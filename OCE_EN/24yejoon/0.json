I'm saying you'll have to accept the consequences of your issues, and accept that Riot have a responsibility to protect other players as well, not just you. Avoid ranked, and take what steps you can to improve your internet, even (or perhaps especially) if that is constantly badgering your ISP telling them you aren't getting the reliable connection you were promised. I know some places in the US don't have options for ISPs, but if it's at all possible, oftentimes a phonecall telling them you're going to take your business elsewhere if they don't resolve the issue is enough.\n\nYou might not have control over your ISP of course, but if you can, talk to whoever does. If your connection is as spotty as it sounds you either live pretty far out in the country or someone somewhere is screwing you over (by negligence or otherwise).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-08-27T21:15:01.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess one day they will actually implement something like buying your leavebuster to go away.

If you can't avoid being salty then let's face it, online games probably aren't ideal for you. At least league has the option to mute everything so you can just play the game without that interaction, which is definitely a good choice if you fall into the salt pile quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-09-04T17:36:43.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ye that's fair","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"24yejoon","date":"2018-08-28T02:59:27.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i get leaverbuster cause i have internet problems but riot says it's your responsibility to fix the internet and its my fault but  the thing is i cna't frcken fix it\nAND I WANT TO FRICKEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-28T04:05:18.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes there really is nothing you can do. If you've already checked your router, connected to ethernet (if at all possible), spoken to your ISP, etc then maybe there isn't anything you can do. What it means is you're one of the very unlucky ones, and it sucks, but at a point you have to accept that your issues ruin the game for 4-9 other people *every* time they occur.\n\nThat's a lot of games that you have a negative influence on, even if it isn't intentional. At a point, Riot can no longer shield you from the consequences of that. You get quite a bit of leeway with the initial LeaverBuster, so if your internet issues are so significant that you are constantly being hit, you'll have to accept that online multiplayer cooperative games might not be the best environment for you to play in until something can be done to resolve your internet issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"24yejoon","date":"2018-09-02T22:58:32.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OKAYY\nI GET ITITITTITI\nYOU DONT' HAVE TO KEEP TELLING ME TAHT\nI WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE NOW \nlol","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-09-04T12:29:03.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you want to hear?

Or fun for the enemy? Not to mention if you're joining 10 minutes late it means remake is failing and leaving those players stuck in a game with an afk. \n\nInternet issues suck. Not being able to properly play a game you enjoy sucks, but think of the effect you are having on *hundreds* of other players. Do they not deserve some form of compensation? Do they not deserve to be treated fairly and with respect? Why should you be given special consideration over every single one of them?\n\nIf there is truly nothing you can do to resolve your connection issues, perhaps it is better you stick to bots, or single player games. Otherwise you will simply have to accept the punishment for negatively impacting the experience of all those other players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BrendoRockLee","date":"2018-08-27T14:45:05.918+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Leaver buster is good and all, until you leave champion select to go and load the match and an error message pops up saying \"Sorry, your game could not be launched\" followed by another message \"Due to abandoning a recent match, you have been placed in a low priority queue\".\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-28T04:01:36.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens sometimes, and it sucks, but if you didn't have a significant history of leaves you wouldn't have received a LB for just one instance.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"24yejoon","date":"2018-09-03T01:17:37.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hey guys\ni got frcken leaverbuster again\nnot for leaving or being afk but \nfricken internet issues yay","replies":[]},{"poster":"24yejoon","date":"2018-09-02T06:43:44.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i keep joining in late too ingame\nlike around 10 minutes late\nso im always level 1 while everyones level like 9","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-01T05:18:16.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had a blackout the other day which caused me to drop out in 2 non consecitive games.
