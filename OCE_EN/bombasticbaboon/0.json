I am looking to create a team to get more competitive with in the lead up to the tournaments. Ideally we would scrim/practice on the weekend with obvious exceptions with the coming holiday season. At this stage recruiting anyone of any rank who has voicecomms and is keen to participate in a competitive yet chill team environment.\\\n\n\nAdd me: Bombasticbaboon\n\nI'll set up some games this weekend for those interested!\n\nGreat Chance to explore team comps, picks and bans, Strategy and review, without the pressures of playing with a team for the first time in the clash tournaments!","replies":[]}
