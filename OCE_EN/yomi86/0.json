Seems like a one-off but it's frustrating since it resulted in a defeat (even without me playing) as well as being reported for something I had no clue / intention whatsoever.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-25T06:22:52.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately things like this can occasionally occur, however the problem it sounds like it's resolved now. I would still recommend you [run a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) on your client though, just to be sure there's nothing wrong with your install.\n\nDon't worry about the loss/reports you'll be fine, especially if this was only a once off, you only get punished if you consistently leave/afk in games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
