Like I understand its to stop people from just ditching but it sucks, we also can&#039;t report that person if someone does dodge jus allowing them to troll another team of poor players. I doubt this will be seen anytime soon but that&#039;s just my thoughts on it and if there&#039;s some reasons as to why this can&#039;t occur or something please let me know, because I am losing my shit","replies":[]}
