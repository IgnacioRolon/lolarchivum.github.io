But that doesn't mean you have to verbally abuse them and be negative in the game.\r\n\r\nEven though you were not the one who started it is not a good idea to answer with the same tone, because it leads to negative atmosphere in the game.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind why your account got the permanent suspension is already explained by Blitzcrank Bot, as seen in your chat logs. Keep in mind that the escalation of the punishment depends on the severity of the offence , meaning that it can skip to straight 2 weeks suspension and then a permanent one.\r\n\r\nGame 1 - \"[All] Morgana: LIKE YOUR DAD LAST NIGHT\"\r\n- \"[All] Morgana: JUST BECAUSE ITS GAY?\"\r\n\r\nGame 2 - \"[All] Morgana: i fked your mum last night\"\r\n- \"[All] Morgana: stfu\"\r\n\r\nYou see this is not cool to them, since is sexism. And I see that you understand for the rest. Just to clarify that 1 game is enough, but your suspension is based on 4, which is enough to be punished for.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that writing a lot of messages in the game can be seen as frustrating and distracting. The in game chat feature was made to let people have efficient communication when trying to make a strategy. Therefore using the chat to spam \"report\" and personally attack a specific player is something that has a negative impact both on that one person and on all other players and this is a thing that we do not tolerate.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to make you realize the negative impact which these words have on the other players by giving you this suspension. We give a lot of chances to players to moderate their behavior in a positive way.\r\n\r\nLike a 2 weeks suspension right before this one. As, you continued to show the same attitude we were left with no choice, but to proceed with more harsh punishment.\r\n\r\nNow, I know this wasn't the answer you were looking for and I am sorry :/\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nTino\r\n\r\nRiot Games Player Support\r\n\r\n\"Life is the main story, dreams are the side quests.

So it snowballed from there, they said gg when they got a kill, i continued to say gg when we get a kill. Then I started saying \"SMD\" to them and \"better bot wins\".\n\nGame 2 we gave first blood to a draven &amp; taric bot lane and said  \"nice ks\" cause the support stole it, and we all know what happens when the support takes the kill off the draven. He gets mad. then he replied with something (don't know what it was I forgot) that's when I said \" i fked your mum last night\", some time passes and were taking the nexus so see my chance and i type \" better bot lane win just how it be\"   \n\nWhat I was doing in those game was sledging which means  \"to seek to gain an advantage by insulting or verbally intimidating the opposing player.\" I don't think what I said is under Verbal Abuse maybe being a dick but not verbal abuse (EXCEPT GAME 3). yeah game 3 was verbal abuse not going to lie, But i should still have 2 chances left on my account.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-22T15:17:21.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> What I was doing in those game was sledging which means \"to seek to gain an advantage by insulting or verbally intimidating the opposing player.\n\nSo everything boil down to you using insults as a tool of distraction. Did i get that right? \n\nBecause if i did, then your logic is flawed on so many levels. Let me give you a few contrasting examples. \n\n* If you are playing sport, would you throw the same set of insults toward the opposition?  \n* If you are taking an exam, would you do the same thing to divert people's attention from the test?\n* If you are in a job interview, would still follow through with the above theory of \"sledging\" to taunt the other applicants?\n\nAm gonna assume you are a reasonable person that understand civility and ethic. Therefor you wont, out of shame and by social nurturing. \n\nThe rules are ingrained into you by the environment of your upbringing, taught by parent, teachers, your social circle ETC... And you should also understand by breaking them, it will turn people against you. **So you don't do it.**\n\nNow this is the interesting part. The reason you do it **ONLINE **while knowing these rules is still a factor, is because the impact of the consequences is of insignificant worth. And you cant see the people whom you are insulting; There are no faces or tone of voice. **And by thinking you wont meet them again.** Enforced your willingness to use insults as ventilation for your frustration. \n\nStart correlate the two instead of spiting them up for your own convenient. Or! Continue on the path and get ban again; But the least you can do then is not WHINE about it. It make you look weak and crude.\n\n>  I don't think what I said is under Verbal Abuse maybe being a dick but not verbal abuse\n\nWhat you've stated is fundamentally verbal abuse, you are using your words to torment the intended listener into rage, regret and sorrow. \n\n> But i should still have 2 chances left on my account.\n\n3 games, 3 chances. They don't have to come in a set of 3 per punishment.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-05-13T15:21:55.083+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, based on the chat logs, it ultimately seems like a punishment was warranted. Just to go over the behaviours of issue here, there's a consistent passive-aggressive attitude, you've consistently provoked others, used direct insults on several occasions, as well as the more \"direct\" comments that the support agent mentioned specifically. It's also important to consider that it is *your* behaviour that is being considered, and whether someone else \"initiated\" the toxicity is ultimately irrelevant to *your* punishment (after all, you're still contributing to creating a negative experience by acting in such a manner).\n\nBased on the response from the support agent, it seems like you had previously received a 14-day ban, from which the standard progression is to a permanent ban (you would have been informed of that in the reform card of the 14-day ban). Really the only way to get a ban removed/reduced is if it was made in error, and if you believe that's the case the standard method of addressing that is to appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (which you've already done). At this point, the only thing you *could* try is to respond to the ticket and ask for a second opinion (if you haven't done so already), though the chance of that changing anything is negligible.\n\nIf you are genuinely sorry for your behaviour then that is ultimately a good thing, as it is the first step in addressing negative behaviours and reforming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXDeath07SwordXx","date":"2019-05-13T12:14:50.518+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7y4jMKl9K0","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2019-06-02T08:37:10.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy shit, you are 1 billion times more toxic in 1 game than my 2 accounts that JUST got perm banned. i dont understand this bullshit at all. mine also said it was from player review, less than 30 seconds AFTER THE LAST GAME PLAYED! like wtf? thats gotta be a lie right?\n\nits like they forget this is OCE and has AUSTRALIA here. swearing is the first thing kids are bloody taught!","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-06-02T09:30:37.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> its like they forget this is OCE and has AUSTRALIA here. swearing is the first thing kids are bloody taught!\n\nThat said a lot about how you are being raised.
