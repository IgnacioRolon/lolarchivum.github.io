The only reason I don&#039;t use the ethernet connection is because it&#039;s FFFFFking slow. :(\r\n\r\nI hope someone can help me out as it&#039;s been close to a week of no league and I feel myself become rustier by the second. \r\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:20:20.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nApologies for the delayed response.\n\nCould you try [switching to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) for me, let me know if this helps at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Warridar","date":"2016-04-22T09:51:25.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue for me.
