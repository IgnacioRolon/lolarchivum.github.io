Every single game has someone who ruins the experience. I run a local board game convention weekly and play games of resistance(5-10p) and almost every game has someone who derps it, but its not coz they are raging little kid with social issues but because gameplay skills are lacking. I wish league had this design. \r\n\r\nI only play ranked because I want to play with people who are serious about playing video games(aka HC gamers)\r\n----> Ranked is too easy to get into, dota2 and smite both need 3billion casual games before u can ranked. NEEDS FIX. My little fix would be. Before u can ranked. 500 wins casual queue. purge the filthy casual and secondary account bullshit\r\n\r\nHeres a sample game from today; \r\nI am banner and I look at chat. People are asking for their bans. I am banner so I have final say and one of my teammates(Fiora later on) asks for lb to be banned. I consider lb high on the list but not as bad as a yas. so I ban yas, riven, lee in accordance with my own experience of the game and the abuse begins.\r\n\r\nAbuse: Never occurs at board games. Always online. Remove the capability to speak and put automated messages available on like the v key? similar to counterstrike.\r\n\r\nIn that game I picked ww to carry. I am the teams tank(ofc) and I offer to gank at lv3. I am abused by fiora for ganking pre-lv6. The badness begins. I leave top lane and then fiora dies, blames me, then rqs.\r\n\r\nAfk: IF at anytime any member on any team afks. Void game. No lp given. Afraid of people afking to save their points? give them Hard bans. and you drop a division if u do.  7day ban + division drop will make b5 a safer and cleaner place/ the bad side is that people will stop playing. and commercial success dies.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer; if your net isn't perfect, don't play ranked.\r\n\r\nFiora comes back after 7m to feed the game to end. Bot decides to afk in base because we wont ff. We lose. jinx is 0/7/0 after 26m and the damage to heroes from fiora is 4k. \r\n\r\nRanked needs to be harder to get into to filter the people not serious about play. Greater consequences for doing shit things too before I come back to this game.\r\n\r\nSayonara","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-15T01:47:40.142+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Before u can ranked. 500 wins casual queue. \n\nExcept skill is **NOT** directly proportional to number of games played. Just because someone has played 500 games doesn't mean they even know the slightest thing about how to play.\n\n> Abuse: Never occurs at board games. **Always online.**\n\nThat's because the \"human\" element is removed. It's far easier for someone to abuse another person if they can't see, hear, touch or smell that person. And I call bullsh!t on it \"never\" happening with board games. I've been abused by people I've been playing a board game with *in real life* on several occasions. It's not something that happens solely on the internet, it's just more likely because of the circumstances.\n\n>  **if your net isn't perfect**, don't play ranked.\n\n**NO ONES NET IS PERFECT!!!**\n\n> Sayonara\n\nI doubt you'll be missed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-20T06:29:39.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"amount of casual games = you're going to be good\n\nthat's why there are people with 4k+ games and still bronze ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2015-03-15T11:26:14.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand Doomdepsairx's frustration. The 500 games criteria was a suggestion. But I agree with VERY harsh punishments for feeders or guys that just don't contribute to the teamwork anymore (e.g. sit on the platform spouting abuse), purely because they had a bone to pick with someone in the game or champ select. Or have no will to play anymore because they died two or three times, and don't know what being responsible to a team is. That's ridiculously low mental stability.\nIn these past two weeks I have also come across 3 people that are level 30 and bought their account from some boosting site.* I can imagine what its like to have those people in ranked, when they really are level 1 newbies. A system where humans (not bots) follow up on reports would be nice, but I know thats probably not going to happen, because it would cost too much for Riot to implement. \nBetter would be to create a real \"elo hell\" bracket whereby abusers are put into this bracket. They might be bronze silver gold whatever, but they only play those other abusers ;) If they meet a certain threshold, they can rejoin the real world. If they continue to abuse, they get banned. Is that what low priority queue is? If not, that's what it could be. But just make sure that the AI police actually do a proper job before implementing it, because as we know, machines are not humans.\nThe best advice for Doomdepsairx is to just report them, fill in a detailed explanation, and hope someone actually reads it.\n\n* No, I cannot put the account names on here, you know why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-15T04:57:48.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember when I did this too...not out of rage, but out of curiosity.\n\nTheres so many reasons why I uninstalled after 2 days of it and came back to LoL...\n\nSo at the most, see you next week here again :) :) :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-15T02:22:16.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to the Internet.
