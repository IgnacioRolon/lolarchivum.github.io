If you're not prepared to accept that you won't always get the champion or position you want then you should probably stick to Teambuilder.\n\n* Give your jungler a decent leash\n\nPretty straightforward really. Your jungler is your lifeline for when you start losing lane so be a pal and make his job a little easier by putting a few shots into that first monster camp.\n\n* Warding isn't just a support thing\n\nIn case you missed the [memo](http://st.elohell.net/public/chill/0a468121c5699ae784150afd8727c603.jpg) warding isn't one persons job, it's actually a team based effort. Seriously, what are you going to do with that 170 gold? Use it to buy two green wards and you'll find your game will be a little more illuminated.\n\n* Help with dragon if you are able\n\nEven before dragon was changed it was just about as vitally important as it is currently. If you're near enough to dragon and a teammate requests help then don't sit back and farm one more creep wave. Get your lazy ass to bottom river and contribute some damage. I guarantee if you can get it your jungler as well as the rest of your team will be thankful for the help.\n\n* Watch your lane opponent/s like a hawk.  \n\nSolo laners especially. Obviously this won't always be possible but taking two seconds to type \"mia\" or \"X champ incoming to Y lane\" can often mean the difference between losing or winning a game. Your team will also be grateful. \n\n* Grow a pair (figuratively speaking)\n\nLet's be honest, solo queue isn't a holiday and eventually you're going to get a troll. It sucks but there are people who play this game that just don't care whether you're in promos or not. Maybe they've had a bad day or maybe they're just an asshole. Either way you're going to have to occasionally deal with these sorts. Yes you can report them, yes you can moan about it but at the end of the day you just have to accept that when you lose due to a troll or two on your team it's about as unavoidable as you getting them on your team in the first place. No one is saying it has to stay this way but as with most shitty things in life you just have to suck it up and move on to the next game.\n\n * Don't doubt the ping!\n\nOk sure your teammates aren't always going to be right but if one of them pings for you to fall back and you aren't 100% on what's around that unwarded corner then for god's sake listen to them because they just might have a better idea than you of what's waiting there. Plus they'll probably appreciate the fact that they're being listened to.\n\n* Comfort picks are aptly named\n\nSo you have a few champs under your belt but your instinct tells you to counter pick against that Le'blanc onto that one champ you're totally sure beats her but have never actually played. Let me tell you something, instinct can be a deceptive prick. Unless you know for sure you can play that pick at at least a consistently average level of play then tell your instinct to GTFO and play the champion you know well and love. Trust me on this it always looks a lot better when you know what you're doing as opposed to picking a counter, losing lane and having no idea what you're doing for the rest of the game.\n\n* Don't let the enemy psyche you out\n\nEvery so often you'll come against someone who just won't shut up about how good he thinks he is or how hard he thinks he's beating you. **NO MATTER WHAT YOU RESPOND WITH HE'S NOT GOING TO SHUT UP.** Riot in their infinite wisdom blessed us with the mute function so why not avoid getting annoyed and tilting altogether because of one loudmouth by silencing him? Let him blather on and focus your efforts on taking objectives. You don't need to trash talk him, win the game and save the SICK BURNZ BRO for the post-game screen.\n\n* Score won't save you\n\nYour KDA may be representative of your average contribution to a  game but in actual play means jack shit advantage or no. Graves may be 5-0 but alone is just one champ versus a whole team and naturally ain't gonna last long in a 1v5. The same goes for you buddy! League of Legends is at its core a **team game** so for better or worse you're gonna have to cooperate if you want that gold/plat/whatever border by the end of the season and more to the point if you want to win the game.\n\n* Attitude!\n\nI may be beating a dead horse with this one but having a positive mindset before you start a game matters and will reflect on your actual gameplay. If you're tired or upset about something then ranked mode is probably not the place you'll be alleviated of these feelings. Treat your teammates nicely and you may find they do the same to you which makes the game overall a pleasant experience. League is a passion-fueled game where tempers flare more often than not so it's nice to sometimes be reminded of why you actually enjoy this game.\n\nEdit:\n\n*  Sweeping Lens\n\nSo by now you should realise how large a role ward placement factors into League or at least you should know this if you plan on jumping into ranked. Well on that note you should probably get used to the idea of purchasing a sweeping lens at  a relatively early stage of your game particularly if you intend to jungle or support as these two positions will usually be the most engaged in the vision war (early on anyway). If you are playing support a good habit to make is replacing your ward totem with a lens on first recall as at this stage you will typically have a sightstone. If you are jungling it is a good idea to do the same as having a lens will either let you gank a lane without concern of being spotted by a ward or allow you to clear a ward which will both force the enemy laner to drop aggression (if he's cautious enough) as well as open up the lane for a gank by either you or another lane. As a general rule your team should carry with it at least two sweeping lens.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-28T12:01:01.240+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great post!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aezuros","date":"2015-01-28T15:35:54.409+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post!

That basically means there's the potential for 5 permanent wards to be on the map at any given time. What I see a lot in a lot of games I spectate is the lack of vision control a team has. \n\nThen there's being ward efficient. It's one thing to place a ward. It's another thing to place a ward efficiently. If you're using green wards. It's wasting valuable ward  time if you place it down purely to place it down. Think about the time stamp of your game and the general player paths that occur during that time. i.e. buff paths, dragon dances etc. In addition placing your wards in certain spots of bushes i.e. placing a pink ward on your end of the mid lane bush. This basically gives you control of that bush. Any ward that gets placed there is free gold and anyone that tries to clear it you should be able to fend of if not able to get a kill. \n\nYou don't necessarily have to place a ward in a bush. Sometimes it's more efficient to place a ward outside a bush than in a bush due to the vision it can give you. The best case scenario for this is using the blue buff bush. A lot of times players ward the bush right next to blue buff. I find it far more efficient if you place the ward on the apex of the cross section. This provides vision of the 4 way intersection of that buff and provides excellent control on that side of the jungle. \n\nScanning Trinket. Heading on into the mid game and late game. I hope at least 2 or more players have upgraded to the scanning trinket. When you think a bush isn't warded. You're usually wrong. Don't tell me I'm wrong here. You know what I mean. \"You have been slain\" Summoner X: \"Wow, that was warded?!\" Scanning Trinket can help secure your area and is an excellent tool for dragon control and baron control.\n\nWard our side of the jungle or their side of the jungle.\n\nTo be honest. You can efficiently ward both sides of the jungle at the same time with the use of pinks and efficient wards. Ward your area. It is in efficient to ward an inactive area. That is not to say disregard that area entirely. But that does not mean you have to burn a whole sightstone to ward it. \n\nWard and TP synergy. \n\nMore often than not the top lanes will run TP. But if the rest of the team ignore this fact and don't try to help out by generating placement for the teleport to occur then the top lanes summoner is very wasted. Try placing a green ward deep in lane and allow the enemy to push up. When the top laner teleports in it will more often result in a burn of summoners from the enemy who will have limited escape options or a kill. \n\nI will provide images later tonight.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-14T13:05:46.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"waiting on pics...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amnion","date":"2015-01-29T15:57:18.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice tips!

League has indeed created a culture of its own over the years thanks in no small part to the people playing it and while this has been mostly good it has brought with it some issues relating to certain factions of the community which you spoke of in your post. \n\nI agree with your view on the game itself though as League is indeed a fantastic game but has its own share of hurdles to climb most notably concerning  issues withstanding in the community. I try not to fault Riot too much for it though as contrary to what many will say they have little control over much of what occurs down in the amateur scene with the rest of us dregs. I believe Riot does what they can but League has evolved to such a degree that a lot of the time the problem can simply be too broad an issue which is why sometimes the only solution is to \"band-aid\" it (the tribunal is a good example of this) until a better fix is conceived.\n\nDon't get me wrong though I'm not at all saying you shouldn't feel largely negative towards LoL's community as I have many times harbored similar feelings. I still get pissed off at this game every so often and the only thing which seems to ease this is my simply putting LoL away for a while I calm down. I don't expect this to help change your mind or anything I'm just giving you my opinion on the matter.\n\nThanks for sharing your thoughts :) (I can go to bed now yay!)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SteeI Tempest","date":"2015-01-28T12:27:44.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoyed reading this!!!
