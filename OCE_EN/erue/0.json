I played lee sin alot season 4 and season 5 but also have at least basic or maybe more understanding and knowledge about other champions. \r\n\r\nCurrent three top champions: {{champion:64}}{{champion:67}} {{champion:238}} \r\nCurrent tier (rank): Silver 3\r\nMost played positions: Jungle and Support\r\n\r\nAdd me: Erue\r\nPlease, please add me if you are interested as I may forget to check the boards for the replies.
