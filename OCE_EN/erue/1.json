I chose to write about &#039;that MOBA games affect college students negatively&#039;, and I would like some sensible points either pro or con. Anything around the topic, can be about health, social life or psychology. \r\n\r\nPlease this is a serious topic/post. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-15T06:25:06.930+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Social life:\nMany college students neglect irl responsibilities such as work and study in order to make more time for video games.\n\nPsychology:\nA big reason that many people play video games is to avoid real life anxieties and other aspects of poor mental health. On a superficial level, this seems like a good way to keep your mental health okay, especially if your normal mental health is crisis level. Deeper down, it creates more issues. In an instance where you are unable to play video games, you basically get withdrawal symptoms, which are the feelings you have been repressing with video games.\n\nAs you can see from the qq threads on the boards, people also get super invested in their ranking. If they aren't doing so well, it can destroy their self confidence, which carries into real life. \n\nAnother issue, which as a league player you have probably experienced is the toxicity. For people who are coming to play to escape mental health issues, being told to \"kys\" or \"get cancer and die\" or self mutilate in some way, can definitely push them over the edge. It isn't that they're weak, its just that their mind set is already so negative, that all of this crap being thrown at them is just confirming how hopeless they feel. <- A big issue to be explored here, as many people who haven't experienced this level of low don't get that you can't just ignore it, or that this type of \"banter\" is severely detrimental. \n\n(I'm sorry if this doesn't really make sense, I haven't slept in 3 days and my brain is pretty much goo)","replies":[{"poster":"Erue","date":"2016-02-15T09:44:45.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your points and meh, English is my second language but I understand your points overall. It is quite an issue with player's toxicity as sometimes, even though its just a \"video game\", I really sometimes feel negative about myself. Your points are quite true as I can notice myself changed - as in my behavior and attitude from the video game that I love to play. I sometimes be angry for no reason or with minor problems and get very sensitive to depression and anger management. \n\nHowever, if I reflect back to what I did when I play the game, I also to be toxic when someone misunderstood my statement and does a mistake. Also, retaliate from a toxic statement from team mates - I cannot stand people making fun about my mum.{{item:3751}} \nIt is this weird thing, you know that is bad for the community and you know how it affects people but you still do it?!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-16T11:59:36.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to manage depression as well, and thankfully have a bit of a buffer at the moment, but if you don't, then even something said in something as 'meaningless' as a video game can be just enough to make your whole day shit. I find myself facing that irritation as well, though very rarely express it in game, I find the best way to deal with it is to take a step back and consider the other person's point of view. If they're just being an ass then mute them and move on, but if it's an honest mistake then it's not right to get so worked up over it :)\n\nYour English is very good by the way, I wouldn't have picked it as your second language had you not said so :)","replies":[{"poster":"Erue","date":"2016-02-17T02:04:43.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the replies,\nman, have you ever notice yourself playing like more than 2hrs of SoloQ ranked and your LP is the same or less than what you started with before x hours of SoloQ on that day?\n\nThat irritates me, like for an example, you spend whole day saying \"Im going to rank up!\" and at the end you get demoted or have those weird match history like 2 win and 1 lose and repeat.\n\nI heard this is called a tilt, and when Im on tilt I like to grab bit of a snack or do my homework. \n\nBTW thanks for complimenting my english, my grammar is not that good though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-17T03:42:41.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I avoid solo q entirely, my feeling is that League is a team game, and especially as a support main, your own skill is defined by how you can work as a part of that team, rather than by your own KDA or your own rank etc etc. I also feel that solo q puts you in a much more vulnerable position. \n\nPlaying with a duo or a team means you have a barrier between you and the strangers on your team, if you get mad at them then you can vent it away from the game and get back to playing. If they are playing well or being nice then you can compliment them and choose to bring them into that barrier if you wish. (Maybe that's a bit too metaphorical but I wasn't too sure how to describe what I mean). It's like having a buffer, you might not need it, but when you you'll be very glad for having it.\n\nMy solo experience in League is limited and mixed, I don't disagree with the people who prefer solo q because it demonstrates their personal skill, it's just not how I view the game and the way I play. What I've found is that when I play ranked with friends, it becomes less about winning, and more about having fun and learning from the experience, and it makes everything much more positive. That said, it's not easy to find the right kind of friends to play ranked with though, to find people of similar skill who you get along with well enough that nothing that happens in ranked is going to cause any lasting tensions. \n\nBut anyway, you're more than welcome :) and I wish you luck in your games/in ranked :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-15T08:07:56.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You raise some very good points! Imo, it pretty much comes down to how you manage it. Are you balancing gaming and irl? Does it bring you enjoyment or do you get super salty? Are you the kind of person who can move on from a bad game or will you hang on to that loss. A lot of the pros and cons come down to the individual, and are difficult to generalise. \n\nThere are plenty of salty or toxic people in League, but there are also a whole lot of people who just go around having harmless fun and generally enjoying the game.\n\nSorry for such a general answer (hopefully you can extrapolate some things from that) I don't have too much time atm but I hope I helped :)","replies":[{"poster":"Erue","date":"2016-02-15T09:49:04.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"management is a great skill to train but it is indeed really hard to \"manage\" certain thing.

A lot of the REALLY toxic people in game are the ones who use League to vent their frustrations with little regard to how those on the other end feel. Those people have no real desire to manage their toxicity in game because venting it in League IS how they manage it.
