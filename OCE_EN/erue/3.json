Im a bronze player, stuck in bronze forever and slowly progressing out of the bronze web. \r\n\r\nBut do please take my words really seriously. \r\n\r\nMy heart is about to explode with extreme {{summoner:14}} ! I know that Riot is trying and trying to satisfy all players. That's why I want your help! Yes, YOUR HELP!\r\n\r\nFirst, my major issue is the : **LAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**\r\n\r\nI think Riot discussed how OCE server is getting ddos attacks. Alright, sounds disastrous i will be patient. But when was this few weeks ago? This random ping spikes are keep happening. I don't know it is because of TPG - that's right, TPG where we had problems with TPG. I thought this two problems were fixed. Today I play a ranked game, perfect ping right on 52, but! Zyra files gone missing. So i repair LoL and start playing another ranked game. \r\n\r\nWow, it was 100~150 at first 20 minutes. Then, sudden ping spikes going up to 105234 (This is not a lie!) then got back down to 500 (which usually mean the internet is not connected but it was). Then again, 500 to something like 324 then back 500 then again - keep switching going all ret*rded. So i had to restart the game, but guess what. DEFEAT! I feel the {{summoner:14}} again. \r\n\r\nSecondly, does really reporting a player works? \r\n\r\nOf course there are lot of trollers and AFK(*people who afk because they just give up or angry with the team*) but, if we report them with 300~500 letter describing what they done politely, would it change this OCE community? What should I do? League of Legends is a GREAT GAME! I like how we can cooperate with each other and do our objective! But, it is not fun when there is trolls and afks. Then in promo we get this alot. What the F*CK should i do. I try not to flame after reading alot of guides in boards. Help me you legends. HELP ME! I WANT TO KILL MY SELF BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WORKING FOR ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI did rest, in fact for couple of weeks. I missed League of Legends and came back... BOOM! I notice more trollers and AFK are here to ruin people's life. I do sound like a 12vie or bronzie but, please understand me with more *love* (?).\r\n\r\nThank you and enjoy your day\r\n> A little kid raging over a team game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-21T05:15:38.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suicide is a serious topic, not one you should be tossing around jokingly. I doubt you actually mean you'd kill yourself over a game, and thus presume you're using it in context of a joke to exaggerate the issue further than it actually is.\n\nTPG is renown for their bad service with game companies. Strongly suggested to change provider if you can afford it, and if not, then at least change your DNS to something better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-03-21T02:38:28.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a better net provider...\nTbh i have zero issues with ping spikes and if i do,the only issue is the servers getting ddos..\nIm with telstra and you get what you pay for tbh,and tpg are the worse internet provider..\nFix that and you will have zero problems.....","replies":[]}]}
