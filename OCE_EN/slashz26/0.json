Being in the silver division you would think people would know simple skills such as ganking and pushing lanes. Then I get banned for flaming when I&#039;m matchmaked with absolute retards and try to tell them how to play, yet they can swear their faces off and they dont get banned, yet I get a 2 week suspension. Riot fix your game, its honestly turning into an absolute piece of trash being full of young kids and instalockers. honestly done with this game and the way its headed, fix your sh*t.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-26T14:32:01.092+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think heartvine said everything needed..\n\nbut i feel this picture sums up your mentality\n\n\nhttp://puu.sh/jdwnq/de431ef5c9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"xSmokey","date":"2015-07-27T03:24:00.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD oh my gosh, this is like almost every bronze/silver player at the moment! \nI know all too well being silver V myself. well said haha!","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-27T07:43:18.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cant paint everyone in low elo with the same brush.\n\ni know alot of players who have a positive mindset and are happy to reflect and grow as a player.\n\n\nhahaha","replies":[{"poster":"xSmokey","date":"2015-07-27T08:04:16.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xSmokey,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=U2FL6hgo,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-07-27T03:24:00.686+0000)\n>\n> xD oh my gosh, this is like almost every bronze/silver player at the moment! \n\nthat's why I said almost you see ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-27T08:05:55.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too true :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-07-26T13:14:24.242+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seven lines, and you still can't manage to keep your head cool.\nSeems like this system works fine to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordWinter","date":"2015-07-26T20:27:55.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortuantly the Oce community (95%+) have no respect, little respect or just want to state they are on drugs etc. This server is not going to fix itself. The new age kids own this server. They would sell their grandparents for $10 dollars of Riot points. The Tribuneral should have been implemented from day 1 of this server going live, but RIOT deemed that oceanic were not worth the time or effort to code or implement it. So we are stuck with all these foul mouthed spoilt kids who don't care about anything or anyone. \n\n   Hope OCE riot unsuspend you, its not fair when a bunch of kids que togethor and all report you, even though they are at fault.  \n   \nGood luck","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-07-27T05:27:47.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep so the report system is the reason you're playing with weak players... sure bud","replies":[]}]}
