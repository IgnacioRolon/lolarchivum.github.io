I do care that the issue gets looked at.\r\n\r\n\r\nTy for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2014-12-10T11:27:22.419+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:2004}}","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-10T12:01:54.923+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> {{item:2004}}\n\nthis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GangOne","date":"2014-12-15T01:43:21.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Ashe is a very fun champion to play with.\nI activate the Q only against champions and late in the game I don't feel that mana is an issue.\nI feel like too many players don't know that Ashe is good from mid to late game.\nI often get blamed by \"rude\" smarf players at the beginnig of the game because Ashe can't do much damage but the good result is there at the end of the game!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-10T10:25:18.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, Riot are too busy giving Kalista more damage...\n\nAlso you could use Essense Reaver, it gives back enough mana on attack to have Ashe Q always on.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-10T15:53:47.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever I play ARAM as her I grab Essence Reaver and leave Q on.
