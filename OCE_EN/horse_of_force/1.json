Even if it&#039;s just a glance at the front page. Most of the time, the problem has already been solved.\n\n* This board is not at all that active when it comes to people replying to your post. Do not expect help to arrive within fifteen minutes, as it does in some other forums. Sometimes, it might just be quicker to [submit a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) instead.\n\n* When someone offers to help you, and you need to relay some information back to them, use the \"Reply\" button on their message to reply to them. If you don&#039;t, then that person doesn&#039;t get notification of your response and hence the conversation might be lost forever. As a general rule, include your operating system and your internet service provider in the original post so that no-one has to ask you about it.\n\n* This is not the place to just complain about things you hate in the game. This board is designed to help other players get back to playing the game because of technical issues they might be facing. If you want to discuss such things, head over to [the Miscellaneous boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous). For suggestions to help improve the game (either user interface or champion rebalancing), head over to [the Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations) board. For bugs, head over to [the Report a Bug board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) (yes, it&#039;s the NA one; we don&#039;t have our own).\n\n* Be nice. Any reply you get here is from someone else taking time out of his/her day to help you at no profit to him/herself. And as a note, if someone helps you, try and help someone else having an issue here too. It will help increase productivity, and act as a sort of payment for the help you received.\n\nWith that in mind, have a nice time browsing the boards!","replies":[]}
