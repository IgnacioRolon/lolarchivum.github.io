In fact, why doesn't it use the same system as the ping spam prevention (where it's not just a simple timer preventing you from pinging multiple times in one instant, but an adaptive timer which changes based on how often you've pinged just a moment before)?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-29T03:42:47.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does seem a little stuffed to me.
