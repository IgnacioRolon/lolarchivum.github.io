He left the game for about 16 mins, joined again, and instantly tried to forfeit. Then he consistently flamed us and gave us intense insults, followed by intentional feeding. Riot, your system is broken and you really have to do something about this. It isn't fair that players like this are allowed to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T05:16:05.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report and move on. If this is a repeat thing then they will get punished. Who knows, this guy could be suffering from something as outlandish as having a severe mental illness that overcomes them and messes with their mood a heap.\nAlthough I doubt that.\nJust, there'll always be people who are asses on LoL just to be asses, and there is no changing that without making people have to pay to play the game, and even so some people would do that. Chances are, this guy could have even been banned for abuse and is on their second account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-29T03:57:24.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is wrong with people on OCE and naming and shaming?
