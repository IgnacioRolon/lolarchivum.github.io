In the centre lay the entrance to the abyss, surrounded by a thousand viridescent fins, its jagged teeth decorated with delicate moss bore open to reveal a darkness that threatened to swallow the ocean whole. Among the adults that gathered around the crevice sheltered many young Marai, curiosity reflecting within their vibrant yellow irises as they peered around and hid behind tails twice their size.  It had been many days since the tidecaller had left safety, and the anxiety was clear upon the flickering tails of all within the silent clearing, only the lulling ebb and flow of waves calmed the Marai. Nami flickered curiously between the Marai, hoping to catch the first glimpse of the returning tidecaller, touching her star studded birthmark for luck. Her mother ushered Nami back behind her, as vibrant tapestries of fishes entered the silent clearing. \n\nCurious schools of fish flittered between the Marai, flashes of iridescent colour between strong green tails. Only the bravest among them would dare venture near the dark crevice that lay innocently upon the ocean bed, the keeper of many mysteries, or horrors. The Marai watched as the latest victims to their curiosity swum into the darkness, unlikely to be seen again.They would dive in under the regretful watch of vibrant yellow eyes, only to never surface again. Murmurs echoed upon the pod of Marai as they watched the moon make its 3rd journey across the sky, lunar reflection clear within Nami&rsquo;s eyes as she tilted her head up, reaching small hands up to bathe in the calming glow. \n\n&lsquo;If only we could pluck that moonstone, mother&rsquo; she murmured, drawing the wishful gaze from the Marai surrounding her. But that was not meant to be. \n\nThe ward around their home was growing weak, as another hundred years passed. Darkness and the creatures of the deep were crawling closer, always watching for a vulnerable time to strike. For the past three days and nights, the chosen tidecaller had left his clan before the entrance of the Abyss, to venture within and seek their redemption.\n\nNami peered out from behind her mother, squinting as a trembling spark came from within the Abyss. She saw his staff first, aquamarine hues reflecting rays of light that shone upon the entrance of the abyss. Gasps were quickly followed by rambunctious cheers as the tidecaller emerged from rocky jaws of the abyss, glinting pearl held tightly within his arms. Face gaunt and drained of colour, the Marai seemed to have aged years within the couple of days spent within the abyss, untold horrors which lay memories that would come to haunt him for years to come. But for now, he swam eagerly with his pod, thousands of Marai heading towards the land, stopping just before where the tide breaks towards to glittering sand. \n\nThe tidecaller hesitated before he left, glancing over his shoulder to shudder at the darkness of the void before propelling himself towards the shore.\n\n***\n\nUnder darkened skies, there are not many corners of the planet that moonlight does not reach. Cool light shines upon rocky coasts as two figures brush through heavily canopied forest to emerge before a glittering sea. &lsquo;Come, child&rsquo;, the woman whispered, not taking her eyes off the horizon, gaze reaching far beyond their world. Hands beckoning silently, Diana reached into a woven pouch to retrieve a sparkling moonstone, luminescent in cool moonlight. Silent rays danced and rippled upon calm seas and whispered breaking of waves upon ivory shores, a thousand crystallized fragments shimmering in herald of the full moon. The stone clutched within fragile fingers glowed in short pulses, almost sentient near the sea. An answering glow emerged slowly from the sea, as an arc of droplets scattered from a slim form breaking the calm that blanketed the ocean. Diana&rsquo;s eyes widened in wonder at the sight before her eyes, an otherworldly entity gracing her presence. Water dripping off green tinted skin, his muscular form dwarfed a stone crown embellished with gemstones of the deep, set firmly upon his head. The whites of his eyes were not to be seen, instead replaced by midnight pierced only by vibrant yellow irises. His staff bore an intricate wave pattern at it&rsquo;s head, and lulled the waves to bring him to shore, where Diana&rsquo;s grandmother had clambered down rocky paths to meet the Marai tidecaller halfway. \n\nShimmering stones switched from coarse hands to slippery palms, short pulses of light momentarily transcending into a luminescent glow that encompassed both figures. Diana blinked rapidly, wincing as the sudden light set against the darkness blinded her. Shaking the starlight that left bright traces in her vision. Her grandmother travelled back and turned towards her in the darkness, worn face illuminated by pale moonlight, a soft glow emitting from her palm. She passed the radiant pearl to Diana, whose hands glowed in an effort to cover the pearl. Bigger than her head, but light as moonlight, Diana held the pearl delicately, a bright beam in the dark. Diana&rsquo;s eyes glittered with wonder, new appreciation forming for the sacred rites of the Lunari. \n\n&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; she echoed again, this time weaving rough fingers around supple hands, lightly tugging Diana back towards the Lunari temple &lsquo;it&rsquo;s time to go home.&rsquo; \n\n***\n\nMoonlight filtered through cracked ceilings, bathing the temple in a translucent glow. Diana and her grandmother emerged from a shadowed path within the forest, the clearing silent except for the gentle songs of the owls that decorated low hanging branches. The quivering of wings set for midnight skies as the pair strolled back towards the Lunari temple, pearl safely situated in Diana&rsquo;s pack. It was quiet now that the owls were gone.\n\nToo quiet.\n\nDiana&rsquo;s grandmother crouched in front of her, curious eyes against weary ones. Placing a shaking finger against soft lips, she started speaking quietly, eyes now darting towards shadowed forest that seemed darker than usual. They were not alone.\n\n&lsquo;Diana, listen to me,&rsquo; she murmured, training her eyes on miniscule movements within the treeline, grabbing shaking shoulders to still Diana&rsquo;s eyes upon her next words, &lsquo;you have to run, Now!&rsquo; \n\nShadowed figures kept hidden at the edges of the clearing that embraced the Lunari temple, until Diana nods and sprints for the temple stairs, cloaked figures burst from deep within the shadows to move seamlessly into a steady chase after the child. Her body shaking with terror, eyes trained upon the illuminated lunar temple, until the hard steel of a Solari shield met the back of her head. Impact throwing her world sideways, Diana&rsquo;s body skidded upon the stone platform leading into the Lunar temple. Her pack thrown far from her, pearl slowly rolling into the temple to illuminate the interior. Diana groaned, young eyes yet to comprehend what lay before her. Dozens of silver robed Lunari lay upon the temple floors, sleeping peacefully, blood staining the fronts of their robes, their hair, spilling vermilion that seeped into stone tiles. \n\nA shrill sound pierced the night as Diana screamed, bodies finally registering in her mind pearl glowing, reflecting her anguish. Solari followers, elders and soldier alike gather to complete their task. The extermination of the Lunari was almost complete, the only one true following was beneath solar skies. Diana WHIPPED around at the sound of heavy footfalls upon broken branches and broken bodies, eyes widening at the sight of a dozen golden clothed Solari charging towards her. She closed her eyes, fearing for the worst. \n\nBut the end did not come. The sweet harmony of magic exalted the clearing, the almost tangible unity of stars and moonshine falling between Diana and the Solari, showering her in a warm light. She opened her eyes, watching magic fall from the midnight skies to bathe the Lunari temple in a luminescent glow. Combined magic of the moon and stars formed a barrier between the Solari and Diana, tears blurring her vision. Faint stars echoed upon her skin, glowing brightly in harmony with the abyssal pearl. Muted clangs of metal against metal echoed behind a symphony of discordant screams throughout the clearing. Head resting upon the ground, a petrichor scent filled Diana&rsquo;s senses as her vision blurred red. Static filled her ears until she winced as fingers met bloody scalp, tears merging to form a rose-tinted hue of the world. Diana could see them outside the lunar barrier, elders donned in both gold and silver robes strewn among the clearing. What was once peaceful was now a bloody battlefield, silver robed elders lying peacefully upon grassy knolls. Diana could hear faint yelling, vision fading in and out as Solari elders shoved against the moonlit barrier, malice set deep t within their eyes. She closed her eyes as restless sleep embraced Diana&rsquo;s form, shadows hovering behind her closed eyelids. She clutched the phantom pearl to her chest, form lit from filtering moonlight upon a darkened shrine. Tears stained her porcelain cheeks as darkness swept around her, falling into a deep void. \n\n***\n\nThrough the darkness she spots an ethereal form, vibrant green stark against floating dark remnants of a wayfarer of the underworld, his name echoed in Diana&rsquo;s head but she could not form the words that scraped against her skull. Her head darted about, body suspended in a darkness that embraced her tightly, an endless expanse that stretched far beyond her gaze. The stranger laughed as he gazed upon her struggles, voice echoing each time he spoke, fire awakening a dark flame within Diana&rsquo;s chest. She clawed at her chest in hysterics, silent screaming emerging from a forgotten voice. He reaches into her chest, Diana&rsquo;s eyes wide with panic as she squirms uselessly under his clutch. Drawing the flame from her chest bore no resistance, as he studied the flickering soul that lay within his claws, curiosity emerging in his eyes.\n\n&lsquo;Sweet child&hellip; it is not your time yet&rsquo;, chains clinking discordantly within her head, amusement heard clearly from his ethereal form. He blew on the flame, from dark fire emerged a pure pearl of light. Starlight. Snorting cynically, he dipped her soul back into her chest and turned back towards darkness, now holding a faint inky soul within his grasp, DABBING lightly at it&rsquo;s surface before pushing it into his luminous viridian lantern. Diana realised that the darkness was not empty - it held souls that were on their last legs, flickering flames invisible before the moonlight that shone from Diana&rsquo;s breast. Her eyes trained upon the stranger&rsquo;s lantern however, luminous beauty glowed enticingly, unwittingly drawing her ethereal closer until pale fingers brushed virescent auras. Underlying the green hues lay the golden aura of Solari interference, dragging her hand to merge with the lantern. The warden turned around at her touch, an echoed &lsquo;NO&rsquo; loud within her head. Diana withdrew her hand to clutch her head at the invading noise, but it was too late. He pushed away from the abyss, but she had lost something precious to her. Everyone who touches the lantern does. Diana withdrew from the void, with no recollection of her previous life. She had lost her memories. \n\n***\n\nHer last year as an acolyte, one final study would bring her closer to her dream. Diana closed her eyes, and the memory came to her as a familiar comfort. Graced with the power of the sun merely a month ago, Leona was exalted; a thousand eyes mirroring awe below her ethereal form. Ancient armour embraced her figure, and the elders recoiling as if she were a poison. A light to drive out the darkness that clung to the weakest corner of the Solari. The chosen one, Diana worshipped her, among a crowd of hundreds of others. Cool incandescence from moon and starlight filtered in from windows that graced whole walls illuminating titles upon worn spines. It was close to midnight, and most of the Solari acolytes were asleep, a select few still studying under the glow of small lamps. Diana trailed her fingers gently along the spines, stopping at a book that felt different under her touch. Gently removing the book from the shelf, Diana let it fall open in her hands, a familiar temple sketched neatly among worn pages. Her forehead wrinkled, apprehension clutching her heart. Diana had to find out what this was. \n\n***\n\nDiana rushed through canopied forests, an environment so familiar to her, yet she could not remember why. Darting nimbly over a fallen log, she emerged at an empty clearing, the sweet melody of owls heralding her welcome to the forgotten temple. Diana slowed to a walk, wonder in her eyes as she took in spiraling pillars of quartz, gently reflecting luminescent moonlight. Red stains marked the entrance of the stairs, but Diana paid it no mind, focus zoning in on a singular beam of moonlight that emerged from the temple roof. She padded carefully in, silent stone building echoing the faint steps as Diana emerged within the main hall, lost Lunari armour clearing shining upon a pedestal. She rushed towards her finding, exhilaration clear within her face. \n\nDiana flew back towards the Solari temple and into great hallways, moon and starlight scattering cool shadows upon building walls. Racing towards the elders chambers, Diana skidded to a halt before 3 men, each adorned with golden Solari robes. Frozen expressions were donned as soon as Diana emerged from the shadows, elders holding nothing but suppressed malice for the Solari acolyte. Their faces paled as Diana described the Lunari temple with vigour, excitement clear within her voice. Her work as a Solari acolyte was done, final research upon the Lunari complete with evidence. In her eagerness she did not hear Leona advancing upon her from behind, darkness encasing her vision as hard steel met the back of Diana&rsquo;s head. \n\n***\n\nDawn quickly merged into dusk as Diana stared at nondescript stone walls of her confinements. There was nothing Solari-esque down her, only the moaning of criminals, the dying, and the stubborn, stupid individuals who dared to oppose the Solari. She sighed, counting down hours, minutes, seconds until the final swing of a Solari blade would end her life. \n\nLight steps echoed within cold stone walls, as Diana's gaze landed upon a familiar figure before her. Leona's eyes flashed with resolution, distaste clear for the one they regarded as the lunar heretic. But Diana would not falter here. Not when she had come this far. Her gaze remained stubborn, even when brought roughly before the three golden robed elders before her. Head raised high, Diana remained resolute. &lsquo;I did nothing wrong,&rsquo; \nClenching her jaw, stubbornness shining clearly within her eyes. The elders nodded, a silent command for Leona to lift her blade. Knelt before them, Diana kept her head held high, even as Leona's blade came crashing down.\n\nIt was quiet. \n\nStarlight poured in through the arches decorating the sides of the open Solari hall, forming a barrier illuminating Diana's unbroken form. The lantern opened within Diana's mind as starlight hit her, memories pouring back into her head, along with an ancient magic so potent it coaxed screams from within. The Marai. The Moonstone. Murder. Lunari. Temple. Marai. Starlight. \n\nThe elders leapt from their seats, snarling in hatred, panic evident within their expressions. 'Cursed moonlight...' they whispered.\n\n&lsquo;No&hellip;&rsquo; Leona breathed, sword and shield abandoned by her sides. &lsquo;Starlight.&rsquo; \n\nLunari symbol scorched upon her forehead, Diana stood to reveal a constellation of shimmering stars at her hip, glimmering under the great Solari hall. \n\nDiana ran, not only for her life, but for the Marai. \n\n***\n\nDusk quickly faded into a colourless night, pale moonshine glittering upon softly cresting waves, crashing and tumbling upon ivory shores. Sleek tails powered through trembling water, and suddenly, Nami was sent off alone towards the light, clear pearl clutched firmly within her trembling fingers. Her eyes hardened with determination, breaking the surface with droplets decorating her smooth skin, an arc or droplets spraying around her form. Above the surface, a discordant symphony of waves crashing upon rocks, shore, and themselves echoed rambunctiously towards her. The hard part was over, Nami&rsquo;s journey finally nearing it&rsquo;s end. \n\nShe searched for a figure resting upon the beach, tales of myth and legend of the two legged creature who were so similar to their Marai, but yet so different, wandering the dry world upon two legs. But there was no sign of life upon the shore, much less life upon two feet. Panic curled her fingers around Nami&rsquo;s heart. \n\nDiana sprinted through heavily shadowed forests, glimmering of moonlight that filtered through the canopy guiding the way. She trusted this force within her now, a familiar partner that housed something much more ancient and powerful than she realised. Breaking free of the forest line, glimmering moonlight upon gently cresting waves shined down upon a finned figure within the waves, gaze searching desperately among the shore. Their eyes met, Diana wasted no time nimbly darting down jagged rocks, moonlit hair a shining beacon to Nami. She coaxed the waves towards the glittering shore, both figures illuminated by the full moon. From their grasps shone two familiar stones, of starlight from both land and sea. A blinding glow emerged from both figures as starlit stones passed from hand to hand, fading to reveal two figures clad in luminescent starlight armour. \n\n&lsquo;Star...&rsquo;\n&lsquo;Guardians...&rsquo; \n\nThey both murmured in awe, fingers gravitating towards each other&#039;s star embellished marks. The ebb and flow of this universe needed saviours, and from two young girls emerged hope, bravery and courage.\n\nTonight, two more stars joined the scattered guardians illuminating an endless night sky.","replies":[{"poster":"Janná","date":"2017-09-18T16:38:47.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lit :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AIi","date":"2017-09-18T07:20:05.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So detailed and immersive!
