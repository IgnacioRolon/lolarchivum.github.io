Thank you in advance for reading my fic and I hope you enjoy! :)\n\n---\n\nI\n\nIonia was no stranger to orphans and widows. The invasion had torn through both its land and its population, leaving both scarred in the destructive wake of the Noxian army. Where there had once been flourishing fields, flowering gardens, and towns with ornate and intricately carved buildings lay burnt wastelands. In some places, the ground had been deliberately contaminated by Zaun&rsquo;s toxic chemical by-products to prevent growth for decades or centuries to come. \n\nZed, too, could remember what it meant to be weak. To feel the bite of winter in his flesh, from the tips of his fingers and toes and deep into his belly, beneath the thin cloth between his skin and the bitter air. To see Noxian soldiers patrolling the streets and feel his heart clutch painfully, his breath quicken, and hear the thudding of his heartbeat in his ears like a drum announcing his imminent doom. \n\nHis skin was stretched, pulled thin and rigid over reminders of his weakness. He smiled, although it was more grimace than smile, and thumbed over the scar over his lip. A remnant from _before_. \n\nBut now, he had the strength to overcome the cold that had once frozen him in place and the fear that had once threatened to push his heart of his chest. He could defeat the patrols that he passed &ndash; all it took was a few shuriken to dispatch a small force. \n\nHe had become a force to be reckoned with, able to challenge anything that came in his path with the guidance of the shadows. Zed had his own following, far greater than that of Shen&rsquo;s, and posed an immense threat to any army, Noxian or otherwise, that may have crossed him &ndash; but still, the hunger, the _need_, for power grew.\n\nII\n\nThe Noxians were no stranger to suffering. It showed in their eyes, hardened by something that cut further and ran deeper than the war that had stolen his mother from him. They did not flinch from the screams of people dying, nor the stench of decay and burnt flesh &ndash; not even the youngest soldiers, some of whom seemed only a few years his elder. His young mind rationalised it thus &ndash; Noxians were evil and heartless &ndash; but he must have known that was not entirely true when he offered water to a soft Noxian boy, barely out of his tenth summer. \n\nHis blood was too red when his wide, shocked eyes stared at him. The soldiers only laughed, mockingly, at the soft gurgle that left his lips and the way his fingers scratched uselessly at the gaping wound in his neck when finally, they let him die. They taunted him, their rambunctious guffaws dark and humourless. There was a coldness in the pit of Zed&rsquo;s stomach when he twisted free of their ropes, and he glanced regretfully at the other boy for a moment before he ran. \n\nThey had missed the relieved smile on his face when he died. \n\nWhen people whispered his name, they often spoke of how callously he ended the lives of those beneath him. He was a monster in their eyes; a murderer who slaughtered the defenceless without batting an eye. Zed was no stranger to their names for him. Demon was the most common, but it was said in the most hushed tones, as if speaking too loud would summon him to them. \n\nIf names were the price for a swift and painless death, then names he would endure. It was not a mercy &ndash; never a mercy &ndash; but a kindness, of sorts. \n\nIII\n\nHe lived in a small town nestled between the famous tea plantations to the east and the green plains, dotted with orchids selling sweet and colourful fruits. The village shunned him &ndash; always had &ndash; for his strange eyes (red, like that of a demon&rsquo;s, or a vengeful ghost&rsquo;s) and his head, full of hair as white as clouds on a warm spring day. The children were ushered away from him by their parents, and even their teachers could not hide their disdain when they sent him to the furthest seat available. \n\n&ldquo;Repeat after me, love: sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never harm me,&rdquo; his mother said to him the morning that the Noxians invaded. It was the same thing she had told him the morning before that, and the morning before that. But the children&rsquo;s stones wounded him just as much as the names, despite the mask of cheerfulness he had forced upon himself. \n\nThe war lent him a new face. One with eyes darkened, but not saddened, by the destruction around him. His mouth did not twitch upwards in a smile; nor did it ever form a frown. There was safety behind this face, he soon learnt, and it was wearing this face that earnt him a place in Kusho&rsquo;s beloved monastery, improving what he had learnt in his years spent evading the Noxian army, and learning new skills to compliment those abilities.\n\nHis mask &ndash; sewn onto his face with the thread of time &ndash; was what had allowed him to steel his nerves and turn against Kusho. When he had begged for the box (and its secrets) to be destroyed, it was not simply through sheer strength of will that he had turned and killed him where he stood. \n\nHis emotionless visage, forged with the fires of his pain, could not be broken. But in the middle of the night, when he woke with a heaving chest and a sheen of sweat on his brow, he could only curse its fragility when faced with his past. \n\nIV\n\nSchool was a place of knowledge. It was where students of any age could gather and share the eternal truths of the world around them. Their teachings were theoretical and absolute, veiled in the pretence of wonderment, but Zed could not help but see the world differently. Perhaps it was a result of the bitter aftertaste of blood and bile in his mouth each morning, or simply the burning disgust he felt at teachers who preached peace and equality yet turned a blind eye at every injustice that they saw. \n\nPerhaps that was why, when he began teaching the way of the shadows to those who believed that balance could never be enough, he gave all his followers one important lesson. His elder students were emotionless as they watched the newcomer fidget, before snapping to attention when the heavy wooden doors were pushed open and Zed entered the hallway. She had a small, slim figure, but there was determination in her eyes and strength in her limbs. \n\n&ldquo;Here, you will study and take in what the shadows have to offer you,&rdquo; he watched, impassively, as she gulped and nodded. &ldquo;You will be the master of your own studies. Seek out knowledge however you see fit, and know that your hunger may never be satiated. Most importantly, however, is this &ndash; know that knowledge comes to us all, but nothing is absolute. Not even the truth.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Thank you, master,&rdquo; she bowed as he left. \n\nV\n\nAs a child, Zed&rsquo;s favourite place was the main town a day&rsquo;s ride south of his hometown. It was large and bustling with people; the streets full of vendors selling candied fruits and barbequed skewers. It was most beautiful at night, when the lanterns lining the stone-paved pathways were lit with magical fire which never went out, but which never burned the delicate coloured paper. Their reflections were breath-taking in the puddles after a shower &ndash; red, blue, green, and yellow melting and scattering as he jumped into the water. \n\nThe one building that had taken his breath away, however, was the grand court in the centre of the town, with its carvings of dragons painted gold on its heavy wooden doors, and bright red phoenixes which guarded the windows. Even the gutters were carved with beautiful dragons which spouted water when it rained. In his adolescence, he had wondered if the buildings in heaven looked like the courthouse, and if so, why his mother always refused take him there to see them. \n\nAs he grew older, he began to understand the courthouse&rsquo;s purpose in society, but he also saw its one perfect flaw. While they were renowned across Valoran for the equality demonstrated in court, he had come to the realisation that the courts upheld justice only for those who demanded it. When someone stole from a monk, people made an uproar, but when a few coins were stolen from an urchin, then everyone turned a blind eye. \n\nHe disagreed with Ionia&rsquo;s definition of &lsquo;justice&rsquo; &ndash; especially in the case of Khada Jhin, whose murderous spree left the dead more disfigured than anything he had seen in the war. A finger&rsquo;s length beyond ten paces was the distance between Shen and himself as they sat in silence. Shen broke the silence and taunted him, but he could only sigh. He was exhausted. He did not want glory for this man&rsquo;s capture. Simply justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Technoscribble","date":"2016-07-10T11:05:18.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought I might have had a shot at winning for a second, but you've crushed my dreams.

I've never quite been able to move on from that phase). That being said, thank you for taking the time to comment, and I'm glad you enjoyed reading my fic. :) <3","replies":[{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-08-01T22:46:54.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for sharing!
