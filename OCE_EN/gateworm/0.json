I recieved the Icon and the augment core fragment, cores and Blueprint.\nI then got my friend to gift me the Decrypter Icon, which contains the Ekko Icon. I received the Icon but did not get the augment core shard, PROJECT cores or the First Strike Blueprint for Ekko.\n\nI then purchased the Ashe Icon and received the blue print, Augment cores and project cores.\n\nI believe this is a possible bug with the gifting of these icons.","replies":[{"poster":"oOUnseenBladeOo","date":"2016-08-10T06:17:37.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing happend to me!!!\n\nso what now? \n\ndoes that mean we wont get them ever?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miss Baby","date":"2016-08-05T08:09:47.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont have 3 blueprints, there is a bug","replies":[]}]}
