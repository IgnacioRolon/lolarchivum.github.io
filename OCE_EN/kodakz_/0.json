It happens to everyone. Ranked games is the worst, too! So why does everyone get punished because of it? Yeah the afker might get a time penalty, but why does the rest of the team lose LP, for something out of their control. Those on the AFK team should get 0 LP, while the winning team get the standard LP, meanwhile the AFKer cops a 200% LP deficit. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-31T07:26:58.674+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, getting afk's in a ranked game can be very painful I do agree with you however Riot has done what they can to try and prevent this from happening.\n\nFor example the remake system that got introduced helps when people go afk or don't connect within the first few minutes of the game which I personally have been able to use to avoid many frustrating 4v5s.\n\nThe painful thing is though that later into the game it is hard for Riot to implement a system against afks that work correctly. The idea that you stated is good in the theory of it will work for making it so that I'd there is an afk you won't get punished for something out of your control. However it leads to the possibility of if there is a game you can't win someone you are queued with potentially taking the leave penalty so that the rest of the team doesn't lose LP and the enemy team doesn't get any.\n\nThis could pose a serious threat to the intergerty of the competition of the game especially at high elos where there are fewer players. This becomes even more of a problem when you think about flex queue as well having up to all 5 players potentially queued with you. \n\nAll up though make sure that you report people who afk on your team as the system will punish them for it. If people afk in games they will start getting bans and if they do it enough or consistently it won't be long before they get a long term ban or potentially permaed.\n\nI hope this helps explain why the system is the way how it is however if you get any ideas about how you think this can be fixed with ideas such as the one you brought up, make sure you make a post about it detailing your idea to add to the system. Riot are always looking for constructive ways to improve their game and the boards is a good way to communicate with them to help combat things such as AFKs in games.\n\nGood luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-31T07:55:51.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because its hard to determine if the person just sits on the fountain making sure the leaver buster doesnt detect them.\n\nThis kind of thing is easily taken advantage of too.

But also AFKing isn't as simple as leaving the game, there are genuine cases where people do not rage quit, this can be taken to the extent that your team mates don't know the full story and can report them for being AFK. I'm talking about cases such as people genuinely are trying to play but their internet or computer simply will not allow them to play due to latency or hardware issues. This brings me to BarryButcher's point; this can definitely be abused from smurfs or a team mate in flex queue, but regarding premades I believe they'd do the exact same thing the did in higher ELO with smurfs, if you're premade with the person you also take the penalty.\nThis ensures that the system isn't being abused too heavily, but also it still would be.\n\nAnyway, that's my thoughts on the topic\n-Threat","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-01T09:17:41.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i once found out that i had to go somewhere the instant i got into game, thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-02T08:00:49.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine for you, but it's not just going to be ok for everyone else.\n\nPlus if this is happening all the time, you deserve all the LPQ's you get.\n\nIf it's a one off, it doesn't affect you.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T00:31:12.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it was a one off, but it was also the time my mate and i got the bot lane together","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Threat","date":"2017-01-04T12:50:38.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=monkiinator135,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=aOQPnItE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-01-01T09:17:41.637+0000)\n>\n> i once found out that i had to go somewhere the instant i got into game, thoughts?\n\nThat's why the remake system is in place, if you just leave the game, your team will be able to remake so long as it isn't past the 1:30 point, because then they're able to remake at 3:00 because you were afk more than 90 seconds.\n\nIn saying that, only you are punished.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T00:30:44.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this was before remake rip","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-04T03:17:49.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=monkiinator135,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=aOQPnItE,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-01-01T09:17:41.637+0000)\n>\n> i once found out that i had to go somewhere the instant i got into game, thoughts?\n\nToo bad for you, that is an afk.\n\nAlso, if the system can tell you are in a duo, apply the penalty to everyone that queued together.
