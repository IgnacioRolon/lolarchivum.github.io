And I was excited using the new client too. If you want to use the old client, just click on the &#039;Launch legacy client&#039; on the bottom right corner of the new client.\r\n\r\nIf that didn&#039;t work (like mine), go to your League of Legends folder (C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends) and double click lol.launcher.exe, that will launch the old client instead, and you&#039;ll get to play the Rotating game mode queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Bar0nSlayer","date":"2016-11-26T08:55:03.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks dude, i didnt even know there was a launch legacy client option.","replies":[]}]}
