There was no &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot; and upon manually reconnecting multiple times (and resetting my router) i still was disconnecting after 10 seconds or not being able to connect at all.\r\nI tried reconnecting maybe like 5-10 times before i gave up.\r\nI&#039;ve got 0 connection problems atm (was on skype the whole time i was disconnecting) so hopefully this is a heads up for riot to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"TeHjAcK","date":"2015-05-26T08:03:55.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem\nSpecs are as follows:\nintel core i7 4790k\namd r9 290\nasrock z97 xtreme4 mobo\nNetgear WNA3100 N300 wireless adapter\nWindows 7 OS\nEVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2 Power Supply\nI previously played 2 matches prior to this bug but after it happened i looked on google for recent bugs(within a month) relating to this exact problem and found this post which described exactly what happened to me. reconnecting sometimes reconnects to the game sometimes it stops midway, and 1-20 seconds later randomly just stop moving and everything in the game stops updating with no attempting to reconnect screen but with good ping","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-26T01:48:58.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Servers op.\n\nWhich ISP are you with?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magicgoat","date":"2015-05-25T06:35:02.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also just a note i was playing ranked summoners rift before this with 0 problems.","replies":[]}]}
