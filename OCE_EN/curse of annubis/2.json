This led to them both raging and said they were going to feed. It was sorted out later in champ select and it seemed they were both going to play the game but then the Nunu that had started it all switched to ghost/cleanse jungle with 1 second left. He then proceeded to intentionally but act nice in chat so that it looked like he was getting raged at for an &quot;accident&quot;, this was made worse by the other team&#039;s jungler encouraging the Nunu to do so. \n\nSo I recommend players in plat to low diamond mmr to dodge him (check match history for the name of the Nunu) and don&#039;t trust him if he says he will play. Also this is like the whole disco Nunu trolls all over again so will they just be banned when they get reported running the ghost/cleanse combo.","replies":[]}
