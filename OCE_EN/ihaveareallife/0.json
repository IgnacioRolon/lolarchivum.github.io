I have played LoL since season 2 but have mainly just been playing with some friends for some fun in my off time. I am currently a student at university but thankfully exams are over soon. I have always had an interest in competitive gaming (CS 1.6, CS:S and CoD mainly). Im am very much interested in starting a team with a solid group that is willing to learn and have fun with each other. I main adc/support and my friend Josh who i am starting the team with mains top. However, we are flexible. \r\n\r\nIm looking for people who:\r\n- Love the game \r\n- Have a positive attitude \r\n- Want to look at always getting better at the game\r\n- Have a microphone and skype :)\r\n\r\nMost important thing: I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR RANK. If you are a genuine person, thats what im interested in. There is nothing worse than a toxic team. \r\n\r\nadd ihaveareallife in game, 16+ only thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"GoriIlaz","date":"2015-11-06T12:24:51.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i'm a Jg / Top main been playing since end of season 3, currently in Gold V.
