Infact i lose 23 lp every game i lose and only gain 13-15, and this is simply just unfair for players. Sometimes we meet trolls and inting players, and we lose 23 lp ; its just simply bullshit because you're losing so much lp not because of yourself but because of inters and trolls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"7S Stylish ","date":"2017-11-14T23:44:54.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like an explanation to why i have demoted to platium 1 after 2 games in ranked solo/duo, especially after i broke my 10 games losing streaks; hence i’ve been winning much more than before and won 1 game in 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-10T08:42:22.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP is based on relative MMR, and MMR is based on more than just win loss. It's also unlikely that you and your friend went into this with the same ranked MMR, that would be nearly impossible, and from the sounds of it, this duo was a one time thing not a consistent thing. If you ONLY played together then your MMR would be a lot closer, but that doesn't seem to be the case.","replies":[{"poster":"7S Stylish ","date":"2017-07-10T18:18:08.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, our mmr is decently close , around 200-300.
