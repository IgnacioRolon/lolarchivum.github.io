Match making is based on hidden MMR and has nothing to do with your visible tier/LP. If someone is in Silver V and is worse than Bronze 2/3 they'll get matched up with Bronze 3 players or whatever even though their visible rank is Silver V.\n\nIt's more likely that you're misperceiving your own skill level and the skill level of your colleagues in Silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-02-14T09:07:21.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah true, and because of that you have b5 players in silver 5... and they trash talk bronzies when they are just as bad if not worse","replies":[]}]}
