But on the other side of things in blind picks on more than the odd occasion I call a role first and someone will insta locks with a bad attitude. Now if I'm having a bad day and I just want to relax and play a few games in my spare time this becomes a lot more frustrating to me than to wait out a few que jumpers for 5 mins. Instead of making a big deal out of it I am more than happy to fill uncalled role and move on with the game but sometimes (if I was really keen to play a certain champion) I might leave the que and move on to another game. But now I am forced to wait 5 - 15 mins before I can join back in and in rank these times are around doubled.\n\nSo now can someone please explain to me why these constrictions exist?","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-27T04:32:33.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To discourage leaving","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-26T12:06:15.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to stop people from joining que, then at the last minute leaving the lobby. then joining que, and at the last minute leaving lobby.","replies":[]}]}
