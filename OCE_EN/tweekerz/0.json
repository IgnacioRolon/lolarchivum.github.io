You will know the struggle when you get total trolls when you're just about at 100 points and you drop until you're at a negative 0 5 loss streak... Then proceed to almost get to gold promos again ti find that matchmaking is actually trolling you at this point and it is laughing it's head off at you clawing at the next Tier.

But I was amateur at that point and never find myself climbing ranks. so I stopped playing ranked and did the same thing as you last season. come back this season and find I can climb my way out of bronze which I guess is something, I won't stop here though have my sights set on gold for now.","replies":[]}]}]}
