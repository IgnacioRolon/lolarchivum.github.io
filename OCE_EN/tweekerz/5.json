You can check out all the rules [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h4q2).\n\nThis might seem like a very large skill range, but in fact it's much closer than you might think. Remember that one whole tier is only about a 300 **MMR** difference. If you used [OP.GG](http://oce.op.gg/) when they still had estimate normals **MMR**, it wasn't uncommon to see 200 - 300 **MMR** differences between games.\n\nIf you want to better understand how close the tiers are, I'd recommend watching this video by **Scrap Computer**.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtjCL1oInz4\n\nI hope this answered your question ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2016-04-12T11:00:49.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See I was wondering how I had Gold tier in a couple games this week (Bronze 1 atm) and it really seems unfair although you explain the MMR is a lot closer than people think. It's still down to skill cap of the player and when you insert a gold to verse a team of bronze without evening out the other team with at least a high silver low gold then it just really seems unfair at this point. Also add the fact that duo has communication ect. I just think they should see the problem here and have some kind of solution. TY for the information regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-13T06:13:43.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an area where I do think **Riot** has gone wrong.\n\nI think It's great that you can queue for ranked in parties of 2+, but I don't think it's wise to have 0 penalties for doing so.\n\nI'm not sure if you're aware but [solo queue](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4dwkar/official_riot_temporarily_put_a_hold_on_solo/) was officially put on hold a few days ago. Which means dynamic queue will be the only way to queue for ranked in the foreseeable future.\n\nEven though solo queue was promised, it's understandable that not everything can go as planned. However I think a lot of players will agree, that it is not an excuse to leave dynamic queue as it is. If dynamic queue is going to be the only way to queue now, then there needs to be more features for solo players, or at the very least, transparency on how it is currently fair for solo players and not optimised for parties like many people think.\n\nIt's important we raise awareness on this and push **Riot** where we can on these issues. Keep in mind though, it's not a call to be disrespectful.\n\nJust something I though I'd comment on there ;)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-04-12T10:43:39.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It generally evens itself out, I'm mid to high silver and I duo with my bronze mate all the time matching with people from silver 2 to bronze 3","replies":[]}]}
