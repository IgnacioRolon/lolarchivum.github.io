In both matches both duo's afk around mid game and there wasn't really anything 3 v 5 could do from then on even when we were on the winning side both times. Neither game gave loss prevented, seriously you should disable duo just for this reason. If one person afk that's okay they could come back its much easier to hold as 4 v 5 but if 2 afk same time all other team has to do is rush mid full force and if they have a blitz or tank support its a simple GG from there.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-15T21:00:07.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo is good in my opinion.
