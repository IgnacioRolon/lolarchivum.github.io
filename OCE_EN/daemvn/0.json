Luckily i know someone with a league account who is happy enough to let me post this on the forums.\r\n\r\nI believe my email address was also compromised as there was no correspondence from Riot about my password change or even my contact email being changed. I have since reformatted my PC\r\n\r\nUsing the recover password or recover account is not working for me.\r\n\r\nI have sent an email to the riot support group a couple days ago and have had no responses from them\r\n\r\nMy account has so many skins and am hoping that i can get it returned to me.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had any luck from Riot in this regard? If so, how long did it take?\r\n\r\nMy summoner name is: Fazza Bruth\r\n\r\nDesperately wanting to return to the field.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-03-31T01:29:55.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Fazza Bruth,\n\nI've locked the account in case of compromise.
