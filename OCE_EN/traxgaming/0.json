Is he really climbing the charts again?\r\n\r\nAzir has always been one of my favourite champions to watch with his dashing and skill requirement. I like challenges so it gives me something to do until I master him. I know he might be getting a rework but playing azir against people in queue they will have a hard time against him in my belief because not many people are used to seeing him anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-20T23:36:35.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with difficult champions, is that contrary to popular belief, they aren't actually high-risk/high-reward.\n\nTheir plateau must be the same as other champions in order to be balanced. You cant make Azir that much more powerful than all the other champions just because he is hard, because then once you do master him, you'd just fly straight up to challenger. \n\nA master Azir player is no more or less impactful than a master Annie player. He has more potential for plays to be sure! But a shurima shuffle into an ult back into your team, is no more powerful or useful than a AoE Tibbers stun. One is very hard to pull off, and the other is piss easy, but they both get a very similar result. \n\nDifficulty is not necessarily equivalent to strength. \n\nIf you like Azir and like a challenge, and thats why you want to play him, then you'll have so much fun with him! he's a fantastic champ :D\nBut playing him for strength purposes only, I wouldn't recommend. You might as well just play Annie or Lux, you'll have a very similar impact on the game, but for significantly less effort. \n\nDont get me wrong, Azir is far from being weak, he has strengths that no other champ can match, and in certain situations he is the best pick by far! But he has the weaknesses to go along with those strengths as well. \n\nIts true that some people don't have much experience playing against him _(people used to build armour against me)_, but since he became infamously popular last year, more and more people know how to play against him, and he's just another champ now :p\n__________\n\nI personally haven't noticed more Azir players around, but then again, you don't see that many in my elo anyway xD\nIll be interested to see if he is indeed getting more popular again. \n\nAlso whats your source on an Azir rework? I haven't heard anything about that (and I'm scared now :S) Its bad enough that they are re-working Aurelion Sol, but now Azir too?","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-20T23:49:43.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally i played him semi-recently, and while he felt strong, i honestly chalk that up to the fact that i was in an auto-win lane (a lower Elo yasuo) then him being strong.\n\nAnd my mechanics aren't terribly weak and i still don't really see the point of playing Azir, there are always going to be a few cases where he is better, but those are out classed by other mages.\n\nFor example Kayle does the whole Auto attack focused mage thing, and she is arguably better than azir just without the flashy plays, and then someone like Ahri has the mobility+mage components but without being confined to someone who has to force insec's and shit like that to do flashy shit.\n\nOf course that's just a personal opinion and shows my liking to specific types of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-21T01:19:28.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you 100% there.\n\nhe is outclassed by a lot of people, he's definitely a specialist, not a generalist.\n\nHe has his place to be sure, he is a fantastic siege/turtle champion, his safe range and turret see to that, and he's pretty good against tanky teams. But in terms of skirmishes, Kayle's damage output is stronger and more reliable, Lee Sin's insecs are easier and happen much much more often. Azir's poke is great, but unlike other champs like Orianna/Xerath/Ziggs/Syndra, he has to stand still for a while, which makes him vulnerable to retaliation poke, more so than other long range mages who can poke on the move. \n\nIm definitely not saying he is weak, I think he is very very strong. But he isn't as reliable as other champions in as many situations. Which isnt a bad thing at all! Not all champions should be generalists like Camile/Lee Sin/Yasuo/Viktor etc etc. Its great to have some champs that fulfil a specific purpose in the team, like he does. Having champs like him and Aurelion Sol makes team strategy so much more interesting!","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-21T03:08:44.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh i don't think i'd take him as a Siege/Turtle champion even, the main reason i would take him is a winning lane (but learn him first) that someone better doesn't also win the lane.\n\nAlso personally with my minimal Azir experience, there are a few things that make him feel slightly clunky, in terms of someone who hasn't played him a lot. (mostly due to him not having an AA range indicator that you can easily see for the command range of soldiers, but again, that would come with playing him more often.)\n\nThat said in lower elo, someone that actually LEARNS Azir would be able to climb easily if they actually learn him to a decent standard, as he is definitely the type of champion with a decent amount of solo carry potential in his kit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-21T03:49:25.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he has a bottom 3 winrate in every elo from bronze to diamond sitting at around 40-46% and you don't see many master/challenger Azirs running around right now.
