Also, it's Cerebus, not Celebus lol. :P\n\nBasically, he has no damage potential outside of his ult and autos (bar the Sunfire cape-esque E ability). His Q is basically Urgot's ultimate. His W is basically Cleanse. E is Sunfire/Frozen Heart. And his ult is a difficult Elise ultimate. I honestly think the idea could be cool, especially if you add in some sort of dual head play, where one head has different abilities to the other when activated perhaps. But as it currently is, not at all viable.\n\nHere's how I'd do it if I were sticking to the theme:\n\n**Hellbaddon, the Daemon Hound!**\n\n**Passive - Hell borne:** Hellbaddon deals 20/30/40 Magical Fire Damage to those in close promity to him per second.\n\nHellbaddon's abilities require _Hell Fury_ to use (which replaces the mana bar), which Hellbaddon generates at ??? points per second when in combat. Also, upon receiving damage, Hellbaddon converts a portion of that into _Hell Fury_.\n\n**Q Ability - Hell Bite:** Hellbaddon lunges forward and bites target enemy, dealing damage with a chance of setting the target aflame and dealing magical damage (10/20/30/40/50% chance). Bite scales with AD. When used at maximum _Hell Fury_, Hell Bite deals true damage instead.\n\n**W Ability - Visions of Hell:** Hellbaddon Fears and Turns all nearby enemies who fail to resist. Effect is a static 1.5 seconds, but extends with AP. The AP scale increases with each level of the ability.\n\n**E Ability - Flame Shield:** Hellbaddon removes all slows, taunts and other movement debuffs and immediately gains a rapidly decaying shield. Scales with AP. When used at maximum _Hell Fury_, the effect also increases Hellbaddon's passive by ???%.\n\n**R Ability - Flames From Below:** Passive - Whenever Hellbaddon kills an enemy champion, he recovers 30/40/50% of his _Hell Fury_ bar.\n\nActive - Hellbaddon explodes into flame, dealing massive amounts of magical damage to all enemies within the spell's AoE range. While in the blast radius, enemies take magical damage as the flames from Hell burn them from below for the duration of the AoE, until they exit or the effect stops. Scales with AP.\n\n----\n\nSo, that's roughly how I'd start the champ off. He could be a great jungler or top laner. He could have a decent Auto dmg and speed, and his Q would scale with AD, so you'd have to decide if you wanted to take him down the AD route. Or you could go AP for more utility in his W and E escapes/taunts and his ult. Or you could go with him being a pure dps semi-tank.\n\nI could definitely see him lunging out of a bush for a gank, dealing some decent damage, and then shielding himself before running away. The more damage he takes, the more powerful he gets (if his _Hell Fury_ bar reaches max), but you also don't want to leave him alone either. Interesting champ, if I don't say so myself! ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-05T01:04:19.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E - To hot to handle\nPassive - anything that gets close to hellbaddon burns, any AA is reduced by 5%/7%/9%/12%/15%.\n\nI think these stats will get dropped a bit as there a tad high I think riot would make it 3%/5%/7%/9%/11%\nAlso whats the radius of this passive(same as {{item:3068}})","replies":[]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-03T01:57:18.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically he's an amalgamation of a few peoples ults??
