It's not that these players are necessarily being dealt with but there is such a high influx of negative attitude players because this game can cause some high frustration.\n\nI don't want to sound like a lollipop but honestly I've changed my attitude when I enter my games and I hardly get mad and I just stay positive. This has made my entire team 70-80% of the time stay positive too when they know they're not going to be abused for their bad mistakes as well. Although it's not a perfect world and no matter what you do people are going to be abusive or negative. \n\nAlso aside from reporting them if you do get extremely toxic players in your game and they actually dish out some threats or some terrible terrible stuff I'd recommend taking a few screenshots and contacting Riot directly. \n\nThanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-07T11:18:37.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not allowed to name and shame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-11-07T10:50:45.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't want to be rude, but it get very annoying when you have to face with trolling and afk people. Rito seem to want those \"people\" to get better but we need punishment for that, and I think the punishment Rito have right now is nothing. Furthermore, what will they do when they get out of those punishment? They get better or they get worst? I think Rito need to learn or build up something. Name and Shame is something we should have to get those player out and view their face for them to know what they did was wrong. No name no shame, they just laugh at your report system Rito. Too much complain about this and I think Rito just want to concentrate on the top 10% player rather then the low 90% one.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-07T12:54:59.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey layowin and DarkDraagoon,\n\nI'm really sorry you guys have gone through leavers in games. But naming and shaming is against the rules of the boards so I have deleted the name. I am more than happy to discuss the current punishment systems we have in place for Leavers.\n\nYou can find full info about every system here- http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nBut the one that specifically relates to Leavers is called Leaver buster. How this punishment system works is if a player leaves a high number of games they will be put in low priority queue. What this means is if a player is on low priority queue from leaving they must wait 5-20 minutes before they can queue for a game.\n\nFor example a common punishment for leavers is 5 games with 20 minute wait time. This means for the next 5 games that leaver will have to wait 20 minutes before they are allowed in queue.\n\nYou can read more about leaver buster here - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-07T21:57:38.300+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know this will probably sound utterly ridiculous, Is it possible to bring in banners for people that do certain negative actions? So we have teamwork and honourable opponent, why not have uncooperative, AFK and Bad Manners banners?\n\nThat way they could see that they are doing the wrong actions in game and will work towards achieving those sexy teamwork banners. Leaver busters just give people more time to make a coffee/tea, go to the toilet, grab a feed, have a smoke or get another beer.\n\n{{champion:83}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-08T00:43:14.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey man,\n\nSo you seem to bring up 2 points in your post.\n\n1) Why don't we give players uncooperative/bm banners?\n\nWe don't do this because we believe in player reform, a lot of our punishments gives players the opportunity to reform and change their ways. If players don't reform after a few punishments then we ban them.\n\nNow the reason we don't give players banners to let everyone else know they've wronged in the past is, can you imagine going into a game and seeing oh a person on my team has AFKed, or a person on my team has bad manners. It would instantly set a bad tone for the game, even if no one has said anything.\n\n2) Leaver buster just gives more time to do other things.\nThats the point, we force players to stop playing League of Legends as punishment. This has been shown to be more effective than bans and let me expand a little on why.\n\ne.g. 5 game 20 minute low priority queue or 3 day ban.\n\nWhat the low priority queue does is it forces you to  wait through the ban (you have to be logged in and in queue for 5*20 minutes).\n\nHowever if a player is banned for 3 days they can easily just log onto another account and instantly play LoL again and just wait out the ban on another account.\n\nThe low priority queue really forces the punished player to feel the punishment in comparison to a ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-08T03:20:40.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah you raise a good point my friend.
