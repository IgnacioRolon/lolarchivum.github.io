I dont blame you because nobody takes this item seriously. You only get it if your trolling or so far ahead that it doesnt matter if you sold all your items for 6 tears. I want to see this item rise in popularity but theres only so many ways you can make the active work. \nHeres my idea riot, since you released the forge below the mountain (ornn) why dont we introduce the active in a smaller way like allow large buffs to be frozen in stasis like baron dragon or the main buffs on either side of the river (blue and red) and give the item a passive that gives you increased movement speed when your in brush or the river. This might help it see more playtime, and rather then just trying to get the current active it has now to work maybe it could come back in some sense for a support keystone that buffs your own tower saving your adc from a 4 man towerdive for 5 seconds. Going back to ornn for a moment make it an upgradable item similar to locket or redemption where its cheap but you still can upgrade it late game. Ornn feels underwhelming about giving other champs on his team a nice little advantage super lategame because he tends to fall off compared to other tanks or divers he comes up against. Just an idea but i would love to have more versions of items he can upgrade for his team. Not massive judt small things because team mates sometimes complain that they have no upgradable item that they can logically use for the specific champion they play. They sound quite dissapointed and i want to help them out and give them an option at least for paying 500 gold for 10 extra armour on a knights vow or 100 health extra on a support item to make up for sightstone being gone. But dont do a black cleaver where it was broken for a while and everyone bought it. Thanks for letting me vent this\n\n- Take the Plunge with Clunge","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-06T22:22:18.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP, please use the 'Enter' key more often in the future, so your posts don't look like a wall of text.\nIt makes them easier to read.\n\nIf I were to suggest a change for {{item:3056}}  to make it more playable, I'd make it a small addition so as to be actually considered.\nI'd add to the active, \"after that 3 seconds, the turret will target you\".\nThis keeps the turret focus off the carries.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-05T21:15:28.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noooo I build it on kat vs full ad itâ€™s so nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"imnotmorgana","date":"2018-02-05T16:07:51.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah i 100% agree with this tbh as a adc main i hate getting towerdove and sometimes my toplaner has his thumb up his ass and doesnt match a tp or doesnt take it at all. i like the tower buff if it keeps me safe from a 4 man dive","replies":[]}]}
