It&rsquo;s called gun play for a reason!&rdquo; Jinx giggled with manic glee as she twisted and danced out of the path of Caitlyn&rsquo;s bullets. &ldquo;You missed me again! Jeez, hat lady, if you&rsquo;re only gonna carry one gun, at least know how to shoot it!&rdquo; Another burst of hysterical laughter, before Jinx bolted away from the chaos she&rsquo;d caused at one of Piltover&rsquo;s many museums.\n\n&ldquo;Me, miss? Not by a long shot,&rdquo; Cait muttered, hiking her way over the rubble to keep the blue haired menace in her sights. She only needed a few seconds and a clear shot...\n\n**_Crunch! _**\n\nThe side of a building exploded as Jinx ran by, concrete slamming her and making her stumble. Vi sprinted out of the wreckage. Jinx spun, grabbed Fishbones, and blasted her in the face; Vi roared with pain and anger but didn&rsquo;t halt her headlong charge. \n\nSeeing Vi get ever closer, Jinx laughed and Zapped her. Vi lurched; Jinx responded by throwing Flame Chompers which latched onto her ankles and brought her to her knees. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s such a loser, always ready to cry! T-t-t-ta,&rdquo; Jinx hissed. Shaking the chompers off, Vi staggered to her feet and lunged. Jinx skipped to the side, pulling out Pow-Pow and firing round after round at the Enforcer.\n\nBullets clattering off her hextech fists, Vi circled Piltover&rsquo;s craziest criminal and narrowed her eyes. All she needed was an opening to dive; then it would be payback time for Little Miss Psychopath. But Jinx hadn&rsquo;t evaded capture by being stupid, and she never let up on her fire, never gave Vi a chance to charge, and so the circling dance continued.\n\nBut Jinx had forgotten that Vi wasn&rsquo;t the only law enforcer after her.\n\n&ldquo;In my sights,&rdquo; came a quiet murmur through Vi&rsquo;s earpiece. Inwardly, she grinned, but she gave Jinx no sign of her elation. Jinx was too busy trying to kill her to notice either way.\n\n**_BOOM!_**\n\nThe powerful rifle made a startlingly loud noise, but soon enough it was drowned out by Jinx&rsquo;s scream, a sound of agony intertwined with pure rage. Distracted by the bloody mess of her leg, the Loose Cannon&rsquo;s aim turned erratic. &ldquo;Boom, headshot, ain&rsquo;t that right, Cupcake?&rdquo; Vi smirked before beginning her charge and yelling &ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo;\n\nJinx looked up from her wounded thigh just in time to receive a right hook to the jaw from a hextech gauntlet. Her head snapped back, her eyes rolled into her skull, and she crumpled to the ground. After checking to see that the psycho was well and truly out of it, Vi started divesting her of her arsenal while Cait cuffed Jinx securely. Then the Sherriff of Piltover turned her thousand-yard stare on her partner in preventing crime.\n\n&ldquo;What are you lookin&rsquo; at me like that for, Cupcake? Loosen up, it&rsquo;s time to celebrate, Little Miss Psychopath is going behind bars &ndash; where she belongs!&rdquo; Caitlyn was unimpressed by Vi&rsquo;s defensive ramblings.\n\n&ldquo;Did you really have to break a wall &ndash; one that Jinx hadn&rsquo;t already broken?&rdquo; She drawled, her upper-class accent apparent in every word.\n\n&ldquo;Sometimes you gotta make a door, Cupcake,&rdquo; Vi laughed. Caitlyn sighed, then reluctantly chucked with her.\n\n&ldquo;I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be an ordinary day if you didn&rsquo;t smash something. Although, our average day isn&rsquo;t the standard in most of Runeterra,&rdquo; Cait mused. &ldquo;Sometimes I wish that our days were a bit more regular.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Cupcake, you&rsquo;d be bored out of your brain if you weren&rsquo;t chasing criminals. Besides, you haven&rsquo;t caught that cat burglar yet, that joker who leaves the calling cards signed with the letter C. How can you even contemplate settling into an ordinary life?&rdquo;\n\nCaitlyn pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, and now that we&rsquo;ve caught this particular troublemaker, I think it&rsquo;s time I turned all my attention to that case.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Well Cupcake, you know who to call for backup,&rdquo; Vi smirked, thinking to rile Caitlyn with her ribbing.\n\n&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; Cait replied loftily, chuckling at Vi&rsquo;s startled expression. &ldquo;Yes, I do know who to call for backup, should I need it.&rdquo;\n\nAzure eyes scanned the chaos Jinx had left in her tumultuous wake, but Caitlyn chose not to see it as a tragedy. Instead, she decided, she would see it as an opportunity for advancement. Her home, after all, was the City of Progress.\n\n\n~~~~\n\nThanks for reading! Constructive criticism is welcome, I haven&#039;t written a short story in a while. I tried to include some of my favourite character quotes in here, and I&#039;m not sure if I&#039;ve really captured Vi - I don&#039;t play her that often, and I don&#039;t know her lines very well.","replies":[]}
