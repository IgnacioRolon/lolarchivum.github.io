No, you are not a good Ryze. 8/10 Ryze players I have seen picking him will feed 5 kills before even getting their Catalyst.\r\n\r\nYou are in bronze/silver. You&#039;re not good enough to play Ryze at his top level, it requires a great deal of mechanical knowledge and skill that somebody in that bracket can&#039;t pull off.\r\n\r\nStick to something that will be easier to snowball and carry with. Ahri, Akali, Lux to name a few.\r\n\r\nI am so done seeing Ryze&#039;s pick rate ryze(hurr) over the last few weeks only for everybody to feed with him because they don&#039;t understand how he&#039;s played.\r\n\r\nThis goes for Azir too. You&#039;re not Faker Faker Playmaker.","replies":[{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-11-07T22:27:54.909+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should not tell a group of people how they are to play the game they want to. It is extremely derogative for you to be telling the lowest ranks what to do, you cannot control anyone. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Ryze player, nor an SKT follower, but to comment about restricting specifically the lowest ranking group is very insulting and shows how you are trying to increase the gap between silvers and golds. Let people do what they want, it's not like they're purposely trying to troll you, they just want to experiment variety, this will slow down eventually.\n-Also, seeing as you are in Bronze IV, I don't think you out of all people can really say who plays what.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-08T02:30:37.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr.\n\nI'm yet to see a bronze player pick Ryze and play him well.\n\nI have my champions I play well.

I've seen their match historys. They are ALWAYS bad with ryze, and if they have a good game, it's because the enemy team is at such a worse level they've been fed.\n\nDon't leap to assume that I make assumptions. I don't, I check match history, champion stats and overall statistics of almost every ryze player that i've seen. They are ALWAYS bad.\n\nThis is Bronze. I have a right to an opinion and to give advice. And my advice is to stop picking ryze.","replies":[{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-11-08T07:51:29.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr ^-^\nyou may do what you do, but what you do is still derogatory. EVERYONE has the right for an opinion and advice, you aren't giving an advice, you are giving a command, and that is not a right. But since you said so, my advice for you is to change your icon, it doesn't suit you...\nBut this is the forums, official forums at that, I'd suggest to stop the argument here, your opinion is out, my opinion is out.
