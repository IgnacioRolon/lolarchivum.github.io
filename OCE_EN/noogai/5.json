This is insane as before you had to build 2 full items ({{item:3031}} {{item:3087}}) and a mini item {{item:3086}}  to reach cap.\r\n-He gets +15% lifesteal from crit. If you can farm well, by 10-15 minutes you should have 17% lifesteal with masteries alone, let alone runes.\r\n-Bloodthirster is no longer unique, so if you&#039;re fed, you can grab two bloodthirsters and enjoy ~57% lifesteal. This is insane.\r\n-He now deals even MORE damage to tanks than before with {{item:3036}}. Yasuo doesn&#039;t build health. He is a skirmisher and so has no HP and will melt anybody that has taken {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3151}}.\r\n-maybe a few other things, I haven&#039;t gotten to get through full builds yet as i usually either end the game at 20 minutes with a surrender from our team due to a fed enemy adc, or a surrender from enemy team from our adc being too fed.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts? Anybody tested any of the melee crit based champions? I&#039;m looking forward to playing Gangplank and Master Yi.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-12T21:26:25.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully a Yasuo nerf coming in :) That should slow OCE down from using him every normals game haha :p","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2015-11-13T07:13:45.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He dosent need a nerf, the items do and masteries, Yasou has been nerfed plenty of times.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-13T22:41:50.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say his Q is a 20 second CD, His W is a 180 second CD and his E is a 10 second CD and his ultimate is a 20 minute CD, maybe a passive of -100% crit damage too.
