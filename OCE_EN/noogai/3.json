I know a lot of people like to have her as Cinderhulk or Warrior&#039;s, but I tried out devourer and it stacks REALLY well with a rushed lvl 3 W and building some damage/tank after that.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-26T07:07:48.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it dominates mid game if you can get sated by 20. But it loses her early gank pressure. I often build and have been having success but it is wholly dependent on how well your lanes do.

Also you will be really squishy easy, with no real decent damage either.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T02:11:48.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q>Auto>E sets off the passive, and Sated would make that be 4 Auto's worth of W so it's worthless in that aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-07-11T02:54:42.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah thats what i was saying","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-10T21:57:42.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be significantly worse in the early-mid game. Maybe alright if youre only hitting tanks and they cant kite you.
