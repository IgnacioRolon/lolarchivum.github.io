(no waveclear, has to jump in for about 1 second to assasinate) the waveclear kinda fks her tbh like to win lane against lb all you have to do is shove really hard and she either can harass you and miss minions or can farm. i know your thinking \"well its not gunna be harass if she 1 shots me in lane.\" but still any champion like viktor and ekko cna just stay kinda far and just waveclear with 1-2 rotations of spells.\nAnother tip when vsing lb is notice if she uses the combo wqre OR weqr (there are more but these are the ones people complain about no counterplay). either one has counterplay. for the first combo it is her burstiest combo but in it she throws her e last so its easier to dodge, wait for the qr to be shot and then juke the e. she wont proc her r and all her spells are on cd, you can play agressive/all in her. the second combo is easier to land her e, but the ult wont proc until the 2nd e proc. right when she W towards you you can walk diagonally down next to her (assuming she hit w).\n\nIm a lb main myself, but ive vsed a lot of good lbs before and these are my counterplay options. obviously when shes fed as hell and qr does 3/4 of your health, there is no counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-17T00:07:08.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've found it's really easy to get to that level of fed where you can basically just roll on the keyboard and not worry about what your R becomes and you'll still get kills.\n\nIf I can get a Needlessly Large Rod before my opponent, I can steamroll the game, more or less. I got first blood in both of my recent games with LB (my only 2 games in normals with her) and I demolished the opposition.
