I got placed into Bronze 1, which is fair enough, I had a lot of lag issues and got stuck in a role I don&#039;t play well (support), but is a lot better than bronze 5. What happens from here? How long/how many wins until I can promo for silver 5?","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-26T02:24:04.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP MMR GGWP","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-26T00:51:32.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you don't lose any games, it'll probs take about 8 or 9 games to get to silver 5.\nthat's without losing any.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-26T00:46:29.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, there's a value called MMR, which represents your level of skill.\n\nMMR determines the level of your teammates (approx) and the average MMR of your team determines the average MMR of your opponents.\nWhile you play your game, the system compares the relative MMR scores and runs probabilities of the outcome - let's say it's betting on the winner.\nYour odds of winning determine how much your MMR will change at the end of the game: good odds will translate into a relatively small gain, or a pretty big loss if you lose, while bad odds will mean you won't lose much, or you'll win a lot if you succeed.\n\nThis, in short, is the MMR system, which is an adaptation of the Elo system (originally used for chess, but later moved to professional basketball, soccer, baseball, and a few thousand other sports and games with a ladder system).\n\nNow with the hard part.\n\nThe MMR value is hidden. What you CAN see is the tier system.\nEach tier/division has a corresponding \"ideal MMR\" value. By comparing your Current MMR with the Ideal MMR of your division, the system calculates a discrepancy, and moves you up or down the ladder according to that discrepancy, using the LP values.\nIf your Current MMR (after the game) is higher than the Ideal MMR of your division, you'll have a large gain or a small loss, and move up.\nIf your Current MMR (after the game) is lower than the Ideal MMR of your division, you'll have a small gain or a large loss, and move down.\nOnce you reach a sufficient total of LP, you go into a Promotion series. You know the rest.\n\nThis means that while you have an accurate and very mobile rating, you also have a relatively slow, smooth variation in divisions. This was made for two reasons: first, it gives a more immediate idea of rating and growth, as it gives you a sense of progression, or \"climb\". Second, it prevents abrupt changes, such as dropping 300 points in MMR due to a losing streak (your MMR will still drop, but it'll take longer to lose divisions and you might be able to reduce the drop with a few victories after).\nSome note that the pure, plain MMR gives a more immediate information and is more reliable, BUT it's apparently harder to understand. I am personally one of those...\n\nps.\nPlacements:\nYou start with a MMR of 1200, which is roughly equivalent to Silver IV.\nAfter placement matches, where MMR gain/loss is increased for higher variance, you are placed in the tier and division closest to your current rating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-05-26T00:26:10.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won 11 games in a row and moved around 120 lp and one promo..
