Carried a game with {{champion:254}}.\r\n\r\nNow I know I&#039;ve said a lot that in most games that aren&#039;t normals, it&#039;s hard to carry a game. You can&#039;t carry as, say for example, Vi, if your ADC won&#039;t push towers with you, or your top/mid won&#039;t capitalize on your ganks to push their lane and help other lanes, and nobody will group up with you.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this game I managed to catch the enemy teams carries (Zed and Riven) out quite a few times, lowering their gold income and putting them out of the game so we could clean up their team and push objectives.\r\n\r\nI consider myself a good player. Not to brag, I just think i&#039;m a decent player. So here&#039;s to hoping I can continue to either carry games or get a team that doesn&#039;t need to be carried. It&#039;s hard to do most of the work on a team only to get burst down in a 3-4v1 situation because you get caught out trying to push the damn objectives.\r\n\r\nAnybody else having good luck in their ranked games so far?","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-10-23T07:51:52.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi takes no skill, she can just legit lock down the enemy ADC and three hit them with no counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-23T11:47:47.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahahha man please..

Knowing when to Q in or when to save it to escape, timing your Q so you hit it, aiming your Q, using your E to effectively reset auto attacks, using your ult. While the ult is point and click, it's not \"durr ult adc and it dies\". You can get chain CC'd or even bursted down after the ult.\n\nI can't even find any match history or champion usage statistics on your name, so I'm going to assume you don't play ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-10-24T08:29:36.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People give vi a bad name, she takes lots of skill.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-10-24T08:37:06.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed. She's a strong champion, with a great early game if you buy Warriors, or she can pump into Hypercarry mode if you buy Devourers and play around your cooldowns well.\n\nBut she's by no means OP. I know of champs that can carry games much easier with a much smaller kill lead (Akali, Fizz).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2015-10-23T15:38:48.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats, I myself was in 8 promos between Bronze V and IV this season (220+ games). The thing that might help you climb a little is maintain that ranked mindset, be positive and focused, grabbing those objectives is a priority, don't over-chase and die, get that turret instead! Currently in B2 promos to get back into B1 for the 3rd time (I tilt on the verge of Silver)\n\nAlso keep it up and your win rate should approach 50%. My win rate at the start of the season was as horrible as yours is right now.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-10-23T16:01:44.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm getting great win rates in normals, just not in ranked, lol.
