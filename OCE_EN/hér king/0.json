I never said a word to him but as you guys probably know annoying toxic people is kinda fun, sets them off beyond belief. anyways this was urf and i was playing ekko sooo its sorta easy to kill him alot. he never said anything about me and as we killed the nexus he typed in all chat \"my team is dog shit and ekko i have ur address\" so i laughed (im on a call with 2 others in the game) and started acting scared on call like \"oh no he is gonna come and kill me!\" (i have been threatened with this stuff way too many times before to even care anymore) so i added him after the game to ask him for my address to check his legitimacy and he just said. \"your getting logged. goodnight\" and my client instantly disconnected from the internet as if my internet turned off. my call worked perfectly and so did youtube. me reopening the client fixed it but how did he do this? what can i do to prevent this again? should i be scared since he instantly disconnected me from the client?","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-02-17T11:01:47.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Probs just another PVP.NET issue honestly, there's been heaps since the last patch.","replies":[]}]}
