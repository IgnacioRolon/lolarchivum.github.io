So the only thing that has changed since this error started occuring was that my account has had a chat ban put on... Regardless, this shouldn&#039;t affect my client or ability to play.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had to re-update the client 3 times, I&#039;ve tried to log in on multiple occasions over a period of a week, the client either endlessly authenticates then bug splats or when I get in I can create a lobby but cannot actually start the queue. (I am also disconnected from friends chat)\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated.\r\nTY","replies":[{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2018-03-24T03:44:18.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From looking at this... it looks like a connection problem. I would recommend looking at this [guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and following the steps in order. I would try this first \"RELEASE/RENEW IP AND FLUSH DNS\" (see bottom of the guide) and see if that might fix your issue. If it doesn't then please use the other steps provided. If all of that doesn't fix the issue, I would submit a support ticket with the information they need (see the very bottom of the guide).","replies":[]}]}
