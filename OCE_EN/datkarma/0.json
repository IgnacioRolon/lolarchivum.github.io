Apparently he found some link 2 years ago which explains that DC is not a reportable offense. My question is, can I report him for leaving the game despite him claiming to have internet issues. He has left the game, he stood in the fountain for a while until the game was pretty much at its end and his attitude is unsightly.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-29T02:00:25.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played with 300 + ping during the past few days, and I don't go afk in the base I just play the game and deal with the lag.
