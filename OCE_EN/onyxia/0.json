And the speed never change again after it went 0. I tried all the methods on the Discussion and even on other websites but just failed.\r\n\r\nIt suffered me 2 days and finally I decided to re-install it. But after that, it got worse. The game is just stopped on the League of Legends Logo after I click the icon.\r\n\r\nI do not understand, how can Riot be so confident with their Downloader? It is always be in error! Why not just post a new patch link for players to update the game by themselves on the website?\r\n\r\nNow, I feel sick and tired enough on this kind of problems.\r\n\r\nI give up.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-15T07:17:08.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read through your post and now I’m wondering…why would you make such a post if you have other things to do?\nShouldn’t you be grateful already that you can play as much LoL as you already have?\nAlso if it seemed like “irresponsible words” then I do apologise, I didn’t give much heart into that response. You say that you’re not gonna read any more replies, but I hope you do read this one and literally, *get yourself back in the game.*\n\nIf you’re looking for solutions then either do it the fast but temporary way and that is to find another friend who shares the same OS as you (whether that be Windows or OSX) and copy the actual patch stuff to your computer from theirs. I’m not sure exactly what files but it’s all over the internet or you can do it the slow and steady way and that is to contact Riot Support about it. I doubt as you said, being the customer they wouldn’t look into this for you/other minority who may be having the same problem…\n\nYou mentioned that you’re the customer and you implied that you put money into this game (which isn’t bad, I do it too) but that doesn’t make you more ‘priority’ for these kinds of problems. You gotta accept it man, every single patch theres gotta be a small group of people who’s computers just don’t accept the patch for whatever reason, and I believe they all look like the same problem on the surface, but probably have different smaller reasons as to why it isn’t accepted, and that is nearly impossible to perfect.\n\nYou say you like WoW better but it takes too much time, then so be it. Play whatever you like, and I would suggest that you don’t play online games so you can start/stop anytime you want, so you can control your time better, unless you don’t like those kinds of games; we all have different tastes and preferences.\n\nSo, if you’re temporarily having an anger spike these few days because you can’t solve your launcher then I suggest you try fix it in either way I mentioned above or by other means possible, because by the sounds of it, you seem to be angrily desperate to fix the problem but you’re at the brink of quitting. I would suggest you not to quit if you can handle your time.\nIf you’re desperate enough you’d be willing to search for a fix ASAP.\nIf you’re not willing enough then yeah you probably don’t like LoL that much and should move on then.\n\nYour call.\n{{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:38}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-15T05:09:24.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats your own fault...no one's gonna sympathise for you man...\nYou seem to be the only one with this problem...well, a tiny fraction of everyone always has these problems so its not Riot...","replies":[{"poster":"Onyxia","date":"2015-03-15T06:44:04.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL, fun. Fault? So what do you mean is my fault? Spending so much time doing this issue?\n\nYour speaking is so ridiculous. I never met such problem before. How can it be mine.\n\nI am not asking anyone one to sympathise me. Of course not. Or, how do you think they can sympathise me? I thought my post will just sink to the deep after I posted.\n\nAnd there are actually a lot of people got the same problem and they posted. You just did not read that and speaking your irresponsible words.\n\nIn addition, I am the customer. I paid a lot buying stuffs online and supporting Riot. Or do you think Riot can make it with the free-players? The problem is my fault? Fun, did they pay the money to me and I did not do my responsibility?\n\nLast but not least, I have my life and game is just an entertainment. I do not know what your life is. Maybe you think it is not a big issue for you. You can spend all day on games. But I cannot, I have my work and business supporting my life.\n\nActually, I like wow more, but I just quit. That game takes too much of time. And now I have spend too much time dealing with the issue these days. I cannot continue to spend my time like that. \n\nAnyway, thank you for replying me, although they are not happy words. But, please do not reply again, I am not going to read it. I just want to quit.","replies":[]}]}]}
