The League In-game cursor doesn&#039;t even show, it just stays as my desktop mouse pointer. I think it may be due to my monitor settings, because trying it on my TV screen was fine. I&#039;ve not had this problem before, but since the last patch I&#039;ve been unable to play.\r\n\r\nPlz halp\r\n\r\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-06T09:40:29.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn off your discord overlay.\n\nIssues like these are pretty much always caused by something over the top of the League window (like an overlay) breaking.
