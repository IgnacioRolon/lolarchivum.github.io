They are saved outside of your \"Config\" folder. Specifically, they are in \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.XXX\\deploy\\preferences\" (where XXX is replaced with the highest number there). This also presumes you used the default install location. **Also,** this contains the item sets of any account played on that computer. It's pretty obvious which file belongs to whom.\n\nUntil they change the way item sets are coded, you can just copy these files from your old client's files into your new ones. Remember to always do it to the latest folder (a new install should only have one there, so it's a no-brainer).\n\n~the more you know~\n\nI've had this happen to me before and by god, I was not happy about it. It's still really strange how Riot still do that. Maybe they're just holding out for the new item set manager.","replies":[{"poster":"Doggykaze","date":"2015-05-17T11:45:39.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bugger me... I had like 40 or so saved item sets. It's going to be pain in the ass to create those again. \n\nAnyway thanks for the heads up I really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-17T11:53:29.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, if you ever want to upgrade your OS in general, it's *really* handy to make a list of all the apps you use so you can install them all in one day~\n\n(If you were really desperate to get the old sets back then you might have some luck in trying out a data recovery program, although most are costly and it will still take some time to sort through it all.)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
