This is the first time happening ever since I&#039;ve started playing LoL a few years ago and I&#039;m confused as to what triggered to make this problem arise.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that **I have no problem browsing any other pages or playing other games with my current DNS servers.** It&#039;s only LoL that&#039;s having this problem. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to fix this problem? I&#039;d like to use my router&#039;s DNS addresses instead of the public one due to various reasons. \r\n\r\nThanks guys, I appreciate your help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-16T23:16:28.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'd like to use my router's DNS addresses instead of the public one due to various reasons.\n\nWhy is that?
