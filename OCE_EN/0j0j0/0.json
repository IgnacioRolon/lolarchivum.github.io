No matter what you are going to end up playing sup. Whether in normals because you were beaten in calling a lane or in ranked because you are last pick and no one gives a damn what you call there. \n\nIn my opinion, Gnar is the better pick because of how he can change forms. He can be a slippery bugger when mini or a CC tank when Mega. He fits in a lot of team comps and he is really fun to play.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-26T05:21:53.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's hard to manage that rage though. \nOne moment your chasing a low adc with Ghostblade on then bam!

He can take a punishing and block all forms of spells with his naturally tanky stats and his Unbreakable. The point of Braum, the way to succeed and stomp lane is to apply your stacks primarily on ADCs and Mid-carries. The stun will set up a lot other CC abilities. It's one of his strongest capabilities. \nEven though Braum is tanky he can suffer pretty badly from harass during lane phase unless you are god at dodging every ability. \n{{champion:16}} doesn't really have as much reliable CC or tanky base stats but she makes up for it for probably being the best healer in the game. I don't play her much but from what I've experienced she is a great sustainer for harass. If you manage to land her Q on enemy champions consistently she can sustain herself well as well. She can change can make a 1v1 being in which your ally is losing into an easy win for your ally with her ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-27T13:30:27.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"omfg thats even worse...and you're not even some korean wonderkid you're just some bronze oce kid, i dont want to live on this planet anymore","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-26T07:31:45.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bitesize guide to support\n\nWard: Your blu or red, whatever closer\nPoke: Poke enemy adc and support like hell\n\nBasically your mindset is to keep your carry alive, help secure kills for your carry, and just generally bitching for your carry","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-26T05:23:25.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn how to play support please.
