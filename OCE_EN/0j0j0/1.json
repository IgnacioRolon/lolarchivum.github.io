The second an enemy champion walks into soldier range, right click them until they leave. Farm till mid game. When you get someone low, your all in combo is W (insert more Ws until you have max soldiers, or 1 less than max) Q (preferably so the soldiers stand on the opposite side of a champ), E (try to hit the enemy champion if they're in between you and your soldiers), right click.\n\nW Q E click wait ignite\n\nWhat champs do you normally play anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"0j0j0","date":"2015-09-22T22:24:09.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally i play {{champion:69}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:157}}  and {{champion:238}}  ty for ur help :P","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-23T02:28:11.807+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well pretend Azir is like Zed, except the button to create shadows is separate from the one to teleport to them, and instead of using E for shadow slash, you right click.
