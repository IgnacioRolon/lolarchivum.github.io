Few hours ago, they said its coming \"soon\". 1 region has got solo/duo q ranked so far (Garena?). Other regions have been told it's \"definitely coming in patch 6.22\" (this patch). \n\nWho knows anymore man, it's Riot. Remember last year? Oh solo Q is coming guys, just wait a little longer.... Actually nah, Solo Q isnt coming back.\n\nSame old shit. Just chill in Flex, enjoy the unbalanced, tilted players, and don't forget to buy skins!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-11-16T03:20:54.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they pushed it back. I'm not surprised at all, expected it 100%. Their heads are so far stuck up their asses trying to save flex Queue so it doesn't look like the complete pile of steaming trash that it is, but this is likely gonna be the queue we are slapped with permanantly. They did it last year with dynamic, they **will** do it again with Flex queue this year.              \n\nThey could release Soloq. They have the tools and the resources to get a system up and running that works properly. It's what a majority of players want to happen, but nope. They will make us pry soloq from their cold, dead hands before they dare remove their newborn flex q.         \n\nAt this point I'm just waiting, *waiting* for them to announce tomorrow \"We are gonna delay soloQ by another week, maybe even two, as we try to resolve flex q issues.\" \"planned activation fucking Never you plebs\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T01:15:58.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The reason it was delayed was more than likely due to the issues with Flex, as they had to determine what caused those issues so they could make sure the same didn't happen to solo/duo.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainin","date":"2016-11-16T01:17:58.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo/que will have no placements because it's rank is just the same for preseason from dynamic que. If anything I think they are wanting to confirm more statistics on player base and certain times to prevent long que timers.
