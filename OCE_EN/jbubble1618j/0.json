Nothing appears in my dock and after a while the application closes itself. Ive had this problem for about 5 days now trying to fix it. I decided to reinstall lol, however the website link for downloading the game doesnt work and presents an error webpage. I decided to get the dmg file off one of my friends and downloaded lol. When i try to open it and patch it the same problem occurs and says sometimes that there is an unspecified error. I have already changed my DNS to google but dont know what else i can do to fix this problem...\r\n\r\nSOME ONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"BETALEGEND","date":"2016-06-21T05:32:18.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever find a solution to this problem? \n\nI am currently experiencing the exact same problem. \n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-23T09:40:58.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a connection issue, could you possibly take your Mac to a friends house and try to set it up there?.
