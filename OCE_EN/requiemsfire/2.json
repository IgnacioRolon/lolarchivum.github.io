I mean I could be totally wrong but doing a basic stat comparison like this it just kind of seems a bit unfair. It could be that Sion would be an absolute monster if he could gain any more hp per minion he killed. Sion is also a really strong team fighter compared to kled with plenty of CC and a revenge passive to slaughter anyone after death. But what do you guys reckon?\n","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2016-08-07T12:00:06.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty ridiculous to be honest.\n\nI did know Kled's passive already, but I just read it in different words so your post confused me until about 18 seconds after I posted.\n\nBoy I look stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-07T12:10:16.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an honest mistake. :P\n\nI'll go reword it for extra clarity.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2016-08-07T11:31:35.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unfair to Sion players to be honest. Sure Sion can keep a person from not moving for 5 seconds but he actually has to make an effort to hit his ultimate ability. Kled quite literally has a better version of Sion's ult, only downside being that you can't pick who you want to engage on. I didn't even know about the health gain passive on Kled, that's actually kind of dumb. Sure hope they buff up Sion's beefyness to compensate for having a champion that is better in terms of innate tankyness.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-07T11:36:22.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, for sure.\n\nBasically this is Kled's passive. Kled mounts his steed, Skarl who in turn has a hp bar of his own equal to Kled's. When Kled mounts Skarl, their HP bars are counted as one and the same so essentially double health. When Kled is downed to half health Skarl flees and only returns once you build up enough of a stat called 'courage'. What this  means is that you can also regain half of your health bar back instantly during a fight if you build up courage too.","replies":[]}]}]}
