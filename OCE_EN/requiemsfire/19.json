Why? You may ask and I might seem completely newb myself for saying so, but to me Jhin&#039;s rhythmic nature in both his auto attacks make it easier to understand how to position, how to kite, how to use your abilities effectively for more than just damage alone while also being able to put out a lot of damage. He also is very good at using abilities to set up for allies which I think teaches a lot. \n\n The timing in between his auto attacks allow for more than adequate time to move about thus teaching some very basic fundamentals of being an ADC without pushing yourself to train rigorously. No, he's not a ridiculously easy to use champion like Garen but he's not so difficult that a total newbie wouldn't be able to learn how to utilize him properly. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Was I right in recommending Jhin? Who would you recommend?","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-28T05:04:09.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your suggestion, but I'd suggest {{champion:222}}  or {{champion:22}} , as they're easy to play and, well yeah that's just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-28T05:13:59.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I don't think being easy to play should be the only criteria on which you recommend because sometimes its better to recommend Mundo that Garen. While I understand that Ashe's focus in her kit is generally in kiting due to her slows playing her doesn't really teach you how to kite but you do play her more effectively when you know how to kite.  That it's on a fundamental level that whether win or lose you take something or some kind of knowledge from the experience. \n\nJhin on the other hand feels like he can teach kiting more effectively because well baby steps, his auto attacks have a brief delay in which you generally want to be doing something and that something is generally moving.\n\nMost champions at some level are easy and most ADC's at that point except maybe Lucian and Draven of being considered \"easy\" to play.
