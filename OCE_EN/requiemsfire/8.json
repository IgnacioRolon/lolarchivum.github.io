However they made quite a few mistakes along the way with damage creep, healing creep, tank metas, assassin metas, bruiser meta&#039;s, but finally mobility creep. It&#039;s easy to talk about how these things became excessive overtime and thus other champions who were had either weaker kits or specialized kits were compensated  for it by numbers or small reworks along the way to compete against newer champions. \n\nWhat I think is Riot&#039;s biggest mistake really is trying to not only design a powerful champion that functions well in the gamebut champions who excell at a role. What do I mean? Well if you look at the roster of champions there are plenty of specialised picks like {{champion:31}} who is overall really strong but not quite strong in a meta kind of sense because his kit only works well against certain compositions. For example you might pick {{champion:54}} for a strong engage or {{champion:14}} for his ability to engage the opposing team and control them with his powerful CC but at the same time {{champion:79}} exist to such an extent that the CC in his kit allows him to do all of that to an extent with one of the most powerful CC ults arguably to divide a team comp. He is a well rounded champion who not only does well at being a tank but he is arguably the best tank overall. \n\nI may also bring up the jungle because specialised picks generally get completely shut out at higher levels of play due to that very same trait. {{champion:76}}, {{champion:60}} , {{champion:60}}  and {{champion:203}} for example, at least prior to their major nerfs were able to not only clear their own jungle but literally counter jungle their opponents out of relevance without even having to contest due to their mobility and sustain. It didn&#039;t matter if you could beat them in a one on one fight because they could just shove you into a bankruptcy and destroy you by merely existing if you had slow early clears.  It&#039;s because not only were these champions designed for the jungle but they are too well rounded for their role that they push all competition aside.\n\n\nThis is not to say champions are weaker than others but rather what excel at requires either a composition to be built around it while other champions can be blind picked without thinking about it because they are more of a jack of trades type of champion that can do more overall.
