Cosmic radiance in particular works very well against this kind of initiation. Not necessarily saying Taric toplane against Kled but Taric support would work just as well to provide a strong counter engage against Kled.\n\nEarlier I was playing a game as Taric and I heard Kled's ult sound, rather than try to run or whatever I positioned myself in front of the enemy team. Kled and his whole team was right behind him when they initiated. I quickly ulted, and healed, and used my stun in that small duration while my team quickly advanced in. The rest of their team probably could've realized \"OH SHIT\" but they couldn't really disengage from the fight thanks to {{champion:64}} and {{champion:103}}. They lost 3 members of their team due to Kled's engage and they of course successfully killed me because I was support on minimum wage with only {{item:2303}}, {{item:3110}}, {{item:3105}} and {{item:3047}} but the fact they had engaged like they had and would have to waste even more spells to try and reach my backline made it an easy win teamfight along with the temporary invulnerability of course.

All of these champions are really good at fighting kled so long as they don't fall too far behind and have options to counter his teamenegage if played right. Personally I feel the best of these options is a more tank oriented sion build taking points in w enough to mitigate his bear trap damage and e for lane bullying since if you can pop sion's shield and use it's damage, kled won't be able to fight you and will be forced to just take the lost trade. If kled does go all in, the armour shred, the tankiness, the slow, and aoe stun means that you are likely to outtrade him and once kled is unmounted you're going to kill him. If kled ults you it's not a big deal with your shield and stun and sion ult can create chaos if the entire enemy team charges and then sion crashes directly into the charge using his unstoppable onslaught. Sion is good at forcing people to focus him and kled ult usually breaks up the team formation allowing you to get right into the middle of the enemy team.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-08-26T01:23:55.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=82dnI7bU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-08-25T10:55:11.647+0000)\n>\n> if you want a toplaner who can outtrade kled my suggestions are sion, darius and malphite.
