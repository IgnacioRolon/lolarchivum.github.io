Heart of Gold is a notorious example as an item intended more for supports but became a very prominent item on champions like Udyr.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-16T12:57:39.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to balance supports is to educate new players what the meta is and why it is. Changing items won't essentially change the game. I mean currently there is a thing called 'Healwick' in Korea where Warwick uses windspeakers, runic armour, and redemption and is unkillable. New items can be used by any champion. Or how about Shakarez's tank karma top.\n\nHowever the **role** of support does not change. Perhaps if there were 7 summoners per team, then there would be no need for a support. Perhaps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-11-16T09:01:22.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are right, it may be possible to link gold generating items to a summoner spell, similar to how the jungle items require smite to purchase? Only problem is that they don't have a spell currently that could be used as it already stands. Exhaust would be the closest thing to a standard support spell, but it is not exclusive to support, like smite is to the jungle.\n\nAnother option is that the current gold generating items could give an extra 50 gold for an assist, but none for a kill. That way if you have one of the gold generating support items and get an assist it is still allowing you a better chance of keeping up. If a good support can get 20 assists in a game, this would be 1000 extra gold, which is bringing them that little bit closer to parity.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-16T12:30:39.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally with support items, it will have to be purposely inefficient pure stat wise but have  passive or active favourable to supports in general.
