So I have seen thresh at his best and worst. \n\nIn my opinion, It is impossible to deny, that thresh has a lot more in his kit than many supports.\n\n**When we actually break down what he has:**\nRanged auto attacks\nIndefinitely scaling Armour/AP\n1.5 second stun, (also displaces enemy towards you)\na dash\na shield\nthe ability to pull allies to you \nAuto attack enhancer\nAoE knock back engage \nAoE knock back disengage \n1 second 40% slow\n2 second 99% slow\nzoning tool\nTankiness\n\n**When we break down Nami's kit, we have:**\nRanged Auto attacks\n1.5 second movement speed boost\nAoE 1.5 second stun \nmaximum 2 heals (generous amount of HP returned) (different targets)\n3x 1 second slow \nAoE knockup\nAoE 2-4  second 70% slow\n\n_____\n\nJust looking at the list above, we can see that thresh already has a lot more (in terms of quantity), but there is a difference between quality and quantity.\nLets break down the \"quality\" of their utility:\n\n**Thresh:**\nHalts all movement + actions for 1.5 second. Has delay. (displaces enemy) (Thresh can also displace himself with this ability.)\ninterrupts movement + attacking + channels. Instantly on cast (displaces enemy) Thresh can choose the direction of the displacement.\nslows you for a total of 3 seconds, or zones you. Has delay. (ultimate ability needed)\narea targeted shield (only shields 1), also pulls ally to him. Slight delay.\nis tanky\n\n**Nami:**\nHalts all movement + actions for 1.5 seconds. Has delay. (does not displace enemy) (Nami can not displace herself with this ability)\nInterrupts movement + attacking + channels. Has delay. (does not displace enemy) (ultimate ability needed)\nSlows you for a total of 7 seconds. Has delay.\nHeals maximum of 2 allies. Has delay.\n\nWhen we look at it this way, we can see that their kits have remarkable similarities, however it doesn't mean that they are equal.\nNami slows the enemy for 4 seconds longer than thresh and heals/shields 1 more person, but the price she pays for this extra slow is: \n\nThe inability to displace enemies (twice).\nA dash.\nhaving her knockup on a slow ultimate with a long cooldown, instead of an instant cast normal ability with a shorter cooldown.\nThe ability to displace allies.\nTankiness.\n\nThat is the true difference between Nami and Thresh.\nSo when we look at it that way, thresh does have significantly more than nami (unless you value that extra 4 total seconds of slow more than all that)\nSo it would be safe to say that Thresh is more overloaded than Nami.\n\n__________\n\nHowever! I agree with you in what you are trying to say.\nWhile thresh has a lot more than a lot of supports, that doesn't necessarily make him better. Blitz has less than thresh, he stuns/displaces you for a similar length of time, but lacks all the other utility, but being grabbed by good blitz is usually a death sentence, being grabbed by thresh often isn't (despite his hook ironically actually being called death sentence.)\n\nAlistar is someone who also has on paper significantly less than thresh, but is someone who is (or at least seems to be) far more dangerous. I would wager that being comboed by Alistar leads to more deaths than being comboed by Thresh.\n\nSo while I do (personally) believe that thresh is overloaded. I think his \"overloadedness\" gives him more flexibility with his combo, but not necessarily give him more power. Therefore he can have a very diverse and overloaded kit, while still not being too overbearing as a support.\n\n(Azir for example has tons in his kit, and could be considered overloaded when compared to someone like Brand, but Azir isn't really a problem ATM, when Brand kind of is... Thats my analogy anyway.)\n\nSo while i think its wrong to say \"thresh isn't overloaded\", I also think its wrong to say that \"thresh being overloaded makes him too strong\".\n\nIn saying that however, he does have a 25.5% pick rate, so he is obviously doing SOMETHING better than most other supports. What that 'something' is though, i couldn't say.\n\nSorry for the very long post, but I hope I have helped clarify a few things (at least in the way I see them). Id be interested if you saw it the same way or not? \nIf not, whats your thinking about it? :)\n\n________\n\n**TL;DR:** I think Thresh is overloaded, but being overloaded doesn't make him a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-04T15:07:13.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Auto attack enhancer (Thresh)\n\n>3x 1 second slow (Nami)\n\nI mean Nami's is an auto enhancer, and can be applied to allies.\n\n>In saying that however, he does have a 25.5% pick rate, so he is obviously doing SOMETHING better than most other supports.\n\nI don't think pick rate really means much in terms of anything, especially since Biltz hovers at ~15% pick rate as well.\n\n\nAlso as an aside, i would argue when comparing Thresh to Nami, Nami heal > Thresh Shield in terms of that part, and most of the time Thresh lantern isn't used for both the shield and the Drag, it's used for one or the other.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-04T21:47:56.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True i missed that bit about nami's auto attacks! \n\nI think pick rate does mean more than you think, thresh obviously does something better than other supports (wether its power, or fun, or just the fact that he is an undead grim reaper) otherwise he wouldn't be picked as highly\n\nI guess you are right about Nami's heal being stronger than Thresh's lantern, i think the scaling is probably better on hers as well.\n\nBut what you say about thresh's lantern being used for either the shield or the pull is right though, and thats what I'm trying to say. He has both in his kit, and that makes him overloaded, BUT he doesn't use both at the same time, so his power isn't actually increased as much as it could be.\n\nIts a fine line i guess xD","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-05T08:33:21.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a person who plays Thresh whenever i am supporting, it's mostly just fun.\n\nNot to mention, he is one of those champs who can make flashy plays (read madlife)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-04T11:35:37.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir was a problem though until they gutted his numbers and removed multiple parts of his utility such as seconds on his wall, W damage on towers, raised cooldowns, his knock up was removed, stopped the soldiers from applying fervor of battle, his CDR attack speed scaling, and lowered his soldier's vision and base damage. \n\nHe was a pick or ban because in competitive play he covered every single thing you'd want from a mage.
