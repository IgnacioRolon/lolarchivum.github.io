She is a sustained fighter i mean sustained as in vlad is a extended team fighter meaning he controls the fights and longer fights are good for him this is the same as anivia but she has more damage then vlads and less tanky but she does the same controls the fights and able to get more damage with longer team fights. This change made her less burst and more needing to understand her team fighting potential. i see this nerf has kinda affected her as her other nerfs since she's been popular when Peke played her but she is still going to be the same you just need to understand her more","replies":[{"poster":"Say","date":"2016-11-22T04:40:32.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ive just played against a yasuo and kat\nand i can safely say that there is absolutely no way you can get a E off on them now\nonce in the entire game was i able to proc my E through a full storm\n\nshes now completely obsolete against any champ that has a dash \n\nthe cooldown reduction on E is meaningless, your E was always reliant on Q and R cooldown anyway\n\nanivia cannot be a sustained fighter, if u could move her ult during the fight, sure, but once u walk out of that little circle she's lost her opportunity to do anything","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-22T14:00:55.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now there's no real reason to pick Anivia over Viktor, who has better waveclear, low cooldowns, early laning, better last hitting, reliable at all stages in the game and more burst.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T23:39:57.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"viktor is a bit more bursty of a zoner, aniv is a bit more sustained, as well as the fact that aniv has somewhat of a long range, as well as a cc that doesnt require u bieng in a circle for 1.5 secs,","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-22T23:59:57.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia is very short ranged relative to other mages.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-23T00:01:27.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good perspective, but when i typed it i was only thinking of her Q really XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-22T03:35:21.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe it or not, Anivia can not fight that kind of battle, she has nothing to it, she's about fighting for territory and terrain to control certain zones during team fights. I've played a lot of Anivia to know her strengths and weaknesses. She is pretty much wholely gated by her cooldowns and slow movement speed. Her ultimate has a pretty fair wind up time to deal its maximum damage and even then for it continue to dealing damage the must remain in it. But it has a 6 second cooldown so simply placing it again isn't at option. She is immobile and slow with only one tool to peel for her which is her Q.\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Say","date":"2016-11-22T23:17:14.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played anivia post 6.23\nI think it could work if her E range got buffed \nright now to pull off an R+E u need to wait 1.5sec, so u would need to stay within the E range for a 1.5 sec duration\nthis acts almost like a stun, which is really stupid considering how she is such a fragile champion\nrelying on Q+E the entire game and using R as just a waveclear skill makes no sense \n\ni've had a few occasion whereby i could proc my fully stretched storm on enemy champ just to realise that i was not close enough to hit them with my E, \nif i risked myself to get closer just so i could wait for the 1.5 sec duration i was dead 100% \nif her E range got buffed (instead of the E cd decrease) i think i can live with this nerf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beaunivia","date":"2016-11-22T07:07:16.458+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a sustained fighter she has some long cooldowns on her spells/the lowest base movement speed in the game and the lowest base health in the game.
