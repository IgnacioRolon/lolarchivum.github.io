I love the animations, I love the theme and will be picking it up in the future for sure. Though I feel like his voice is a bit out of place on the skin and that while I understand the difference between a legendary and an epic skin I feel like a different voice filter could completely change the way the skin feels and looks while adding a lot more overall value to the user experience. Not necessarily to change the dialogue or the beautiful animations of course. Just my opinion though.\n\nLet me emphasize again though that this doesn't mean I'm entirely unhappy with the skin because I definitely want to add this to my Varus collection of skins.
