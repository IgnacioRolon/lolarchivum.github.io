I see this on my own team, I see this on opposing teams. It's really frustrating to not only see this on my team but opposing teams as well.  Of course I will always make sure to purchase an item with grevous wounds even if I happen to be support just to make sure I can apply its god damn effects in team fights so that my team has a chance at least :l","replies":[{"poster":"TheOvermind","date":"2016-04-12T07:55:51.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you were in my recent games where my diamond mate Yasuo was fed and I made him unkillable and unescapable as the Zilean Support.
