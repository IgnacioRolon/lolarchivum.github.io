Hopefully though this either speeds up or Ivern will be strong enough to clear camps quickly with his abilities after acquiring a jungle item.  He also creates copies of the brambleback and blue sentinel post level 5 so this could help him a lot. \n\nAlso I think its implied that Ivern can just drop a grove and leave it so this would mean he can just go to his camp, drop a grove, come back and get it. Meaning it would actually be pretty hard to properly counter jungle him or stop him from applying pressure without confronting him directly. \n\n**Early Lane pressure** \nHis Q will definitely create pressure particularly aimed at the top laners who have a ranged basic attack like maybe {{champion:78}}&#039;s passive or {{champion:150}} or the bot lane in general but this seems a tad risky in some instances for the ADC especially but if its a 3v2 there shouldn&#039;t be much case for worry. This will also definitely benefit {{champion:412}} in particular. This is also a root so he can be used in games where laners have a low amount of reliable CC . \n\nAs its implied if he can leave his groves to grow he can gank prematurely at level 2 very effectively and simply come back to claim exp and gold. \n\n\n**Safety**\nHis bush and ability to root with Q gives him a lot of safety from champions with point and click abilities and champions with gap closers. Not to mention sitting in that very bush gives him empowered auto attacks which might grant a temporary window of which to turn the tide on an opponent. However Ivern does not have an ability to use which would grant him an escape. I am also not sure if his E can be applied to himself but on the assumption it also obviously adds to his survivability. We&#039;ll assume he&#039;s not a strong duelist early on when discussing this. \n\n**Snowball potential**\nIvern doesn&#039;t seem like a snowball heavy champion but it seems due to his empowered auto attacks he may be built like a bruiser. Even if that is the case he currently seems reliant on snowballing his allies ( like {{champion:154}}  and {{champion:20}} )like rather than himself due to the nature of his kit built to support his allies.\n\n**Late game presence**\nHis damage may fall of significantly but he may be able to 1v1 any squishy with his ult when built appropriately. His bush would also provide a fair amount of peel for the allies since point and click abilities cannot hit someone you can&#039;t see. His snare would be greatly impactful and as mentioned he would synergise well with bruiser champions who have ranged auto attacks when it comes to team fights. He might also function well as an initiator rather than a backliner. He only has a snare for CC so his presence might be far less impactful than say a Gragas or Malphite depending solely on his numbers.\n\n**Verdict**:\nI think Riot did rather well in creating a new champion with this niche of not killing jungle monsters. The design they opted for was making him a safer pick without the fear of being completely overrun by champions like nidalee and kindred early on through counterjungling.

My assumption is it does nothing, the grove keeps growing until the monster is dead.\nsince it takes 40 seconds for the grove to mature if you find out where an Ivern starts jungling, you can seriously f him up.\nEnemy jungler can simply walk into his jungle and take his monsters and he cant do shit about it since he literally can not auto monsters. Like counter jungle and leave a wolf, raptor etc and he has to wait 40s to collect 1 raptor worth of gold and xp delaying the respawn even longer...\n\nAlso HIS level 1 counter jungling seems broken. \"smiting a grove instantly frees the monsters\"... so i can walk into the enemy jungle level 1 and smite away their blue/red in 1 second? Crazy.\n\nIts a cool idea. Start growing your groves then walk back and \"collect\" them all. But exploitable, so it will be interesting to see how it works out.\n\nHis Q seems like it may become problematic. Great for laning, but situational at other times. ADC flying towards a rooted Amumu and other likely scenarios.\n\nW seems like a cool idea. The passive especially. Making me think he might be a cool Smite top laner. Level 1 steal a buff. Autos become ranged while in a  brush. Interesting.\n\nE. Janna size shield with a more powerful Sion shield explosion.\n\nHis Ult seems like it will be useful but really out of place.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-21T06:51:04.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wel basically he can just walk up to a camp, sacrifice a small portion of his health and mana for each camp, so he could arguably have his entire jungle cleared within 1 minute just by walking to them. Then he just walks up to them to collect them after 40 seconds. If he has placed a grove there's a small opportunity to steal them but for the most part you probably won't be fast enough if he is cautious.\n\nAlso level 1 invading him could be very pointless of a thing for you to do because of how he can instaclear.\n\nHis W is interesting to me because lack of vision counters a number of champions like {{champion:60}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:62}} etc in that their abilities won't function if they can't click on you.
