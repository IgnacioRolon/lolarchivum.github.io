Xin Zhao simply refused to group with us, ignoring the team entirely and even stayed splitpushing, he ignored calls for dragon, he ignored calls for baron when it mattered. What did this do? Well essentially he quietly threw the game away by allowing it to stall out. By simply farming all game when the game should&#039;ve ended giving our enemy time to scale up with trist, Sona, and essentially overpowering us because Xin simply didn&#039;t want to play with the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-10-24T05:24:54.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cant report people being bad.... its just bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T10:58:28.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can empathize with your situation- I've played many a ranked game in my time.

They might be in JG and just want to farm until late game, as they have muted the team (lets assume he did not tell the team his plans or that he is muting them) they wont be able to tell if a team needs help unless he looks at the map. If he does not help and keeps farming would that be considered intentional feeding? \n\nJust asking cause I play JG a lot and I play farm based Jg's like Shyvanna and I often get flamed for not helping the team because I want to farm up and get my items (plus dragons).","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T21:38:28.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you're trying to win, breaking from convention and splitpushing won't get you banned.
