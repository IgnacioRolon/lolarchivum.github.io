Like what if Syndra was to utilize a world rune in order to enhance her power to its very limitations and began to form some sort of cataclysmic storm event as a result. Ryze seeking the world runes would confront syndra lacking the raw power to face her with. However I would figure that Ryze would be more refined as a mage especially with the energies of the world runes flowing through his very body and would be compelled to stop her no matter what. \n\nTo me these two characters relate to each other a lot personality wise.  In terms of ideals they are total opposites. Syndra shuns and destroys any who would try to weaken or bind her powers. Ryze seeks to contain power, hiding the world runes to prevent their misuse. They both killed their former mentors(albeit different reasons) and they&#039;re both very gifted mages. Hell, maybe he'll be forced to use a world rune to combat Syndra against which I imagine is the very last thing he would want to do? Maybe it'll cause a colossal aftermath which devastates a portion of RuneTerra?\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I just a Ryze fan boy?","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-15T06:34:55.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah its interesting actually .. the thing is due to literally less than <5% of the Player base actually care about lore i doubt theyll do anything theres so much they could expand on \n\n They'd rather put their money else where like making better ranked systems or making league more friendlier or listening to their player base .. oh wait *Cough Tencent https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs","replies":[]}]}
