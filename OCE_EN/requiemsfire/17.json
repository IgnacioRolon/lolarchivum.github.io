But I want to tell you, while it might be the reason the game played out the way it did, it was not her fault we lost. At 47 minutes into the game, my team wanted to try for a base rush when the enemy team had elder dragon, baron, several earth dragons when I honestly believe we would&#039;ve won a team fight fairly easily. Me and Taliyah tried to hold them off but ya know quickly overwhelmed and destroyed.  Even if I pushed with my team our DPS wouldn't have held up compared to theirs on towers. \n\nSo I want to put out that even if there&#039;s a feeder, there is still something more you can do in a game and it&#039;s not necessarily always the person who fed&#039;s fault. I want to emphasize that there are more mistakes to be made than just laning phase feeding even if you're at a disadvantage.

If the game played out the way you said it died if taliyah had like 8 or so deaths seems, You'd of won by a landslide and never been in the position to lose most likely >.<","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-29T11:35:49.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See it's not really a sentiment, it's a fact on how things happened. It may have been her fault that the game dragged on the way it did, but it even more of my own teams fault for not realizing the situation we were in when all they did was base rush rather than fight a team fight which would've most likely swung in our favour.\n\nTaliayh was the one supporting me and she did a lot of mistakes early in the laning phase which did cost me considerably early on but you also have to consider the poor judgement of my team was what actually costed the game and not her feeding early on. \n\nIt's too easy blame the feeder for losing the game which really is just playing the blame game and not taking responsibility. \n\nTo put a nice little analogy, this is like seeing your enemy toplaner going 3/0 and then complaining you couldn't 1v1 him and that he's too fed despite his obvious level and gold lead. Yes your toplaner fed three whole kills but it was your fault for not recognizing that.

I played Renekton. and basically only me and the tryndamere were still beleiving we could win, everyone else going at least 2/10 etc. i was going 2/4 so pre badly myself but i was tanking while tryn was doing damage and all of a sudden we had won a teamfight and secured a baron, meaning we could start pushing their towers, take an infernal dragon and reset. Before we knew it we had won another teamfight and another baron was on our hands, we pushed to their nexus towers and it got to the point where they literally couldn't win a teamfight, suprisingly since we were in their position not long before. It just shows that no matter how many deaths you have you can always come back from an \"unwinnable game\" (we did win it btw :P). and i think this post needed to be put out there because there are so many people willing to just go \"oh, 2/10 she must be a feeder gg wp\" however they might have been unlucky etc. Anyways thats all from me. :P","replies":[]}]}
