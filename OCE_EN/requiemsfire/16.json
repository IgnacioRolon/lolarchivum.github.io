To put it simply I&#039;ll add this picture taking directly from champion.gg demonstrating the winrate change from 6.21 to 6.22(pre-season patch). Now I know that a lot of people are now playing Talon to try out the rework and that does affect his win rate but he is not as mechanically complex as Katerina. \n\nIn fact this is true for a lot of the assassins in the rework how their rework has left them without being able to perform despite not having a terribly difficult learning curve. \n\nTalon winrate: [Click here to check his champion.gg page for source](http://champion.gg/champion/Talon)\nhttp://puu.sh/shzyY/ee464b394a.jpg\n\nAkali winrate (secondary assassin example: [Click here to check her champion.gg page for source](http://champion.gg/champion/Akali)\nhttp://puu.sh/shzXX/b97e47f2d5.jpg\n\n\nTheir win rates plummeted. Personally I enjoy Talon, I am a mastery 6 talon so far(not that great) and he is my favourite assassin to play and I will continue to play him despite where his rework put him but I hope Riot recognizes this.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-14T08:33:27.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly there are more complicated issues at play.\n\n1. A lot of the changed assassins have gameplay design that makes their gameplay HARDER (talon having a lack of a way to get into melee range without someone face checking a bush.) but reward them for doing said things.\n2. Everyone is dropped to essentially 0 experience on these champions\n3. Assassin's are very hit and miss in games anyway and have issues with win rates because of this, you either snowball the game, or you lack ways to do things.\n4. Reworks mean a lot of non-experienced players play these champions, with no clue on how to play them, this is different between the mage update and this update due to the difference in why a champion may have a low win rate (Your better having a mage on your team then an assassin.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-11-14T06:27:39.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is most likely more people playing Talon than before the patch was released, so of course his win-rate would go down which is why this stuff is best left to Riot and not people randomly looking at graphs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2016-11-14T05:52:35.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basicly every champion that is newly reworked or made has a low win rate for the first few weeks until one player becomes the \"best x champion\" in challenger. an example of this is with Jhin for the longest time no one knew how to play jhin and didnt rate him at all, but after Cloud 9 Sneaky played only jhin for a week he gave the ideas of how to play jhin properly.\nTalons win rate will most likely go up to 54% and his ban rate would be even higher","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-14T04:57:43.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With talon firstly, they reworked him to give him an e with amazing utility but they still haven't fixed up his kit yet and they basically made a 3 ability assassin into a 2 ability assassin so he's going to need some number buffs and stuff to give him a fair amount of burst as an assassin. Secondly, rengar's winrate probably hasn't dropped... at all and he's pretty broken right now. Thirdly, people still need time to relearn the rework talon since he's probably had one of the most dynamic shifts in gameplay of any of the assassins, so his winrate is going to be pretty low.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep","date":"2016-11-14T04:31:02.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure this is normal. Usually after a champion rework or release, their win rate always plummets as people are getting use to the changes. I'm sure soon his win rate will raise again.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-14T04:33:47.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note in the mage update all the mages winrates either shot up  where as the only one sthat dropped was Swain, Cassiopeia and Vlad. It'll rise by like maybe 2 or 3% but I doubt any more than that especially since the statistics are taken from plat and above.
