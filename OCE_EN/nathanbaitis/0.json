Apparently this is related to Darius&#039;s W but it happens even with it not activated. \r\n\r\nSo what im trying to say is &quot;rito pls fix&quot; otherwise i would appreciate a refund because i can not play up to standard with htis skin equipped.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-27T13:26:55.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There used to be a bug with Champions with empowered auto-attacks (Shyvana's Q for example) where it would chase them, get in attack range then fail to auto-attack and wobble on the spot a bit then continue chasing and continue doing this. Was really annoying. Maybe it's related (they fixed it, not sure if anything was said about it but I think it was a pathing problem and it's probably worth sending in a report ticket about as this usually gets Riot's attention guaranteed and then they could fix it).","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-27T11:14:50.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does he have trouble targeting minions?","replies":[]}]}
