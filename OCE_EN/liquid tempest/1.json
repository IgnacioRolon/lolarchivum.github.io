Pro games? Streamers? Any advice for self-learning? Thank you. \n\nWatching those streamers that play your champions is good, but **watch the whole game** (i.e. after the laning phase ends). If you are serious on improving, check [ArcSeconds sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXpvCxIyFgBAXqmtIPiC0rL5BUmxAR95dLj44upGz_c/edit#gid=0) on all of the things to improve.\n\n> One thing I&#x27;ve been doing for a number of years is using nerfplz.com and &#x27;tier whoring&#x27; as well as using probuilds.net for builds. Do you think this is good?\n\nprobuilds.net is a good site for current meta guides, but try to understand why those players picked the items for the games they played. nerfplz.com may be okish, but a better guide would be to follow LS's tierlist for your level (i.e. don't drop Annie mid!). Reason being that LS understand's the game better than most westerners (and also many Koreans).\n\n> Also, do you think support mains are comparatively on a lower level from other mains which are at their level (please be unbias with this question)? I&#x27;ve noticed that the supports seem to have the worse macro/ mechanics. I can autofill support better than any support i&#x27;ve ever seen (mid gold only).\n\nYes support mains generally have the worst mechanics because they don't practice those. It depends though. If they are on their main champions, their mechanics should be reasonably well practised.\n\nI'll give you the biggest tip though - be humble! Players will make mistakes in games, don't let their mistakes tilt you. Focus on yourself. \n\nJust as a side note, it was disappointing that you didn't want to continue duoing after we had an 8-2 record. It's true, I made some mechanical errors in the Zilean game, but we are all human and won't win every game - It is possible to be versing players that are better than you. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-07-03T02:51:46.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SleazzyJefff,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=8nR5azdJ,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-07-02T23:34:51.348+0000)\n\nBest way to get better if you are new or even experienced. I'm still learning after about 3-4 seasons is just playing the game. Focus on the little things. Watch replays see what you could have done better and learn from that. Pro players have details about the meta and how to play so watching them is the best. Bjergsen / Aphro are the streamers i watch for this kind of stuff. \n\nYes and no. Depends where you are. If you are bronze/silver/gold, you can follow a tier list. Anything above that you generally play 2-3 champions and focus on them, understand the match ups, builds etc. I don't follow any tier list but if you want good champions to climb with tell me your rank and ill tell you the champions right now in the meta.\nChampion.gg and Op.gg are better websites to follow. \n\nHm this is a tough question as a support main. Support can generally be a role where you can be unskilled and do good. You just need to protect your adc/team and just make picks or if you are playing a peel champion like janna/lulu/nami just peel. A good support and exploit a bad support's problems to a win. it's a 50/50 with support role and level of skill. Low elo's also are still learning macro and mechanics so you can find people that will struggle. Even at diamond+ i still see supports that i can exploit their problems to end up winning. \n\nHope this helps. Good luck summoner :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
