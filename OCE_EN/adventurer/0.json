I'm a second year animation university student at UTS and am looking for an opportunity to intern at Riot Games OCE. I've scoured the internet but mainly found information for the headquarters at LA and others instead, nothing for Sydney. I also can't seem to contact the page on facebook through messenger [seems its been de-activated] nor is there an email supplied anywhere for the OCE Riot headquarters. As is, it seems theres nothing going on but it wouldn't hurt to ask!\n\nSo my question is, is there any plans for an internship at the OCE office or some program of the sort?\n\nHope someone sees this!\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-10T02:22:23.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the best of my understanding, only NA does internships.
