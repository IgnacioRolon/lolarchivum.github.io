They hit the news feeds well over a month ago and have been sitting ready since patch 4.21, so what exactly are we waiting for? i heard rumours that they may be next years lunar revel skins which is fine but that's not until coming mid January around, so why have we been told about them so early? i realise that riot are currently doing snow down so they have the winter skins out, but if they weren't going to release these skins for over 2 months why bother getting people hyped up about them this early especially when some of us are more interested in blood moon skins than any of the Winter skins for this year?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-23T06:12:25.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says in the patch notes:\nthese skins will be released at various times in patch 4.21\nand below it it has all the snowdown and bloodmoon skins\nso unless this one patch continues for another month its probably not lunar revel. but again i dunno how the patching system works in the pre-season but it seems unlikely to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-23T07:00:05.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
