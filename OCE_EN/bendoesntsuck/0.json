Before I&#039;m branded as absolutely retarded, I just want to say that I have searched up fixes and solutions on the web, and also employed the help of said friend for a couple hours only to find no leads as to why the Patcher Kernel isn&#039;t working.  \n\nIn the League of Legends folder, there are: RADS, lol.launcher.admin, and lol.launcher . \nIn the RADS folder, there is: projects, solutions(empty), system, temp, rads_user_kernel, and several logs under the same name\n(i.e rads_user_kernel.log1, 2, etc)\n\nEDIT: Yes, I have tried running as admin, ticked admin box for patcher, and have ran in compatibility mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:32:20.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bendoesntsuck,\n\nSometimes, transferring files from one computer to another may cause problems. Can you try running a clean re-install of League of Legends and let me know whether it works once you've done that?","replies":[]}]}
