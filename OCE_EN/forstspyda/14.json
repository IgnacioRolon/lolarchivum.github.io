The reform card you are given contains only your own text, because that is what you are responsible for.\n\nIf someone is being toxic in chat and you want to respond negatively to it, just mute them. Starting an argument will not help anyone, and you become a problem to everyone else just as much as the first person. In Riot's words; \n\n> Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game. If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/203066050-Tribunal-FAQ#h1q2\n\nExcept in extreme cases, it takes many reports before you ever get punished. While the game(s) in your reform card may have triggered your punishment, there would've been many more that contributed. Punishment is now dealt in 4 tiers, in order;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nKeep in mind that severity of the offense is less important than the consistency of the offending behavior. That means that enough minor infractions, however small, may eventually result in your next punishment. Remember this next time you want to retaliate instead of just mute and play your game, because it can eventually add up to much more severe punishments (it takes 3 months for the punishment tier to drop *one*).\n\nIf you want to share your reform card to ask opinions of what you did wrong and how you could improve so this doesn't happen again, feel free.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hinokio","date":"2015-12-27T03:41:34.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report the player or take screenshots and submit a ticket to [riot support] (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)","replies":[]}]}
