Negatively impacting the ADC slightly while gaining a huge advantage for other team members though ganks etc is more than worth it for your team overall. Come mid-game there's even more stuff to do on the map, and following the ADC around mindlessly is usually the mark of a bad support, not a good one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-30T10:41:21.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Support should SUPPORT you, it is not rocket science, really. Stop fucking taking CS, stop taking kills, stop being a turd muncher and actually support the person in lane.\n\nToo many times I see the 'support' picked by someone like Talon, completely useless. I see plenty who just sit there and wait for a kill to happen so they can steal it, yes I have seen 'supports' with the lowest damage done, taken AND most kills, like when Kat goes support. I have seen WAY too many who just pick whatever because they didn't get the lane they wanted, they choose NO support items, don't even get a single ward, never do anything to help, just look out for themselves and only attack if they can either won't take damage or get an easy kill.\n\nReally, you take someone with CC, heals, lane sustain, something that actually either supports you directly, indirectly, or disrupts the enemy. Annie support, MF support, those types CAN work, but someone like Blitz, Ali, Thresh, Voli and the like is much better, you can not only CC the enemy, but charge in like a dickhead and survive long enough for your team mate to get some damage done.\n\nTL;DR - SUPPORT YOUR ADC YOU ****HEADS AND STOP PICKING SOME SHIT JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET THE LANE YOU WANTED!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-30T14:41:33.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i do support properly ;-; what did i do wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zombienoobs123","date":"2015-12-29T01:20:07.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of agree, I main support and its a well known fact that ADCs are NOTHING without there support, supports are there to set up kills, keep there ADC alive but not get honoured / appreciated for there work, if a support is not willing to support there adc in early games, then they are an obvious troll, if someone reports you nothing bad will happen, Riot will look over the problem and ignore it as its unfair.
