Its legit. Like a slightly worse version of Annie support.\nI can tell you that almost any champion can play support if you understand what your role is.\n\nHell Ashe support is legit now that she has a free perma-slow and global ward.\n\nThe taking cs thing is about the player, not the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-13T00:40:01.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Ashe support is great. Was even better pre-rework, i played her SO much.\nAnyhow:\nIf your pick has high damage rather than high utility, it'll be great in the early/mid game, but generally speaking, even if you take CS and scale nicely, the team will feel the loss of utility near mid/late game.\n\nIt's pretty much the reason the support/jungle meta was born in the first place. Lategame scales better with utility than with raw damage (or, as in the old words, \"CC wins fights. Damage merely ends them\")","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-12T05:52:32.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the role your picking for is support, ideally all what the support does keeps adc alive. you can play any champ you like as a support doesnt have to be a supportive champ as long as you play it really well and do your required job. To answer your quest you should have a sightstone cause you dnt have to buy wards but if you want a slot free upgrade your warding trinket but till than you will have to buy wards and after you upgrade your trinket you should always carry a pink with you as  it acts as a sweeping lens and your trinket as a sightstone, lets you build full damage and be a support. And lastly only take minons say if its 100g you need before you back if its more you rather wait it out or improvise, cause any more cs than that would be better on your laners. your not a laner since your playing support. (side note if you ever find yourself split pushing as a support that means you have abandoned your team)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-12T05:19:15.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) Xerath has a stun.\nB) that's not being a support, that's being an APC in bot lane.","replies":[]}]}
