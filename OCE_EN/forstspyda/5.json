You should've received an email in regards to your ban which should include a link to your reform card/a copy of the offending chats.\n\nIf you _were_ banned for toxic behaviour and are unsure of why, you should consider making a post in the [Player Behaviour board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour) and including a link to your reform card for our friendly team of Emissaries to take a look at :).\n\nIf you were banned for another reason and/or didn't receive an email regarding your ban please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support for further assistance.","replies":[]}]}
