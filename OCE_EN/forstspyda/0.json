Think through the conversation and reflect on your words. League is an intense, competitive game, but every player deserves respect. Read more about the effort to encourage sportsmanlike play, here.\n\nHere are some chat logs that w ere identified as negative by other players in the community.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nno\nty\ngj\n1 minute\nwtf\nno\ni cant gank with out mana so we lose\nmy clears will be slow too so i will fall behind in xp\nur an idiot\nff 20 btw nubs\nnot guna even try now\ndont care u fuked me\nwell enjoy loseing cause u stole my blue\ndouble buff for ashe\ngj nami\nzero map awareness team\nff soon\ngo back to school kids\nive said 2 things the report will show nithing    _**( from here on in the game the harrasment got worse) wheres there chat?!?!?!?!?!?!?**_\n\n6.5 minutes surrender\nreport tahm stal my blue all the time\nban tahm from now on i hate that swallow whit\nsaays the 4-7 nub that nees a carry\nbut ur so trash\nshut up nub we lose cause ur trash\nsupport top works so well doesnt it ?\nim out\nfuk this tahm\nhes a %%% troll fuk\ngg ez win nub top and mid\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis type of behavior is unacceptable in this community. When there is nothing good to say, don&#039;t say anything at all. As a community, we also don&#039;t believe that retaliation is an appropriate response, so in cases where there is retaliation, both players receive penalties. This is the only warning this account will receive. Further examples of toxic behavior can result in permanent closure of your account.\n\nSo Wheres the rest of the chat all the stuff they said ?  and WTF your jokeing these players !#!@$!@!@!   \n\nall game since the first blue he stole my buff slowed my clears and harrased me i want to see the rest of the game chat wat a load of trash you goto be f*ken joken right!","replies":[{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2016-02-19T21:09:16.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh ok but wheres the rest of the chat log seriously tired of trolls and abusive players and then i have been through the other 3 tiers but i still see players that are far worse then me.  broken system is broken, and forever more will be!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2016-02-19T02:23:24.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ForStSpyda,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=j1A7EdpN,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-19T00:28:45.570+0000)\n> This type of behavior is unacceptable in this community.

Further examples of toxic behavior can result in permanent closure of your account.\n\nAs stated in the email you received (outlined in my quote) retaliation is not an appropriate response. When they look at your reports, they will look at you as an individual and your individual behaviour within the game, hence why you only get your chat log. As it stands, your behaviour (regardless of what the other players have said or done) is not acceptable.\n\nThey will also be up on the block and will be punished for their actions, but just because they said or did something bad, does not give you right to retaliate with these kinds of responses. In the heat of a game, it could be very difficult to ignore toxic players, but in the future do mute them and use the reporting functions so they get punished for their behaviour.\n\nDefinitely take this as a learning experience, as it is your last warning, any further punishments will result in a permanent ban as per the 4 tier punishment system;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-02-23T02:31:29.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"First of all, it's really good that you are posting here to try and understand why this is happening.\n\nAs Lemon Hunter mentioned, you will only receive your own chat in the logs that you were sent.\n\nIn the case of the chat log you have linked, you're verbally abusing your team mates and the other logs you were sent will also show this.

Not a single court of law would condemn a person based on their actions alone without consideration for circumstances.  At the very least it's unethical for your company to do that.\n\nOn top of that, your system is fundamentally flawed.  Is it OK to abuse someone?  No, it's not, but your system encourages trolling through _behaviour_.  As it stands someone can knowingly troll your game and take your jungle, push your lane, auto attack minions, buy ridiculous items, suicide to buffs, build AP Riven etc etc etc - and all of those things are perfectly fine as long as they don't say a word, because as long as they're not abusive in chat, their behaviour is perfectly fine in the current system.\n\nI have to say, also, that you're teaching millions of people how to incorrectly deal with difficult circumstances in real life.  There is no report function in real life, there is no mute in real life, there is no attempting to permanently ban people from real life (unless you get a restraining order or something, but even then, people who get permanently banned in-game just make new accounts anyway, so it doesn't work), so what exactly are you teaching all of these kids who play your game when it comes to conflict resolution?  Absolutely nothing.\n\n I have as much of an issue with douchebags and abusive people in games as the next person, but your system is fundamentally flawed, and permanently banning people achieves nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2016-02-24T17:25:32.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"nice to see an intelligent person on these forums\n\nthis reminds me of high school, where teachers/staff decided to take the approach of punishing the victim of bullying because they retaliated in some way and regurgitated the same kind of response you're seeing from riot employees and their helpers on this post. thing is, the bullies themselves rarely got punished themselves. why? because they would gang up on the victim when it came to making reports. same shit happens here.","replies":[{"poster":"Quavelix","date":"2016-02-24T23:18:57.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lebron Games,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=j1A7EdpN,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2016-02-24T17:25:32.124+0000)\n>\n> nice to see an intelligent person on these forums\n> \n> this reminds me of high school, where teachers/staff decided to take the approach of punishing the victim of bullying because they retaliated in some way and regurgitated the same kind of response you're seeing from riot employees and their helpers on this post. thing is, the bullies themselves rarely got punished themselves. **why? because they would gang up on the victim when it came to making reports. same shit happens here.**\n\nIt absolutely does and I've witnessed it countless, countless times playing this game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-19T08:57:29.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As LemonHunter and DTN have said, the official stance is that regardless of reason that kind of behaviour is unacceptable.
