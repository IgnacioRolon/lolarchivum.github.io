I mean like ... how in any way is that even remotely good?? sure passive move speed .. you have to get up to level 12 before you are even faster than tier 2 boots (provided you don't want the swifties of mobility boots) and you can't get the magic pen or any other buff.. I don't think it that bad really .. after all it does open up another item slot for more AP, and some would argue that cass don't even need boots because she can just sit at the back line and poison people .. but still I would like to see that passive move speed increased a little maybe even to like 5 per level would be nice. As passives go its just not that great.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-14T04:32:19.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive looks like \"you get movespeed.. eventually\"\nWhat it really is, is \" You get to 6 item builds instead of 5+boots\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-05-11T14:32:26.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6.10 notes from ff@20\n\n    Cassiopeia \n\n    \"Cassiopeia's update shaved a little too much power off of Twin Fang.
