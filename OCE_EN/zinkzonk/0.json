I&#039;m bronze 5 AF and get placed against a team of 2 platinums and a silver... with a full bronze team, 3 times in a row. Fuck that off, how is that supposed to be fun for anyone?\r\n\r\nPlease unbreak matchmaking","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-12-08T11:29:00.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranking (MMR) system is different between ques:\n\n* Summoners Rift - Normal blind pick\n* Summoners Rift - Ranked Solo/Duo Draft pick\n* Summoners Rift - Ranked Flex Draft pick\n* Howling Abyss - ARAM Normal All Random\n* Twisted Treeline - Ranked Draft Pick\n\nAnd you can have a different rank for each que. For example: \n\nIn SR - Normal blind pick I could be diamond MMR (I say Diamond because, I pre-made with challengers and diamonds and they carried me a lot)\nWhilst in SR - Ranked Solo/duo I'm Silver 1\nand in SR - Ranked flex I'm Bronze 4 (cause i used this to group with my bronze friends thankyou riot)\n\nSo whilst Twisted Treeline - Ranked Draft pick is complete 'shitty matchmaking' mixing you with bronze teams against diamonds it's because, the MMR isn't set in TT - Ranked. So it's going to be garbage for about a week or two. Whilst it sets Summoners where they should be at. Based on their performance. SO expect shit Match making for a week or 2.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-09T01:27:56.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> expect shit Match making for a week or 2.\n\nI'd say probably expect sh!tty matchmaking for a bit longer, probably a month *at least*, given the queue is (currently) only available for 10 hours once a week. It will take heaps of games for people to start getting where they should be, even after the high ELO players get to their respective ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-09T02:36:35.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probs based of normal TT mmr, but I agree that 2 weeks is a bit generous.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-08T23:20:18.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate their solo queue rank means nothing in TT ranked. \n\nFuck i wish people would use their brains before crying about this same \"issue\" time and time again...","replies":[{"poster":"JogadorJNC","date":"2017-04-29T00:12:26.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, i guess you are right, it makes total sense that someone who is platinum in summoner's rift would be bronze 5 in tt, it's not like the mechanics are EXACTLY the same, and the game knowledge is almost the same, nah.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-08T13:31:04.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what do expect when fuckall people would be queing for it. do you want to wait a millions years.","replies":[]}]}
