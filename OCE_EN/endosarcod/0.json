Skype/TS) from your phone","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys,\r\n\r\nOne day I got sick and tired of always alt-tabbing to adjust the Skype/Teamspeak sound volume in Windows' sound mixer, either the game is too loud, or a friend I'm speaking with is inaudible, and then I created this app. Now I adjust volumes of any applications running on my PC while staying in the game, no more wasting time / taking risk minimizing lol.\r\n\r\nBonus: If you use Teamspeak, you can even set the volumes of each user in your channel independently!\r\n\r\nAll in all, you can have Windows' sound mixer on your smartphone. Just plug your charger and put your phone next to your keyboard!\r\n\r\nCheck out my website for more info! http://www.remoteappvolume.com\r\nOr if you want, here is the google market link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alban.remoteappvolume\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to report any issues/opinions/improvements!\r\n\r\nI hope you will find it useful! Happy mixing!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-07T05:32:58.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a) this looks like bull%%%%.\nb) 21 day free trial, for something no one would pay for.","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-07T07:51:02.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=w8ZWktW0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-07T05:32:58.710+0000)\n>\n> a) this looks like bull%%%%.\n> b) 21 day free trial, for something no one would pay for.\n\nUh just saying, assuming it works properly and doesn't cause any issues (all of which you can determine with the free trial) it's easily worth 99 cents\n\nor you could make your own if you're too much of a cheapskate, oh wait you don't know how so you're just putting him down for no reason.\n\n--------------------\n\n@OP I don't own or want to own a smartphone, but if I did I would probably use this.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-07T07:57:54.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to the play store for a second which he linked.\n\nnotice how it want's an IP address and password.\n\nYeah that's called bull%%%%.\n\nIt's most likely some program designed to hack %%%%.\n\nAnd regardless it's a useless program, you should have your volumes pre-adjusted, for crap like this.","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-03-07T08:08:29.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=w8ZWktW0,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-07T07:57:54.000+0000)\n>\n> Go to the play store for a second which he linked.\n> \n> notice how it want's an IP address and password.\n> \n> Yeah that's called bull%%%%.\n> \n> It's most likely some program designed to hack %%%%.\n> \n> And regardless it's a useless program, you should have your volumes pre-adjusted, for crap like this.\n\nright, your phone is totally going to automagically connect to your computer without an IP address. It can totally do that.\n\nJust because you or I have no use for it, does not make it a useless program. Whether there are enough people who consider it useful enough to actually get any money at all from it, is another matter.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-07T08:17:03.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause you know, it's not possible to have a computer connected to a phone at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2015-03-07T07:55:14.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My phones never charged so I'll stick with what I got","replies":[]}]}]}]}
