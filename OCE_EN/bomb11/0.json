(Opinion)","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello everyone, I am bomb11 I have returned to league of legends a few days ago after not playing it for about a year.\r\nnow as you may all know league of legends is a very competetive game and therefore there is the ranked mode where you queue up and play with 9 other players and prove your skill level by being placed in divisions like: Bronze, Silver, Gold etc.\r\nnow with all my respect to the league of legends team I am sorry to say there is completly no point in placment matches.\r\nPlacment matches are SUPPOSE to place you in a division you have achived through wins, the higher wins you have the better divsion you&#039;ll get.\r\nHowever, there are more stuff being taken into account, your MMR, your KDA and many more\r\nHOWEVER, for some reason another thing who is being taken an account is your rank last season.\r\nnow keep in mind as I said I have played this game before, climbing through the ranks is part of the Ranked mode and I am aware for that.\r\nI won 7 games and lost 3 games in my placment matches, sounds not too bad am I right?\r\nI got placed in Bronze lll which is the 3rd most worst rank in the game.\r\nnow I dont mind the rank, I will climb it up and prove my worthy of a higher rank.\r\nhowever for other players this is very frustating as they dont have as much time to play the game in order to climb ranks as fast as they could if they had the time and therefore having this kind of system just isnt healthy.\r\n\r\nmy question to you is:\r\nWhy is the system ranks us this way?\r\nAny suggetions for improving this one?\r\nFor me, I would remove completly the way the system takes into account your rank last season, what was last season stays in last season.","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-09T17:32:46.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you mean, my dude. I played ranked for the first time in season 4, then didn't get placed in season 5. In season 6, I was placed in b5 even though I won 6 of my placement games. It's very frustrating, but it's just the way the system works. Overhauling the system would be very difficult and expensive for Riot.\n\nI doubt Riot would be willing to do much at the moment.","replies":[]}]}
