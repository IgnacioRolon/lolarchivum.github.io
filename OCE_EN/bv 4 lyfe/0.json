Just a couple of lines that stand out. And that is enough to get an account perma banned. \n\nI think you missed a rather large point there. If we're getting technical it's more than a couple, but it's not just about the explicit lines of chat, but also the atmosphere they create. I also said quite clearly that a log this is unlikely to get an account punished on it's own, but would require significant negative history to have accumulated.\n\n>Yes the log is unedited. Why would I edit it?\n\nWhether or not you did, I should think the reasons would be obvious and that some scepticism is understandable.\n\n>I have put in two tickets so far, and so far have received two canned responses. \n\nLike I said, if you ask simple questions you will get simple answers. They use macros yes, they don't have all that much time to address each ticket, so if they check and a punishment is valid, they aren't going to spend much more time on that appeal. If you want more info reply to the ticket (don't create a new one) and ask for context.\n\n>It seems they don't actually have a look at the logs. Just go by the fact that other people reported you.\n\nYes they look at the logs, they also look at your prior offences and any supporting chat logs leading up to your punishment. Sometimes punishments are a result of many cumulative small offences rather than one or two severe ones. The reform cards can't display more than 3 games and as far as I know have a time limit on them as well, so sometimes the reform card alone doesn't paint the full picture.\n\n>The system is open to abuse. Troll a game, see if anyone bites, like I did, then get you and your mates to report them. Bam you just instabanned someones account.\n\nClearly you have no qualms about being an ass in game, so it shouldn't really surprise you when that comes back to bite you. Retaliation is a no go, as you are responsible for *your* behaviour, and furthering the negative experience created by another player is just as bad as starting it in the first place. In your case the punishment is more than likely linked to *consistency*, not *severity*.\n\n>Yes about 3 months ago I did get a 14 day ban, but nothing since then.\n\nWith time *and* good behaviour your punishment tier drops, but even if you don't display behaviour severe enough to see punishment, negative behaviour will still prevent your punishment tier from dropping.\n\n>I have seen much much worse behavior than mine in games.\n\nYour are responsible for your behaviour, not the behaviour of others.\n\n>It seems Riot doesn't care about behavior in games. Just chat logs. \n\nGameplay offences are harder to confirm (intent feeding vs a bad game and such), so they take longer to punish. This doesn't mean they aren't punished, nor does it mean chat offences should be ignored int he meantime.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-24T05:54:20.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Awwww!
