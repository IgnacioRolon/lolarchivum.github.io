This allows other players to gang up on a player that has done nothing wrong. One player has a bad game, or points out that we are losing because of an afk, or people inting. The other players report him, and he gets punished, not because he did anything wrong, but because the other players didn&#039;t like him.\r\n\r\nI guess this is League of Legends way of keeping staff costs low. Just have auto reporting. But it can also end up punishing innocent players. Just because their team mates are in a group, and all decide to report them.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2018-09-23T09:24:57.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system doesn't ban based on how many of the team reported you, fortunately. When someone reports you in the the game (for chat offenses, for example), the system will review your chat logs for that game and determine what to do based on the severity and frequency of your behavior. Whether 1 report or 9, the system runs this check exactly the same and it's always run; in this way nobody can \"gang up\" to influence the system to falsely punish someone.\n\nI highly recommend sharing your chat logs (assuming this was for a chat offense) so that we can review them with you and try to help determine what the system issued the punishment for. For all I know it could've falsely flagged something, just drop them here and be open to discussing them so we can try to clear things up and work towards a solution so we can all enjoy the game :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-23T08:55:26.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are so cherry-picking facts.
