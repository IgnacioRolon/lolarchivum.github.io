I know i was not the model player and i had some issues and that cost me a lot. This is something out of my hands. How can i be banned when i haven&#039;t even logged into the game for months!\r\nPlease help me out here.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Energia April 22, 2016 08:23\r\n\r\nHello Man,\r\n\r\nYour account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\r\n\r\nOCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\r\n\r\nWe won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nEnergia\r\nRiot Player Support\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Man Mode April 22, 2016 11:01\r\n\r\nHi Energia\r\nI didn&#039;t know there are third party programs that can be used in League of legends. The last time i logged into my account was around Dec 2015. Despite the fact that i spent hundreds of dollars on my account, i can&#039;t be responsible for something i have not done. I didn&#039;t even receive an Email from Riot regarding this suspension. Please help me out on this as i certainly believe i am unfairly punished, otherwise I&#039;d like to thank Riot for the past 6 years as this would be the end of my journey with them.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nafter many back and forth email replies\r\n\r\n Broken Blade Wednesday at 03:16\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry that I had to be the bearer of bad news, but all of the context regarding your suspension has been fully explained. We stand firm on our decision and we consider this matter closed.\r\n\r\nBroken Blade\r\nRiot Player Support\r\nPlayer Behavior and Game\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Apparently i used some sort of exploit while i was &quot;offline&quot; which makes total sense. \r\nThis is not a cry out for help, just informing you guys on how i was treated as a valued customer**","replies":[{"poster":"LeeSinuous","date":"2016-04-29T12:38:53.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come on now dude. Perma banning players is the last thing Rito wants to do. They are a business. They make money off you playing the game. Think about the logic here. This isn't some random 12 year old administrating the worlds largest online game. \n\nYou used some sort of cheat and you just need to accept that you did wrong. No point arguing the matter, or crying out for help. \n\nAnd just to add they know where your account is being logged on and whenand what IP and ISP etc etc...\n\nGood luck, maybe you can try CSGO, but they also perma ban for hacks.
