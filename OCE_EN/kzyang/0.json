So recently, I made it to Gold 5. But ever since I haven&#039;t really found a way to keep going. I was wondering whether settling in at Gold 5 is something to be proud of or whether I should feel ashamed because I can&#039;t climb any further. What are your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-07-07T01:55:30.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on oce.op.gg, you are in the top 25.79% of all OCE players.\nCongratulations.

It's up to you how you take it. \n\nFirst of all, you should be proud that not only you've reached Gold but that you've smashed your personal best (congratz btw). I personally find that there's a point in every season I get carried away after climbing a bunch of ranks and I either get stuck or get demoted (which is the state I'm in right now). All you can do is take a step back and try to ground yourself before figuring out what you need to improve on in order to get to that next division and the one after. If it happens it happens, but if it doesn't just chalk it up to a learning experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-08T01:34:18.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel pissed, because you stepped into an even worse level of bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-07T23:24:35.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see no reason not to be proud of being in gold 5.
