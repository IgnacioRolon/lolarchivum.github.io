UNTIL my most recent ARAM game........I was the ONLY human player in the entire game of 10......the other 9 were bots......what the hell Riot? I don&#039;t play league to play with bots, I play league to play with other human players. So what is going on? Because that WAS THE MOST BORING game I have EVER played!!!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-24T09:59:52.821+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, there are a fair few bots in low level games and arams.
