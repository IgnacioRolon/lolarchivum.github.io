I seriously hope this is a temporary gimmick for the bilge water event....","replies":[{"poster":"Dr0pbear","date":"2015-07-23T05:17:36.026+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, sadly my first game in patch 5.14 May be my last league game ever. It was offensive to my eyes. It's not that its ugly, it's that the HUD was as unfamiliar to me as DOTA. Changing the HUD in such a dramatic way in one foul swoop was a bold move, not one that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the way it looked, my eyes knew where to look. I just don't think I could be bothered to put that much effort into retraining myself for such a silly change. There goes hundreds of dollars in RP. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2015-07-23T08:37:11.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much how I feel. A new UI, in a game where we're constantly trying to improve our mechanics and such all the time is made so much more annoying/harder/etc.. unnecassarily by having to also now re-train my eyes to look at different parts of the screen. I can't even get used to where to look for gold, so i'm never \"conscious\" of the state of my gold and when i'm ready to back for items.\n\nIt's pretty much a new game with a new UI, and i've got no interest in being a team player when I have to learn all that crap again. Almost throwing a XBox controller at us and telling us to play with that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bravo Bird","date":"2015-07-23T04:46:04.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"ikr....at least give us an option to choose..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-23T09:41:49.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hoes aint loyal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Primal Moz","date":"2015-07-23T07:27:57.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dam them and trying to change things they will never get 100% of users happy lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2015-07-23T07:24:58.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate it when they move things around as seconds counts in this game and we spent so much time getting used to the old visuals","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-23T04:30:34.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally i like the new hud, i just have to get used to it.","replies":[]}]}
