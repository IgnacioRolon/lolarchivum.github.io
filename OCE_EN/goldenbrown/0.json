In the very unlikely event that's what triggered the ban, it would more than likely be a \"false positive\", which you could appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option).\n\nHonestly, I'd be more inclined to think that there's some other reason as to why you were banned, possibly a chat-related offence (most common reason when people come onto the boards). Other than the reform card which you should have received in the client (which *should* have contained a reason for the ban and any relevant supporting evidence), you should also have received an email regarding the ban which should also provide an explanation. If, for some reason, these provide you with little (or nothing) regarding the ban, you can submit a ticket to Support (link above, use same option, probably start with this) to request that information.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-30T08:35:38.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it's important to point out the distinction. You were not punished for what the Tahm did, you were punished for what you did. Your reform card will have given you specifics. If you've received a permanent suspension for behaviour you've had at least a 14 day ban (and likely two chat restrictions) prior to this punishment. The 14 day reform card clearly states that any further offences will result in permanent suspension of the account.\n\nDefending yourself is not the same as firing back, and you clearly crossed that line if you are facing punishment, though if you want community feedback specific to your behaviour you'll have to post your chat logs. Your best course of action would have been to ignore the Tahm and report him in post game. If you really couldn't stand him, you would have honestly been better off afking. \n\nIf the Tahm was as bad as you say, your chances of winning were low anyway, and you would have only been risking a LeaverBuster timer and not a permanent suspension. If the TGahm was as bad as you say, then I don't think anyone would particularly begrudge you the leave for long, instead of adding toxic chat to the mix and making everything that much worse.\n\n\n>[WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT?](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7)\n\n>Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nIn light of this is you still wish to appeal your punishment you can do so through support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nUnless you ask detailed questions your first response will likely be a simple yes the punishment will remain, or something's not right we'll look into it. If you want more context than that just reply to the ticket, but support's decision is final in this matter.","replies":[]}]}
