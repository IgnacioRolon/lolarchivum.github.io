I know majority of people will say that remake is great since no one wants to sit through a 5v4 and I&#039;ll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but get rid of the stupid fucking remake option. I just started up a ranked game, got into loading screen and out of nowhere, power outage. The game was remade and I lost LP for something COMPLETELY out of my control. Before anyone says, fix your issues before you play, there&#039;s no way I could&#039;ve known that my power could&#039;ve cut out, plus most dc&#039;s at the beginning of the game aren&#039;t because of internet issues, but rather random bugsplats that once again are out of control. \r\n\r\nSo please, either get rid of remake, or remove the punishments for being a &quot;leaver&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-24T23:34:14.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, power outages occur rather less than people being disconnected by the Riot client itself after a front page update.

Even if you do return, you have still put your team at a disadvantage they do not deserve. \n\nSure it sucks losing LP for something out of your control, but you know what sucks more? Losing LP for something out of your control AND having to sit through an entire game to get there. \n\nIf you only have the occasional snag then the remake system isn't going to make any negative difference to you in the long run, it's a single lost game of LP maybe one or twice a season. That's nothing. On the flipside, it's going to protect you from the \"my internet died\" and the \"I got called away\" and the \"I didn't dedicate 5 minutes to this game nevermind an hour\" and all those other games ruined by an early AFK, which MORE than makes up for one or two games lost LP to a remake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-25T02:02:17.238+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So the 9 other people in the game have to sit through a 5v4 because your power went out?
