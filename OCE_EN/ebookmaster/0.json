After pressing the &#039;Launch&#039; button, it appears grey, where I am unable to do anything. I am not sure if there is a fix to this solution but I am not keen on reinstalling due to my Internet speed. Also, this has happened to several of my friends who have Windows 10.\r\n\r\nI have tried:\r\n\r\nDisabling my firewall, antivirus, etc.\r\nRunning League of Legends as Administrator.\r\nUsing the horribly broken &#039;Repair Tool&#039;.

I contacted support and got linked fixes that don't work. I have reinstalled twice and it works only the first time I run the game. On the second launch it greys out and becomes unusable until I reinstall it. I have tried reinstalling without antivirus and firewall off also, along with the administrator option.
