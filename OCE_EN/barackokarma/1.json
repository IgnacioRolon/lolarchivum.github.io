These monsters would be on both sides of the map and replace the dumb altars. They would grant a buff that lasts the whole game and with every kill of the monster (respawns every 3 minutes) your team gets a large buff. It would stack and grant things like health regen Gold income ad ap etc. How many you kill differentiates the team and if one team kills the other&#039;s monster the tides would turn as they would have 1 level of buff above them.\r\n\r\n2: a redesign of what the map looks like. With the map being a duo lane still but the lanes diverting outwards till the edge of the map. Vilemore is placed in the centre of the map and is easier to kill, he gives players double their current buff for a short period plus a poison attack on there basic attack. \r\n\r\nJust a few tweeks and this map WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER pls rito give us a new map, summoners is getting boring","replies":[]}
