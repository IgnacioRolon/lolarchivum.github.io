Anywho I just got my first job and I&#039;m going to be buying a Desktop to play League on as the one I am currently using isn&#039;t mine and doesn&#039;t run too great.  I&#039;d like to be able to run League on the highest settings while having youtube playing in the background (dual monitors) I just got NBN so i&#039;d love to use my net as it&#039;s $100 a month.  Without the cost of the monitors/mouse/keyboard what could I pick up for about 500-700 that has the power to run dual monitors with LOL open efficiently. It doesn&#039;t have to be amazing just enough to do those two things without overheating,crashing or  giving me FPS issues in teamfights, as an Ahri main (lmao ikr my name) I Can&#039;t afford to h ave any FPS issues or i&#039;l get locked down and rekt. {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T11:24:29.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Without the cost of the monitors/mouse/keyboard what could I pick up for about 500-700 that has the power to run dual monitors with LOL open efficiently.\n\nLiterally anything that isn't pre-built. I built my system for around $700, including monitor, speakers, mouse and keyboard, and I'm able to use dual monitors with one on Youtube streaming video and the other playing League on max. settings with no FPS drop. While recording.\n\nIt's mainly going to boil down to your graphics card. I suggest greater than the 600 series by Nvidia or something recent from AMD (sorry I can't be too specific about it, I'm not familiar with AMD). Try to avoid having an integrated graphics driver, like Intel tries to do. Intel's processor's are great, though.\n\nIf you want to buy a pre-built computer that's capable of that, though, you'll probably have to dip in a bit more money. Try around a thousand.\n\nUnless you do the smart thing: buy a pre-built computer and then install your own graphics card. ;)","replies":[]}]}
