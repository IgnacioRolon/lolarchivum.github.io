This Hut is a humble yet peculiar hut, It has a Slanted roof covered in snow and a large chimney with which smoke bellows from showing signs of life inside the Hut, The yellow glow of candles Piercing through the frosted windows illuminating the snow out front of the Hut, A strong Wooden door with a large iron lock protects the inside from the freljordian winds, the snow leading to the Hut has very few signs of movement other than the tracks of the few animals hardy enough to survive the freezing temperatures of the north. Inside the hut is a warm, welcoming decor with a brick fireplace with a roaring fire sending smoke up the chimney, The fur of white bear rests in front of it. A large well constructed table sits on top of the bear rug with a detailed box that has old writing no longer legible.\r\nThe door creaks open with a hooded figure covered in snow steps inside the hut, The hooded figure walks over to the table flipping his hood back revealing the face of a scarred feline creature, and in a deep voice the creature laughs and says &quot;My finest prey and they&#039;ll never know where it went.&quot;, he opens the detailed box revealing a black cigar. \r\n:^)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first time i have submitted one of my stories online pls go easy on my spelling/punctuation :)\r\n\r\n(Ploz give graves his cigar back)","replies":[]}
