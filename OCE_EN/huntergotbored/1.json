My client takes a long time to get to the post-game stats screen. It&#039;s tolerable, i just go to youtube for a bit. Problem being i miss the ONLY chance to honor. Why can&#039;t i honor my team like i have done for the last 4 years of this game? Why is there a time limit on honoring?\r\n\r\n2. Why only one per person? What if i want to thanks everybody? What if many players did well in different areas?\r\n\r\nApart for that it&#039;s ok. Thanks for reading - HunteRgotbored","replies":[]}
