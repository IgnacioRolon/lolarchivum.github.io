It seems like a fun mechanic but dickheads and other toxic&#039;s are able to eat and throw at the enemy every few seconds. Squishy carries, low health teammates, everyone. Just NOM, deliver, dead. Can we have an option to refuse Tahm&#039;s, *cough* &quot;help&quot;, if we know he&#039;s just going to dick us over? \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re about to ask, yes i did just get out of a game where an &quot;ally&quot; Tahm just carried us to death.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-17T23:15:26.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly one of the purposes of tahm's devour is to suddenly save a low hp teammate from death by eating them immediately before an ez or jinx ult gets them or by pulling them instantly from the bowels of a team fight. if you had to give consent to be swallowed there wouldn't be time to be saved before you got hit, maybe you'd have enough time for a karthus ult but not and ezreal or jinx one. Also the only way to give consent would be to click on him like threshes lantern or kalista's black spear, and have you ever tried clicking on the lantern mid team fight with 9 other people standing on it? its too hard, not to mention that tahm would have to be still for the duration of the'consent giving' period, so you'd both end up dead and frustrated most likely.\n\nimagine if you had to give consent to every allied ability that might affect you in some way, consent to give bard before he ults, consent for Azir before he shoves the whole enemy team into your face, consent to blitzcrank before he pulls their fed Yi into range of you, consent to anivia before she walls you off in the jungle, consent to jarvan before he traps you in the middle of their team. its just not practical is it, its a team game and that means you have to sometimes rely on choices that your teammates make, and yes sometimes they make wrong ones, but so do you, are you going to tell me that you have never caused a teammates death?\n\nalso you do realise that you have the choice to exit whenever you want? so its not like he can grab you and run halfway into heir base or anything, \nand his ult is a choice, if you jump blindly in and end up in their fountain, thats your fault for not paying attention. \nalso he cant devour you if you're recalling or channeling your ultimate, or teleporting or whatever to disrupt it like Anivia and Trundle can.\n\nAnd trolls exist, and they will exist whether champs that have the ability to troll do or not, would you rather miss out on champs like tahm and anivia and bard because of that small chance that someone might troll you at some point?","replies":[{"poster":"HunteRgotbored","date":"2015-07-19T11:16:56.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few points to address. \n\nYes, Tahm's Devour is entirely a save from skill shots and a beautiful engage for 2 tanks. \n\nYou are correct, having to give consent during a cluster-fuck teamfight would be impossible. \n\nTrue, allied abilities can affect me to, but they are designed against an ally, not for the team.\n\nAfter Tahm eats an ally there is a 1 second \"lockout\" where neither of us can exit, and this particular Tahm would throw us over a wall / into an enemy / away from buffs the very half second it was available. \n\nHis ult wasn't the problem, it's the 8 second CD Eat, run away, throw. away from jungle camps, away from farm, over walls. He would follow someone and generally be a dick every 8 or so seconds. No-one had the moves peed to get away because of his yellow Nike's\n\nFinally, yes. This is League of Legends, the not Dota MOBA. I would gladly lose a few champs to be absolutely certain that dickheads don't even have to option to screw over their OWN TEAM because of a stolen kill / stolen farm / stolen lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-17T13:13:44.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a similar experience.\n\nI went {{champion:101}} \n\nI poke the support and ADC to both critical HP, while Tahm tanks most of the hits and gets to a similarly low HP. I'm still at full. The ADC is still walking back to tower. They're Thresh and Sivir\n\nTahm eats me and spits me right in melee range and Thresh pulls me under tower with his hook. Sivir gets a double kill.\n\nGG\n\nRito, it's bad enough you let a ghost (who's actually pretty ugly IMO) shove her black spear down our throats without our consent. Now you let a fish monster stick stoned people {{champion:101}}  down their throats.
