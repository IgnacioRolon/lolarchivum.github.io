If an account is permabanned, then the naming and shaming only serves to create and hold grudges, which negatively affects those players who have them.\n\nIt can be argued there are positives to naming and shaming, but they do not align with the purpose of the punishment system, nor do they outweigh the negatives.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
