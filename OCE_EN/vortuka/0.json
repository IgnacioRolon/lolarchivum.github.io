That said, I don't believe there's any indication anywhere of when during patch 9.13 TFT will actually become available. It might be available as soon as the server is back up, or Riot might intend to sync up the release time with other servers, in which case we'll have to wait longer, possibly a couple of days or so. Might be more information regarding it's release date/time once the patch goes live, if it's not already available at that point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-06-25T09:00:20.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Idc about TFT, I just want to play Sivir 2.0.\n\nWatch her not be available until Thursday.","replies":[]}]}
