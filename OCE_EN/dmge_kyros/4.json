I was up against one, and he was just outright unbalanced with the new masteries.  His q is really annoying and with the &quot;heal every 4 whatever&quot; mastery he doesnt ever lose health, as soon as I burst him to half way he just regains it all with his cleaver shit, I also beat a mundo with riven one other game but as soon as late game started he could 1v5 and no one could do anything about it? Even the new items dont seem to work against him...\r\nanyways people pls teach me and not scold me for being a noob because im still learning bout the game. \r\n:^-)","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-28T15:45:21.991+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get Mortal Reminder.\n\nOh look you've won.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-29T05:13:30.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was gonna write that...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-28T19:17:35.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SammyTheDeadRat","date":"2015-12-01T11:10:25.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One does not simply win against mundo\n\n{{champion:420}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-28T14:40:08.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ignite, grievous wounds would be a start to reduce the healing. Just play passive and farm until late game. Percent health damage champs are good, as well as blade of the ruined king. Your adc should be able to kill him no problem as long as you can peel enough.

There is no step two.\n\nBut seriously just find a champ that your ok with that does well against him early. My personal favorite is Jayce but I would recommend trying trundle. Another strat would be to pick someone that can impact the rest of the map early and still do ok vs him in lane like Lissandra. Also vayne adc gives 0 f's about mundo.","replies":[]}]}
