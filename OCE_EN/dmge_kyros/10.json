All my friends from school are bad and i just want to rank solo without having to see the same club names in champion select ever so often. I do not have the synergy or the communication to be able to communicate with the premades making things really unfair since they would ussually have a jungle to gank often and I cant call for backup because my side is ussually always camping his mate down at his lane. They are also usually very toxic towards me and choose the most non meta picks (ie jg renek) and there is nothing i can really do but dodge. However this is just my opinion so don&#039;t say that i&#039;m bad and all and carry harder etc, i just would want solo queue back for having a less fustrating time playing and knowing i wont be wombo combo&#039;d by some fellows with the same club name.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-16T22:01:31.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like people are just using Dynamic Queue as a scapegoat this season for their complaints in ranked.\n\nToxicity, jungler ignoring top and non-meta troll picks, aren't issues that suddenly appeared with Dynamic Queue.

It mainly changed the meaning of ranked and ruined high elo match-making.
