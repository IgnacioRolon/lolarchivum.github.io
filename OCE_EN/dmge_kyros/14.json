I know how to control the lane, freeze hardpush etc, waveclear during enemy baron, ward, roam teamfight/ position and peeling and i know matchups well. The only thing i blame my team on is . Not warding enough( in baron pits, dragons, jungle entrances) and fighting while we are behind or when they have a baron up, its very fustrating to try to talk them into listening and soon after we end up losing the game because of one of these things. Should I change my lane in order to carry harder/ champion? or what am I missing in terms of game knowledge?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-09-17T04:34:14.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Allow me to help as a Top lane main! I main Riven and she is hard to use because she is very mechanical and you need to understand every matchup. Practice Riven in norms as well as your animation cancelling. In regards to top lane in general. I highly suggest you try the new Yorick! You can't go wrong with him. Just make sure you ware the tri brush always and after every 2 cs for example take a quick look at the minimap. See whats going on. If your're a Malphite it doesn't hurt to roam at 6 to mid with your ult. Only if you are losing lane do the scuttle or roam mid. If you have a hunch on where the enemy jgler is top side, go there and who knows you could get a kill :) When the wave pushes over half way on your side last hit always (freeze) dont let minions get to the tower or your freezing is ruined, so tank the next wave just above your tower so that the tower doesn't it :) capitalize on the enemy cooldowns so that the enemy knows ur smart. The more you capitalize on their cooldowns, flash and tp aswell, you will win lane and get fed. Call your jgler if you are losing. Keep an eye for objectives, if you kill top, try and get the rift herald. So beast on riven and whoever is good with basic attacks in top lane. If they have baron, tell your team to play safe and let them come to you. Let them waste baron. I know you know how to freeze and all that but I am just elaborating to help you. maybe you learnt something new :) You can carry from every lane. You need to play really well in order to do so. For example if I am fed as Riven, all i have to do is do the flash mechanic in teamfights and then thats game. Just keep practicing the champs you like playing in top lane, understand the matchups and you will win if you keep doing this. if you die first in top lane, your mentality has to change, be careful unless you know how to kill him or call the jgler, if you do get the kill, keep being aggressive. Try Yorick and Fiora aswell they carry really well as well as GP and Riven. I personally don't like playing tanks. I like tanky dps like Yorick or Darius. I hope this helps! Need anything else, don't be shy and say it! I am here to help :)","replies":[{"poster":"DMGE Kyros","date":"2016-09-17T06:31:58.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what can you do if your wave is pushed all the way to their tower? im scared i will miss cs if i stay back and if i come in close the jungler will always gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-09-17T07:14:20.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure I said this before, try and roam, get the scuttle crab, if you know the enemy jg is at red or wraiths, kill him. do something if he freezes for example. you are malphite lvl 6 and his freezing the lane, take that opportunity to roam mid, your ult is perfect to roam with. just like how mid roams to bot. Be productive dynamic toplaner :) always ward the tri brush and the brush where the river is. After 2-3 cs, keep looking at the minimap so you can make opportunities :) if I pushed the wave all the way up I just take scuttle and come back to lane but sometimes i know where the enemy jgler is so I go and kill him. And last hit as much as possible :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-17T06:50:13.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"deep wards. That way you can still last hit under their tower, and know if a gank is coming. When you see the enemy jg on one of your deep wards, back off. simple as that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
