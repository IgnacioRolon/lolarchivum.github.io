Because kindred was made for jungling their kit is far too good for laning phase. Kindred adc is fine but for top and mid lane it is so hard to deal with. \r\nFirst off Kindred has got massive range and kitability, her autos alone do to much damage because of the mark, but as soon as you go in to initiate the q will make you chase her to the very end of the minion wave, soon after you use your combos on her she get a really bullshit heal from the wolf and in turn the wolf will aggro you to shit then comes another source of damage from the E where it slows you to crap where you cant move as kindred is firing her arrows, wolf is eating you and the 3 hit bs slow that will chunk the shit out of you. Also the fukin wolf range is alone stupid.\r\nThis isn&#039;t fair to many laners and is really bs. Kindred also has the broken heal that comes up every 5 seconds with her passive which is annoying enough and when you get that tiny chance to finally kill her with ur jungle she fukin ults out, it is so hard for me to deal with kindreds in lane and IMO i think kindred needs to get nerfed when people use her to lane. KIndred is basically a BARD/KALISTA/CHO GATH/VAYNE thats been merged into one fukin champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-01T10:36:11.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not even level 30, go learn how to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DMGE Kyros","date":"2015-11-01T10:59:07.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i already know how to play the game, im asking how to deal with this problem not if I know how to play the fukin game","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-01T12:17:16.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's pretty obvious since you're not even level 30, and have no concept of what CC is nor counter play that you don't know how to play the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-01T08:43:48.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lane kindred may have a strong early phase, but late game she doesn't get as fed as Jungle Kindred, as lane kindred can only reliably get stacks off of one person, where as lane kindred can reliably get stacks off 5, and jungle camps.","replies":[{"poster":"DMGE Kyros","date":"2015-11-01T10:59:29.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true that, I've won some kindred matchups after that but like do i focus more on farming or staying alive?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-01T11:57:33.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play like every other marksman.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-01T09:45:36.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could say what everyone else says to assist with any matchup.
