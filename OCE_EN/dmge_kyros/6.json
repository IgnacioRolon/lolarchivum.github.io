This is because real players punish him before he gets items, especially if hes in the support role. Tell your jungler to gank him if hes mid or top and building AP. Slow as heck, easy kills, rinse and repeat, take his tower, snowball game.\nI had to laugh - recently had an AP Malphite top in my team vs enemy Ekko and they didn't punish him, so he went something like 15-2-15, low elo in a nutshell really.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-13T03:24:27.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}}  is like other mana champs, if not used properly he will become mana hungry so he will either need to back out for mana which u will need to get every farm to be ahead of him and get either zhonyas {{item:3157}} or Maw {{item:3156}}  or if he stays in lane mana hungry then abuse him and make sure your in too deep unless your warded.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-12T10:51:36.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Whenever i find myself against a Malphite, im usually quite happy as all of my top laners hard counter Malphite. The top laners i main include {{champion:420}}  {{champion:122}} {{champion:58}}  These champs all excel against low mobility champs like malphite and so i find him quite an easy matchup. Malphite is quite slow, so try to only last hit,not push up the wave so your jungler can jump in for an easy gank. {{item:3102}}  is a good item as its passive blocks one of his abilities, other items include {{item:3026}}  and {{item:3065}}  for some heavy mr.

Try to bully him pre-6 to reduce his potential in mid game. If he's using ult to kill in lane, then that denies his team a lot of map pressure - he can't TP+Ult gank bot lane so look to make plays for your team that way instead.\nIf he's building AP, you should be able to beat him late game if he isn't too far ahead as he'll be squishy (and if he's building tank, his late game damage is minimal and most ADCs can kill him easily enough). Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
