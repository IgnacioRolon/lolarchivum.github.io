I dont know if hes just super fed but it doesnt seem fair for anyone to solo basically rape everything and regening to full health in 2 hits everytime.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-13T14:18:22.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about Xin Zhao being OP, but Thresh is going to be quite strong with the wind speakers blessing mastery (Cunning Tech level6)","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-13T16:27:22.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really lol he has no heals for allies and his shiel is only from possibly face of the mountain and definitely from Lantern but that's not huge at all lol. It's not really spammable either so the 15% resistance bonus isn't that great. Are you sure you mean wind speakers blessing?\n\nIt's more for Lulu, Janna (insane heal and shield there) and Soraka (Bs heal) plus bard benefits from it a bit, as does Taric and Sona but Soraka and Janna are probably the 2 strongest.\n\nBond of stone is better for tank supports so Thresh, Braum and maybe even Bard if you're playing him tanky wise and not taking the heal tree and opting for utility/AP but opting for an in your face tanky bard playing aggressive.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-13T22:26:52.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes okay after doing some self research I have realized that your idea is better and I thank you for telling me this.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-14T00:06:12.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol you're welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-14T03:34:12.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-14T03:33:49.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grievous Wounds/AS Reduction/Hard CC","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-14T01:44:51.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin with some AP and AS items has always been able to kill towers without minions and lifesteal like crazy on stuff like baron.
