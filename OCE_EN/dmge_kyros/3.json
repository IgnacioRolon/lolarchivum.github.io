It really needs a nerf because of how much damage you can output onto your enemy or an enemy can put onto you, basically another auto attack once your whole combo has been completed or if you miss an ability during your combo can act as a substitute ability. 30% of your ad + 10% of your ap and another 10 damage is quite a lot compared too the other masteries available.\r\n\r\nChampions with fast spamable abilities make use of it really well, for an example champions like rlucian, zed , lux, and many more do too much damage without even doing much. Half your health will be gone because of the thunderlords proc and its just a  matter of who auto attacks faster. Champions with high auto attacks or cancels abuse this since the damage counts as abilities or auto attacks you can do, for an example Lucian can just q auto auto = 3 and that would activate the passive quite easily, other champions with bursty combos will do extra damage and nuke health really fast( Zed, lb, brand, and many other mages) they can do this at a range and deal crazy amounts of damage, especially lux brand who can just Stun and auto then half your health is gone. Assassins can also use this to their advantage from the one shot combos they can do( rengar, Khazix, talon, riven, eve, yas) and it adds too their high enough burst. \r\n\r\nRiot really needs to change how this mastery works imo because it is used too much and because the other masteries have turned to shit and are practically unmatched compared too thunderlords. The damage it provides(30%, 10%) is crazy and the rate that champions can activate it is quite annoying(every 3 abilities/attacks). Other than being really strong and too crzy for a mastery it is really fun to use for champions that need that extra damage but it is too strong for other champions that already have enough damage. \r\n\r\ntl;dr- too strong with burst, spamable, nerf times and damage\r\nTHx for reading my essay ppl","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2015-12-26T11:19:28.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"But lux and zed require you to actually hit the skillshot lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-26T21:22:36.305+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are two of the most spammable champs, if you miss the skillshot you get another go in 0.0000001 seconds anyway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-27T02:56:30.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, just need to buff everything else I reckon hey","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-29T15:16:37.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are buffing everything else","replies":[{"poster":"Jimbob","date":"2015-12-29T16:40:41.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP tanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DMGE Kyros","date":"2015-12-29T04:34:31.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would work, but the meta would become a fucking overkill nuke meta","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-29T08:59:08.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or not just straight up buff everything to Thunderlord's power.
