His damage output is at its highest when his hp is down  , thats when you want to exhaust him. these are the only things you can do if he is a problem and getting fed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-10-11T09:12:02.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"play malphite and win lol!\n\nany tank champs will rekt tyrn\n\nvolibear\nsej\nmalphite\nrenekton","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-12T00:01:25.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"until he buys the last whisper and bork","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-12T00:41:44.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yep lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-10-11T11:52:24.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Predict when Tryndamere will cast his W and turn to face him or just learn how to kite.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-11T11:58:40.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"his w stops kite lol","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-10-11T22:38:52.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've timed it perfectly once, the trynd got pissed that i didn't slow xD\n\nBut your prediction timing has to be on time, I mean, you dont really have time to think really.\nSo kite to him / look in his direction / click in his direction to not get cc'd by his W","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-11T22:56:06.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3153}} slows and 90% of builds on trind get it","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-10-12T00:48:20.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ik, so u play smart then, dont engage him under their turret, dont push far.\nOh and if they tower dive you, then play keep away with him until their ulti wares off :P\nBe a champion that has cc, that'll help you out alot","replies":[{"poster":"Winston Wolf","date":"2016-01-13T11:20:53.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zen Bot,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=gMQiy4yv,comment-id=00050000000000000000,timestamp=2015-10-12T00:48:20.693+0000)\n>\n> ik, so u play smart then, dont engage him under their turret, dont push far.\n> Oh and if they tower dive you, then play keep away with him until their ulti wares off :P\n> Be a champion that has cc, that'll help you out alot\n\nBe blue ezreal\nQ tryndamere\nWhile Q is midair tryndamere spins and hits takes off half your health\nBlink away\nTrynamere activates his free aoe exhaust\nHis slow beats yours\n2 seconds have passed and his spin is back up. \nYou lose.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-12T23:48:38.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Move quick {{champion:17}} (Also blind)\n\nLightning Rush {{champion:85}} (Also lots of CC, strong early game and can make plays while Trynd is a farmer and will probably not be able to do much while you Kennen port and ulti a whole team plus your Lightning Rush gives you stats and range is good against him plus if he melee forms it's easy to land an E-Q-W).\n\nEat fruit {{champion:41}} (Also ranged harass and strong melee'ing with barrels and a nice ultimate that punishes commits or tower dives along with a nice movespeed boost from Trial by Fire.\n\nLeap and poke and heal plus a bit of burst and you can jump in then back out and also move decently fast in brush plus you can jump then flash etc. {{champion:76}} \n\n{{summoner:3}}  Exhaust is nice too.\n\nAnyway those are voyboys top counterpicks to him - sometimes you can't do much about him though but exhaust is generally great seeing as he has to E in and deal damage quickly to be useful and exhausting him can shut down his DPS a lot and then he usually has to over-commit to do his job or even hurt people - couple this with a bit of CC seeing as his damage was halfed by the exhaust and your support can exhaust him again and he can get shut down hard.\n\nTPs pretty safe too but I prefer exhaust unless I can out-range him a lot - Ignites sorta bad because it's basically useless post 6 and all you're doing is hoping he cant smash you with ulti (I mean not many people can sit and fight him for the full duration and then chase him down after ults down and the heal isn't that significant plus during laning phase - it's a consistent heal in most cases so ignite doesn't do much against it and shutting his damage down by 40% and slowing him works pretty well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-10-12T10:07:18.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst him down.
