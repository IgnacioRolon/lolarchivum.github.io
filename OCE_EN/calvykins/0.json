Will changing ISP help at all?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-31T02:00:43.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you look at changing ISPs, the first step will be to try and rule out your home network as the source of the packet loss.\n\n* Do you connect to PC your router via Wifi (this is often a common cause of packet loss)?\n* Is anything else using your internet connection at the same time?  Eg. youtube / torrents etc?  Try performing an isolation test where ONLY your computer is on the network.\n* Try running a traceroute to our game servers - (103.240.227.254).  _It won't connect to the final destination, but will show you the quality of the path from you to the servers._\n\nIf you can confirm that the ISP is the source of the issues, then I'd say that it would be worth switching.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
