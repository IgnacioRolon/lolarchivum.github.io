When I try to download LoL through the launcher, it always gets stuck at the last 274mb. I leave it for days, and it says it&#039;s downloading at 1kbs. The rest of the files download in approximately 30 minutes. I&#039;ve started from scratch multiple times, with P2P on and off, but there&#039;s no change. \r\n\r\nI found a full download of the files from Garena (or something), but the game is infected with useless middleware garbage. Anyone know of a solution, or a place to download the game without having to use the launcher? I&#039;d rather not go to a torrent.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-14T09:25:27.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. You can't torrent League's data because League is constantly evolving and changing its database. Anything you get would be severely outdated, as well as having a different MD5 tag (though I'm not sure that League uses such technologies to check local data, otherwise we'd have far less people complaining about glitchy clients).\n\n2. You can transfer League from one computer that has it properly installed to another. You don't have to go to the internet, just go to a friend's house or something.\n\nHave you tried refreshing your connection while downloading? ie. disconnect your internet source when it stops downloading and then reconnect it. Sometimes that fixes it. If it doesn't, head over to [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues) and try out what it suggests.","replies":[]}]}
