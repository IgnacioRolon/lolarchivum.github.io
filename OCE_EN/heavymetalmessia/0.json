I never rage at anyone especially if they&#039;re having a bad day or bad game (would prefer to help them instead), and don&#039;t care much about winning (winning is nice of course but whatever). It&#039;s fine if we lose if the match itself was good i.e. we gave each other a run for the money.\r\n\r\nIm pretty bad and haven&#039;t played in a while. I had an account on NA but missed the free transfer so I guess would be playing on a new account here. It would be nice to get better, but it&#039;s not important if the game itself is fun. I only really play Bruiser types (the most fun class for me I guess?)\r\n\r\nAnyone with a similar mindset interested in playing with me? Also I don&#039;t mind at all people trying weird builds or strategies or anything, it actually makes things more fun I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Jusoraas","date":"2015-05-26T13:32:43.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I'm a newish League player looking for friendly people to play with too so feel free to send me a friend request. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyss Persephone","date":"2015-05-24T07:18:42.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm keen as a bean :D I shall add you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-05-23T10:32:45.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!
