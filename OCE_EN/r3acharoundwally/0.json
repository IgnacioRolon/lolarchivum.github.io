I don&#039;t like using his death as a means of guilting or getting something I want, but i feel it&#039;s appropriate to mention for the context of my request, which is in two parts.\r\n\r\nFirst; is there any way I could somehow grab ownership of his account? The idea of watching his account fade into obscurity hurts, a lot . Being able to play his account will give me some sort of feeling that he&#039;s still around, a way I could feel closer to him again.\r\n\r\nSecond, which is a stretch, i know; but is there anyway i could merge my account with his? I&#039;ve invested over 4000 hours into my account and i have no intent on playing it again if i had his account.\r\n\r\nI understand if this request is impossible, there&#039;s no way of knowing if I&#039;m telling the truth or if I&#039;m trying to scam a free account, but it would mean the world to me.","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-24T04:33:14.864+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My condolences. Sadly, I don't think there is any way to merge your account to his, but I'm not sure about the 'getting ownership' part of his account, but I'm sure Riot are able to work something out for you. Best thing you can do is send a support ticket to Riot and wait to hear back from them. I'm sorry about your brother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adelê","date":"2016-11-24T06:56:05.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May he rest in peace, I'm so sorry for your loss. \n\nOwnership can possibly work just like any other non-gaming company - for example, for bank accounts, etc, don't you just need like a death certificate to certify their passing to gain access? I mean, something along those lines, I don't really have much experience to the situation but yeah. I mean giving Riot maybe some sort of proof would be sufficient enough, surely? \n\nAnd maybe there is an easier option - do you know his email password? Seems like you'd be hacking, but yeah... \n\nLook I don't know, just throwing ideas out. But once again, so sorry :(","replies":[{"poster":"R3achAroundWally","date":"2016-11-25T02:32:10.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I think my best bet is to lodge a ticket and go from there :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-24T08:56:43.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really sorry to hear that man. Damn... I don't know what to say. \nAnyway, if you you know the email he used for the account you can use that to retrieve password, otherwise, you can go send riot a support ticket","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-11-24T07:07:25.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have access to said email it is linked to you should be able to either go forgotten password or ask riot, to get access to said email you will need to contact the provider and have a death cert to prove that A. your story is true and B. you are kin","replies":[]},{"poster":"R3achAroundWally","date":"2016-11-24T06:48:20.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comments @nochillgamer and @kenyans. Yeah I knew it was a bit of a stretch for the merge, but maybe I could try and ticket for ownership, hopefully this would qualify as a special case. I don't think I could guess his password however, it could be anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-11-24T04:37:27.907+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"sorry bud, but riot is a bunch of spineless money grubbers, anything that gets you free stuff(even if it wasnt technically free) they will never accept, i have myself sent tickets for far less than that about things i have actually paid for/earned, and they are just super rude and uncaring, its what you have to expect from people like that, however you should try getting his passwords on your own through history searches/guessing and take it over","replies":[]}]}
