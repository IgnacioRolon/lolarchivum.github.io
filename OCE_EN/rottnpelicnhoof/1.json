Now, OP - you might have a lot going for you, you might  actually be a decent guy in real life.\nJust understand that the more you pursue this kind of behavior, the more repulsive you may find yourself becoming in the eyes of the people whom you end up surrounding yourself with in the future.\nYou might see this all as just some harmless form of entertainment, but in all honesty, i don't think you've considered the implications of behaving in such a way.\n1. you're causing emotional stress for this person ( which doesn't need to happen in the first place ).\n2. you're shaping a path for yourself ( no matter how you see it ).\nIt's pretty typical for young people to assume that just because it's the internet, they can do whatever they want without having to feel any form of consequence.\nTruth is, you're allowing yourself to behave in a way which is socially unacceptable. Now, why is this a bad thing? well, one simple answer - this type of behaviour leads to ostracism.\n -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndefine ostracism: \n\nexclusion, by general consent, from social acceptance, privileges, friendship, etc. \n\nIt sounds like you're still pretty young, so there's a lot you don't quite understand yet.\nDoesn't mean it's too late.\n\nAdvice:\nDon't delete this forum post just because people are being hard on you.\nTake in as much of it as you can, so you can feel the disagreement.\nLearn from your mistakes, and try to become a better person ( for your own sake before others ).\nGoodluck mate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-01-11T15:24:29.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in just to downvote.
