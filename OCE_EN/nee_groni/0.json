I&#039;m not trying to get my LPQ lifted, as you state that is not possible. But im not sure why I receive this after one leave? Surely the leniency should reset after playing 20 or so games without leaving/afk-ing? Like I havent left a game for a long time now, I should not be put on a 20 minute LPQ for one leave... Its an hour and 40 minutes, its so ridiculously harsh. Like if i picked up the game in a year, and had to afk once, am i receiving the same penalties? Does it reset every season? I believe it should reset based on a good behaviour bond type situation. A season for a reset is far too long, especially for people who play very often. Very frustrating )-:&lt; On a side note, the times i afk&#039;d earlier in the season was due to having inters and feeders down in Silver. Not to mention the Silver players that deny an ff because they think they can win, when we are down 20 kills and have taken no towers... This needs to be fixed. This wait time only tilts people and makes them want to throw and int the second something goes wrong in their game following a LPQ. \r\n\r\nSo what im suggesting is this. After being placed in LPQ. If you successfully finish 20 games without leaving / afking, your low priority queue timer should either reset back to five minutes, or to what it intially starts as, with the 1-2 game leniency, followed by 5-&gt;10-&gt;20 minutes LPQ times.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-07T12:03:48.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unlikely you would have received an LPQ for one instance of leaving, with a possible exception if it was a more serious instance that occurred in Ranked (ranked is weighed a bit differently because of the competitive nature of the queue). Though you wont be able to get the LPQ removed (as you already know), you can pursue the issue with [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (I'd recommend the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) asking for more information on what caused LeaverBuster to act in this case.\n\nAs for what happens going forward, you'll need to play out the LPQ (however long that takes) and continue to play in order to bring your account back to a neutral standing. Over time your standing with the system will improve and you'll be dropped back through the tiers, so long as you don't leave/afk often enough for LeaverBuster to act. One thing to note is that if you don't play your account's standing wont improve. Time is an important factor, but so is activity and consistency, so you couldn't (for example) play on an alternate account, or not play LoL at all, and just wait out the \"risk\" of a higher tier punishment.","replies":[]}]}
