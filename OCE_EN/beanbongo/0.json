Why is solo que still not fixed and the game is over 10 years old. I don't understand why or how. \nI need the community and riot games to explain this shit. Why am I gold 4 in solo que ranked getting 2 unranked accounts, 1 of which has never won a ranked game in their promo, a bronze 2 that has 38% winrate and a silver 2.\n\nMEANWHILE on the other team there is a silver 4, 3,1 and Gold 4, 3 which both have above 50% winrate. WHAT IS THIS I NEED ANSWERS.  \nCheck the imgur link for the screenshot of my games ranks according to op.gg and one player who SHOULD NOT BE IN MY TEAM IN MY RANKED GAME.\nI literally lost from champ select. Like the game is over how am I suppose to play this game if this happens?","replies":[{"poster":"Sakio","date":"2020-01-21T17:39:55.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi BeanBongo,\n\nI understand you're frustrated by how the season has gone for you so far and are unhappy with the matchmaking. I want to reassure you when I say that it is working as intended.\n\nWithout sounding like a jerk, if you focus on what you can change instead of things you can't change you may see yourself winning some more games. You'll find that you will lose a lot of games until matchmaking has put you in a division where you belong and from there it's up to you to improve.\n\nI'm not arguing that from time to time you will have one, or maybe even several \"unwinnable\" games due to matchmaking or poor team-mates. But overall the system works and you'll find that almost every game is winnable if you focus.\n\nTo reassure you I'll link an imgur screenshot of my own which shows myself winning upwards of 30 games in a row only losing 1 games out of 50 played.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3IBZnCe\n\n-Sakio\n{{champion:203}}","replies":[]}]}
