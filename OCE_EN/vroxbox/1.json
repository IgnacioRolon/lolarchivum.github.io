Since you adamantly say you are a Riven main and would have carried, any reason for not saying anything? I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this one.\n\nIn the second example though, you start calling player 2 stupid. Well then I wouldnt be surprised if that makes them trolling more likely. Also,player 3 is the voice of reason and then you \"wtf\" question their Xin pick?\n\nSure, in the case of player 1 and player 2, maybe they would have trolled anyway regardless of how you reacted.
