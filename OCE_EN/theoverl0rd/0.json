The  Graveyard was where I spent most of my time. The quiet dead don&rsquo;t disagree with you when you propose them with preposterous queries. Above, the dark was so intense it seemed to suck the light from the world. The stillness   was around me as I slowly drifted from thought to thought. Eventually, the sky would burn open and reveal a terrible secret, known only to the select few.&rdquo;\n\nI had recent contact with my old colleague, John Legrasse, who told me of his discovery of a Cthulhu temple; the details of which chilled me to my spine. Towering cities of monolithic blocks oozing with green slime seething out of the cracks and seams. This description made me feel queasy and deprived of energy, although ironically I have had sufficient sleep. I lived on the sandy  streets of Shurima and visited the Temple whenever I felt a desolate emptiness inside me. It seemed I was going to this necropolis with increasing frequency; it made me feel alive, as if I was consuming the life and knowledge of those lying beneath me. Until that one dreadful and terrifying night of winter. The sky roared open and it was as if someone lit the heavens on fire. This glimpse into the seemingly unknown forced me to see unsightly visions, a plane of infinity and in it iridescent globes, forming an unidentifiable mass. Thankfully the town was indoors when this happened because for that brief second mass chaos would have emerged from the ashes of our burnt souls, resulting undeniably in the end of our sanity. The fiery sky closed up and it was my belief that I had imagined the whole event, but now, because of Legrasse, I knew the truth. \n\nA few weeks after this incident, there were reports of numerous ritual orgies of the savage tribes that lived around Shurima. I went to investigate what these loud cries of ecstasy were. As I ventured   time, I saw visions of destruction, death and a floating conglomeration of glowing spheres. I found myself lying on the ground; I had fallen down a small hill. As I ventured further into the dense forest I heard a cry of pure euphoria. I rushed in that direction to find these savages and their rituals. &ldquo;N&rsquo;Gath Wol T&rsquo;na Vel&#039;Koz&rdquo; I moved towards one of them and acted as they would, howling as the day passed into night and again passed into day. I found clarity within this, I understood what this vision meant. Soon the savages went to leave and I ran into one before it left, it was a large Negro fellow with an overhanging jaw and a large deformed leg, the signs of someone formed from incest. I asked him with queries about the sky opening up and the visions I had. All that he said was Yog-Sothoth is returning back to claim this realm.     \n\nIronically, I couldn&rsquo;t go to the police as they would arrest me, and I couldn&rsquo;t defeat the malevolent activities on my own. I had to see my close friend, Inspector Legrasse in Demacia. As I travelled, it seemed that these visions kept on coming and I had to distract my conscience mind to try and dispel these visions of vivid and horrific natures. I finally reached Legrasse, but by this stage had lost the ability to stand without help. I was in a mental state of collapse, which must have alerted Legrasse that I was in dire need of medical assistance. As Legrasse brought me inside I had a vision. This vision wasn&rsquo;t of the same calibre as the others. I could still see the world around me and how it interacted with every step. Inside Legrasse&rsquo;s door, it seemed as if there were spirits of hell were flooding out. As I asked the inspector about these ghouls, he said that I was still in a state of delusion.  When I regained some sanity I found that I was in the foetal position like a baby. Then it was as if a wave of darkness hit me and the only light was that of the floating terror, Vel&#039;Koz. The darkness around me consumed me and with it, I kept falling through the vast and dark infinity of space and the stars around me were part of this massive and godlike entity. It was as if god were looking through my soul.\n\nAs Legrasse tried to get me back to the world of the living, I realised that I was destined to follow Vel&#039;Koz as he is the gate and key to peace. If I go to see him and bring him I would be his vessel and he would be my cure. As the inspector finally brought me back I told him of what perilous journey I must venture to achieve peace. He scolds me and threatens to send me to jail, but I left before any threats become a reality. I head towards the wild untamed lands, marking out an area and start practising the rituals that the savages were doing that one fateful night. As the time progresses I feel myself fading into the darkness, I feel the grasp of a world of death. As time slowly progresses cracks opened in the sky and what I see is pure beauty, and I hear a thundering sound. &ldquo;That is not dead which can eternal lie. And with strange aeons, even death may die.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"azaki","date":"2016-06-26T04:10:27.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing work! Very captivating.
