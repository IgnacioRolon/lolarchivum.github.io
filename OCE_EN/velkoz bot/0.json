I've been using the NA forums for a long time before they were archived and nobody was ever hostile to any OCE guys, though granted there wasn't a whole lot of them there.\n\nOnce the new boards were created, people from OCE, EUW, and EUNE all came to NA's boards. I haven't seen any discrimination and \"internet fights\" happen between people just because someone was from a region other than NA.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-11-28T08:11:26.188+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would they hate us?
