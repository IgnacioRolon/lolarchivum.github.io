I got back into the game sometime earlier this year and have been playing ever since. From my games from 2017 up to a week or two ago, my ping has never been higher than 30. Recently, however, most of the time it's been going from (lowest)200 to (highest) 415ms. I now very rarely get 10-30 ping. When I play any other game, I get the same amount of ping I used to get on said game. I even connect to servers from other games, which are based in NA, and I get a better connection on there than I do on League. I know for a fact that this isn't a problem from my end. Is there any way to find out what the problem is or a way to fix whatever is happening?\n\nP.S. We have 4 people in the same house, all using internet connections at the same time. Despite this, My ping was still as low as 10 on League up until this point.\n\nMe pinging the OCE League server.

Generally, your ISP will have some sort of service status page where you can look up any outages or re-routed connections and why they are the way they are. They're also not generally the best at updating these for anything except the biggest issues, so giving them a ring or email may help in that regard.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey'll probably ask for some logs or a tracert, but they'll be able to help you pinpoint the source of the lag and go from there.","replies":[]}]}
