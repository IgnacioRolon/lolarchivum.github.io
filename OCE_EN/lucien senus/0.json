I was bouncing from 13, to 80, to 10, to 25, to 17, to 182, you name it.  The worst part of this was that these skips were sporadic, lacked a discernible pattern, and were completely unaffected by _any_ change I made.  I attempted to lower my graphics, tweak movement prediction on, then off, shift my V-Sync, implement a frame cap, _nothing has worked_.  There is not a single setting I have not tampered with, tweaked, or otherwise changed.  _Nothing has worked_.  I have now lost my first preseason placement game, which isn&#039;t too horrible, except now I&#039;m guaranteed a net loss even if I win the next 9.\r\n\r\nI want a resolution.  I _demand_ a resolution.  I&#039;ve poured hundreds, if not thousands of dollars into this game over the years.  I&#039;ve found not a _shred_ of help in _any_ of the official resources, and I&#039;m at my wit&#039;s end.  XBOX Game DVR is not the issue, and I have neither Flux or F.Lux, so those don&#039;t appear to be problems either.  Fix this, please, Riot.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s also worth noting that, prior to the 2018 Preseason, this issue never happened to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-29T11:29:26.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm sounds like you're experiencing the dreaded fps drops on high end machines if you nnormally run at 250.
