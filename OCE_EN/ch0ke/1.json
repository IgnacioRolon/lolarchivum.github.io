I understand you guys have got a decent workload and probably want some off time away from the game, but it would mean a lot to me. If it&#039;s doable, any other summoner also looking to celebrate their 1000th win at this point in time, leave a reply or add me (FADS) and maybe we can share it together. \r\n\r\nOCE {{champion:111}} \r\n\r\nRegards, Jake","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-04-14T02:24:12.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*places nerf gun to summon Rioter*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-13T15:15:57.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lets celebrate by getting a life!!","replies":[]}]}
