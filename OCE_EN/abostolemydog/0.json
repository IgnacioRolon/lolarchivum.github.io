I hope they can keep following that.\n\nNot to mention your name is kinda offensive I can't see why you wanna cherish that ign, but whatever. Unless this is already something you've changed to, *shudders*.\n\nEDIT: Also I am not sure about the \"f wits helping enemy team\", was that referring to intentional feeders? Well report and ignore, don't rage because if you insult out of rage you're at fault as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-18T19:07:45.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> my brother threatens me with anthrax\n\n> f wits\n\nAnother 12 year old i see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-18T23:06:00.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\\*Abuses Riot staff\\*\n\\*Gets surprised when treated like sh!t by Riot staff\\*\n\\*Obviously hasn't read the TOU and EULA*\n\nFYI, by accepting the TOU and EULA you've given Riot permission to do whatever the hell they want to do to your account for no reason.
