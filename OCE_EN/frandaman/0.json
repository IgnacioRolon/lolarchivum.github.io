Try to keep deaths below 4, every time you die you are giving the other team 300 + gold.\n \n\nIf you focus on getting more CS and dying less you will climb pretty high. Remember that almost every death is your fault, so every time you get killed think back about exactly what mistake lead to the death. learn from each death and you will climb fast.\n\nAside from that its really just learning a lot from playing through all the different situations in games, experiencing what you can and cant do on certain champions.\n\nRemember Climbing Soloqueue isn't meant to be easy. Just focus on improving your own game and stay positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T01:35:04.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> every time you die you are giving the other team 300 + gold.\n\nunless he doesn't get any kills and assists between deaths right? doesn't gold vale drop to around 50 after enough consecutive deaths","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-26T01:39:54.440+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If hes dying that much then we have other problems =P","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T06:41:57.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed.\n\n\" cough cough 0/31 tristana \"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Hornattack","date":"2015-08-26T05:57:19.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"csing is not the most important thing its about the fights over dragon and who gets dragons. also being bronze isnt as bad as being silver 5. #RankSystemSucks","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-26T06:07:36.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragon fights are definitely important too, but I have't seen his gameplay so I can't comment on his team fight positioning or objective control. \n\nI am just giving him tips to improve from what I can observe in his match history.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-08-26T00:41:33.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey maraudaur could you have a look at my match history and tell me what i could improve on? it would mean alot","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-26T00:50:02.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man had a quick look as well and its actually quite similar! \n\nYou are level 20 so there is a lot of room to grow but focusing on improving your CS and dying less is a great start.\n\nhttp://www.carry.gg/oce/AngelOfHell\n\nYou should be aiming to get 80 cs at 10 minutes and 180 cs at 20 minutes. \n\nEspecially your Fizz has low cs =P","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-08-26T01:55:49.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey thanks for that XD it means alot\n\nany tips for csing as mid lane fizz? i often find it hard to cs as fizz mid with out taking heaps of harras? is that just my positioning?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-26T02:37:30.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play fizz that much, but max E for wave clear and activate W to last hit under tower.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-01T11:55:23.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marauder, I think you've got yourself a player analyzing business up.

It's entirely possible that OP has all the knowledge they need but are just incapable of applying it in-game where it matters.\n\nI guess the only advice i can give to op is :\n\nIf you know the shit, try practicing it in ranked. Not normals, not custom. Ranked. Its better to adapt to the environment quickly by playing ranked.\n\nEg. csing, pay **more **attention on csing for a few games and see how it goes. \nYou might want to find a main lane or champion so you have a better chance of winning.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-26T00:44:34.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note: Wall of text incoming.\n\nThere's an important balance you need to consider. Knowledge is important if you want to climb high, though having that knowledge and applying it in-game are two different things.\nFor example: I know that using Quinn is an effective method of defeating Yi's (even fed Yi's) in low ELO however I still struggle applying that knowledge in-game. I know what I need to do and when I need to do it but I occasionally miss that all important \"Blinding Assault\", leading to my retreat and/or demise. When I manage to pull it off, however, it works extremely well, I've even been accused of hacking at times.\n\nThen you need to consider skill. Quite straightforward really, you just can't climb if you don't have the skill. Practice improves this and that's pretty much it. Focus on getting those last hits, buying wards and putting them where they'll be most effective, picking and choosing when is best to engage and knowing when you can't win a fight etc.\n\nWhether you choose to go it alone or bring a friend is an important decision. Picking the wrong ally puts you at a disadvantage. Consider how well you work with them, what's their attitude like, are they going to negatively impact your play and vice verse. If you're consistently duo queuing with the same person that adds another common factor to your games, making it that much harder to determine where an issue has come from.\nI have a friend who I'll play with occasionally, and it's fun, but I wouldn't duo with them in ranked because I know that would put me at a disadvantage. \n\nThen you have attitude and mindset. If you blame your team mates for everything or just rage/abuse them it's going to negatively impact not only the way you play but the way they play as well, usually ending in a loss. Being positive, acknowledging when an ally makes a good play and not abusing/raging at them for making mistakes will go a long way to improving the way everyone plays, increasing the chances of you winning. If you have a bad game, take a break (short or long) to get out of that \"I'm going to lose\" and back to \"I'll learn from my mistakes and win the next one\" mindset. It's no good if your mind is focused on the negative.\n\nAs for what's most important, an argument could be made for either skill or attitude. For me, it's attitude. I've had experience with this being a big influence, in fact my entire ranked history (on my main \"SparksElm\", feel free to take a look) shows how much of a difference attitude can make. It may only be 16 games but still, I lost all 6 I played in season 3 and just did all round terrible in them and, guess what, I blamed my team mates. After improving my attitude over the course of a year I went back and completed my provisionals and those 10 games were my best experience with League. I did well often, won more than half o my games and got silver 3 (much higher than I expected) not because I improved my skill, because I didn't, but because I changed my attitude. I've seen plenty of other people with similar experiences as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-08-26T07:27:17.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good post mate.\n\nSolid advice. +1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frandaman","date":"2015-08-26T02:50:35.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amazing advice! i really appreciate you taking the time to respond to this! will be keeping a consious mind on how i play now and i hope to see improvements. thank you so much <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T01:33:01.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok listen up, you wan't ranked easy? don't get to silver, also, playing when the 8-14 year kids gone to bed helps a lot, less agro flame and stuff\n\nalso, I once tried to trust allies, it backfired.

If you want to get out of bronze,firstly, attitude is a huge one(this actually applies to every elo), do not type to your team at all, mute everyone toxic instantly. You do not need to ward, you do not need to farm well, you do not need mechanics, you do not need to teamfight well, you dont need good objective control. Proof of this, players that have gotten to much higher elo's without any of the above skills. You just need to learn to apply pressure, and ignore your team. Thats literally it. Low elo players cannot deal with pressure correctly. They will either send everyone to you, giving your team room to do stuff, or they will ignore you, leaving you free to take towers. I dont know what position you play and it does not matter, next game you go into, play heimerdinger in top with teleport, and do not group, even if it is the correct thing to do, just ignore your team and pressure lanes. 70% win rate achieved easily. If they enemy comes to fight you, either hide in your turrets or run away. This will work all the way up to plat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-08-26T07:30:28.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing that I could suggest is **understand and accept** when your either counterpicked or beaten in lane **(solo killed)** and adjust your playstyle to farm up for mid/ late game\n\nBiggest thing I see is when people get beaten in lane try to get that kill back then go 0/3 loss a ton of CS and wonder why they lost and got no help.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-08-26T02:25:00.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"10 Easy tips to remember:\n\n1) Focus on your CS, Voyboy once said \"There's no excuse for missing free (uncontested) CS\" words to live by. \n2) Don't die, i know it sounds obvious but so many people die needlessly because they don't play safe or they don't understand the strength of there own champion or the strength of there opponents champion, if you need help just ask your jungler nicely and hug your tower. \n3) Wards, wards, wards and more wards, ward for yourself and ward for your team, wards save lives.... wards. \n4) Help out your team as much as possible, the ones who helps out the team the most are usually the support and the jungler with all there vision control. \n5) Roam, roam, roam, roaming is the best way to help your team out other than having good vision control, roam whenever possible. \n6) Focus on securing objectives and not on securing kills, iv seen too many people focused on getting kills when they could have been securing a nice beefy objective that would benefit there whole team, whether it be a tower, dragon, baron ect.. if you have the opportunity take it. \n7) Split pushing, this best works with an AD/ tanky DPS top/ mid laner with TP or a global ult, you're constantly offering up lane pressure and securing objectives while your team usually pressures elsewhere or defends, if things get choppy for your team you have your TP or global ult which usually makes the other team back off. \n8) Learn how to team fight properly, it will take too long to explain but there are heaps of tutorials on YouTube to help you with that. \n9) Always stay positive, a negative attitude will put you and possible your team on tilt. \n10) Watch some professional players in action, they usually offer up some pretty solid advice.
