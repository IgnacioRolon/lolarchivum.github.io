I couldn&#039;t click &#039;change gamemode&#039; or &#039;invite&#039; or &#039;play game&#039; and the only button available was cancel but it didn&#039;t do anything but play a sound effect. \n\nAfter I restarted the client, it took 10 times longer to authorise. After I finally logged in, I pressed play, selected normal, the select buttom became unresponsible again. \n\nAfter another restart, and another 5 mins authorising, I finally got into the queue. But when the ready check thing popped up, it suddenly disappeared and said &#039;ready check couldn&#039;t display properly&#039; or something. So I queued up again and got into champ select, but I couldn&#039;t select any champ at all which resulted in a dodge penalty. (screenshot included)\n\nRiot pls fix this asap I just wasted 1 hour doing nothing but waiting for my client to work and reporting this bug. {{item:3070}} \n\n[messed up champselect.jpg](https://s9.postimg.org/m1q8n7qa7/Screenshot_6.png)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-07T01:40:08.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[]}]}
