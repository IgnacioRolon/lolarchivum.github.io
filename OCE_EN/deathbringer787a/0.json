I am a Silver 5 support and jungle main, and I&#039;m here today to talk about one of my favourite aspects of League of Legends. Being positive! It is an important strategy to stay happy and enjoy the game.\r\n\r\nFirstly, being positive is always good in a game! Being nice to other people can hopefully brighten their day. Someone might not be doing the best. Please don&#039;t say toxic comments, such as &quot;You&#039;re bad&quot;, or &quot;Stop feeding&quot;. The desired outcome of mentioning such a phrase is apparent, it is to make the person feel bad about their mistake. It is likely the player understands how they died, and further agitating them about it may lead to an undesirable situation, where the player may &quot;go on tilt&quot;, &quot;rage&quot; or &quot;troll&quot;. This would add negativity into the game, and that will only lead to more negativity. \r\n\r\nSecondly, always be happy to be in the lobby. Remember, you are lucky to be playing with such a nice team! For example, I love helping others, that&#039;s why I love playing support and jungle. While in the lobby, I always emphasise the point by putting plenty of smiley faces &quot;:) &quot;, love hearts &quot;&lt;3&quot; and happy phrases, such as &quot;I love my team&quot; and &quot;I am happy to help&quot;. Whilst playing support, you can be an important asset to helping your precious ADC either survive the laning phase, trade with the opponent, or attack the opponent. Even if your ADC does badly, do not type anything bad into the chat! If you consider it, how does saying &quot;You&#039;re bad&quot; help your dead ADC? It clearly doesn&#039;t. They aren&#039;t going to magically become mechanically better. However, at any sign of advantage, make sure to be happy. Saying things such as &quot;Nice job!&quot;, &quot;Great work!&quot; or &quot;Well played!&quot; are sure to make your team feel better! \r\n\r\nThirdly, enjoy the game! Games are for enjoyment, so have a great time!\r\n\r\nIf you ever see me out on the rift, give me a shout! Preferably of encouragement and happiness, but it would be pleasing to know I helped incorporate positivity into League of Legends. Best of luck! Have a great day!","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-11T08:11:14.891+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}} \"The heart is the strongest muscle\" ... \"Keep your spirits high\"\n\nI concur, if someone is being salty or aggressive, I will make a single attempt to chill the situation with a positive note. But some are too head strong and decide to keep going, so I forget about chat and play on, having fun regardless.\n\nAnd for those who keep doubting themselves or shit canning themselves for a mistake, I find that simple encouragement goes a long way and most of the time they pick up.\nI think most people are so worried about what others think of their game play they put too much pressure on themselves to perform and forget about having fun, and you kind of snowball yourself toward failure","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bakon","date":"2016-09-10T12:11:45.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need more people like you.\n<3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-11T06:22:01.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Throughout my life even to I reach level 30 Silver, I had been positive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-11T05:12:42.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stay positive until there's a Yasuo in the enemy team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-09-11T01:39:56.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually find it significantly harder to remain positive while playing support than any other position. Largely due to the number of ADCs who seem to think every time they die, or lose a trade, it's entirely the fault of their support. \n\nHaving said that, I definitely find a noticeable difference in how the team goes when everyone's on a positive. Can usually tell within the first few minutes of the game how the team will gel - throwing out a stupid line or two and seeing how people respond gives a good indication of who you're playing with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xypher","date":"2016-09-11T00:30:45.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm positive 99% of the time but sometimes some people are so frustrating that you just want to stab their skull, i stay quiet but i really really want to do it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-10T14:21:43.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's nice seeing more people agreeing with the idea of a support being not just lane support but morale support for the team. That said a note is that for some people, long positive statements can be distracting or annoying and so it's probably better to keep the positivity short to things like 'gj', 'nice', 'wp', 'thanks for...' too much chat can sometimes bog the team down too and it's more impactful when it's rationed properly.\n\nI too try to be as positive as possible although there are a few things that can tick me off a little, I try to at least stay positive in the chat. That said if you do something really silly (not like an offmeta build but like trying to proxy farm as the adc and expecting me to come help you in the eventual 4v1 and then you get all toxic for me not coming to help you despite danger pings) then I might just type 'gj' in the chat when you do something very silly and die. I need to do this otherwise I'll blow up sometimes. Also a note to all adcs towerdiving at lvl1 is a bad idea, going toplane to towerdive at lvl2/3 is not a good idea and I will not help and finally adc should not be played like a singed, they're very different please don't do this, it's not a new korean strat, it's a bad idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-18T10:38:05.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I ended up getting in silver somehow and I feel so boosted but at least I don't see dumb things anymore.
