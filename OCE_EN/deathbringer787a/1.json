I am a Silver 5 support main!\r\n\r\nYou many remember me from an earlier discussion, \r\n\r\n&quot;Being Positive&quot; http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/mfovL8EQ-being-positive ,\r\n\r\nand today I would like to discuss the issue about supports. Not a rant about how hard the role is, or how the team is toxic, or how &quot;everyone is bad, OMG I belong in Diamond but my team is holding me back&quot;. As aforementioned in the previous discussion, being positive is the key. To give constructive feedback is one thing, to say &quot;OMG you missed kys&quot; is just counterintuitive. Putting someone down for a mistake won&#039;t make them mechanically better. The tip is, either stay silent, or say something nice. No sarcasm, of course! Saying &quot;ohh GJ Zed&quot;, right after he died because of a bot and jungler roam mid isn&#039;t nice.\r\n\r\nSo, supports. We have plenty of different types of supports, such as the more tanky one (Alistar, Nautilus) more aggressive one (Blitzcrank, Leona), a more utility focused one (Janna, Lulu) and the more sustain ones (Soraka, Sona (ish?) ). We also have more &#039;carry&quot; type supports that are mages with limited utility sent bot lane, which are normally aggressive (Lux, Morgana). We also have the &quot;all-rounders&quot; (Such as Zilean (My main &lt;3 ) and Kayle). But what is the issue with supports? People say &quot;oh, it&#039;s boring&quot;. I would like to say, it is the exact opposite. Even at my MMR, supports are always looking for ways to win trades, get vision, push a little harder and capitalise on a level advantage and get free damage of onto the enemy. To me, even though there are clearly more mechanically complex champions with a higher skill ceiling (Riven, Assassins), support feels like the most fulfilling role. A good support can shut down the enemy ADC and support. By default, your ADC will be superior to theirs. A good support will force objectives, providing advantages to their entire team, including their ADC. A good support will gank mid, allowing their mid to help pick up the slack for the ADC, if the ADC happens to not be having the best game. A lackluster ADC can still scale strongly into the game. Even if they are 0/2, and behind 30 cs, don&#039;t complain. You took up the burden, the weight of being the ADC&#039;s caretaker. It is heavy.\r\n\r\n&quot;But how is the support role supposed to prosper if the ADC is garbage? What always ends up happening is the ADC will die, and then my turret will get pushed even if I am hugging it. My damage and CC is no threat to the enemy lane since I&#039;m 2v1&#039;ing them as support, so they ignore me and continue on to shutting down my lane.&quot; says a player.\r\n\r\nThe answer is, well, firstly, I think support is the most unique position of all the roles. You are part of the only lane on the map that requires two people to constantly work as team, and to top it off you are expected to carry a big part of that burden while being the least powerful (damage or threat wise) member of the team. (Think Kuroko from Kuroko no basketball, before Season 2). As it is said in that anime,&quot; I am the shadow, and you are the light. The stronger the light is, the more powerful the shadow is.&quot; The ADC and Support are akin to two lights shining at each other, if the ADC is good, it amplifies the Support. If the Support is good, it amplifies the ADC. If both are good, they will a force to be reckoned with. \r\n\r\nIf one imagines every role to be a light, one can easily visualise, and hence, understand, why that statement is true. If a light shines brightly, the other&#039;s shadows will be increased. If you can&#039;t adapt your support, you aren&#039;t good. of course, the first step to getting better, is to never blame anyone but yourself. If you die, analyse the situation, and how you died, what you could&#039;ve done better, and how you can improve. Otherwise, if there&#039;s nothing going well in the bot lane, just don&#039;t focus on your ADC and check what you could have done better and try to get better yourself and don&#039;t blame your teammates. Even if the ADC is doing badly, you can still be useful to the team. If another lane is doing really well then your priority should be keep that player alive instead of the not-very-useful ADC during team fights. Just remember that losing the lane does not mean that you lose the game.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, everyone has their own playstyle. The ADC may have expected you to play a passive support like Soraka and that is why he was so aggressive, he just expected you to sit back and keep him alive with heals. Another situation is that ADCs may be too passive and need an aggressive support like Leona or Blitzcrank to initiate fights for them. This is why communication pre-game is good so you can ask your ADC how he plays and you can work your supporting around it.\r\n\r\nIf an ADC is having significant issues that cannot be addressed with a quick tip then my own personal history has lead me to believe that your best course of action is two-fold. First, cut the feeding in half. Play passive and let the ADC do what they&#039;re going to do. There&#039;s no sense in giving the enemy&#039;s carry two kills instead of just the one. Secondly, start &quot;floating&quot; to mid and top. Ward as much of those lanes as possible and pitch in on tower pushes and ganks. Try to get at least one of your teammates safely to the late-game with the gold they need.\r\n\r\nAlways ward up the lane. Buy Sightstone. I&#039;m guilty of not doing this all the time, but it&#039;s becoming a habit now, which is good! There&#039;s a lot of ways you can make your ADC look good when you&#039;re support even if he&#039;s bad, you really have more control than you think. At the end of the day it&#039;s all about experience and figuring out how you can take control of the lane if your ADC doesn&#039;t know how to. Talk to them. Try to be calm and explain to them that they should try things a different way. Don&#039;t flame or say negative things. Ask mid and jungle to try and help your lane more if possible.\r\n\r\nIf they&#039;re mechanically (Such as Last hitting and poking) not-great you can do so much, such as autoing the minions to get it low. If they lack great decision making, or skill shots, you can do a lot as Sona/Lulu/Nami by zoning to allow for easy cs, cc&#039;ing or handing them the win by helping them get kills. Also, remember the enemy is probably not a Korean Diamond smurf, so they will make mistakes. As a support, you can punish them for their poor positioning by getting free damage off or cc&#039;ing them. This will help you zone them. Also, even at my MMR, when people get a lead, the rotate to the other lanes and pressure them. SO WARD UP for those lanes.\r\n\r\nSo, have a great day!

I too am a zilean support main though my current ranking is way bloated from just recently doing my placements and getting placed way too high. This is also pissing off one of my plat friends and it's just causing alot of friction, since he's mad I didn't get put in bronze 5 (I feel I deserve bronze 3 maybe 4 but maybe not bronze 5) but I really like what you're saying.\n\n I love playing support but sometimes I feel I'm not doing enough and I really want to improve. Right now I'm really struggling though I'm happy with the fact that I'm going to drop out of silver soon. I'm really trying to improve so I can at least not drag my team down. I really like sightstone and red trinket and I try to do all the things you've said, though I lack experience so I often fail and can't do the csing help thing because I'm not good at csing myself. Also I feel that since I've only been playing support I've been carried since though my damage over the game is decent it's never carry level and most is just lane poking and not majorly impacting kills. Nice to see these posts that help people like me improve their support game. So far I've tried my best to help my team and be positive  but I'm not really swaying the game and I feel so boosted.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBringer787A","date":"2016-09-18T11:29:51.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool Icon by the way! It's great to see someone respond! Practice hard, and you will definitely improve! Of course, like you said, the first step is to not weigh the team down, then naturally, the second step is to lift them up, or to carry them! You are definitely not boosted! If you do your best to help your team, and be positive, the power of the support is just beyond your grasp. I'm sure you've at least had a hint of it before, what it feels like to shine with a dazzling team. \n\nAs for the cs issue, I know it sounds tiresome, but load into a quick custom with your usual support runes and masteries, and just farm for about 5-10 minutes by yourself. It's hard with low AD, but don't worry! Also, try not to use spells too much. Then, when you can easily get 5 of the 6 (or 6 of the 7 for the cannon wave), move onto vs'ing maybe one bot, then two. Finally, go into a normal game, and auto the minions until it health is below 100 hp. <3 best of luck out on the rift!

I use to main blitzy support, was earning myself a lot of S games even with losses before I started trying all the other lanes.\nNow heading back into the support role because I also find it a fun challenge, but now using Nami a lot this time.\nBecause when I play Blitz I find unless I am on comms with my ADC, its hard to sync with them. When I catch someone out of position, or have the potential to pull them out of position/under turret safely enough, I just go for it. And right then, I am pretty much forcing a fight whether my ADC is ready or not.\nAnd most of the time, they aren't ready and can't deal enough damage while the opportunity is there.\n\nUnless I am queuing with friends, I am either too aggressive for my ADC, or too passive for them. This alone is the challenge I find when playing support.","replies":[{"poster":"DeathBringer787A","date":"2016-09-19T06:46:31.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man! Appreciate it!
