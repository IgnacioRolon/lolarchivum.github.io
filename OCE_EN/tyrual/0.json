Some will ask for a swap others do not, however regardless of this they continue to get away with gaming the system and ignoring the given role. There must be repercussions for doing this, there&#039;s no way out during the pick/ban sequence if this happens and there&#039;s no direct report option available. It&#039;s a complete lack of ability to work within a team structure and for the people who do get their roles taken during autofill protection is just plain unfair.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a report option at the very least to highlight this prevalent issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-31T04:23:23.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"If I get auto-filled, I politely ask for Jungle.
