The project event was to celebrate of some sort the release of Project Ashe like they did with Yi also. And I'm certain they have done an event with arcade skin line when Final boss Veigar or Blitzcrank skin came out with that arcade game.\n\nSaying that i wouldn't mind having a Final Boss level where you join with 5 people and you vs each Evil arcade skin so it feels like a boss battle with them having massive health and damage etc. Would show people the power of team play also","replies":[{"poster":"xXdimicXx","date":"2016-08-26T03:39:41.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh didnt know that thx for the info\nand yeah a final boss game mode sort of like ascension would be dope as","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-26T02:28:38.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think these new arcade skins are rather underwhelming","replies":[]}]}
