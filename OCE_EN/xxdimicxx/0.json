Why can't some people just accept that others have a different style of game.\n\nThese people don't see URF as a special treat - they see it as a full game, instead of the normal League of Legends. If there was a game exactly like URF with all the same champions, items, abilities, etc, they would play it nonstop, because yes, it is funner.\n\nFor the rest of the League community however, URF is a special event not meant to be here forever. URF is some peoples style, League is another game to be honest. I don't play League that much anymore but I do during the special gamemodes. If they were there own game, I wouldn't be here. But they are part of League, and some people just love them, and not in a once a year way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-28T03:56:43.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are none.
