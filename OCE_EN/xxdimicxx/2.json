But give it some time. If you managed to clock up a good 30-50 URFS over the weekend, by game 15, you noticed that it was usually a pool of 20champs being picked. It's fun, but it needs breathing space. \n\nThough i feel it should be a mode in custom games, just not regular. People could still play it amongst friends if they want for the minimal IP. But, i think the constant urge to play would detract from LoL as a whole, i know regular modes were alot more interesting on monday as i made so many mistakes due to being in URF brain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illidalian","date":"2016-04-27T21:57:09.978+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh dear lord, please, no.\n\nIt was fun for one night.

With the current rotation of Ascension, LotPK, URF and OFA we'll get it once every 4 weeks, which would be a total of 13 times over the course of a year. Considering Riots estimate that each rotation will take 1.5-2 months (rather, 6-8 weeks) we'll be seeing URF between 6-9 times in any given year. Considering we not only get URF but a variety of other featured game modes *on a regular basis*, I think you need to stop asking for more. Riot didn't have to do this much.","replies":[]}]}
