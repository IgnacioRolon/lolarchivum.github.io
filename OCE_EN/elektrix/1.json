Make it so that if the player hasn&#039;t got the time to wait 5-20 minutes to join queue they can still serve the punishment in a different way. Unlike a ban they can still play if they want to but can just wait it out if their lives don&#039;t allow for them to sit and wait to be allowed to join queue.\n\nEdit: Not sure if player behavior is the best category to post this in but sounds right to me so correct me if I'm wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-15T12:12:38.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure I understand what youree saying the punishment should be","replies":[{"poster":"Elektrix","date":"2017-07-16T12:25:10.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Instead of waiting for 20min to join a queue 5 times you could not play matchmade for 5 days or a week and leave buster will be lifted. I'm not referring to having one or the other I mean to have both options available to the player should they end up in leavebuster","replies":[]}]}]}
