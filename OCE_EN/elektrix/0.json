This sparked the idea of a champion that didn`t/couldn`t basic or if they did, it did no damage. The idea for a support champion came as the idea for an &#039;above the normal skill requirement for supports&#039; support as i`ve noticed that alot of supports are really easy to pick up and do good with, where as only a few require some more skill but not by much.\nSo here he is: Yen, the Zen Master.\n\nYin is a support based champion. His lack of damage output is greatly made up for by his ability to assist and secure kills for his team and turn the tides of battle immensely.\nBeing a support champion, Yin is of great use in the bot lane with abilities to reduce the damage output of the enemy carry, and increase the damage output of your carry.\nAbilities:\nPassive - Equinox\nYin`s basic attacks deal no damage\nChaos Stance: Basic attacks reduce the targets armour and magic resist by [5% Attack damage] for 5 seconds.\nStacks 5 times.\nOrder Stance: Yin`s attack speed is increased by 50% and now targets ally champions. Basic attacks can target ally champions and heals allies for 10/12/14/16/18/20/22/24/25/26/28/30/32/34/36/38/40/42 + [1% Ability power][1% Attack damage].\nQ: Discordance/Dulcet\nChaos Stance: Discordance\nSends a mid ranged skillshot that marks the first enemy champion hit. The mark slows them by 20%, increases the power of Equinox and allies basic attacks deal [0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1% Ability power]% of the damage as magic damage.\nOrder Stance: Dulcet\nSends out a mid ranged skillshot that marks the first allied champion hit. The mark grants them 20% movement speed and grants them Equinox.  \n\nW - Entropy\nFires a short range skillshot the hits the first champion it reachs.\nEmpowers an ally champion granting them 5/10/20/50/75% bonus attack speed and 10/20/30/40/50% lifesteal and spellvamp for the duration.\nBonus attack speed can exceed the attack speed cap.\nWeakens an enemy champion reducing their attack speed by 5/7.5/10/20/50% and attack damage by 5/10/15/20/25% for the duration.\nAttack speed and attack damage reduction cannot fall below base value.\nIf this ability hits an ally, Yin switches to Order stance, if an enemy is hit, Yin switches to Chaos Stance.\n\nNote: This ability will have a long (very long) cooldown due to the shear increase in damage output it will have for certain champions{{champion:429}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}}.\nE - Duality\nChaos Stance: \nPassive: Basic attacks mark the target for 10 seconds. If an ally basic attacks the marked target, the ally is granted bonus attack damage for 5 seconds and is healled for 0.2 + [0.2/0.4/0.6/0.8/1% Ability power]% of there missing health. This heal is tripled if the target is an enemy champion.\nThis cannot occur more than 3 times in 30 seconds and will not occur if the ally is on full health.\nActive: Yin unleashes a mid ranged AoE that shreds 25% of the targets Armour and Magic Resist of all enemies hit for 2/3/4/5/6 seconds.\nOrder Stance:\nPassive: Basic attacks mark the target for 10 seconds. If an ally basic attacks the marked target, the target is takes (1 + [0.1/0.3/0.5/0.7/0.9% Ability power]%) of there current health as magic damage.\nActive: Yin channels for 5 seconds healling all allies within the zone for 1/2/3/4/5% of the missing health every second. Entering a movement command, recasting Duality or casting another spell will end the channel early.\n\nUltimate - Equilibrium\nYin calls upon the forces of balance to turn the tides of battle.\nYin releases a large AoE that marks all champions in the zone. \nIf the total health of the enemy champions marked is greater than the total health of the ally champions marked, the enemy champions in the zone are stunned and the rest are slowed by 40/60/80% and all allies in the zone are healled for 10/20/30% of their max health. If the total health of the enemy champions marked is lower than the total health of the ally champions marked, all champions in the zone are silenced and enemy champions in the zone are snared.\n\nLore: Once a peaceful monk of the Hirana Monastery, Yin left to defend his home during the Noxian Invasion of his continent. When the invasion was over the High Priests found that there was no place in the monastery for such a disciple who refused to hold their power back. \nNot sure where to go next, Yin looked for the others of Ionia who where exiled for their actions. Yin eventually found Syndra, who took in the exile and taught him how to harness the raw destructive power of the arcane. In return, Yin taught Syndra how to hold balance to her actions, to more fluently cast her spells and manipulate the power she was gived with. \nSyndra, pleased with her student, pointed Yin in the direction of the Institute of War and advised him to join the League of Legends. \nNow Yin traverses the Fields of Justice, exercising the balance he has obtained.\n\nNote: This is my first attempt at a champion idea and I`m not sure on how balanced this may be. So I`m looking for feedback from both high and low elo players on what these concepts and mechanics could do to ranked players.","replies":[{"poster":"Fallion","date":"2016-07-06T05:26:17.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a  nice idea :)","replies":[]}]}
