Doesnt fit her theme 2. No one is gonna buy them. Taliyah is still relatively new so asking for a skin is outbof the question. Skins arent easy to make and it takes more than just segestions to make them. Dont be ignorant, if Riot wants or sees a need for a new Taliyah skin they'll make it, if not, stop crying and except it.","replies":[{"poster":"Wat U Lookin At","date":"2016-12-08T13:19:18.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Doesn't fit her theme\" - Hands down the worst argument ever. I dunno about you but I don't think Pool Party Mundo fits the steroid abuser, or any of the arcade themed skins. A skin doesn't need to fit the theme, it just needs to look nice, and I can guarantee people will buy it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-08T15:23:24.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pool Party and Arcade are some of the more lenient themes. Basically every skin theme exists in it's own little canon, like how the Blood Moon skins are the Ionian depiction of the Shadow Isles champs (much like the eastern depictions of demons and spirits irl). Pool Party is one of those real loose \"what if?\" themes, namely \"what if x champion was going to a pool party?\" so it fits any champion.\n\nMost skin themes like Super Galaxy/Neon Strike or PROJECT have some basis in a twist on the champions theme, and have lore of their own that has to align with the champion.\n\nI feel Elementalist could in fact be applied to Taliyah, but they've already taken an elemental route with the two skins she has, so an Elementalist skin would be kind of pointless. Pulsefire would be a stretch, could you imagine her abilities fitting with that theme? Same goes for Spirit Guard. There's also the fact that Riot has never doubled up on Ultimate themes and likely never will to keep those skins special and unique.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-08T15:17:47.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Arcade skins does have a theme when they were made for the champs and they came in groupz, if there were a pool Part Taliyah, which there won't be, who is she gonna be grouped with huh?
