My champ will auto attack enemies around him but I cant select the target.  I have 40 ping, with a very strong wired connection.  Everyone else moves in real time, and I watch myself die.  I can move my camera around the map, see chat from team mates, and  chat myself.  This needs to be fixed.  My hardware and connection are 100% effective, and I know its not an issue on my end.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-12T01:16:13.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Please head on over to this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/3njvd7AN-glitch-cant-move-no-lag), and follow the instructions. \n\nI'll see if someone has a fix yet.","replies":[]}]}
