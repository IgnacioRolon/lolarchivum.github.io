I'll be honest, I was #TeamLegacy but it was a great series nevertheless :P\n\n_Here's some questions for one of you guys:_\n\n1. **Raes** performed really well in the finals, but obviously some fans still have concerns on how he'll perform at IWCI. \n\n What are your thoughts on this? Is he up to scratch with the rest of the of the competition?\n\n2. How does shot calling work for you guys? Is it more dynamic like TSM (multiple shot callers) or is there one person making most of the big calls?\n\n3. OCE has typically been one of the weaker regions at IWCI (compared to BR and TR). Why do you think this is? Do we lack the infrastructure for a competitive region, or is our talent pool just not big enough?\n\nGood luck at IWCI, make OCE proud lads!","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Jish","date":"2016-08-16T11:00:40.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nObviously, from the outside the player trade always looked to be a bit scary, especially for fans. Having said this, all of us were incredibly confident in Raes from the moment we started playing with him. We knew he'd play well in the semis, we knew he'd play well at finals, and we're confident he will play well beyond that.\n\nShot calling on our team is fairly dynamic, and different people will often voice opinions and make decisions. Primarily, Spookz and EGym will do a lot of the work, but everyone has particular roles they're usually relied on for communication. \n\nI think there are a handful of reasons why it looks to be lagging behind. I don't think we are that far behind though, and each year I feel the gap is closing. \n1. Population: Our player base is incredibly small, and therefore the amount of top tier players is proportionately small.\n2. Location: Many other wildcard regions are located close enough to larger, premier regions for practice reasons. Japan + Korea; Turkey + EU etc. So these teams are getting arguably better practice than we are, because of their geography.\n3. Infrastructure: I think this excuse is getting a little forced now, because we have come a long way in terms of resources and stability, which I expect will be all but on par with the rest of the IWC regions, or close to, in 2017!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-16T19:59:57.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, I didn't expect a reply from the coach himself :D\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer my questions!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cohen","date":"2016-08-16T07:23:00.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you believe this is the year OCE wins IWCT? \nWhat makes it different from previous years?\n\nAnd one for Swiffer, what's your opinion on midlane now since Azir is no longer #1?","replies":[{"poster":"Good listener","date":"2016-08-16T11:26:43.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we're all in the best form we've ever been heading into a IWC, having the house and working essentially full time as gamers has enabled us to reach this level and we're all feeling great heading into the event","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"StuTheDude","date":"2016-08-16T07:25:08.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many hours a day do you play Pokemon Go?
