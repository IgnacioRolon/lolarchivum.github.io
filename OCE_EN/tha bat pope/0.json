We also know that Garen and Vi are coming next.\r\nSo? You may ask, what are you getting at pope of bats?\r\n\r\nThink about it. so far we have had a mid (Zed), a support (Sona), a jungle (Vi) and a top (Garen). That leaves adc! It may be that there is another teaser aimed at one around the corner (at the time of posting, it was only the previous 4), but I think it means that Jhin will be a ninja flavored (the floating petal motif says ninja to me) adc!\r\n\r\nWhat do you reckon? It&#039;s probably complete BS but I thought it was worth sharing :)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-29T23:48:38.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds plausible","replies":[]}]}
