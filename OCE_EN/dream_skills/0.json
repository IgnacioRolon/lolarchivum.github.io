If you&#039;re tired of hearing new champion ideas then don&#039;t read on.\r\n\r\nSo i was thinking, after looking at the store and seeing all the melee champions with swords. There are quite a few that seems appealing. Other than Yasuo. The other champions holding swords feel a bit out-dated. That&#039;s coming from someone who hasn&#039;t played for about a year and started playing again. Could we get a fire + sword combo going? Maybe tryndameres arch nemesis, or yasuos long-time rival. Who knows? It kind of fits in with their background considering tryndamere has ice in the back. If you want to lean towards Yasuo&#039;s side you can do a sort of &quot;Too much wind snuffs out fire, but too much fire devours wind.&quot; Kind of thing... Just an idea. I just think it would be pretty fun to have a fire+sword combo and when I mean sword, I mean sword meaning greatsword or katana. Not one of those lame toothpicks that fiora uses or that broken &quot;sword&quot; riven uses. I&#039;m talking about a big boi&#039;s sword like Tryndamere&#039;s or long and sleek like Yasuo&#039;s. One of the skills would be a combination of Yasuo&#039;s e and Riven&#039;s q. Just slashing and burning as you glide past enemies, of course with a CD. You get the gist.\r\n\r\nNot trying to offend any Fiora mains or Riven mains, but foreal though. Make it happen. \r\n\r\nP.S. If there are similar posts to this, or a million of the same posts as this, then I apologize. BUT, that just means they REALLY need to make it happen. If a million people DEMAND it, then they should SUPPLY it. Riot would rake in the moneeehh and the players would rake in the enjoyment of a sword + flame combo.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-09T16:44:19.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"passive - Flame swordsman: auto attacks burn through % of armor\nq - Heavy cleave: Swings his sword in a large arc in front of him dealing damage and disrupting enemies, leaves the ground burning where he swung which deals magic damage to those who stand in it. \nw- Volcano: Smashes his sword into the ground and become immobile for 1 second during the animation. The ground erupts around him dealing magic damage to those hit and knocks them back and slows. \ne- Blaze a trail: Him and his flaming sword become a singular flame and dash a short distance, passing through enemies and terrain before reforming at the appointed location. Enemies that he passes through are stunned for one second. \nr- Super nova: Huge power emits from his sword and burns enemies around him for the duration supernova, enemies hit by the burst are blinded for half a second. While supernova is activated he gains attack speed. \n\nSo many good combos can be done and played smartly.\n\neasy","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-02T21:17:26.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big boy sword?
