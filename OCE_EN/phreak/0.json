Thanks for taking the time to come say hi and/or ask me stuff! Hopefully you guys got something out of my answers <3\n\nStarting at 4pm AEDT, for the next hour or two I'll be here to answer your questions. What types of things should you ask, what types of things will I answer? Well, I'm down for most topics, but I'll toss in a quick biography so you know where I'm coming from.\n\nI'm 27. I've been gaming since the go-to operating system was DOS. I've been playing games online since the days of Myth, StarCraft 1, Diablo 1, etc, I remember playing shooters on 300 ping and the first time I got broadband internet i was disappointed that I didn't immediately have < 100 ping everywhere.\n\nI've been Shoutcasting or doing commentaries at least since I was 15. Might have done some stuff earlier. But all of it just as a hobby until a few years ago. I've only commentated for a handful of games, though. Mostly Warcraft 3 and League of Legends.\n\nI was a semi-pro Warcraft 3 (Night Elf) player. I peaked at #2 outside of Europe/Asia, probably top 20 worldwide.\n\nI hit #1 in the League of Legends ladder way back in 2009/2010 as well. I've been Diamond every season (except Season One where the highest was Platinum) in solo queue, and Challenger in Twisted Treeline these past two (and Diamond in Season Two, which was the highest then). I'm an AD Carry main, though I understand a passable amount in the other roles (enough to let myself get carried in solo queue typically).\n\nI've been playing League of Legends for over 5 years, since Closed Beta. I've been at Riot almost as long, joining just under 5 years ago (December 2009). The game, the company, and my stardom (I guess?) have grown massively in that time.\n\nI also stream semi-regularly (PhreakStream on Twitch) just for the love of it (and you guys). My hours tend to be somewhat Oce-friendly, so come say hi next time you see me on :)\n\nI'm the voice and used to be the producer, video editor, script writer, etc. on Champion Spotlights. I'm also a Shoutcaster for the LCS and Challenger Series over in North America. I also had the privilege of casting the Oceanic Regional Finals just a few weeks ago in Melbourne at PAX Australia, which was awesome.\n\nThough my travels both personal and professional, I've been to six of the seven continents on Earth (sorry, Antarctica).\n\nThat mostly sums up my public life. If there's anything you want to know about me, if there's anything you want to know to help yourself, if there's anything you want to know about the experiences I've had, I invite you to ask away (within reason)!\n\nI'm posting this 30 minutes early to start collecting questions (and upvotes to the questions you guys want to see answered) so have at it!\n\n<3<3<3","replies":[{"poster":"Daemoon","date":"2014-11-28T06:01:37.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> G'day, mates!\n\n\nNot all of OCE talks like this.

It was the other smart folks at Riot that were like, \"Well, we're gonna make new champions every 2 weeks, so let's make them about the champions!\"\n\nI had never done any real video editing in my life (exception being \"Insert this background music into this video\" which isn't exactly hard or very educational). But as of Ezreal back in 2010, I managed to turn around a new video about a new champion every two weeks. Learned a ton, was really fun, was a lot of hard work, but was overall awesome. I did everything from fact-finding, to gameplay, to video editing, script-writing, and publishing.\n\nEventually Riot grew, we got real video editors, people who specialized in publishing web content, and I started to do a smaller percentage of each of them. Nowadays I keep myself up to date with the champion, spend a few hours working with the script and scriptwriters, and then voice the thing. Everyone does an awesome job and I'm super proud of how far they've come.","replies":[{"poster":"I Am Noot Noot","date":"2014-11-28T05:04:46.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is Champion Spotlight it's own team or is a small group made up in multiple teams that get together 2 weeks before a champion releases?\n\nDo you miss the rapid fire champion releases?","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-11-28T05:18:46.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a \"Video Team,\" which is a whole bunch of dudes who do a whole bunch of different stuff..

Heard about it while I was over there. Definitely going to be helpful to the scene :).\n\nIndividual play-wise, Oce is pretty close. Quite a few standouts to me: Tally, ChuChuZ, Veritas/Nada specifically, but a lot more of you are all right up there as well. Strategically, a lot of room to grow for pretty much everyone. That's the short version of it.\n\nBut I think the extra structure from the OPL will definitely help. It's almost always just a matter of practice. I do think Oce has a good shot at making it to Worlds this year. The most important thing to make that happen IMO is getting a team that has a stronger strategic grasp of the game.\n\nSo few teams from so few regions actually successfully employ different playstyles outside of \"Well, we group for objectives, try to ward stuff, and out-rotate them.\" And while a lot of teams (globally and in Oce) still have a lot of room to grow in that one department, I think it's possible for a team to say, \"Yeah, YOLO, we're just going to develop our own style\" and then NO ONE knows how to deal with it. IMO this is the hidden power of all \"developing\" regions. No one's going to bother paying attention to their style or how to beat it until it's often too late.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OCG LittleKaz","date":"2014-11-28T04:40:08.748+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello Phreak,\n\nIf you could be stuck on a desert island with anyone from Riot who would it be?\n\nAlso, when are you coming to NZ (we all love you here in CHCH!)?\n\nI love watching your stream, you are super informative!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Phreak","date":"2014-11-28T05:08:43.183+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, my girlfriend is a Rioter, so definitely her :)\n\nI don't know when I'm coming to NZ, although I would LOVE to.

Also, what do you think of the OCE scene as a whole (including finer details on playstyles contrasting with other regions of the globe)?

I'll start with under-rated:\n\nTop Lane -> Assassins, like Akali, Fiora. I guess up until Gnar became super popular (but he's just a ban away, anyway) Top Lane became increasingly tanky and passive, which is a free license to play hyper-scaling weak laners. There were some NALCS players 6 months ago who had the great idea to run Yasuo Top vs. Dr. Mundo, because it was a free lane. I think we should see more of that. There's a few Kassadin players out there and the like. And we saw Looper play his Akali at Worlds. We need to see more of that.\n\nJungle -> Well, we've got the new season now. It was actually Warwick before the season changes, but now he's obvious. Rammus was also a big sleeper, but he got nerfed in preseason so I'm not sure anymore. I think Amumu is still really up there as a heavily under-rated jungler. Hard engage is, and always has been, really strong. Just making sure you have some is really powerful.\n\nMid Lane -> Karthus. I know people are playing assassins and all that, but Karthus has been good even when the mid lane meta was like Diana, Evelynn, and Ahri, so I don't buy the whole \"He doesn't fit\" argument. This guy deals ridiculous damage and is another massive backline threat that's honestly really hard to deal with, especially since Zhonya's is so easy to buy on him.\n\nAD Carry -> Ashe and Jinx. It seems Jinx is getting more love recently, but Ashe hasn't been seen for a whole Season and I don't know why. Like with the Amumu (and before, Rammus) point, just being able to start fights is really, really powerful. Ashe also does more damage than people think: IE+Shiv guaranteed crit to start a fight is a lot of up front burst, and her base attack speed is actually quite high.\n\nSupport -> Brand and Sona. Sona's just a harass goddess who doesn't have to respect minion waves basically at all, and Brand just deals ridiculous amounts of damage against non-sustain lanes. Sear costs 50 mana, has like 1,000 range, and deals something like 100 damage +8% of your max health at rank 1. WTF is that?\n\nNow, as far as interesting places on the graph:\n\nUdyr and Singed are way higher on player skill than you might think. It's not mechanical skill, but decision making, since they have to be VERY deliberate on where and when they go anywhere.\n\nRumble is higher on the gold graph than you expect. Q has a ridiculous AP ratio.\n\nTanks are higher on level scaling than you expect. Just in general, being level 18 is a massive amount of combat stats that keeps you from dying. I think that's part of the reason Top Maokai and Top Alistar were believed to be so strong. Some of it was the champions themselves, but also it was having a real tank getting solo lane XP and people were like, \"Wow, they live for so long!\" Tanks also tend to have useful level-ups on all their active abilities, so Maokai ends up getting these really high-damage saplings and really low cooldown CC.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Child","date":"2014-11-28T05:46:39.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you say be your biggest achievement with League of Legends, work and play-wise?","replies":[]},{"poster":"FRK OneTrueTree","date":"2014-11-28T05:38:27.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you think the OCE region will expand with the new competition series that's coming?

Went to a pretty good university over in America (UC San Diego). However, from around grade 10 and through university I started spending less and less effort on school. I actually almost got kicked out of university for bad grades. All of that was because I was spending much more time gaming than studying. Some of this time was spent what I would consider \"productively\" - Training for my WC3 matches. Shoutcasting. Audio commentaries. But a lot of it was doing really wasteful stuff like Pindle runs in Diablo 2 or whatever. I kept telling myself that I needed to ration my time better. Never did.\n\nNow, I cannot recommend my path. I firmly believe I got lucky with the opportunity to work for Riot. Very much right person in the right place in the right time. And thankfully I spent a lot of my time leading up to that point learning useful skills: Talking about things I understood very well to other people. Learning how to abuse systems and get the most out of a game. Writing. Speaking. Excitement. Those got me in. But, if I were able to manage my time better, I could have learned those skills while maintaining good grades, so again, everything in moderation :)\n\nI was always a big math nerd. I was OK at English and such, and I liked the more math-based sciences (AKA not Biology), but math was always my thing. I used to know all the breakpoints for how many upgrades it would take to require one more or one less attack for a unit to kill another, both in SC1 and WC3. I've always had a really heavy emphasis on perfecting really small details that were easily repeatable. I remember my Night Elf Tavern build order was literally just BETTER than everyone else's. No one took the time to perfect it, get that extra 5 Wood out of one of your initial Wisps. Always confused me that no one ever tried. But whatever, I just always got 5 more Wood than anyone else, not exactly massive. Just an example.\n\nI did play a lot of both Defense of the Ancients (the old RoC version by Eul) and Allstars by Guinsoo and/or Icefrog. I played HoN for a few months before I got super bored since it was identical to DotA, and then moved onto LoL which was familiar enough for me to be good at it, but different enough to be new and exciting.
