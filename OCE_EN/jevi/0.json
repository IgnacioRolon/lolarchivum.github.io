However in game it continuously spikes from 33 ping to between 100-1000 ping. This makes it impossible to play the game.\r\n\r\nI have been monitoring my internet, and it is perfectly fine. Since the new patch, I have tried playing at different times of day, and have disconnected all other devices. Same issue.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to other players, and six others I have encountered in game are having the same issues since the new patch. That is a lot. \r\n\r\nPlease look into this.","replies":[{"poster":"WinterFurry","date":"2015-07-11T22:43:28.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same issue","replies":[{"poster":"PlushBores","date":"2015-07-11T22:44:37.892+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too, is horrible play with 300 ping, just with lag i have this problem, with other line games im fine but with lol no.... the problem is the server not our internet or pc, we need  a real solution, i have this problem like 3 week","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aarku","date":"2016-02-20T02:59:54.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Gf is getting this problem as well, I'll be playing other games with no issue and she will be on a steady 30-40ms then she complains that she gets massive spike lag...

I was even thinking that it might be bcs i changed place of my computer , i moved it to other room...\nI asked players i played with on ranked once , and 3-4 of them were free to go in that kind of conversation in which we were talking about this.\nThy said it probably has something to do with Riot , and 1 guy said that he got a loss prevented last game ...\nI was playing on top and the kills between me and the other top laner were decided by those lag spikes : he lags and doesent move? Well am'a be a bit*h and pick up the kill - Same with me - im lagging with 1.6k ping? He will kill me .\n\nIt just makes this game unplayable and completely unenjoyable , Riot should atleast put alert saying something like : lag spikes lag issues bla bla we gotta fix this , loss prevented and stuff coming in but most ppl would take a break for a day or two from this game.\n\nI think it has something to do with the last time they had issues ... you remmember? With ranked que disablings?\nIt probably had something to do with those lag issues coming right now, they should totaly fix this.\n\n\n\nPS: too lazy to go to my main acc even tho this acc is lvl 2 or so idk :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thiondor","date":"2015-07-18T23:40:31.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having this issue as well.
