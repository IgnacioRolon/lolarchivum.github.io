It can actually detect when someone is inactive in-game for more than a few minutes, or when they disconnect from the game, so it stands to reason that if they were leaving often enough they *should* still trigger Leavebuster.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Riot isn't necessarily \"against\" players dodging, or even leaving, games where they have to deal with trolls, if such cases are infrequent, which would seem to be the case with QAPLA (not to say they necessarily condone the behaviour either, but they don't condemn it outright).\n\nAs a side note, this thread is two months old and should have been left alone.
