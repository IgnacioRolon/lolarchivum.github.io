I assume a forum post?), due to reason &#039;don&#039;t be a jerk&#039;, well that&#039;s probably fine but I have absolutely no idea what the &#039;content&#039; was so I can hardly make an informed decision on avoiding such content in the future.\r\n\r\nWhat you, me or someone else considers to be appropriate at any given point in time is highly subject to interpretation of the individual and their circumstances at the time.\r\n\r\nFurther to this it even mentions I may not have meant the offending content in the manner it may have been percieved, so if I didn&#039;t mean or recognise it as such, if I don&#039;t even know what said content was, what good is that to anyone going forward?\r\n\r\nJust to rant further, this reminds me of when I was doing exams to qualify for a heavily safeworking based position (I can get 100&#039;s if not 1000&#039;s of people killed if I make a serious error in judgement), the pass mark is 80% (I got 93%), but the fellow marking the papers even after I passed refused to tell me what I got wrong.... well let&#039;s just hope that 7% never rears it&#039;s ugly head!\r\n\r\nSo basically, if i&#039;m even going to get slapped on the wrist, don&#039;t be a jerk and just tell me what it was for :)","replies":[]}
