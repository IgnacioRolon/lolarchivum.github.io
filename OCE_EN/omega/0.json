In saying that I don't think I should even lose 3LP or 1LP for that matter. It's probably a stretch but if 3 or 4 out of 5 people agree someone is going to be a complete fuckwit we should be able to vote/dodge and have the idiot lose LP and no one else.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T03:09:34.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that kind of detracts from the game. So you shouldn't lose anything at all just because you had one team-member who wasn't going to help? How can you even know that until you've completed the game?\n\nBut I do agree with the \"vote against the bad player\" thing, just change the punishment. Instead of cancelling the queue and making them lose LP, just make it so that if three or more people vote against a certain player (hidden votes of course) that when the game is completed, the player is told of the negative behaviour they did in the pre-game chat. Repeated pre-game chat violations result in low priority queue. This would also mean that when you're in champ select on the other team, you're less likely to be randomly kicked out of the queue because \"Somebody failed to select a champion\". Sounds great!","replies":[{"poster":"Omega","date":"2015-05-16T05:06:43.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it was more than one, the first pick wanted vayne top and the entire team to build around them, sure whatever. But the last 2 didn't want bot so decided to pick random squishies and spam they will feed.\n\nSo it was 2 to 3 team members, not just one.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T11:37:59.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh...\n\nI'll lay it out. I can't do anything to your account. Nor can I change the way Riot works. The only thing I can do is offer my personal help to you.\n\nWhen you get into a game and you see this sort of negative behaviour start to happen, the worse thing you can do is egg it on. When people start doing that, remind them that this is a game where the aim is to have fun. Of course, that wording will probably get them to hate you, but getting that message to them might make them think about what they're doing.\n\nAnd in the case they are just shut-in their ways, you can still do something about it. Pick up a champion that can assassinate, and use those members as bait (where possible, of course). Rest assured, if they end up straight up feeding (like, 0/12) then they will be sorted with appropriately. Most people who say they will \"feed\" don't actually do everything in their power to give up kills. They just threaten, while actually attempting to play the game, which is where the bait technique comes in really handy. Once you've gotten a lead from this baiting, roam the map and get your lead everywhere. Pings are your friend.\n\nThere's also plenty of guides online that can help you with this particular situation. Jeremy \"Gaming Curios\" has a video on the subject. Hopefully this helps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
