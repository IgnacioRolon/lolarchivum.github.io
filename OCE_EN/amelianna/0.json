I would type something and when they reply their message appears above mine..and then it gets confusing after multiple replies because it&#039;s all over the place!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried repair tool at login screen and it didn&#039;t fix it. Any help? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"amelianna","date":"2016-01-20T10:04:52.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My time zone is correct and it synced with times.windows.com today already.
