If you gain 25 and lose 10, you've got a good MMR. You won't get a number out of this of course, just an idea of whether or not your current MMR is above or below where you should be. oce.op.gg and lolking.com aren't very accurate, I seriously don't trust them one bit xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-04-28T07:31:45.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can check \noce.op.gg\nOr Lolking.com\nBUT these are rough estimates of your MMR not 100%\n\nhope this helps","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-28T07:47:08.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
