After losing about 50LP from games that people ragequit after 5 minutes is extremely frustrating. The game clearly recognises when someone has left the game, isnt there a way to minimise the losses for the rest of the team while the people who leave get the full penalty?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-09-01T23:46:32.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, in the greater scheme of things, that LP has to come from somewhere. If a player afk's a 'winnable' game, then sure it sucks for their team, but on the other hand, it would suck more if you got reduced LP gain if someone on the enemy team decided to afk just as you were about to kill the nexus.\n\nNow you could just take this LP from the AFK, but that brings up other issues involving duoing and having one player agree to lose the LP to prevent their partner from losing LP or promotion games. Also this kind of system would often result in adjusted -90ish LP for a single AFK (or -250 with your 50LP swings), which feels bad, especially if it wasn't your fault and the client froze, or there was an inexplicable blackout or internet interuption. Completely out of your hands, and it already feels bad when you lose 15LP you should have won.\n\nNow I'm not saying nothing can be done. A suggested improvement is that if there is an AFK on your team who isn't partied with you, that the threshold for demotion could be lowered by a small margin for divisions, and a bit more for entire ranks. This would still need adjustment, but I believe it would be possible to buffer this system using the lost LP for players who didn't gain MMR/LP when their client crashes in a game their team eventually won, rather than just redistributing this MMR to the entire playerbase which may inflate players who do not play reguarly.\n\nBut I hope I explained it well enough, that LP isn't just some magic infinite stuff, it's a simplified representation of MMR, and when you win you take MMR, and when you lose, your MMR is taken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DestroyerDa007","date":"2019-09-01T19:59:08.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what riot would possibly say  - Unfortunately this can happen but in most of our games people play in the intended manner. We are sorry this happened to you but there is nothing we can do.\n\nPlayed this game since s2 and its been the same since then. It seems besides punishing them afterwards riot can't do anything/implement a system to reduce LP loses.\n\nUnfortunately in this game its something that\\s part of ranking up.","replies":[]}]}
