A chest requires a key to open, and will contain a shard and possibly some amount of essence (more on all that later). Some details:\n\n- You can earn up to four chests at a time, with one chest slot regenerating each week. Purchasing chests doesn’t contribute to this limit, so even after earning four chests in a week, you can purchase another. You can purchase up to 25 chests per day.\n- Once you earn a chest from achieving S rank on a champion, you won’t be able to earn another with that champion until the end of the season. You can see which champions you’ve earned chests with in your profile’s Champions tab. This chest cap resets each season.\n- If someone in your premade group earns an S rank, you’ll receive a chest as well! The chest you receive is tied to the champion you’re playing, so that champion will be unable to earn more chests for this season.\n- You can only earn chests if you're playing a champion you own. So, if you rent a champion or play an unowned champion on the free rotation, you won't be able to earn a chest with them. However, if your premade partner earns an S rank on a champion they don't own, you can still earn a chest from their S rank as long as you own the champion you're playing.\"\n\nIf that still doesn't explain why you didn't get a chest, then unfortunately it's beyond my area of expertise. Therefore please send through a ticket to support so they can specifically investigate your account.","replies":[{"poster":"Minimachine","date":"2016-03-25T02:31:16.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I played the game I was playing a champ i dont own (free week) could this be the problem?","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-03-25T02:35:51.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's correct. \n\n\"You can only earn chests if you're playing a champion you own.
