No point running tp on Azir because you really need time to set up sand soldiers first but I'm sure you know all this being an Azir man.\n\nWard the side of lane to give side lanes a little bit of vision when he leaves mid. Ping to let them know he is mia and just try match his roam to try even the fight up a bit, there isn't too much else you can do. If you don't match the roam then just try to deny him as many creeps as possible.\n\nI'm sure there will be wiser players out there with some better advice for,you nut that's all that I can suggest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-07T09:41:09.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people purpose feed zed always, they ignore pings when fighting a zed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-06-07T09:18:33.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the replies guys yeah im thinking ill try up my counter roaming and be a little more obnoxious with my mia/danger pings haha!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-07T07:36:09.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but....it's a Zed...he's just broken that way...if he can't get fed off you, he's gonna get fed off other lanes....if he can't get fed off other lanes he'll just scale till late game...if he can't do any of those he'll just wait till someone gets low, then he'll just use his uber mobility to get fed again...\n\nYou on the other hand need to control soldiers, manage your mobility etc...you have it harder just by enjoying Azir...I was in your place before till I realized he isn't worth the effort (but that's just my opinion)","replies":[]}]}
