No surprise there's a lot of diamond/plat/gold in there.\nIt would be great if they had a normal game mode that capped the rank.\nUnranked vs unranked only, bronze v bronze only etc etc.\nI know there's a heap of smurf accounts and boosted animals that could still play, but I don't think it would be as many as an 'open game' in norms as it currently sits.\nPlus I don't see why people would bother logging into their smurf just to play a matched norms game to win, without advancing that smurf account. Whats the point of having the ranked smurf account if you're not going to advance it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-08-12T16:38:52.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most plat 5 players are boosted anyway lol.","replies":[]}]}
