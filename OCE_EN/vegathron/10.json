Isn&#039;t the point of the Victorious skin to be a champ that was relative in competitive the entire season? Maokai was a flavor for like a month at the end of spring split and beginning of Summer split.\n\nJust off the top of my head here are some champs that deserve it way more than him: ashe azir cass ekko gnar gragas graves irelia jhin karma kindred nidalee olaf trundle viktor vladamir\n\nProbably missed a few but thats just off the top of my head.\n\nMaokai? Really?\nHaving finally reached Gold this season I have to admit this is a huge let down. There were so many good options and you picked a super binary, boring as hell, out-of-meta champ. Sorry to sound salty but to be perfectly honest I really am. What a disappointment.&quot;\n\n\nThis is also MY 1st time of finally achieving gold now i feel like i could go int feed back to bronze 5 and wouldnt even care that much. buzz officially killed.\n\np.s. azir sacrificed himself in vain. rip azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-10-01T12:29:28.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where the darn heck is my god damn Victorious Urgot or Victorious Karthus if we are picking champs that are super in the meta and usefull, maybe even Vic Udyr after they nerf him another 5 times.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-02T22:07:09.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we need victorious urgot.\n\n\n\nJust like we need star guardian urgot.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-02T22:48:50.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least Star guardian Jinx makes a reference to star guardian Urgot, thats probably as close as we will ever get.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-01T12:01:59.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont dare give it to Azir! not till i get gold!\n\nI am legit thanking the gods that he dodged the bullet this time!","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-10-01T12:39:30.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was this year or never cuz hes dead now after nerfs and wont be played till he gets changed","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-01T22:09:51.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good","replies":[]}]}]}]}
