I find Veigar works well against Ahri since new Veigar can push back really hard and make it hard for Ahri to farm and sustain in early levels and you can 100-0 her alot earlier into the game than when she can do the same to you, making it hard for her to look for opportunities to go for the kill early. Don't try to outgank her, either stay in your lane or counter gank her since your Stun Circle is better in 2v2s and 3v3s than her charm.\n\n Alot of ahri's potential is in skillshots and so her positioning and how she plays the lane can be a little broadcast when her ult is down since most of ahri's power (though not damage) is tied to her ult and you should be very careful if she leaves lane whilst she has her ult as a good ahri will be able to make some very creative and effective roams. Burning Ahri's ultimate with a jungle gank is highly effective because without her ult she has to play alot safer and she won't be able to make many big plays without it. \n\nAnother key point to remember when fighting ahri is that often when going for the kill an ahri player will fire off all her spells with her first dash, meaning if you can dodge it, she'll be vulnerable for a few seconds until her rotation of spells come back up. If an Ahri engages with her ult, she'll generally be planning on dodging your abilities with it, however, after casting her ult, there is a slight delay before she can cast it again, and this brief window is when you'll be able to nail her with all your spells.\n\n Other general tips is watch out for the return q damage since this damage is true damage and this will hurt alot more as you start to enter the mid and lategame. Most of her burst damage in the midgame will come from her w, whilst her bread and butter poke will always be her q and lategame her q becomes a terrifying burst spell thanks to the true damage (which becomes more painful as you begin to rely on inbuilt mr scaling or defensive items like abyssal, so i'd personally suggest buying hp or for ad midlaners the edge of night). If you stand in the middle of minions ahri's q can be hard to dodge and will also heal her more so I'd suggest standing to the side as this forces her to re-position to get a good trade off, this can also be used to force her next to a sidebush which can make her easier to gank. However if it looks like she wants to go all-in standing nearish behind minions can lower her damage potential just a bit or force her to go further in which makes it alot riskier for her. Another very very scary thing is that if an Ahri player can clip you with the very end of her q, you'll take damage 3 times. I'm still not sure if that's twice on the regular dmg or twice on the true dmg but it hurts alot more, counterbalancing this though is the fact that it's very hard to land like this and very easy to dodge, meaning if the enemy ahri is trying this, unless they're very very good, you can generally just make them miss by moving to the left or right a bit.\n\nThat's about all I can think off, I'm sure there's more but that's as far as I know, oh and Ahri's auto attack animation, whilst good, does have some latency after she's begun that orb twirl but before she launches the auto attack, so that's the best time to harass her when she's csing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-17T04:12:48.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the help guys some good info here. a particular problem i have been having is: i see the matchup and decide as vel right im just going to waveclear and play it safe. then the jungler always wants to try and make big early plays usually in the enemy jungle which compels me to follow as the ahri goes to counter the play and we all endup dying in enemy jungle =( with the jungler flaming me and then continually doing the same thing over and over when all i wanted to do is farm mid","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-17T05:24:13.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well for this you want to ward more and also take barrier/exhaust and ping the jungler not to come to your lane if you think you're going to get counterganked.

If he roams and encounters trouble, judge whether you should provide assistance. Don't suicide for the sake of the jungler either. If he wants to go deep in the enemy jungle, watch mid lane and ping should the enemy mid leave. If you feel it safe enough to go, you should, but don't feel compelled. If the jungler proceeds to flame you for whatever happened, mute him and report him at the end of the game. It's the best way to ensure you have the best game possible without toxic players interfering. Ultimately all you can do is control your own game and your own champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-19T00:35:53.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers i will try this next time and cross my fingers they listen =D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The shade o nigt","date":"2016-12-17T13:59:03.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play jg and top.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-19T00:29:27.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my two worst roles sadly haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-12-17T03:03:30.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahri to me at least is more of a safe pick, shes not super strong but not super weak, her poke and charm are both skillshots her w has low range, take a lane bully and destroy her pre6 or dont bother fighting her and play the wave clear game with a tp so you can match her if she roams or take cleanse\n\nwhile i dont really recommend i have found success against her as mid miss fortune with cleanse i built ad bullied her and just waited for the team fights to start","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-17T03:35:41.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why do people take immobile adcs mid against assassins?

Don't play an ADC mid when you have champions like Zed and Yasuo available, who do arguably well against Ahri. Zed can essentially avoid all her poke, and retaliate either by poking her back or going in himself, and Yasuo can nullify all her poke if he times his wind wall right, and has multiple dashes himself if he positions himself right.\n\nAs previously mentioned before, champions such as Syndra and Annie do well because they can burst her down easily. I'd also imagine Cassiopeia to do quite well against her, as her Q is easily place-able if Ahri was to dash in. Cassiopeia's W also prevents Ahri from dashing in/out or flashing away which can be good should she try to escape. Also if you're quick enough, you can ult as Ahri dashes in and then proceed to burst her down with your E which resets quite fast. Ahri is easily in the top 5 strongest mid-lane picks and has been for a long long time.\n\nOverall, your champion pool is quite weak against her. Malzahar was a really strong pick against her but as you mentioned he got nerfed. Diana can be a good pick provided you build MR first item and are able to complete your Q/Ult combo regularly and you can cancel one of her dashes too. As a Vel'Koz, you really need to predict where she's going to dash to and try and position your E there as it will cancel her dash and for a short duration incapacitate her and prevent her from doing anything. You must wait for her to use E (and hopefully miss) before turning around to ult otherwise it becomes useless. \n\nUltimately as immobile mages you must play safe and avoid her post-6 otherwise you can just surrender because if she gets fed she can steamroll games and smoke all competition. She was much stronger until they nerfed her so you can be thankful for that too.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-17T09:10:01.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that immobile mages like veigar, annie, syndra (much higher skill req for this matchup) and ziggs are pretty decent against ahri, just don't play adc's midlane into an assassin, it doesn't go well in any equal skill matchup.
