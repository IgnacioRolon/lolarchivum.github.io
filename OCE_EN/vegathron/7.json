(you must build in order, so example to build a stinger id die, get 1 dagger, drink 5 penalty drinks to get the 2nd dagger, then on my next death i can finish it into a stinger)\n-drink 1 drink per death. and an additional drink for a death spree. eg ive just died my 5th time in a row, so i drink 5 drinks for that death\n-if you get shutdown drink the number your spree was upto. 6 killing spree so i drink 6 drinks for example\n-drink 3 if you lose a tower (in mid) and also purchase 1 additional component next death or back.\n-drink 5 if you B (but remember dont buy unless you die) alternatively walk back to base and only drink 3.\n-drink 5 if you fall 50, 100, 150, etc cs behind your opponent.\n-finish your drink if your mid inhib falls\n-game ends after inhib is destroyed.\n\nit looks complex but its actually pretty easy to remember once you play a few times we had a blast (and ended up drinking alot lol) hope you guys have fun!\n\nExtra rules if you guys play more than 1v1\n-if an ally dies drink 1,\n-if your team gets aced drink an additional 1 ontop of each drink per ally death\n-(if its teams and you want to add in drag/baron) if you get dragon/herald enemy team drinks 3, for baron enemy team drinks 6\n\nplz drink responsibly;P and remember, never drink and ranked!\n\nClarity: just incase anyones not sure when i say something like \"drink 5\" i mean 5 swigs/sips of your drink not the entire cup or shots haha","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-13T01:43:33.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this does not sound like drinking responsibly, since depending on the drink, for most drinks 3-4 shots will get most people pretty drunk and after 8 you'd be wasted passed out on the floor, excluding maybe the odd 7 foot tall irish bricklayer and even he'd be a little tipsy on drink 9.","replies":[{"poster":"morekaks","date":"2016-10-13T02:58:45.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"8? really? thats not much i drink way more than that and i dont even drink haha","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-13T06:15:12.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you irish?","replies":[{"poster":"morekaks","date":"2016-10-13T19:57:30.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah im moari from new zealand lol","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-10-16T04:12:57.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's why you guys are tanks when it comes to holding your drink","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-10-13T02:38:28.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who said anything about shots? when i say drink x i mean drink x sips/swigs of your current drink. i think youd be in hospital before the 1st tower fell otherwise haha =P i edited a bit at the end to clarify for others haha","replies":[]}]}]}
