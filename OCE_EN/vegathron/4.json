I know we’re normally pretty silent about this type of thing (gotta keep our enemies in the dark), but seeing as how it’s probably the 3rd largest salt mine I’ve ever excavated, I figured we’d give a little advanced notification. \nI’d also like to cunningly make use of everyone’s eyeballs as a reminder that we’re definitely not into applications that provide measurable player advantage. The cheating we’re targeting here is primarily comprised of modifications that take actions on your behalf (affectionately called scripting), and that’s our least favorite type of mojo. It’s probably been said before, but this is meant to be a fair videogame and you shouldn’t ever have to go digging for add-ons just to stay competitive. \nWe've got a lot of work to do in preventing this behavior from occurring in the first place, but rest assured, the banhammer won't stop swinging until the message really sinks in. \nTL;DR - Bans for days. Stop scripting. Thanks!\"\n\nrip automated banwave thinking they banned a scripter, in reality its only my good ol mate who only plays shit champs, er ,, kogmaw and wont change his ways. lmao rip.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-09-17T11:17:44.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When does the ban expire?","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-09-18T03:16:48.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think it was February 22nd ish","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-16T13:08:10.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell him to submit a support ticket...","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-09-16T13:36:29.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you do that when u cant login to forums? or do u not need to be logged?","replies":[{"poster":"EyeOfSaturn","date":"2016-09-16T16:36:29.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Head on over to https://support.riotgames.com and click sign in.
