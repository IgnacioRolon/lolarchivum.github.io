The victorious skin could also be decided by any unusual and effective picks made at worlds though, so something like victorious ezreal or kled or something might not be out of the question either. My bet though will be on zyra though since she lacks skins and she's been quite a popular staple in this seasons poke support role.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-09-04T06:10:52.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah then again there was the rein of Korean Build Lucian.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-04T11:47:33.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but I can't imagine victorious lucian given how he's lost his wife, what's her name. Unlike the other victorious champions he doesn't really have a win scenario; he just sort of lives for revenge. Like morgana has got a revenge focus too but her end goal is to defeat kayle and her fanatic justice and give her people freedom. Even janna want's to protect something and give order and safety to zaun. They all have an end goal that really encompasses a kind of victory whereas lucian just lives for revenge and to destroy the shadow isles. It's not really victorious so much as goal achieved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-04T06:46:45.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Was\" mate.. there is no \"was\" in bronze/silver... that shit stays around for years...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-03T14:36:38.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want Victorious Ahri...\n\nIt's not like she needs a 24th skin...","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-09-04T09:38:10.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can imagine it but she already has challenger which i feel like sorta fills that skin slot somewhat, same with championship skins","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-03T09:06:41.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im guessing Azir, just because I'm not gold and of course it'll be one of my mains.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-09-03T08:26:55.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah ekko should be...","replies":[]}]}
