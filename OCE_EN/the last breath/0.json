To be honest with you my sister introduce me to this game and when i first started playing this game people call me a &quot;Noob&quot; which have no clue what they meant, but later on when i keep on playing i soon learnt what the word means. My ever first champion i played was Kog&#039;Maw, Veigar and after that i basically started with the simple champions like Ashe. Annie, Ryze and Master Yi. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to get to level 30 because when you reach your maximum level you can be eligible to participate in rank, now I&#039;ve been told rank is for players who wants to get into any division basically starting from the bottom climbing your way up to the top for example Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master and Challenger Division.  I have to say I regret myself  playing rank. I&#039;ve been put in Bronze 5 ( or I could just refer it to Cardboard 5 )  in Season 3 climb to Bronze 3, the season before i didn&#039;t participate in rank so i wasn&#039;t placed and now for this season I&#039;ve been place in the same division. I&#039;m an average player since when i started my favorite role is ADC, but also can play the other roles as well. For those who may think this is totally out of your mind but I&#039;m a Deaf person who plays lol, not sure if there is anyone out there who is Deaf and that plays lol if there is please comment below! much appreciate it. I know you guy&#039;s want to Judge me because Alot of players that I met in the game are not deaf, they are either girls or males in different age groups. \r\n\r\nFurthermore I like to discuss on how I think the game community plays a role in this, have to say that I&#039;m sad that many players who are rude, take the advantages of other people&#039;s business and interfere in games such as flaming at each other, not helping as a team, not satisfying the rules and they tend to break the rules and get reported, i mean you have to be careful because you do not want to be like one of them. Whenever I do rank there is always an AFk or someone who decides to feed on purpose does not make the game a good impression as it will lead to negativity towards other team mates, I would like to say there should be more positive outcomes and a good attitude on playing this game because I&#039;m disappointed on how players are often treated and it&#039;s just wrong. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if you guys will read this, or you may find it boring or not interested it at all then that&#039;s up to you, but I&#039;m willing to take my initiative on saying my words towards the community and throughout this forum. I honestly never doesn&#039;t this before and I would like to hear my word out loud and clear that lol is not a laughing matter, you here to play for fun, meet nice people, play by the community blending in different cultures and beliefs and respecting each other and I don&#039;t see that in may players, there are times where players are just toxic and may need to deal with the consequence in their action. I know this story may be long lol but I just want to express myself and let things out then rather then keep it inside of me because the motto always say &quot; Stick and Stones May Break Your Bones Words Can Never Hurt You But In Fact They Do&quot;. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion no matter how hard I tried to be my best, things always fall apart, I love this game but honestly I dont know how I can cope with this rudeness of players who don&#039;t give a damn about others is just sad. Riot People I love you guys and I wish I can work with you guys but I don&#039;t think I will ever have a chance, please keep league of legends alive because the good players want to keep this in their heart and as a favorite hobbies just like taking a selfie photo and smile and see how special you guys are, everyone is perfect in their own way and they have to find their own pathways, whereas i have to go through life the hard way which is not very nice but hey! I have to deal with it. If I would want to say to you all is -Accept Who  You Are, Don&#039;t Rely on others to carry you and always be happy no matter what, stress will drag you downhill- \r\n\r\nRegards xXThomasXx ( really want to put my full name but I&#039;ve learnt not to give your personal details to anyone that you don&#039;t know of) \r\n\r\nPS: Feel Free to Add Me, its xXThomasXx and i&#039;m on the OCE Server \r\nFor those who are in the NA Server who is reading this i&#039;m sorry but you guys and send me a message, i would love that and follow my twitch which is http://www.twitch.tv/xxthomasxx14\r\n\r\nPS: I&#039;ll do another post of Champions that I like and the builds and etc.. right now i&#039;m falling asleep Zzzz and I need my rest so thank you all for reading my 1st ever blog and hope you guys comment and i&#039;ll reply back to you as soon as possible \r\n\r\n-God Bless- xXThomasXx","replies":[]}
