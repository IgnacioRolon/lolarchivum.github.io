Its easier to hit r early on because most opponents haven't bought boots. In lane phase opponents always move towards their turret when fleeing - it's not hard to guess which direction they are going to try to sidestep. Later on there are no turrets and no obvious escape routes.\n2. Its a good trick to charge q while facing a random direction so that you do not indicate to your opponent where you are going to fire. Then when you are about to fire you snap your mouse over your target and release.\n\nI hope this can explain the xerath player's behaviour/success\n\nAlso your cheating teammates probably turned on their autoevade scripts late game.","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2017-01-15T11:51:40.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey cool, thanks for the heads up.","replies":[{"poster":"Daniel Durag","date":"2017-01-16T11:10:10.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was hitting perfect ults right on top of us while we was moving.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-01-15T21:38:12.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scripting in League of Legends is not a new thing, it happened quite a number of times throughout my time playing the game, not to mention that this happened to me very recently.\nThere are several ways you can use to detect a scripter.\nFirstly, see their actions, like if they go into a lane when there are enough champions on that very lane, and if you chat with them but they do not answer, this might indicate that those champions are script controlled. Other actions may include: willingly give kills, and not retreating back when they are low in health, run into the enemy's turret in spite of the fact that there are no minions within the turret range, and not retreat back when the number of minions are low within the turret range.\nSecondly, if a champion leaves the base without getting any items, tell them that they forgot to get their items, and if they didn't go back to get their items as well as ignoring you, pay close attention to them as there is a possibility that they are script controlled. There is quite a possibility that a script controlled champion will not get items at the beginning of a game before they leave their base.\nThirdly, if there are no script controlled champions in a game, it would be more likely for the enemy's team's turret to be destroyed than your team's turret being destroyed. If you hear 'Your turret has been destroyed' too frequently in Coop vs AI, stay alert, and observe all the champions to see who is scripting.","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2017-01-15T22:28:12.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may be referring to botting.... rather than the performance enhancing 'scripting'.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-01-16T04:10:03.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I was referring to botting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-14T11:20:00.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The clearest sign is usually that the champion may be occasionally jittering and spazzing in clearly unnatural ways as a result of the bot trying to lock onto and switch in-between targets or from it trying to process conflicting orders resulting in that spasm, but otherwise for experienced scripters it may be very hard to distinguish from consistent good plays. So yeah.\n\nJust remember to report any you find eerily suspicious after match, as long as you don't abuse it, and just hope the system does its job.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-15T13:00:39.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a note, don't take this from only one instance, as a good player can still get that spazzing from time to time depending on where they are clicking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-14T11:46:46.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're ever unsure if someone is cheating or not, it's always safer to report them and add something like \"possible [offence]\" to the description.

Probably about half my reports are ones I'm unsure about, and I still occasionally receive the Instant Feedback notifications that someone I reported was punished so it certainly seems that I'm not losing any report weight.\n\nIf I had to guess, the system would pass the reports onto an actual person for manual review if it doesn't understand the attached comments, so it's likely that stating something like \"possible [offence]\" in the comment box will simply cause it to be a manual review rather than done by the automated system, meaning it's logical to assume your report weight wouldn't go down because you've indicated you're unsure.\n\nThat said, I'm sure the Rioters have stated more than a few times that you should report any behaviour you find suspicious, even if you're not sure whether it falls into \"reportable/punishable\" behaviour. After all, the system only works if it's getting reports.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
