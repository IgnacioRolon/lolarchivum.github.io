Recent games have resulted in me being placed against high silvers and some low golds...\r\nI&#039;m assuming this means that their MMR is lower than it &#039;should&#039; be and we meet somewhere in the middle.\r\nThis does beg the question of why do they have a higher displayable rank than me?\r\n\r\nWould it not be fairer and better for our MMR to be displayed in some fashion with the ranking directly tied to it?\r\nIe. at 1200MMR we get &#039;Silver&#039; status, and at 1400MMR we get Gold status.... etc.\r\nWhat was the problem with MMR being shown?

A great Starcraft personality said back in the day that if you are ever playing a game with a ladder your rank ins't what your skill level at however it is showing your improvement which is a very big thing to visually show.\n\n---\n\nNow I understand your points that showing MMR will give a greater idea of what your rank actually his, however I think that there are a few points as to why Riot hasn't done this.\n\nThe first of which being that climbing up the ranked system with the way it is, feels a lot more satisfying and really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you win your promos. Notice how they decided to have a promotional series as a real test of skill as to if you deserve to go up in rating, it doesn't really matter if these are hard for you to win at the time, or just a breeze through they are a stressful few games that choose if you go up or not and the feeling when you make it through successfully feels amazing. This is something that I don't really feel can be matched if you just watched a number go up and down at the end or start of a game.\n\n---\n\nThe other reason that I think it is done through the ranked system is to keep everyone at a somewhat similar pace. Yes if you are climbing and your MMR is higher than your rank you will go up faster if you keep winning with more LP per win. However the issue is if there wasn't the ranked system and it was purely based off of MMR you would have players flying all over the place ranked wise either going up way faster than they should, or snowballing insanely far down if they go on a loss streak. \n\nSo in a sense the ranked system not only slows you down in a sense, but in a good way because you can see your improvement as you go. Along with this if the ranked system was based purely off of MMR, it would be insanely easy for challenger for example to fill up with smurfs because of how easy it would be for them to climb back up there on a secondary account.\n\n---\n\nAnother reason I think would be with how the ranked system is they are able to split people up into different groups of players. Riot has said that if you are for example in Taric's Masterminds players on your friendslist that get to your league have a good chance of getting into the same league as you, just as much as you have getting into the same league as them. This creates friendly competition between friends and you can watch either climb or fall.\n\nIf Riot were to do this through a MMR system, it would be extremely difficult to split them up into groups in my opinion and would give players a very weird sense as to where they were on the ladder. If players weren't grouped you would be rated out of the 200,000 or so players on the server and given a ranking number, however with the way it is, you can see a goal to work towards and it seems within sight and reachable. I think that for me it would be extremely demotivating if the system told me directly what rank I was compared to everyone else in the server, however with the way the system is, I'm motivated to push towards that next division, not just a number.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is any other questions I can answer or anything that you want me to clarify on let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam\n_\n(P.S.
