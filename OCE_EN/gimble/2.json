Any chances of support class being used anywhere besides bot would be immediately nerfed, and combined with the point just above makes support roles a very aggravating experience and utterly inflexible role to fill, hence the vast majority of people avoid it like a plague, again for a very good reason.\n\nInstead of trying to fix a system within a system with more addition of systems, why not just address the root of the problems and fix it instead?\n\nIf we give more freedom to support champions and don't reflex nerf them every single time they do anything remotely extraordinary, this effectively removes BOTH LoL's age-long cripple of being hindered by bot-lane meta creeping, the fact nobody wants to play support, AND the issues associating with role-queue. I say 3 birds with 1 stone, why the hell not?","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2016-12-28T04:21:36.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree with you in that the support role is problematic in its current state. There are people who like the role, but they are definitely less than 20% of the playing population... hence the need for an 'autofill'.\nAs you have highlighted... support 'plays' basically less rewarding personally due to the egoistic mentality of most people... we want the kill ourselves. And secondly the role itself results in gold anaemic play, where you have to get certain items... sightstone, aura items, etc...\n\nBut in the absence of this revamp we are stuck with having to play support occasionally...\n\nSo the better option IMO would be to give people control of when they will be playing support before champ select... rather than randomly when the dreaded 'autofill enabled' comes up in lobby.","replies":[]}]}]}
