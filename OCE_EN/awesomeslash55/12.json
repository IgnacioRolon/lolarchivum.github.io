But theres no leathality on the blue side in the shop. Do you know why? I wanted to swap with attack damage in the blue then I relised in the red side where the attack is it does +0.74 and on the blue side it does +0.28. Why aren&#039;t they the same? Please tell me if theres a lethality on the blue side becuase I saw on videos there is but mayby my computer isn&#039;t loading it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-25T13:57:06.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way the current rune system is set up:\n\nThe \"yellows\", or seals, are more oriented towards defensive stats. You'll get more bang for your buck with things like armor seals or health seals. \n\nThe \"blues\", or glyphs, are more ability oriented. You'll get more bang for your buck with things like magic resist glyphs, ability power glyphs, and cooldown glyphs.\n\nThe \"reds\", or marks, are more attack damage oriented. You'll get more bang for your buck with things like physical damage marks, attack speed marks, and lethality marks. \n\nThere aren't any lethality glyphs currently in the store, so I'm not sure about that. \n\nIf you have any further gameplay questions, I strongly recommend dropping a post in the [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) sub-board, where it'll get more visibility from our community!","replies":[]}]}
