He does well when ganking but he is really bad at maneuvering around minions. It would be nice in the next patch that either that kayn&#039;s e can go through minions or champions can go through their team&#039;s minions because this happened to everyone.\nIt would  nice if someone took this to consider because I die sometimes because I&#039;m trapped my minions and then the enemy kills me.\nThanks\nP.S.
