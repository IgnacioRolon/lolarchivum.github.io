Start raptors with help from your midlander (take w first, but max e first). Then red, and if you're thinking of ganking that side go krugs, and then hank if in position, of not do scuttle\nWhile ur laner sets up for the gank. Zac can gank from some crazy places with his e, makes him one of if not the best jger in the game rn. Make sure u don't smite ur first camp, save it for ur second. As for items, runic echoes with either red or blue smite is a must for AP Zac, if you're snowballing get mejais. For flat AP items, go desthcap, rid of ages, void staff for magic pen, ludens echo gives lots of AP and AOE dmg.","replies":[{"poster":"AwesomeSlash55","date":"2017-07-15T04:37:34.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx a lot!","replies":[]}]}]}
