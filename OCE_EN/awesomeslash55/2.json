I&#039;ll tell you what happened from teh begining. My friend and me started a queue while in the queue I upgraded kayn to lvl 6. We got a match after that and we accepted it. After the game, I got an S and it said I had a shard. I went to my loot but it wasn&#039;t there.\nTell me if its a glitch.\n1 day later today when I go into my loot it says there is data missing and it cant retrieve it. Then it says restart client, I did that 3 times and it said the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-23T08:37:36.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't heard of this issue, so it might be some sort of fringe bug.
