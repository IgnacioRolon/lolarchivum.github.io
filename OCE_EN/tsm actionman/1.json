Solo Q design is really bad with stories like yours and more.  Better to find some players to play with on a regular basis, that way you can build on positioning and match up with each others.\n\nTry and play with atleast 2-3 players you know, it more than enough to win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fukushu","date":"2017-05-08T15:38:03.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand you're frustrated but buddy you're breaking the rules on the forum (name shaming? or something similar) I suggest u just blur the name out and just generally rant about the idea behind people like that ;3","replies":[]}]}
