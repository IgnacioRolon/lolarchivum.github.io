Is there anything I can do to prevent it?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for anyone who can help me.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-11T10:06:13.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis definitely sounds odd, as mastery pages are tied to your account these days.\n\nPerhaps your account is compromised, have you noticed any unusual games in your match history that you don't recall playing? I recommend changing your account password and the password to your email account that is tied to the account (If the same as your league password)\n\nIf this continues to occur however and you're sure there are no signs of compromise then you'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support for further assistance, we here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific inquiries.","replies":[]}]}
