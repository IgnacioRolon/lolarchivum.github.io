Use your Siphoning Strike to stack as soon as it comes off cool down.\n2. Seriously, don't even bother trying to 'poke' or 'harass' your enemy laner with your E ability. It doesn't do much damage early and it costs so much mana, which could be better spent stacking. However, don't underestimate your E, I believe it gives armour shred and does some good AOE damage late game.\n3. Whenever I play Nasus, I usually sit back, relax, and chill out for the first 15 or so minutes and just stack. Then, once you have around 300 stacks, just go ham. One Q will be doing around a quarter to half of any squishies health, and I love how shocked they are when their health bar is just deleted >:D.\n\nI mean you could build damage on Nasus, but even then 90% of all his damage comes from his Q stacks. Unless your building AP Nasus (which is really fun btw, try it out!) don't bother building any damage items.\n\n He needs CDR and mana so he can stack easily. The best item for this right now is Frozen Heart. I always build it first item on Nasus, it's actually super OP on him at the moment. As for boots, always go for either Merc Treads or Swifties, to prevent him being heavy cc'd. Then just go full tank, building depending on what their main damage is. Full AP? Spirits Visage and Banshees Veil are your best choices. Full AD? Dead Mans Plate, Thornmail, and Randuins (if they have heavy crit).\n\nThere seriously isn't many combos for Nasus. It's mainly just slow them and spam your Q ability, while occasionally throwing out your E. However, when going for stacks, if they harass you a little, like an auto or something, just ignore them, however if they go full on Faker mode on you, using their full combo, just slow them, roll out, and gleefully taunt them as they writh in pain (once your under your tower of course xD).\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I'm always excited about seeing people get into Nasus as he is super fun and I wish more people played him :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-19T00:28:28.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you go against kiting toplane try to get a protobelt at some point once you have your core items; trust me it's funny. They think okay nasus can 1shot me but I'll be safe if I stay away from him, protobelt+e+q+triforce+titanic hydra suddenly they're dead and are completely tilted and demoralised. It's also pretty good in teamfights because suddently you can also be a diver. It's highly situational but I have a feeling you'll enjoy it when you do get the chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-19T01:25:05.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, never thought of that.

One thing you should practice first is learning to control minion waves. This generally sits around the concept of 'freezing' a lane where you patiently last hit creeps down to their very shred of HP  to minimize how far either minion side push. You would try and 'freeze' it outside your own turret so that you can free farm and deny your enemy laner CS while forcing them into a position where they can be ganked by the jungler for trying. If you're stronger than them, you can zone them out.  If your laner tries to roam or gank another lane, seize the opportunity to push the lane as hard as you can to pressure the lane. \n\n2. If you're losing lane, you're better off rushing defensive items early on as an iceborn gauntlet is much cheaper than a triforce whilst providing a ball of stats. But if you can farm successfully and keep your lane opponent at bay, then go for trinity force to capitalize on snowball potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-18T08:10:27.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When ever i want to learn a new champ, i have found YouTube to be my friend. There are a few people who stream that are decent enough players and give good tips so i stick to the same channels for advice.\nPersonally I've found watching advice easier than reading advice, the visual makes the info stick better imo for when you practice.\n\nLove playing susan though, he really is a lot of fun when you get your stacks going. Good luck out there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-18T01:30:10.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when playing nasus you have to keep in mind, you will be losing lane for the first 10min or so.\n\n So you need to let them push into your tower whilst you farm under tower and get stacks. Don't get greedy and back when needed. Spirit fire can be dropped to heal and poke but use this as rarely as possible since you want to have mana for your q. Always focus on your q and only tp bot if you are 100% sure your presence is necessary and you'll get some assists. Otherwise stay top and farm and tell the jungler to not go top since you don't want much attention up there. Farm and farm and farm your q, take tank runes, start corrupting potion (since it stacks well with spirit fire and offers best sustain) rush a glacial shroud first item against ad, kindlegem against ap or sheen if the enemy can't play aggressive or dive you. \n\nMasteries should depend on matchup. Against lanebullies and divers go 0-12-18 taking all the left ones in cunning and taking all the right ones in resolute tree up to the grasp of undying (since you stack hp). In more passive lanes or if you are confident in your carry potential you'll want to go 0-18-12 taking stormraiders and much of the same.\n\nYour core items as nasus should be:\n{{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3748}} {{item:3111}}  does more damage, carries harder and new triforce is easily better than gauntlet in terms of individual fighting stats.\nbut if you need more tank stats go:\n{{item:3025}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3060}} {{item:3111}} this build doesn't carry but you make a hell of a tank. You don't hurt as much but you are really hard to kill.\n\nIf they are kiting you out some alternative options are:\n{{item:3152}} which is hilarious and can be extremely useful for diving and works better with the tank build\n{{item:3026}}  really good lategame since if you are carrying, your death can mean gg. Build this on the regular build.\n{{item:3116}} good for escaping if they have a very sticky team.\n{{item:3156}} this item is highly situational but good against say moawkai or ekko, due to the shield, lifegrip and the armour pen.\n{{item:3053}} this boosts the spellblade proc a little and is good for splitpushing or if you are matched up against say a darius and he wants to get up in your face.\n\nI hope this helps. :)\nps: {{summoner:6}}  is a good option over {{summoner:4}}  but it depends on personal preference.","replies":[{"poster":"ZeddJunior","date":"2016-08-18T03:44:52.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"awesome thanks :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-18T01:29:09.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build health and resistance items.
