It's a little different to what you're asking for, but I think you'll be interested in the format we offer.\n\nOur discord server is at https://discord.gg/Ze3a2aK and our latest session announcement can be found on our twitter too:\n[https://twitter.com/_BambooProject/status/1082173291891089408](https://twitter.com/_BambooProject/status/1082173291891089408)\n\nThis invitation is open to anyone else who's interested too.
