I can see what you mean with locking in runes and masteries as sometimes if you dont do it fast enough it wont save and say \"There was an error saving your masteries/runes\", so i suggest making sure you select them as fast as possible. But a good thing is the new runes reforged update being worked on, it will combine runes and masteries and make them editable in champ select making it easier. But i don't think coming here and dropping the F/S bombs continuously in every sentence is not really the best way to report a bug or recommend stuff regarding the client, i suggest going to https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client to voice yourself. \n\nRegards\n~ Not a morgana main pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"ServerLord","date":"2017-06-23T10:37:34.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New client is 'slow' takes a bit more time to load etc, but it is not the issue if you are getting dc'd out. That is your own connection. You should probably upgrade your internet connection (if you are downloading more than you can access aka you might have 300 gigs peak and have used it), also if you have anyone else in the household (sisters, brothers, parents etcs), using their Iphones or android phones, they will be hogging alot of bandwidth. Also other laptops or computers. Since these all take alot of your download, but the Iphones and android phones to some extent HOG upload to the point that even if you have 2meg (2000+ kbps download), if you only have a .25/.75 meg or mbit upload, your came is compromised. Australian internet is horrible, and during the 5pm to 11pm timeslot, pretty much all the major companies ISP'S reduce the bandwidth, and netflix has been a big BIG problem in australia also. So call your ISP and don't jump onto the OCE boards and blame those that have nothing to do with your bad internet. \n Go talk to your family at the house and ask the  to turn of their phones wifi, or access your modem and disable it. \n   Also, read up how your internet provider is ranked, specially during time slots and location. I know for a fact since netflix came out, I have changed 3 different providers and all reduce the speed for download and upload around 5-6pm to 11pm +.","replies":[]}]}
