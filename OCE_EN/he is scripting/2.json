I played every chance i got, now? i rarley play.\r\n\r\nRiot i loved you game it was amazing, i especially loved the tribunal system because it showed us that players were getting punished for there toxicity...... \r\nAnd then things changed. You started putting more focus into pumping out champs and running esports than fixing the issues already in the game. there are so many champs that need work and bugs that need fixing but you don&#039;t seem to care about that now. All you seem to care about is releasing new champs and poorly made skins. i get it you want to keep people interested but your going to lose more players by leaving all these issues in your game. \r\n\r\nplease riot can you start fixing your current champions and bugs instead of focusing on everything else? also could you bring back the tribunal system it was awesome.","replies":[]}
