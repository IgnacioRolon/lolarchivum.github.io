I main mid fizz, and as an assassin and game carry, to win games i must focus on buying items, not spending gold on control wards. Often, in these cases where i need to prioritize items over warding, I miss out on getting even an S- due to lower vision score, even though I carried and we won the game.\n\nI win more games when I don&#039;t buy wards when playing hard carry champs, so i will keep getting A&#039;s due to lower vision score. Doesn&#039;t make sense to me though... or maybe if they just excluded control wards from counting towards vision score it would work better.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-07T15:42:32.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"One word:\n\nTrinkets.\n\nThey are *completely free* and will allow you to maintain a reasonable vision score when used correctly.\n\nMaybe you should just stop ignoring what is essentially a *free* item slot...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tsundere Support","date":"2018-07-07T22:17:18.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have greatly underestimate how crucial vision control is in league...\nSR isn't a map you simply run forward and kill all enemies you see, thats ARAM\n\nA simple list of what good vision control can provide you,\n\n* Spots incoming ganks\n* Track junglers \n* Spots invades  \n* Determines lane aggression\n* Provides good TP flanks and allow split push\n* Objective control\n\nAnd a control ward can deny all of the above at cost of 75g, so what are you waiting for, buy control wards next game!\n\n_Ward saves lives, buy a ward today!_\n{{item:3649}}","replies":[]}]}
