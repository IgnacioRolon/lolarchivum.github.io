I came here to study meaning i had to switch isp, my new isp is Unifone, and from research i realize that Unifone is not the best for playing League and there has been troubles in the past. my issue is that I can&#039;t connect to games on the OCE server, this happens after I choose a champion, the loading screen will become black follwed by a message saying can&#039;t connect to the server please check your connection or something like that. I spent a lot of time trying to fix this or finding a way around the issue and have tried all the troubleshooting provided by RIOT. I checked to see if it&#039;s my league that&#039;s busted or if it is my internet provider, to do this I created an account on the NA server which works fine however with high ping, around 200. I then tried using a VPN to change my location to another country and retried my connection on the OCE server, this worked however with over 600 ping. Honestly I have no idea what the problem is, my guess is that it&#039;s packet loss and to fix this i need to talk to my isp, however seeing as i dont own the isp because im living in a communal flat I can&#039;t really fix it. So is there some way that RIOT can help me out with this, or is my league days over. I hope not because this is the only game i can really play with my friends. please help. \r\nThank you, I hope a riot employee gets this.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-02-05T04:54:59.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThanks for getting in touch - I'm assuming one of the things you tried was going through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide?\n\nOne step that might be helpful - can you run a traceroute from your PC to the OCE game servers  and post the result?
