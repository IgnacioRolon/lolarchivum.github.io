His blades are replaced with strips of broken, twisted metal. He wears ashen, torn, light-armor. The impression it would give would be similar to Demonblade Tryndamere, but where he has been overtaken by the shadow, not fury. His ability particles would focus on what is essentially black and reed smoke particles. \r\nQ- A surge of dark red energy flushes his blade\r\nW- Shards of broken metal flung out, leaving a faint smoke trail momentarily behind them. Red sparks appear upon impacting with a unit.\r\nE- A puff of red-streaked, black smoke where he appears and disappears\r\nR- For this, just imagine the stereotypical smoke bomb being thrown on the ground, but with the same black and red smoke as the rest of the abilities. A cloud of smoke and broken shards of metal are flung out from the center, and the smoke fades. When reactivated, the shards return, leaving a brief smoke trail. \r\nOf course...there would be different animations on the abilities.\r\n\r\nNew quotes would revolve around the corruption of his mind and body by the shadow-for instance:\r\n* Where once was light...only shadow remains.\r\n\r\n* The shadow...it has overwhelmed me.\r\n\r\n* I need more blood!\r\n\r\n* Your allegiances are meaningless to the shadow.\r\n\r\n* Weakness...is not an option.\r\n\r\n* I once had a purpose...but no longer.\r\n\r\n* This power...I cannot control it.\r\n\r\nAnd much more...\r\n\r\nTaunt- probs more than one\r\n* What...? You scared of shadows?\r\n\r\nJoke- Again...will be more than one\r\n* (summons a small cloud of smoke- then coughs) Tell me again why people say smoking&#039;s bad for your health.\r\n\r\nDance: An alternate dance by Michael Jackson (maybe)\r\n\r\nRecall animation: Talon stabs his blade into the ground, and a swirling cloud of smoke gathers around him, then a streak of red strikes him from the sky and he is gone.\r\n\r\nRespawn animation: A flash of red from the sky strikes the ground, and a cloud of darkness forms, which fades and Talon is there.\r\n\r\nAnyways, just thought i would share this skin idea with you guys and girls. Hope you like it and please do give feedback.","replies":[]}
