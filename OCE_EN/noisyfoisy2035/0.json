And i've notice that sometimes in the first part of the match (like 2 mins in) the players have extremely high damage. Is it just me? Bacause i'm bad, but im not terrible at the game, i've a pretty good idea of how to combo abilities and such, but sometimes there's that one player who can hit you with all of there abilities in one go. I'm not talking about like, teemo or pantheon, but like lee sin.","replies":[{"poster":"Sesilan","date":"2019-08-26T22:26:30.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There definitely is cheating software out there available in the wild, but as stated by Broken, most of it is detected fairly quickly, some players do just happen to have an extremely high skill cap, it sucks when you have to go up against someone who outclasses you like that but it is just part of the game and something you'll have to get used too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeadEyeDonni","date":"2019-08-27T05:29:45.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, most third party programs are detected almost immediately these days. Sometimes it can feel like certain champs do a lot more damage early game than others and that's due to a range of things factoring in their items v yours, their natural atk stats v your def stats, their ability to combo, your ability to react to certain combos. Like, for example, back in s6 when riot overbuffed lethality and pretty much 80% of adc mains around the world(we'll say beneath diamond) were complaining that they were getting one shot repeatedly by rengar, talon, zed etc. with zero to no counterplay not realising that all they had to do was take some armor in their runes, and maybe blow a flash to avoid taking a full lvl3 combo from one of said champs. Nowadays though with almost 200 champs in the game their is unfortunately a hell of a lot to learn for newer players aside from all the weird and wonderful interactions between certain champs, like even as someone who's been playing on and off since s2 I feel like there's always new things I learn about this game every time I play","replies":[]},{"poster":"SRE Kekzii","date":"2019-08-27T01:39:44.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot really does not mess around with scripters, I got my first account permabanned when I was Level 23 or so because I was curious, so I downloaded ELOBuddy (an old scripting client thing - pretty sure there was a lawsuit) and I played a few games with it.
