HOW IS THAT FAIR?? i know i am a toxic person and i honestly couldn&#039;t give two fucks if get banned for being toxic but the second I get punished for standing up for myself from a person who was calling a and i quote &quot;A g^% N#$@er F@&amp;%$t, your parents should have ended you the moment they seen you.&quot; To me that should be an instant Suspension or Ban if they have a history of that.\n\nI loved this game so much but now to me this is bottom of the barrel tier.

That system? Because I'm pretty sure a system that isn't even being used is a *terrible* thing to focus your complaints on.\n\nThat said, there is a clear difference between \"defending oneself (and others)\" and \"retaliating to toxicity with toxicity\" (although the best course of action is always to ignore the toxic player and report them post-game, since it provides the least possibility of you getting caught up in their rule-breaking and, consequently, punished). If you can provide the chat logs from the game in question (you should have received an email with the logs included, if not that's something you really should bring to Riot's attention by submitting a support ticket) then we can go through them and point out where you could have handled the situation better.","replies":[{"poster":"Roronoa Zorro","date":"2016-10-17T09:47:12.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh i know where i went wrong, i just find it stupid that you can get punished for standing up for yourself.
