I can&#039;t tell atm if they also lost ranked rewards for prior seasons, I&#039;ll hold off confirming something like this until after S5 rewards go out and I do a more thorough check but it&#039;s good to see Riots actively chasing down these accounts.\r\n\r\n Does anyone else bother to go back through their reports and check-up on suspicious accounts?","replies":[]}
