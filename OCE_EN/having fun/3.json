You either need to turn the sound the whole way up and listen to the loud champion pick/ban sounds in order to hear when its your turn to pick or can turn the sounds off and risk accidentally dodging because you don&#039;t realize its your turn. \r\n\r\nI think it would be a good idea to add &quot;important sounds&quot; as an option that only shows sounds crucial for you as a player (eg, when que comes up, when its your turn to lock in a pick/ban and start of game). This would fix lots of issues and increase the playing experience for many people who watch videos and what not between games.","replies":[]}
