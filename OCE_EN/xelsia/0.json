You can review these terms at http://www.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse Due to the severity of this violation, your League of Legends account has been banned until Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 UTC 9001 If you have any questions, contact our Player Support team at https://support.leagueoflegends.com/home Riot Games Player Support\r\n\r\n This is the first correspondence with Riot that I&#039;ve had in an extremely long time, so I was a little bit surprised to see I&#039;d been banned for a year without any warning. Looking into the matter further, I discovered that someone had gained access to the account and was playing Ranked games (somewhat poorly). At that point I changed my password and contacted support about the matter. They requested I use an alternative email address, and then asked me a few security questions in what looked like a stock email for people who had lost access to their account. I reply, and the next email I recieved was this:\r\n&gt; Dalek Skaros (Riot Games Player Support) May 2, 06:29 PDT Hello, Thank you for providing further information regarding the account in question. I dislike being the bearer of bad news, however your account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here: OCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse Keep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself. We won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. Kind Regards, Dalek Skaros Player Support Specialist &quot;If you have problem, you come to me first!&quot;\r\n\r\nAt this point, I&#039;m a little bit upset. Despite rarely playing League in the last year or 2, I&#039;ve been playing since season 1 and dumping a fair amount of cash into it here and there, here I&#039;m being told that due to some low life somehow brute-forcing their way into my account (which, I should add; I&#039;ve never had any issues with any of my other accounts for other games being compromised, and I have never even paid a second glance to services offering free RP or shared my account details). I&#039;m now no longer allowed to play League on my old and well-fleshed out account, and it doesn&#039;t even look like Riot are able/bothered to do an IP check to see what&#039;s going on. I reply with an analogy of a bank kicking someone out the door because of that person&#039;s credit card being used for illegal transactions by someone else, without even a second glance at what was going on with said card, and I get this email in response.\r\n\r\n&gt; Hello, Our system detected the use of scripts within your games. I hope you can see why it would be unsatisfying and frustrating to play against other players who are using a tool to tamper with the gameplay experience. We took action to protect the fairness and integrity of the Fields of Justice. We have explained the context of your suspension, will not remove or modify it, and consider the matter closed. Kind Regards, Dalek Skaros Player Support Specialist &quot;If you have problem, you come to me first!&quot;\r\n\r\nTo me this seems entirely unfair. I get it wanting to take a toxic account of the system, but why is the victim being punished here? I haven&#039;t been given any warning my account&#039;s been compromised and no warning that actions on it are in breach of the summoner&#039;s code before the nuclear warhead of a permanent ban was dropped on it. Riot won&#039;t even tell me what the script-kiddie was even doing to get the account banned, or willing to give the account a second chance.\r\nAm I overreacting, or is this situation entirely ******?\r\n\r\n**TL:DR OP&#039;s account gets broken into, someone proceeds to use scripts poorly, gets it banned, and support won&#039;t do anything about it.**","replies":[{"poster":"Preddator","date":"2017-05-04T07:26:47.229+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my account is gone now too, riot do nothing to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-04T13:08:15.576+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"apparently they wont believe you, trust me.
