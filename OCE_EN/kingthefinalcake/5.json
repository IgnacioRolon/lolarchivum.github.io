The bounty you are rewarded increases as long as you stay alive.\r\n- Respawning costs gold. cost increases as time increases capping at 1000 at 20 minutes\r\n- Jungle monsters costs a lot of gold early game.\r\n- Gold is pooled together as a team.\r\n- Champs with skins have an increased bounty (Debatable)\r\n\r\n\r\nTell me what you guys think and let the hunt commence!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}
