Back when all hope was lost in the final days of the rune wars. Thidius Spiritmight lead a battalion of warriors on the front lines. Because of this his warriors have grown weak and wary each passing day. The opposing magi shred the very earth to oblivion with unimaginable power, twisting it like it was as easy as flicking their wrists, and his men are but simple soldiers with sword in hand and a shield in another. He knew his warriors are too weak to go on, and so he issued his last order to his second in command. \"Stay hidden\". \n\nHearing this, his lieutenant's heart sunk and Thidius creeped around the battlefield to lure the magi away from his men. He stood at a foothill with only his sword and shield in hand. He then took a deep breath and let out a battle cry so fearsome that it shook the very earth itself. The nearest Magi just laughs and raises his hand and whispers \"that was foolish of you\". But the ground would not stop shaking, it became louder and louder. Until the nearby woods began to tear apart. Thidius' men are answering his battle cry, few but frightening. the magi knew that these men were prepared to die, and so they tried to cut the head of the army. They all blast their thunderous magic at Thidius and struck his shield. Strange magic soon took shape and change the very shield he is holding. He threw his sword and struck the first Magi in the heart and fell. By the time he let down his shield, life left him. His men shocked at the sight do not falter and charged on to honour their fallen commander. With the Magi defeated, his men were only able to recover his sword and shield as his body disappeared. \n\nHis sacrifice led to the victory at the bloodwood forest and became one of the best examples of Demacian history of a commander putting his men's lives before his own. Rokhan looked up to the shield and sword now displayed above the hall of history. \"One day young warrior, you will be able to wield those very same sword and shield and defend this world with your strength\".\n\n**\"Come my comrades, Victory awaits us on the other side of the battlefield!\"**\n-Rokhan on his first official match in the institute of war.","replies":[{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-23T00:12:39.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't like this idea and I can see why riot hasn't done a champ like this yet. If you look all the champs in the game can't go full tank and still deal tones of damage. This hero can. Rokhan can get like 300+ armour and 200+ magic resist and destroy teams as fast as {{champion:421}} can and we all know how broken he is. All the tanks in the game have ad and ap scaling damage abilities do this doesn't happen. In saying this their are some awesome ideas in this champ. Like the lower his health is the more tenacity he has. That is a cool idea. And his healing is great. So the champ in a whole is stupidly broken, none the less some awesome idea's mate :D","replies":[{"poster":"KingTheFinalCake","date":"2015-01-23T05:51:30.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point and I agree, but I havent been seeing any tanks taking the limelight lately and wanted to make a champ with that 'leading the charge' feeling to him in a teamfight, if I name one at the top of my head that has that kind of feeling, Id say {{champion:89}}  would be one. Every champ comes out broken at first but they're eventually nerfed or countered. Thanks for the feedback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trumbe","date":"2015-01-22T15:45:04.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Q's stun time seems a little high.. maybe 0.5/1/1.2/1.5 sec per level etc etc\n\nI noticed there is a few similarities to some other champs skills but a very cool idea","replies":[]}]}
