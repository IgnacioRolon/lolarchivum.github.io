They have had a lot of time and resources to make the community grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nHowever I question the &quot;Games&quot; in their name. They literally have no other game in their arsenal.\r\n\r\nSo RIOT, why not make a new game and expand your reach even more?\r\nRiot, you clearly loved the idea of making more games as your name literally &quot;has Games&quot; in it like a promise to future generations, so why not?\r\n\r\nThey clearly have the resources, the money and you even offer jobs as your site has &#039;Careers&#039; on it.\r\nSo why not? New game? What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-04-10T06:12:05.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out this article that we put released late last year. http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20141012/1549/putting-s-riot-games\n\nIt takes time to develop and make a really good game so don't expect anything soon...but we are definitely looking into it.","replies":[{"poster":"V0ldemort","date":"2015-04-10T14:32:41.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, I can't move to one of these locations to apply, is there any programming opportunities for those of us elsewhere?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-04-11T23:54:05.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nUnfortunately you would have to move if you wanted a specific job.
