Last time I heard, these champions where being looked but the specifics are uncertain. \n\nOthers just need changes to single abilities like as previously mentioned, Galio and Quinn. It so happens I main Galio (full support tank) and Quinn (bot lane ADC) simply because they are underused and I like to show players that they can be used effectively and are viable picks in many situations. \n\nQuinn is fun to use but is one of, if not the riskiest ADC to pick (the fact that she has to get into melee range to access her full damage potential) and can be shut down by most of the meta support picks which is why she is not picked. A reset on vault after she secures a kill WHILST HER ULT IS ACTIVE and a much lower ult cooldown in the early stages of the game will improve her early snowballing (which is much needed as she loses power in the mid game if not fed, making it hard to reach late game where Quinn becomes scary) and clean up potential whilst ult is active making getting in close more rewarding. This should entice more players to pick Quinn.\n\nGalio is the opposite. Players comment on how boring he is (the main reason he isn't picked) but his kit is really strong. Atm Galio could use a new passive as he can become very oppressive against AP champions but quite weak against AD champions which is strange as he has an AoE taunt forcing players to basic attack him. His basic attack is also quite lame for a melee champion. Maybe a 2 part passive that gives bonus AP based on 25% of MR and 15% armour and also every 3 abilities that Galio suffers damage from, his next basic attack does extra damage or something like that. \n\nI'd just like to see underused champions still being picked as they add certain elements to each game which are exciting rather than seeing the same champions each game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-12T14:01:35.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like Brand has been forgotten, I don't play him a lot and I don't really like him but I feel like there's been no changes to him.
