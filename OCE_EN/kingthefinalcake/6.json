One champion had connections with another and stories linked with actual battles made by players like the battle for Ionia. The battle for Ionia has even impacted today's games giving birth to {{item:3158}} . It was so indepth with lore that I could not stop reading their articles.\r\nDuring it's early phase League even had a news section for lore.\r\n\r\nBut what happened to that story driven game?\r\nDid It become more money fuelled? Did it get more focused on gameplay?\r\nIt seems like they want to focus on more champions than lore. Riot pops more baby champs out than the rats in my attic.\r\nAll I ask is a bit of consistency on Lore to satisfy that side of the gaming community.\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-02-13T22:12:35.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more mumu lore pls","replies":[]}]}
