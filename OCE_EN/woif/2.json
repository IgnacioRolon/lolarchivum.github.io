I heard you can get a chance to get him from level 5 honour which I just got today (yay)! However just my luck I ended up getting Medieval Twitch.. I know it&#039;s a 50/50 luck of the draw but I am hoping maybe some way there is a chance I can swap Medieval Twitch for Grey Warwick? I&#039;ll use my skin refunds if I have to.. Warwick was the champ that got me into this game, my favorite character and that skin has always been one that I wanted the most, even look at my username.. \r\n\r\nI know it&#039;s a long shot but I don&#039;t want this Twitch skin I know that sounds ungreatful but I&#039;d get more use and enjoyment out of the Grey Warwick\r\n\r\nHeres hoping. {{champion:19}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-11-10T01:41:57.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, it is not possible to swap the Medieval Twitch skin for Grey Warwick; however, if you reach Honour 5 next season, there's a good chance that you'll earn the Grey Warwick skin, given that Riot doesn't change how the skin is awarded.","replies":[]}]}
