Says you need to make a 3 star champion with 3 combined items. On my first game I did this, got no reward thought nothing of it until I tried again and still wasn't given the reward. This time I screen shot my level 3 Volibear with 3 combined items and I even won the game but was not rewarded for it? I closed the client and reopened it thinking there could be an error that resetting would fix.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or am I actually doing something wrong here. This is the 2nd mission that has been bugged in this mode.. Really annoying when they're so specific too.. Makes playing the game annoying. \r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/jSukILQ\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/yBOA8pl \r\n\r\n- Wolf {{champion:19}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-18T05:34:27.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can click the little picture of the bug in the bottom right-hand corner of the client: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005466327-Report-a-Bug\n\nOr you can head over to the report a bug section of boards on NA (_read the rules for posting and the sub-board guidelines before posting_):\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report","replies":[]}]}
