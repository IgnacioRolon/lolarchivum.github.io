When I first started you needed 25 friend referrals to get this skin. In only had 1 friend that played LoL that showed me the game so they already had an account. Warwick was the champ that got me into the game and loving his new rework. I know that Riot gave us a chance to refer just 3 people to get the skin but unfortunately not many of my friends like to play computer games so I missed out. I&#039;ve always wanted this skin and even more-so now that it looks so much better than before even though it used to look really cool to me. \n\nI highly doubt it but they did bring back Championship Riven, so it&#039;s worth a shot? Give this WW main  a chance.  {{champion:19}}","replies":[{"poster":"WoIf","date":"2017-10-08T01:26:23.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I get my wish after all this time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoIf","date":"2017-02-12T02:59:11.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-02-06T05:24:21.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They changed it ages ago to 5 referrals.

And it makes sense, as only beta testers from season 0 were able to get them\nSeason 1 for Urfwick, Riot has that joke running for like 10 years now.","replies":[{"poster":"WoIf","date":"2017-02-06T06:51:19.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of us don't have that kind of luxury as my friends and family are not into computer games.  They could always use the vintage boarder for them if people want to feel hipster (I had it before it was on sale). I agree the beta skins are a cool thing to show off for being part of the games history, much like Steam developers give out special stuff for those who pre-order games. \n\nThe basis of these skins is that you're required to know people and get them to play enough to get their account up so you can unlock it. Some people have gotten many people to play but their friends did not use the referral link given to them.\n\nA lot of bots were created for people to unlock these skins which I don't agree with. \n\nAnd I come back to the Riven skin. Some people payed hundreds just to buy that skin because you could only get it from Pax after it was taken off store - yet they brought it back I think these skins deserve another chance. Also how about the players that joined and never even got a chance to unlock them? \n\nI have many skins that can't be brought anymore but I wouldn't care if you still could buy them today, some people don't need to feel like a special snowflake having something others can't have.","replies":[]}]}]}
