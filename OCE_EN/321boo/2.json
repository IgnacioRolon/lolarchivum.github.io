I have tried reinstalling, re patching and a multitude of other &#039;solutions&#039; (including running as administrator). When I transfer other people&#039;s league to my computer it works fine until the next patch when the problem reoccurs. I am also on windows 10 but the problem occurred on windows 8 as well. Help would be appreciated.
