It's in the old forums 4 days ago, +1'd, archived, unsolved. \r\nI can't find it anywhere here because this beta forum is a piece of crap (in my opinion). \r\n\r\nPATCHER SCREEN/landing page/whatever. \r\nScreen is too big for the window. Can't extend the window. \r\nHelp?","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-11-26T03:26:29.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I think I remember this. Was this the causing you to not be able to login because the buttons were off the page?\n\nIf I recall correctly this was a DPI issue.\nYou can resolve that by doing the following:\n\nFirst, open your Control Panel. You can do this from the Start menu. When the panel opens, click on Appearance and Personalization\nThen, click on Display\nAnd finally, select the \"Smaller - 100% (default)\" option, then click Apply\nRe-launch your patcher after that and let me know if you're still having issues.\n\nI believe this has solved it for a number of other people.","replies":[{"poster":"The Euphorian","date":"2014-11-26T03:29:26.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's it. \nThis is all I get (see screenshot).","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-11-26T03:31:10.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aw, dang!\nDid you try the method I suggested?","replies":[{"poster":"The Euphorian","date":"2014-11-26T03:34:44.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh, the rest of the comment hadn't appeared yet. \nYes, that worked for LoL but now everything else on my computer is tiny. xD \n\n*sigh* It's been fine this entire time, now all of a sudden the DPI is weird.

Ugh.\n\nYeah, unfortunately that's the issue with it currently.\nOnce you have accepted the Terms of Service, and don't mind some of the news being off the launcher you can change it back to how it was and it will still work as you only need the Launch button at the top.\n\nYou will just need to do this process when there is another Patch or until there is an official fix for this.\nAs far as I am currently aware this is the only workaround for the time being.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
