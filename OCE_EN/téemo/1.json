Especially when it comes to things like 3v3, I was an avid 3v3 player back on the NA servers but moved over when the OCE servers were released and I have been waiting ever since for 3v3, the team I used to play with has since stopped playing the game that&#039;s how long it&#039;s been. \r\n\r\nNow with the new season approaching you can play 3v3 ranked in the other regions as a FLEX, which means you can play 3v3 solo ranked! You have no idea how awesome that idea is to a person who basically only played 3v3 back in the day. To see that we still don&#039;t even have a constant normal queue and they&#039;re coming out with ranked flex for 3v3 is disheartening to say the least. It really feels like RIOT (OCE) doesn&#039;t care about the people who want 3v3 and 3v3 ranked. We used to get constant updates about the 3v3 queue as well, and now we&#039;re lucky to get an update once every year, it&#039;s sad.","replies":[]}
