Now my internet has been having issues and since I have had these issues disconnecting I have stuck to playing with 5 man lobbies (with IRL friends) to avoid grieving other people playing.  Now I was just playing an ARAM with my 5 man lobby and disconnected 3 times for intervals of around 3 minutes a piece. I had reconnected every time, without even receiving an in-game AFKers warning. I had reconnected for a last time where we had turned around the game and won the game to then get in after game lobby to see I had more priority queues? It doesn&#039;t make sense as I am not intentionally leaving the games and am coming back to finish them when my internet regathers itself. I have had my account for plenty of years and have put so much time and effort into my account to be unfairly punished for things beyond my control is not fair at all. I&#039;ve rang my internet provider and every solution they have is only temporary for a couple of days. Now i&#039;m back to work tomorrow after this christmas holiday and don&#039;t really want to spend my afternoons after slugging out work all day to wait 20 minutes at a time to play a game where people are most likely to feed and make it a game shorter than the initial queue. \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t know what you can do about this but yeah some understanding without automated authority would be appreciated, cheers","replies":[]}
