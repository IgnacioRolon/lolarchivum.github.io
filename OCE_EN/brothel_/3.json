I believe i&#039;m better then any Oceanic support at Bard and if anyone disagrees I offer them a 1v1 on the Howling Abyss, Bard only.\r\n\r\nNow I don&#039;t want to impress you all too much, So I won&#039;t run through Nami, Morgana &amp; Janna. (Even though my Janna will blow you away).\r\n\r\nSo after all this banter I offer myself to be the Oceanic All-Star teams support and lead us to greatness.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t promise coca-cola to come from your kitchen sink taps, I can&#039;t promise world peace, I definitely cannot promise to negate Australias Ice epidemic... But what I can promise is great leadership and the best support in Oceania to carry us to the next level.\r\n\r\nSo fellow non OPL Players, VOTE #1 For Brad.\r\n\r\nBecause Brad is your dad.\r\nRad.","replies":[{"poster":"EuVee","date":"2015-09-04T05:40:20.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#bradforoceallstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"lyD","date":"2015-09-04T15:35:14.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"joke thread?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-09-04T11:10:16.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I vote 1/2 for brad.\n\nFor being not so rad. \n\nCuz if you cant stop the ice epidemic then you are not worth considering...
