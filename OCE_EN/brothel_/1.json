(Platinum+)","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hey guys, \n\nAfter parting ways with my old team (Crowd Control Gaming) I have decided to form my own organisation for Platinum - Challenger players to be managed, analysed and in the future to be coached by a professional, alongside a friend (4L Rampage).\n\nWe're running a trial on Sunday at 6PM AEDT (Sydney time). At this current point in time there is 23 people trialing on Sunday but we're looking for more!\n\nWe use Teamspeak 3 as our voice communications, so having this is a must before you trial.\n\nThe trials will consist of putting 10 people at a time into a custom game into the preferred role they wish to trial for, which then Rampage and I will sit in the channel and listen to your communication and spectate the games.\n\nDepending on how many points of interest we receive between now and Sunday will depend on how many teams we will create.\n\nAt the moment we're looking to create 2 solid teams, spend time with the teams and get them entered into tournaments ASAP. We will also run through available times for every person on both teams to find the best time to get you guys training. We are preferably looking for people that are available between 5-6PM to 9:30PM AEDT 3-4 days a week. There will be no weekend training unless tournaments are presented for that weekend.\n\nWe're also looking for an age limit of over 17 years old, there will be exceptions if proven yourself a mature person.\n\nWhat we're looking for in the trials is\n- Your knowledge of the game\n- Your team communication\n- Your attitude towards a losing game\n- Your mechanical play\n- A solo queue rank of platinum 5 +\n\nYour attitude towards others will be a main factor towards being selected, as we don't want any issues and we want a respectful organisation.\n\nIf selected into the team(s) we will ask you to change your name and add a \"4L\" tag infront of your desired username. \n\nSo if you wish to apply for trials, you may add Brad (CCG Dunbt) in game or Andie (4L Rampage).\n\nWe will issue you our teamspeak IP before Sunday and will remind you of the trials once on our friends lists.\n\nWe are eagerly looking forward to seeing you guys trial and to have you as apart of 4Leaf.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nBrad & Andie\n\n- Edit -\n4Leaf A core roster has been locked! \nWe're still looking for a sub though. (Diamond 3+) for 4Leaf A.\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Tribunal","date":"2014-12-12T08:41:40.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played a member of 4L, he was very good.","replies":[{"poster":"Brothel ","date":"2014-12-12T09:24:01.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did you do this?
