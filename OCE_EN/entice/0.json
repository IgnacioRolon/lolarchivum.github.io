I have just recently uninstalled LoL from my computer and reinstalled, to be faced with the exact same issue I had previous to this. \r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me, or put me in touch with someone that can it would be greatly appreciated as this is really beginning to annoy me ._.\r\n\r\nPLS  people of the community, be my saviour","replies":[{"poster":"Lara Croft","date":"2015-08-04T13:27:33.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you running Windows 10?","replies":[{"poster":"Purcevil","date":"2015-08-05T03:22:10.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Purcevil","date":"2015-08-02T06:38:32.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this same issue right now.
