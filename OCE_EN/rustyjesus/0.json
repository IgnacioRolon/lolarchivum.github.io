What if Riot made one day or even a few hours where you could buy skins (heavily marked up) for IP?  \r\nI was thinking maybe for the 1 day you could buy 1 skin for IP for every 1 skin you buy for RP (worth same value) on said day.\r\nWhat are your thoughts? How could they do this and still make money?","replies":[{"poster":"DiablosFiji999","date":"2015-09-17T05:52:40.993+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will be so happy that I will even kiss a Teemo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-16T08:16:35.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about: yes, but no. Make *some* skins available for IP purchase, like the really cheap ones or something.\n\nIt is an awesome idea though, I'd love to have the chance to buy a skin without jeopardising my bank account. We'd need a bit of time though, if they cost 10K IP or something it would take  a **very** long time to gather that - I wouldn't have enough time to get all of that in one day.\n\nBut then they would have an epic sale of IP Boosters hehe..","replies":[{"poster":"Rustyjesus","date":"2015-09-17T03:36:25.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i more or less meant it for those who already have spent hundreds of dollars on the game and have 20k + IP sitting around.  I mean personally i have bought every champion that came out this year with IP and have all the runes * 9.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-17T05:07:25.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I uh, I'm not cheapskate or anything...\n\nHow about a conversion kinda thing? You pay $5 to get 10K IP converted to $10 worth of RP maybe? They still make money that way from *ahem* cheap-erskates like me.\n\nThe idea itself is pretty cool though, I'm sure there's loads of people out there that play waaaaay too much LoL, and even if they don't buy RP they'd have loads of spare IP and nothing to do with it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-17T06:51:11.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can petition all you want, it's not gonna make it come true.","replies":[{"poster":"Rustyjesus","date":"2015-09-18T01:16:56.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all we need to do is give them a reminder and a new look at it and you never know","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T01:02:01.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can dream *sobs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ringbear","date":"2015-09-16T08:25:32.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This has been suggested so many times, and again, rito will say no.","replies":[]}]}
