(at least to my knowledge) I think that it should be made easier to find and read for example putting it in settings in about. I think it would also be a good idea to bring it back to summoners minds.\r\n\r\nMy reason for this is just about every game i see someone on either team being toxic to their team mates and I think the refresh of what riot wants and allows in game would benefit our community. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-09-03T14:57:14.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Riot doesn't care about the community so why should the community care about Riot?\n\nThink about this before you answer.","replies":[{"poster":"satansanta","date":"2017-09-11T00:22:02.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I saw this went away to think then forgot about it. \n\nI cant remember where I saw it but I saw that Riots goal is to provide the best player experience and to be most player orientated game. (not exactly what it said but I cant remember where I read it to quote exactly) \nIn their Legal Jibber Jabber page relating to copyright, when players feel inspired to make things related to league, it states: \n\"We believe that League of Legends should be free, and that encompasses the whole experience, not just the game itself.\" Of course this excludes skins and content they make.\nThey also hold many events where players can get free content, or just have fun, like Ocean week or the new missions. They are also continually improving player satisfaction by changing things (e.g. removing lvl 30 cap to reduce the amount of smurfs that ruin new players games) \n\nBut I do want to know your side, and why you think this?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-11T00:58:21.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can't speak for Dragruler, I can understand their sentiment.\n\nOne of the big aspects that seem to impact the opinions of players is the feedback regarding punishment systems, or rather, the lack thereof. As it stands, the only feedback players can currently receive (through official channels) on player punishments is via the Instant Feedback system, and that is currently restricted to the \"final report\" before a punishment goes through. This results in the assumption that report do nothing, and that only about half of reported players get punished (the assumption usually being the players who \"reacted\" to the toxicity of others).\n\nAnother aspect to consider is that Riot has, on occasion, seemed to place a higher importance on profit than player satisfaction, and while they do need to earn a profit since they are still a business, it makes players feel betrayed, especially when it happens often and/or in situations where it is not necessary. One example of this behaviour is how Riot handled the OCE server skin, which is the only server skin to date that was not given out for free to a select population of the relevant server. Many players (including myself) believe that Riot only promised to commit a portion of the profits from that skin to charity to distract the player base from the fact they were screwing over OCE players.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, both sides of the debate have merit, so long as you take an objective view on the situation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-09-01T07:05:41.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're god damn right :D\n\nI can't do anything about having it in the client, but I will ask the team about maybe giving it some visibility on the boards.

Any idea how hard that is to deal with, even though we still somehow managed to win that game, it is a massive problem for me going through rank and it is a big turn off sometime for me to play ranked games. That's 3 out of 5 ranked games i played yesterday which were trolled another typical day of ranked for me!\nI do file reports on such behaviour, as i don't want others to go through such hell!\nSo i do hope i maybe wrong and that your idea will help make a change!","replies":[{"poster":"satansanta","date":"2017-09-02T23:21:37.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a point in it won't stop it all. I know that that wont happen, but I do know that some people will read it and think twice the next time they are toxic. Some people don't even know about the summoner code, I didn't till about lvl 15, then i heard someone say it in game and i had no clue wtf they were on about.\n\nI also report people who are toxic or int. I will usually tell them to, just so that they know what they are doing is not okay, and if they continue to do it it will likely end with them being banned for some time. \n\nBut here's hoping it makes a pretty big dent in the community, instead of just a little one. {{sticker:cass-cry}} ( i was tryna find a sticker and i saw this and chose this, even though it really doesn't have anything to do with what we were saying i just like it XD )","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-09-01T06:19:19.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That might just be because Summoner's were retconned, your not a summoner, your some random who is here to give 2 cent some money.","replies":[]}]}
