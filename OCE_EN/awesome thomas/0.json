Neutral players will still progress, though much slower, but negative players, even if their behaviour isn't all that severe will not progress. This is about being honourable and improving the community after all.\n\nJust to be clear since there was some confusion about this with someone else, this isn't any kind of honour lock, you aren't prevented from progressing, only on a game by game basis it's being determined that you shouldn't be earning honour.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"awesome thomas","date":"2017-09-29T13:03:19.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"awesome what a joke of a company, trying to have fun with friends cause of this boring game yet they ban me even with an apology in the chat saying its a joke and they still ban me, absolute joke","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-09-29T13:09:55.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your \"Friends\" reported you leading up to the ban.
