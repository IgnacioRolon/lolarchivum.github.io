Hope you enjoy. \n\n{{champion:101}} Pool Party Xerath - 1350 RP Cost\n\nQ - Arcanopulse) Prepares to shoot a beam of water from his gun. (At the moment he puts both his arms up to make a ball of energy, instead put a huge water gun on his shoulder that he charges up)\n\nW - Eye Of Destruction) Throws a Water grenade OR When w is activated a float up pool is made at the target location and he throws a rock or something into it making a splash (Inner circle can be indicated by a rubber ducky or yellow pee or something).\n\nE - Shocking Orb) Throws a massive water balloon which pops and explodes with water on impact.\n\nR - Rite Of The Arcane) Kinda the same as W so ye water grenades OR combine q and e together so that he has a water grenade launching gun on his shoulder that he then shoots.\n\nBasic character) Practically all the electricity in his body is replaced with water. \n\nIt's a great time to introduce some new pool party people, hope you like the idea, just a bit weird that I did all this for a champ I don't even play. Maybe the skin would change my mind and many other players as well.\n\nHope you like the idea.\n\nZILEANS GOT SWAG{{champion:26}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-10T05:03:05.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or...\n\nPool Party Zac!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-10T04:56:06.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad concept","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-11-27T03:42:12.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd  make this a 1820RP skin.\n\nJust because of all it's effects.{{champion:74}}","replies":[]}]}
