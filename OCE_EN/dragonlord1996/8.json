It&#039;s really annoying that it happens on any game modes every single time I play. I have tried fixing the client and re-installing my graphics drivers to no avail. Thankfully I have League of Legends on my SSD so reconnecting back to the game takes only a few seconds. I will try to re-install League of Legends some time later.","replies":[{"poster":"Rogher","date":"2016-10-15T04:22:06.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/AEYHEbHf-league-crashing-after-new-windows-update","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyguys445","date":"2016-09-18T11:50:23.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens to me to, but every time i go back to the fountain I crash again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"geriSTORE","date":"2016-09-13T15:05:57.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here","replies":[]},{"poster":"tzighi91","date":"2016-09-11T12:28:20.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem,i don't know what to do...
