Yes I know I play alot of normals and team builder and dont have the nuts to play ranked since I have a slight fear of playing ranked even though I'm Bronze 2. Disregard the shitty ADC Builds with the Essence Reavers was just testing to see how it would work. I can tell you that the matches I had were against 2 Rivens and Tryndamere in the picture above. Yes I know that Teemo counters them but I want to see some other people opinions about it.","replies":[{"poster":"ADC or Cry","date":"2014-12-07T08:14:29.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won a game as AP rengar, quick LCS teams learn the pro strat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-10T08:59:14.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank teemo new meta, kiddies and jelly haters gonna dislike!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T09:58:33.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anythings viable in bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-12-08T07:11:41.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will definitely work better with enemy AD-based comps - he can certainly be a brutal split pusher with that kind of build against those comps. Without a solid AP threat, blind + high MS + frozen mallet + shrooms would be super frustrating to play against.\n\nIt depends what you mean in terms of viable though - certainly seems like it could be good in the right circumstances!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MouseDestruction","date":"2014-12-07T09:46:05.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played it a few times in silver ranked games. Works ok just gotta make sure your not the real tank (he cant out tank a real tank vs like aoe and stuff). I've beaten jayce's and other champions with it who should rape a teemo. Although i usually build it different to you as more of an ap or hybrid bruiser. The one problem with it is he loses alot of his ability to assasinate someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-07T13:58:42.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly think AP Teemo is more viable often, but I think Tankmo is a good idea if it allows you to battle your counters. So maybe it could be a situational thing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-07T05:09:48.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, you a Satan worshipper?\n\nOh I will find you, and I will hunt you down you hear me?","replies":[]}]}
