This is me playing some Jinx in Team Builder. So I decided on building 4 Infinity Edges. By the way I lost this game due to being a 3v4 match.To any of you saying that what a shit build on Jinx I'm a Bronze let me build what I want.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx6BIWsLURQ","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qx6BIWsLURQ/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* So many months ago I was bored and uploaded some videos and this was one of them. I had some fun with stacking Infinity edges when they were 25% Crit ratio with Berserk Boots. But people are stupid and got 2 dislikes over 1 and did not read my crappy description. This was in Team Builder, I am a Bronze and I intend to stay crappy and not really improve at the game, 3v4 against a Teemo and a Morgana which means I can&#039;t do crap. Before you say that you shouldn&#039;t stack Infinity Edges because they don&#039;t stack it just that the PASSIVE DON&#039;T STACK but the Damage and the Crit do plus Jinx&#039;s Q passive this was fun. Rant over. Any comments and no this channel is more or less dead, don&#039;t really intend to upload videos anymore unless if I managed to learn to edit videos and not upload videos raw.","replies":[]}
