During intensive moments was noticing some fps drops down to the 30&#039;s until when we were about to loose the lag is extremely prominent which drop down to the teens when Kindred skills pops everywhere on the screen. My system should handle this game without any sweat but why did it go down onto its knees. Here are my specs: \n\nXeon 1231v3 \nCooler Master Hyper 212 with 2 fans\nR9 290 Sapphire Tri X OC \n8GBS RAM \n750w EVGA Super Nova G2\nCrucial MX100 256GB which League of Legends is on\n1TB WD Blue.\nCougar Spike Case with the side panel off.\n\nPS. I lost that game, Mord is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"truc2ouf","date":"2015-10-23T02:08:45.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when there is a kindred my game i have hudge fps drops too.
