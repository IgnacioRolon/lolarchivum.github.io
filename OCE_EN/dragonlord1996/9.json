Lets say that I was running in a specific direction then quickly change to another direction. The problem is that the animation jumps and jitters instead of turning normally and the fix to it is capping to 144fps and its normal.

As you have noted, the workaround is to set it to 144fps - which is about as fast as most monitors can display anyway!\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"dragonlord1996","date":"2015-08-18T11:49:34.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thank you I thought I was the only one.","replies":[]}]}]}
