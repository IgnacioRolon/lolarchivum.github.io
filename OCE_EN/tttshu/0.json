His only cc pre six is his q. Which gets block by minions. And his w is extremely mana heavy. He'd have pretty good Tele ganks and roams. And would be able to wave clear ok. I just don't see where you get very strong from. The top lane tanks will be tankier than him in lane and the top lane carrys will probably do more damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-03-27T13:21:54.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you've ever played mumu you would know this haha","replies":[]}]}
