I usually play ADC/Supp and can also play top and mid. The jungle seems to have changed so I don&#039;t think I&#039;m quite up to that yet.\r\n\r\nLeave you role and IGN down below.

Similar sort of thing - been playing on and off for about a year because of uni getting more hectic.

Yeah I feel you man, uni takes over most things during semesters. I played a couple of games today and man I suck now. They weren't even ranked games.
