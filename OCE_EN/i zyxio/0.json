When you respond in a negative manner you're just giving them what they want, and at the same time you're becoming a problem to the rest of the players just as they are. The best way to approach it is to simply mute and report them if they don't stop after asking them politely. If you don't mute them they will just continue getting on your nerves, and you don't need to see what they are saying for your report to work.\n\nIf you are having trouble responding to players like this, I'd suggest using the Mute function more liberally, or even moving the chat box off your screen. Continued behavior like this may result in a permanent ban, so try and ignore these people and stay positive. For guidelines on how to be a sportsmanlike player, I'd suggest reading the following articles;\n\n[The Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/)\n[Behavior Worthy of a Champion](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874)\n\nA competitive PvP game like LoL can be stressful at times, so next time you're having a bad day you might want to do something less competitive, whether it's Co-op vs. AI or RGM's in League or just doing something else.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-06-21T13:41:32.351+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like your typical toxic ADC blaming support role from the beginning. I would have muted you from the start as soon as you started harping on about the cannon minion.\n\nI play a lot of support and see this all the time. You started about him not killing the cannon minion then once you died you played the blame game because he didn't take exhaust.\n\nAlso to be honest without seeing the other chat logs it seems you like initiated the shit throwing most of the time. Cannon minion remark first, then exhaust comment, crying to jungle, this team comment, another failed team fight comment, sb remark... from the logs those comments seem to come out of nowhere and would appear you kept initiating the toxicity and they reacted.\n\nFrom then on you were just as toxic as most people in league and they probably reacted to you just as much you did them.\n\n14 day seems fair to me. I've been chat restricted for less so thank yourself lucky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu3 burgler","date":"2016-06-22T06:58:30.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it can be very very hard tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blu3 burgler","date":"2016-06-22T06:58:02.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My trick for toxic people is don't talk to them at all until it gets out of hand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ezpenta1234","date":"2016-06-18T05:18:48.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven players zzzzzzzzzzzz","replies":[]}]}
