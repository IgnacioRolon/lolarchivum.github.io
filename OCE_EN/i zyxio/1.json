You become just as bad as they are if you do.\n\n In your additional notes part, you seem to be implying that other people's poor behaviour justifies your behaviour. It doesn't.\n\n+ Your chat log was definitely out of line with what is acceptable in League, but TBH I wouldn't classify it as toxic. For the most part your responses were pretty controlled, although that might be because I'm used to seeing much worse.\n\n_Why you were banned for this:_\n\n+ If you got [perma-banned](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2) for this it means you've gone through: a 10 game chat restriction, a 25 game chat restriction, a 14 day ban and then continued your behaviour.\n\n If you didn't have a report history, it's likely this game would not have triggered a punishment IMO. But you do have a long report history and the system viewed this as a \"last straw\" of sorts.\n\nThat said, I think it wasn't the best call for the system to ban you for this game. You might have a good shot if you send your claim to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and talk it over with them.\n\nMaybe with a bit of luck we can get you back on the Rift soon :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-09T00:44:29.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep you be riots bitch and take the abuse, because they are a 4 man, and won't ever get banned because 1 report means nothing, and no enemy team ever reports anyone, unless they are being salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-09T03:41:51.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely not. I would never expect anyone to \"take\" abuse. The whole point of the mute button is so you don't have to keep exposing yourself to that stuff. \n\nIf **i Zyxio** had of muted these players and reported them after, instead of getting involved with their trolling, this whole situation would have been far better.\n\nAlso, any reports after the first have no impact on the system at all. All you need is one report and a bit of evidence! :D","replies":[{"poster":"i Zyxio","date":"2016-07-09T07:50:33.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you think i should just move on? make a new account and start fresh?

Good see you're interested in taking the next step forward :D\n\n**Whether you move on or make a new account is up to you;**\n\n+ Personally, I would consider how much you actually enjoy League. Sometimes toxicity can stem from people who continue to play this game, even though they've grown to hate it. \n\n It might be a good idea to move on to something else if you think you're in that category. Otherwise, a new account and a fresh start would be the way to go.\n\n**How to prevent this from happening again:**\n\nI have so much advice on this we could be here forever. I'll shorten it to a few main points, but if you want more feel free to ask.\n\n+ _Don't be afraid to use the mute button_\n\n I'm guilty of this too. I often think that _\"I'll just ignore him\"_, but by the end of the game I realize that I feel terrible and super tilted.\n\n We're all humans and sometimes it's tempting to give the trolls a taste of their own medicine. Muting them is fairly effective at preventing you from going all out on trolls and scoring yourself a ban.\n\n+ _Dick Sucking Theory (DST)_\n\n Stealing this one from mah boi **Sky**. It sounds stupid but it swear works XD \n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7TWpRXyRY)'s a video of **Sky** explaining how it works, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flUruPbPi8U)'s DST working in-game.\n\n Essentially, you're just so positive that it's hard for your team to tilt and flame, this should help keep people from getting on your nerves. I've also heard that it becomes a habit to mask toxicity. DST users will call them a retard through the screen then type _\"aww unlucky we still got dis doe ;)\"_.\n\n+ _Never play when you're feeling like shit_\n\n It seem like a good idea to sit down and play some League after a bad day at work, but this is often when good players get lost a little bit and go toxic.\n\n It's hard sometimes, but letting it go for a day and maybe watching streams is often a good idea. Once you're in-game and starting to feel the flame, it's much much harder to calm down.\n\nI know a few of these are hard for a true alpha like yourself, but I swear in the long run they'll work out.\n\nGood luck man! :D","replies":[{"poster":"i Zyxio","date":"2016-07-10T01:31:31.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the replies! ill be sure to use DST in my ranked games to prevent my team from being toxic in the first place and now i might actually start using that precious mute button too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-09T13:41:33.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also, any reports after the first have no impact on the system at all.
