How does a high ranked player (plat+) get an account that is only low bronze without deliberately throwing games or buying the account?\r\n\r\nMost ranked games seem to have a smurf/booster in them for the last couple of weeks. Sick of it. trying to build my rank and so many game wrecked because of these smurfs and outrightly cheating boosters.

Low, Mid and High ELO!**\n\nIf you want OCE to grow, smurfing under mid silver needs to stop! 100%. This will allow new players to slot into their ELO nicely and grow at their own pace. \nSome new players will be better than others, and they will climb and devlop with a steady and smooth curve.\n\nthis bronze stomping needs to stop, its limiting our server growth and just straight up a dick move.\n\n\nI know each ELO has this issue\n\nGold players camp bronze, silver. \nPlat players camp gold, silver and bronze.\nDiamond players camp Plat.\nChallenger players camp Plat and diamond.\n\nIts not fun for anyone at any elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-04T01:19:44.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"despite what people think, a lot of smurfs are actually using their accounts to learn a new role or a new champ. They may not feel comfortable playing in their own elo, and need to practice a bit lower. If they are playing a completely different role or adopting a new play style (e.g from ranged to melee), they will be placed lower than you would expect. I recently did placements as an ADC and got placed in B3. Overall smurf macro play is better, so even if playing an off role it can be pretty obvious that they're playing below their level. \n\nAs for boosters, they suck. If you see someone in a game that you suspect to be boosting an account (really common with end of season fast approaching), please report them in the end of game screen - leaving a comment in the box saying that you think they are boosting. Riot will look into it and quite a few of them will be banned :3","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-05T08:06:30.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"C'mon, how does a platinum 2 player have a smurf that gets placed in bronze 3, get real here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-05T08:28:08.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sure when I get my jg account to level 30 and do placements I will be forever B5 lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-05T14:04:23.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"!!!\n\nActually I'm keen to see what you do to climb from bronze 3.
