When ganking mid, PLEASE don't confuse a support's advantage with an ADC's advantage or an overall lane advantage.\n\nThis is generally how you should play bot lane:\n\nlane is pushed towards you: Stay, farm, get ganks, do not engage unless you know you'll survive being out of turret range for a bit as dying means byebye to tower.\n\nADC is ahead Support is average, lane is average: ADC farms and waits for support's signal. Support either nags jg into getting off his sorry lazy red bumff and take drag, or engages the enemy laner.\n\nADC is average, support is average, lane is average: Farm fest for ADCs until support does stuff. Supports better do their job and beg jg for a gank or engage. The one that acts first usually wins but a gank beats an engage even if the engage comes first, so be careful.\n\nADC is behind, support is average, lane is average: Support peels the ADC. ADC farms. Do nothing else, except beg for ganks but keep the ADC out of it.\n\nADC is ahead, Support is ahead, lane is average: GG at this point. For them. If the ADC can 1v2 farm, while support roams, otherwise only roam when the enemy laners are away.\n\nADC is average, support is ahead, lane is average: Support gets the ADC kills. Follow above instructions.\n\nADC is behind, support is ahead, lane is average: If support is ahead enough to 1v2 and kill one, even if the support dies in the process, engage with ADC and let the ADC KS while still keeping the support alive by being a threat. If not, the support failed and just let the ADC farm while harassing the enemy laner. Beg for ganks if the jg is okay with being KSed by the ADC.\n\nADC is ahead, support is behind, lane is average: The support is doing great. Let the ADC 2v1 if possible, otherwise peel when things go wrong.\n\nADC is average, support is behind, lane is average: Support begs for ganks. Just beg and peel. ADC farms\n\nADC is behind, support is behind, lane is average: Don't even beg, just peel, the jungler needs to take care of other lanes and even 3v2 can't help here.\n\nlane if pushed towards enemy: Ward up, let ADC farm. If the ADC can passively farm 2v1, roam mid. If not, stay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-31T10:14:37.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gotten many tips from high elo players on how to improve, and generally they all seem to mention the \"Proactive and Reactive\" theory in some way.\n\nThe reason why \"people loosing lanes\" affects every other lane is because that enemy player is making a proactive plays (e.g Ganking Bot, taking Dragon, taking a turret...). When people make proactive plays they force the enemy to make a reactive play or lose the objective. This is pretty much map control, if the enemy is always having to defend and react to you, it's hard for them to make plays themselves.\n\nSo you want to be as proactive as possible, if mid is loosing, they'll be pushed in and in a vulnerable position. Gank for him, if you think you can get a summoner or a kill. If you keep showing up, the enemy mid will be really careful when they all in, since you could be just about to gank. Not to mention, you're now forcing the jungler to hang around there to stop you from pressuring the map. This means he's not farming or ganking.\n\nThis of course works best as support, since it doesn't matter if you miss xp in lane because your abilities don't really need levels to scale (think Blitzcrank). Plus there's a nice mastery that helps you catch up in xp anyway.\n\n**Note:** Proactive plays are good, but they need to be smart. If you leave bot lane while the wave isn't pushed in your favour, then you're leaving your ADC extremely vulnerable to an all in. Lastly, sometimes you can respond to proactive play with another proactive play. The classic example of this is to trade turret for turret, or gank for gank. \n\nTL;DR\nMake plays! Force the enemy to react to what you are doing. The second you think it's good enough to just chill bot lane and farm, is the second you lost the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubly","date":"2015-08-31T09:07:15.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \n\nWith bot lane it's easier for the support to take advantage when you're ahead and the ADC remain behind.\nThis is because roughly 18 cs is equal to 1 kill, so letting the enemy have a few waves while you gank can quickly change the flow of the game.\nThat being said if you wipe the bot lane out, go ahead and spend 45~ secs ganking mid or securing drag/buffs.","replies":[]}]}
