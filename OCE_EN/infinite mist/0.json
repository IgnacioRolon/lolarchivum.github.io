Do all these big streamers get in instantly or some shit?\r\n\r\nLike I've tried over the span of 3 days now, probably a total of 30+ hours in queue and never got in.\r\n\r\nYou're Riot Games, not no small indie company releasing a new game on steam, sort it out.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2019-06-23T19:21:07.190+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it’s the Public testing grounds, either get in when they reset the PBE every day to avoid queue or once you get in never log off. They have addressed these issues on twitter and reddit and even boards pbe. \n\nKeep in mind they will NOT be uping the pbe capacity so if you don’t like waiting then you can be a little patient and wait for it to come to live servers this week!","replies":[]}]}
