It'd be awesome if both were available for large amounts of ip but I doubt rito will do that because you know making money. \nWe all feel this frustration but there's probably not going to be any changes made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-07-25T11:48:10.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a good idea and should be implemented into the game. There's nothing more annoying than finally getting a chest and then having to win like 387839478746 games just to get the key shards to open it. \n\nIf you think about it from a business perspective, Riot doesn't make much money from people buying key shards with RP, as most people aren't going to buy a key with RP, they are just going to wait for the key shards. However, Riot would probably make more profit from players spending about 2000 IP to buy a key.\n\nOr even just increase the drop rate of key shards, I have five Hextech chests and I can't open a single one because key shards don't seem to like me. It's not like I don't win games too, I think I'm just super unlucky.","replies":[]}]}
