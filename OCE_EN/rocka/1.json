They got back to me saying they will be dealt with accordingly. The player is still playing games, no punishment was received at all for telling somebody to kill themselves. So if that is not being punished then please tell me what is punishable because after that i really have no clue how your &quot;justice&quot; system works.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDragonb0rn","date":"2018-10-09T13:53:42.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol got perma banned for saying kys i lovrito","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-23T18:29:37.219+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There are a few things that could have happened which don't necessarily mean he was ignored;\n\n* He could have received a chat restriction\n* They might not have processed his punishment yet\n* They may have determined he hasn't done it often enough or the singular case wasn't severe enough to warrant a punishment *yet*.\n\nIt's generally not a good idea to ban someone for a single mistake. Some people have bad days, but unless they act like this often a ban isn't going to help anybody; it'd be punishing someone for a single event that wasn't going to happen again anyway. Riot's Player Behavior Initiative is meant to *reform* players, not just punish them.\n\nIf you make a mistake just once, do you want to get banned because someone made a ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-23T21:12:04.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Sorry but in the world we live in this is isntant grounds for banning tbh..\nNo 2 doubts about it..you CANT say things like that period....\nNow what if that kid had depression that was on the receiving end of it?\nReally take a good think about it...\nThis isnt the behaviour we or i want as a player let alone in the community....\nAnd i can tell you first hand what some1 in your family feels like when they take there own life....\nSo im telling you this needs to be clamped down so hard its not funny...","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-24T02:14:12.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Truth is i actually do deal with depression, that is why i sent this to riot support expecting some results because i dont want anybody to have to deal with any of this. sadly nothing seems to have happened.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-12-30T05:57:33.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8UbB2j6L,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-24T02:14:12.692+0000)\n>\n> Truth is i actually do deal with depression, that is why i sent this to riot support expecting some results because i dont want anybody to have to deal with any of this. sadly nothing seems to have happened.\n\nTo be honest, if some random jerk on the internet randomly tells you to kill yourself, you should ignore them because they are a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-30T06:14:13.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats not the point here.

We played against this very cocky, very toxic Caitlyn ADC and she was abusing my whole team all game but we were premade so we basically took the piss and weren't offended because she was probably either 12 or having an awful week and taking it out on randoms on the internet, as many do. We eventually won the game which felt bloody amazing by the way, considering I fed their {{champion:105}}  to no end for the first 15 minutes but got back into the game shortly after. We then reported her and as we queued up for another game, I got a notification telling me that our team had reported her and that she had been punished. IMO I at least feel like a mute would be handy for this riot player. You have no idea how powerful words can be, especially when you're having a bad day. Some days people will flame at me and tell me to kill myself and I'll just shrug it off, other days people will just say that I shouldn't play this game and I'll be pretty sad for the next few games and I'll be less inclined to play whatever champion I was playing during that game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"tyger223","date":"2015-12-28T12:18:32.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"how about you stop being butthurt. its the internet. shit happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T03:09:30.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"someone telling you to kill yourself over a game is just fucking disgusting and should be perma banned","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-26T06:43:59.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its good to see alot of players are with me on this, thanks for the support.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T11:33:57.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"been a sufferer since 15 and am now on the right ad's, so this shit annoys me deeply","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-26T11:41:01.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think i might just quit playing league, riot does not give a shit about the community.

And you go all the way to forums and even log a ticket? I had someone say they would track me down and kill my entire family for playing bad so I just pissed them off more. Do you even know how retarded these people are in real life? They probably slam their computer on the ground when they lose you are doing much more damage to them since they will probably die of a heart attack. When people like that say stuff like that you should always retort but just don't use any swear words and if possible add a :) or :p to piss them off more and they will probably have a blood clot in real life. Geez you are so dumb don't you know you have the ability to kill these people without ever having to meet them in real life? Keep making them mad and make sure you add a smiley face :) that pisses them off the most. I can't believe you don't know the damage you are doing to these people just by playing bad or replying with smiley face (:D), because they are probably obese in real life and anger will be very bad for their health possibly even kill them. Do you really think it's fair for you to ban these people? Think about it you log on and you are banned for something that happened ten days ago you will kill this person in real life he will be so pissed that his blood clot will block his heart flow. Far out think about these things before you decide to log a ridiculous ticket and possibly murder someone in real life.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-21T03:44:36.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't mean it's acceptable and shouldn't be punished\ncyber bullying like all other bullying can become very serious depending on the reaction and/or situation of both party","replies":[]}]}]}
