Right now we have multiple automatic systems in place to punish negative behaviour; for example\n\nLive\n\nLeaverBuster\nChat restrictions\nIntentional feeder bans\nManual audits\n\nCurrently testing\n\nAutomatic verbal abuse bans\n\nThe above systems all use **your reports** to build player profiles and determine which players should be punished or not.\n\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards. You can read more about our design philosophies here: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nIf you're really interested in player behaviour give this video a watch it is Jeffrey \"Lyte\" Lin talking about \"The Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games\".\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player","replies":[]}]}
