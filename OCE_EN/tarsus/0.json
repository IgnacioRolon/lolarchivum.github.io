Any and all feedback appreciated, and I hope you guys like my idea :)\n\nalso, to simplify things I've left a lot out of the updates, so if you'd like more information read over the original file\n\nFIRST UPDATE:\nhttp://www.docdroid.net/tbdr/hobb-league-edit-1.pdf.html  ","replies":[{"poster":"Tarsus","date":"2015-03-03T12:13:12.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next target is to fix the E and work in some lore :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-02T03:03:54.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so a permanent slow is probably not the best idea maybe when he casts an ability he is slowed this is the fall back to his strong early game tankyness  so basically he carries the ball on his shoulder but when he casts an ability he gets slowed this slow lasts for 5 seconds at lvl 1 and resets when he casts another ability the slow time goes down by 0.25 every 2/3 lvls.\n\nQ: hobbs throws the ball in a straight line(so a skill shot that doesn't stop till it reaches max range) knocking back and stunning all enemies hit for 1 sec up to 2 at lvl 5(no longer gains a shield) \n\nW seems a bit to strong in my opinion maybe change it to,\nPassive: Hobbs gains increased heath regen each time he is slowed for 3 seconds(this allows him to make the best of his passive)\n\nActive: Hobbs summons a chain to join him and an enemy together slowing them by 20/26.25/32.5/38.75/45 % that lasts for 3 seconds, (the target can break this chain if they walk out of range) and giving hobbs a shield of 50/75/100/125/150+ 10% of is max hp, which lasts 3 seconds after the chain is broken/duration is finished(this is to make up for his shield removed from q) and deals 10% of the targets current hp+25/50/70/85/100(maybe a ad scaling instead of dealing current hp?)\n\n\nE: change e to a charge/dash type ability\nHobbs gains a sudden surge of energy dashing forward 400~ and knocking back 1st enemy champion hit dealing damage based on hobbs bonus hp hobbs can use this ability to dash to the champion with his w on even if they are out of e range and knocking them back breaking the chain and gaining the shield as soon as the charge has finished\n\nR:hobbs spins his iron ball around in a circle stunning all enemies hit for 2/3 seconds dealing 100/200/300+ 0.5 of his max ad once hobbs has finished his spin he becomes immune to all cc except self inflicted cc","replies":[{"poster":"Tarsus","date":"2015-03-02T03:21:57.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea behind the slow on his passive is it only affects him when he moves past the range of the ball (as he has to drag it along behind him).\nwhile within range of the ball, Hobb is not slowed: and yeah I agree on the W but I figured when creating him, start overpowered then reign it back in as i get feedback on the skill kit itself. Same applies to the Ult, however i like the idea of the execute (similiar to kalista's w but rather than securing the kill himself, granting it to an ally). I originally had the %Attack speed increase at 25/35/45% but after looking at a few other champions i thought I'd start with it higher and see what feedback i got.\n\nThinking about it again now, it does make more sense to have the Q as you describe, however I think it should be rather than himself carrying the ball then throwing it, he instead kicks the ball directly away from him to its max range - I wanted this ability to be hard to land, because overall he is a very agressive champion, and i wanted to encourage more skillful play.\n\nThe E i was originally intending roughly what you said there, but i thought it would be fun to potentially knock them back into your team, or off to the side : splitting up groups of enemies, while again being hard to aim (land a little to the side and instead of throwing their ad carry into your jax you knock them around a corner and secure their escape)","replies":[{"poster":"Tarsus","date":"2015-03-02T03:22:59.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that though I really do appreciate it :) wasn't expecting any replies at all tbh :P","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-02T10:55:17.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tarsus,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=OAx5g26E,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-02T03:22:59.296+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for that though I really do appreciate it :) wasn't expecting any replies at all tbh :P\n\nI like replying to these posts I do really like your idea but some of mine might just fix him as he does seem a bit broken but I do like the idea of his kit you just need to make it revolve around the ball more rather then just a slow","replies":[{"poster":"Tarsus","date":"2015-03-03T12:10:58.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just added the first round of changes - His Q, mainly.
