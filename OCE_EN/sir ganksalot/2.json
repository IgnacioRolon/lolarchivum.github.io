After a delay of 0.25 seconds, the entire trail detonates, dealing magic damage to enemies standing upon it.\r\n\r\nIt cuts through the ground ffs\r\nHow does wind block a void being generated through the ground??\r\n\r\nRiot sort Yas out asap there is so many abilities that stupid wall blocks that it shouldn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nAlso its just wind so why does everything that touches it disintegrate??\r\nThe projectiles should fall around the wind wall in a certain radius still doing dmg to anything they hit, its a wind wall not a bloody plasma laser.\r\nThis to me is probably one of the most broken things in league and deserves you immediate attn.","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-17T02:06:10.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yorick needs a rework 1st","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Ganksalot","date":"2016-01-17T02:19:33.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but he needs a full rework, Windwall is just one spell and it would be good to see it fixed preseason","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-17T02:45:18.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats fine problem tho, its the fact some projectiles don't get blocked is the problem","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-01-17T04:33:29.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you just stop playing with semantics and forget about the worded description of an ability, and just accept that certain abilities are or are not blocked by windwall?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-17T09:27:15.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure things like zed w vel e tf w which are all labeled as projectiles shouldn't go though and should be blocked","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-01-18T01:09:44.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure I said stop nitpicking on the wording of an ability description and accept what works.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-18T02:22:32.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure i said, some abilities that are meant to be blocked aren't, so abilities that look like they shouldn't be blocked are","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-01-18T04:33:07.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who are you to decide what is and is not meant to be blocked","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-18T04:34:50.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A hypocrite if i ever saw one.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-01-18T07:47:11.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, explain my hypocrisy","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2016-01-18T08:15:52.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fattyhotdogs,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=vuON8Wxy,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-18T07:47:11.152+0000)\n>\n> Please, explain my hypocrisy\n\nAn ability description is exactly that, it's the informations we are given to know what the ability does, the more accurate the description the better we can use the ability. If windwall is meant to stop projectiles but fails to stop certain projectiles, and blocks things that are not projectiles then that is a problem that needs to be fixed with either the ability or the description.
