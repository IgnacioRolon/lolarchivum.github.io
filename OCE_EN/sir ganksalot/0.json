Half the games I am in are decided at champ select, because one person or another wont pay attention to the lane calls. This used to annoy me and i blamed them. Now i have come to blame RIOT for not enabling us to be able to play the spot we wont to. Having been trying to practice jg and been unable to call the spot fast enough i spend 50% of my games as supp. This is super annoying and makes me want to instalock and ignore the polite rules of the game. I now understand why ppl are instalocking and ignoring calls. they just want to play their champ in their spot and get better. Which is the whole point of unranked games in my mind. We should not have to risk our ranked ratings to have a decent chance of landing the spot we want.\r\n\r\nI truly think this shows a prejudice against the OCE server that we get treated differently to other servers. It is also adding hugely to toxic and salty behaviour, RIOT you can do something about this. No point constantly asking us for feedback about the community when your set up is half the problem.\r\n\r\nSo Dear RIOT pls bring draft queue to norms in OCE","replies":[{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2016-09-08T10:49:50.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post is wonderful and needs to be brought to the attention to Riot. A draft normal queue needs to be implemented as the benefits far outweigh the negatives. Roles are constantly being contested for in champion select and the outdated, shitty version needs serious replacing, and fast. When I go on a losing streak in ranked, I try and calm myself down by queuing up for a normal game, but manage to get the support role 90% of the time because my computer is slow and I can't call out the role I want. It's extremely frustrating and like you said, contributes more to the already toxic server that OCE is. Please Riot, either get rid of Blind Pick or give us Draft Normal Queue.\n\nThanks for making this post, hopefully some form of change takes place, but I highly doubt it, considering how ignorant Riot can be in responding to its community.\nOn a side note, please release URF again, it's a fantastic game mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-09-07T03:33:52.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Draft normals were not implemented on the OCE servers because of the lack of player base. Riot mentioned earlier this year that we won't be getting it for that reason.

People play games for entertainment, why force people into roles they don't enjoy? Seems stupid to me.\n\nI'd like to see a 4v4 rift game mode, so no one is stuck in support. 3 solo lanes and a jungler. Sure some players enjoy supporting, but many don't. Those that do, can play 5v5.\n\nAs long as non-ranked rift play is dictated by who calls lanes first, or is too slow but goes \"fuck you I'm mid or feed\" etc, I'll just stick to ARAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sir Ganksalot","date":"2016-09-07T01:51:12.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am so passionate about this i will shout some skins to the three best comments left on this thread.\nplease be sure to add you character name and fav champ to your comments","replies":[{"poster":"JAMOO","date":"2016-09-07T03:21:12.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sir Ganksalot,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=UVdGik0s,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-09-07T01:51:12.185+0000)\n>\n> I am so passionate about this i will shout some skins to the three best comments left on this thread.\n> please be sure to add you character name and fav champ to your comments\n\nLeague is toxic, plain and simple, riot or the community can't do too much about it, but I do heavily agree with what your saying about how they should add draft norms, then we won't have people insta-locking champs as much and that might shape up the community, but that's only a matter if riot adds it or not.\n\n(I'm a dirty {{champion:83}} main)\n\n-Jamoo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-09-07T03:16:56.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I hate riot.

Honestly there's nothing good about Blind Pick. At least in Draft I can get my lane and go good. Blind is only good because theres no banning. And the way to fix that is.......

The Co-op games don't have a jungling bot. So it sets an unrealistic situation to start with. For new players. Co-op is the way to learn basic mechanics, and when they feel confident enough - can progress to normals and ranked eventually etc. \n\nThe main issues I've seen from my experiences, consist of people who play 1 lane, get abusive if they don't get the role they want and then throw the game. 20 minute surrenders can be quiet drawn out. I think there needs to be a 30 second window at the 10 and 15 minute marks (or one or the other), in the instance where someone manages to reconnect. but then shortly after the /remake function is unavailable, disconnects again - due to no fault of their own. \n\nHaving the ability to ban champs in normal games, will also help people who havent played rank before, with that transition. Unfortunately - there's almost an unwritten ''law'' on attitudes played by specific champions. Sounds silly? 95%+ of the Yasuo's I've seen are the saltiest, most toxic underskilled players I have seen. Followed closely by riven, zed and blitz.\n\nSo what do I think can be done? \n\n- 2 games played per champion in co-op prior to being eligible to play in normals.\n- 30 second window to surrender at 10 and 15 minutes into the game.\n- selecting the role you wish to play before queing - to reduce instalocks.\n-Less QQ more PEW PEW \n\n\n\n\nI've also noticed that since the hextech system has been introduced - the majority of solo queuing players, play less of a team game, chase kills in the hopes of getting S/S+ for cubes. I'm unsure on what could be changed to redirect the focus to team work, as its a team game. However i do feel that something needs to change. Maybe it's what makes you eligible for an S/S+.. \n\nAnyway, I'm sure that I have forgotten to mention heaps of stuff. So I'll leave it at that for the mean time.
