I can give a few tips ( used Vegas for 4 years ).\n\nLayering with opacity is a good way to have multiple things going on at once, and perhaps bring focus to one point, instead of awkward jump cuts to slightly relevant things.\n\nText - seeing the usual fonts and styles is a big turn off for audiences, try and customise your font to be more personable.\n\nCamera Tool - You'll need to find a way to smooth out the rotation on the camera tool. This will likely come with practice, because now it's very obvious where the key frames are.\n\nFeel free to hit me up here with any questions, I'll get back to them when I can :)\n\n~J","replies":[{"poster":"Karma sama","date":"2015-05-05T01:58:43.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Jason. Thanks a lot for the tips. \n\nYou guessed right I am very new to Vegas and I will be looking at some tutorials to learn how to use it better.\n\nI can see how the usual font can be a turn off so I will search for a more personal font. Do you have any recommendations? I was thinking about using \"Forte\".\n\nYeah I am using SkinSpotlights as my Camera Tool and it is kinda tricky to use at first. I will try to get more smooth camera rotations.\n\nI have two questions.\nFirst do you know how I can reduce the size of a media? For example to be able to put a picture in the corner of the video.\nAnd second, does Vegas have a zoom in effect? So I can show a part of the video more smoothly.\n\nOnce again thanks a lot for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-05-05T06:11:14.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The questions you asked can both be answered with one tool.\n\nEvent Pan / Crop\n\nYou can zoom in on things, or zoom out to put them over the top of a clip playing in the background.\n\nPro Tip; If you are using a flat square image for a 16:9 ratio video, it might not let you go outside the box it would otherwise fit. \nThe fix: going into the Event Pan / Crop and right clicking on the box, and selecting fit to output ratio ( or whatever it is )\n\nRemember to try new things, CTRL-Z ( undo ) is your best friend for experimenting\n\nAdditionally, for font, just find one that you like, that isn't overly boring, or hard to read.\n\n~J","replies":[{"poster":"Karma sama","date":"2015-05-05T14:03:43.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks once again.\n\nI will definitely try out using Pan / Crop, I had the problem of the 16:9 ratio before so thanks a lot for the fix.\n\nAs for the font, I will keep looking for a good one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
