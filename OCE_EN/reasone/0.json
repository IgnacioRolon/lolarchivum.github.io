I stoped play LoL in 2015 (more or less, i can&#039;t precise it), and since them, i never log more in LoL website or App. During that time, somebody stole my account and transfered to other region. Im from EU West and i played always in EU, but during the time i stoped, one random guy stole my account transfered it to Oceania region. He changed the name (The original is Reasonable, and now is Reasone), change password and desactived e-mails/notificacions from RIOT to me (he don&#039;t change e-mail, only nickname, password and region - problably can&#039;t, because RIOT make private questiones before). \r\nBut yesterday, i download the game again to back play with some friends, it&#039;s like nostology and just for fun. When i tried the login, appears one notification saying the account has been transfered. I pass one hour recending a lot of e-mails to recovery the password and discover the new name of account (actually, i tried in all regions until appear the Oceania with that new nickname). \r\nThat random thief guy played during 2016, until got perma banned for offensive language, rage, etc. (and belive me, the guy is really a toxic player! insult everybody, i have already checked the chat. His embarrassed and shameless) \r\nThe problem now is, my account was created in Season1, during the time i play, i achieved Diamond Rank, i have all most chars and a lot of skins (presents offered by friends and other i payed for it). So, my account is really valius. \r\nI already send a e-mail to riot servers to remove perma ban, and try change to the original Region (EU West) - i can&#039;t play in Oceania because the ping is insane). \r\nAnyone know anyway to remove the perma ban? Anyone knows if is it possible RIOT look the IP&#039;s of logins the prove i&#039;m a victim of a scammer and not a rage/toxic player? The original account is from Portugal, Europe, EU West. \r\nI don&#039;t wanna know who&#039;s the thief of accounts, i don&#039;t care with him. I only hope take my account back to play with my friends. \r\nThis is really sad because i spend a few money, i don&#039;t rage or insult - i don&#039;t need it actually because i play with friends -. Usually, when i played ranks, i get a lot of positive comments and honors, not reports. \r\nSo, i come here to search for help because RIOT don&#039;t send me any awanser until yet. They only awsked me if i can provide a different e-mail to create a new ticket for the recovery quest.\r\nIt&#039;s all for know, GL &amp; HF.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-12-10T11:13:34.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to this being an account specific inquiry, we unfortunately cannot help you on the boards.\n\n You best bet is to wait for your support ticket answer. It may take slightly longer than usual since it is pre-season there are a lot of things going on so their support will likely be flooded. \nGood luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Reasone","date":"2017-12-10T11:19:07.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi @Yaiamone!
