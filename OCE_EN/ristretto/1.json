Patcher client .spin files?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m running OS X Mavericks at the moment and the current, up-to-date Mac client for LoL. However, I was using El Capitan where I started encountering this problem.\r\n\r\nRandomly, without warning of any kind, while I&#039;m in a game my computer will just restart. There&#039;s no pop ups, no nothing at all. It just does it. I did some googling where I learned that this is generally caused by a Kernal panic and to check/post the .panic file online. Only problem with that is, there is none. I have no .panic file and there appears to have been no Kernal panic. What I do have are System Diagnostics files for the Patcher client, they end in .spin.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m no good with this technical stuff, nor do I even know what a .spin file is or what it is for, however, I&#039;m wondering if anyone else is having/had this issue and knows of what to do to fix it or what to look for to see what the issue is? It was happening in El Capitan and I downgraded to Mavericks tonight where it&#039;s still continuing. Getting LeaverBuster for someone that&#039;s not my fault is annoying and I&#039;d like to enjoy matches without worrying about whether or not I&#039;m going to get a random restart :(","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-24T07:28:47.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware .spin files can basically be viewed with any text editor.\n\nI'm not _too_ familiar with macs but feel free to reply with a link to your latest .spin file and i'll take a look at it to see if I can figure out what the issue is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ristretto","date":"2016-03-24T11:14:55.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.mediafire.com/download/d085g832o02d99b/LatestSPIN.zip\n\nI can view the spin files easily, yes. But I'm unsure as to what they mean. I don't understand anything inside them. Hopefully these are somewhat understandable for you.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-25T00:01:09.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, that doesnt help at all. haha.\n\nHave you tried reinstalling the game at all? Does this happen in any other games?","replies":[{"poster":"Ristretto","date":"2016-03-25T12:06:07.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have and no it doesn't. I've also tried rolling back from OS X El Capitain to Yosemite than Mavericks. It doesn't matter what the OS it happens only when League is open. It'll happen even when i just have the client logged in when not in a game. I'm not sure why but the LoLPatcher spin files are all I have to work with haha","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
