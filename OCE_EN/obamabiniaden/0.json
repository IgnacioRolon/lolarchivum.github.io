Also teammates might treat these players differently and judge there moves as on l\nPurpose so.\n\nFurthermore some people might abuse the fact that they can award points for anrgy players and just troll by awarding it to the whole team or the  person who is really the one angry awarding point to the nice players.\n\nSo I don't really think this will be a good idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-19T19:17:55.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"once you get this badge you entire team labels you as worthless and crap at the game, I don't believe this is right, if they do add in this badge I would like it if they also added in a badge for skillful and crappy players. To do this they would take the KDA + assists of all champions with 18 ranked games played. They would also replace your average cs as support to the lowest cs average on all champions with said 18 ranked games played. \n\nAfter looking at all players in this particular division and weighing out their averages, all players will be given a badge.\n\nAqua badge = Amazing player \nTurquoise badge = Great player\nBlue badge = Solid player\nYellow badge = Average player\nGreen badge = Bad player\nDark green badge = Quite bad player\nBrown badge = Absolute trash\n\nThis way you could have for an example\nVery toxic player emblem, into an Aqua badge. \nThis would mean the highly toxic player would be allowed to trash talk everyone as he was the alleged best on the team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-18T04:02:12.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we do this for bad players aswell just to make it easier to climb since no one wants to be teamed with speds.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-18T04:52:22.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only get matched with people around your skill level, at least it tries.\n\nHe may be bad in some certain areas which you're quite capable of, but same can be said the other way around.\n\nNot to mention if you get bad teammates, either enemy team will also get his fair share of bads this game or it may be next game.

It goes wow this person is alright we will put people of lower skill with him so that it balances out.  The problem is that it hits a point where most of your team has been delt loss after loss for what ever reason and this can get people nerves because they are genuinely trolls who only seek to make ppl mad and ruin the experience for other players. I agree there are times when people need to chill out but sometimes the matchmaking system fails.
