I am wanting a support friend to help improve together and create an environment that is conducive for learning and allows room for mistakes. Some basic requirements to be met are:\n\nSpeaks English\nDiamond 2 - Challenger Elo\nHas decent microphone\nPlays regularly\n\nIn Saying that I am also wanting a support that has similar values of the game to me. Someone who:\n\nIs wanting to be competitve\nResists flaming in chat or blame like comments.\nKnows when and how to give criticism and also understands how to receive criticism\nDoesnâ€™t tilt for long periods of time. Who can recover from tilt  fairly easily\n\nSome extra requirements that might come in later could be reviewing vods of LCK or watching the streams taking notes and doing analysis together. Playing other games outside of League of Legends together that might help to strengthen the friendship and blow of some steam or frustration.\n\nEverything I expect from my support I expect from myself too. If you might be interested add me on my accounts Oomny and Oomny v1","replies":[{"poster":"bluz0r","date":"2016-05-27T15:42:50.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added.
