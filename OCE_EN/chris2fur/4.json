Someone going to be on a lot so we can play a lot together. My favourite ADC's at the moment are Jinx, Graves, Lucian, Tristana, Corki and Sivir. I would prefer if you can play Supports like Janna, Morgana, Nami, and Thresh. Others like Blitzcrank, Leona etc also all good. I want us to have fun but our main goal is winning and hauling in that elo. Add me if you are interested, no need posting here.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-31T11:29:55.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop double posting.","replies":[{"poster":"Chris2fur","date":"2014-12-31T21:07:41.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad on double posting, I've deleted the other one.","replies":[]}]}]}
