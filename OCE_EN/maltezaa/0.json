Any comments whether other players are experiencing these issues would also provide some reassurance. \n\nFurthermore, it would be great to be provided with more detailed reasoning, personally and proactively (on Riot&#039;s behalf), regarding the status of the individuals game client and servers.\n\nMalteza","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2018-05-23T01:46:34.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks - just an update here.\n\nThere was an incident on the OCE server earlier this morning (which lines up with when you got initially stuck in games / champ select).

We didn't communicate within Riot as well as we normally do, which led to some of us not seeing the fallout from the issue (ie. the ghost games you've been reporting) as quickly as normal.  While it likely wouldn't have changed the outcome, we could have been much more on the ball in getting the message out to you guys.  That last part is pretty important as we always want you to know what is going on.\n\nHopefully the ghost games fix up soon for you :)\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Collierado","date":"2018-05-23T04:47:04.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ask for your subscription fees back","replies":[]}]},{"poster":" nechie","date":"2018-05-23T01:52:55.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Agent Mindstar,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=ZX7l6hWV,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2018-05-23T01:46:34.536+0000)\n>\n> Hi folks - just an update here.\n> \n> There was an incident on the OCE server earlier this morning (which lines up with when you got initially stuck in games / champ select).
