You cannot be perma-banned through this system, so the 20 minute low priority queue is the most severe punishment possible. You find more info on LeaverBuster [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\n> **Quick Tip:** \n> If your connection is bad but you want to play League, then search the custom games list for something you want to play. Going unintentionally AFK in a custom game will not lead to any punishments. See more about that [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h1q4).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-13T10:07:59.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it goes up to 30 minutes, though repeated Ranked leaving may result in an account ban.
