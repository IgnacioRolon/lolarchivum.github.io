Really good coaches for decent prices. Some are even free!\n\nThey also run an [adopt-a-newbie program](http://www.lol-coaching.com/newbie.php) which is great for new players like yourself. Its free to join and the people are really nice and super helpful. It will probably be a bit better than the coaching option.  \n\nGood luck  ♥","replies":[]}]}
