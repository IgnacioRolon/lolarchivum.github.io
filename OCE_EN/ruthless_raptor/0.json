You would think the client would give us some info. I noticed ranked queues closed at 12 last night, but now they are back open? My rank is still the same, nothing in the client has changed, and ranked is still open, so is this season over or not? Are the end of season rewards already locked, or if I get platinum today will that show for next season?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-19T09:58:27.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rewards are locked yes. We are in preseason now, through which your rank will persist and you have a chance to climb a little higher to make your start of next season journey a little less harsh on the reset, but any ranks earned in preseason will not count towards end of season rewards. \n\nAs I understand it, ranked queues persist through pre-season partly to not overload the normal queue and partly because they remain the 'serious' queue.","replies":[]}]}
