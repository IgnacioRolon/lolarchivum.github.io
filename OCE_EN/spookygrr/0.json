Me and a few friends would like to see a change to the things that stop Ekko from casting his ult, The main problem being abilities that snare Ekko when snared Ekko is unable to cast his ult the main thing that saves him from dying i find this really unfair as Tristana is able to rocket jump when snared but Ekko is unable to ult I would just like to see a change because it just ruins the fun in playing him.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-03T14:07:47.761+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so let's make his ult have absolutely no counter play ?

Earlier I was against a Vi as Ekko and while she is moving towards me while ulting I believe Ekko can't ult which is total bs.\n\nAs for stuns, I disagree because with good reaction time you can just ult before the stun hits you, however even then people with click to win stuns e.g. Ryze just screw over Ekko.","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyGrr","date":"2016-08-03T11:52:25.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stuns are stuns they stop everything and i am fine with that its just the fact you are meant to be able to use abilities when snared and for example a morgana snare that lasts nearly 3 seconds thre is nothing you can do ","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-03T12:14:49.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"True, but that's not really a problem with Ekkos ult, it's more a problem with Morgana (and other champs with long snares) having op snares/stuns.","replies":[{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-08-06T03:45:20.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"those stuns are not too long, champs like zed and ekko are only killable while locked down. i main lux and morg and without those stuns im dead, even under tower. its the only thing that stops you 1v1 me under tower, kill me and leave","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-06T07:20:41.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm I see where your coming from.

You smoking something? Cause that idea is just stupid. You're talking like only ekko gets fucked if they get hit by morg's snare. Champions like Zed, Talon , Katarina and other assassins are fucked if caught by her snare. Ekko already has a dash, a stun/shield and a ult that basically avoids death and now you want to make him some sort of a untargetable assassin?

If a Morgana is able to land a slow-moving snare on such a slippery champion, how is it fair to her that you can just ult right out of it? \n\nIf you are Ekko, you pretty much have to be trying, to be caught by a Morgana snare. So if you do get caught, like every other champion, you should be punished for it.\n\nIn saying that though, i think Morgana's snare is too long, not just on Ekko, but on everyone. \n\nAlso Trist's jump does NOT happen if she is CC'd, if she is in the animation of her jump and she get's snared, her jump will still continue. (and i think youll find the same thing with ekko, if you press R, and in the split second after you press it, before you become untreatable, you get snared, your ult will still happen.)","replies":[{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-08-06T22:37:48.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The snares are not too long, Yasuos ult lasts longer I'm sure. Yes it seems like 7 days stuck in the same place but it also feels like that when being hacked to pieces by an untargetable champ. Zeds, Kats, Yis and Yasuos etc, have no call crying about a snare when they have so much escape and damage at their disposal. Any hyper carry should be able to take some well planned deaths with the 15+ kills that came oh so easy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-04T02:20:32.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tristana can't jump when she's snared, but she can be snared while she jumps.\n\nAlso it's a pretty fair mechanic since it's quite literally the only counterplay to Ekko's ultimate ability which is really really overloaded to prevent him from having zero risk and all the reward.

[Similar to Ezreal's E-Arcance Shift]\n\nIf ekko was able to cast his ultimate while CC'd (even snared), that'd make him extremely strong, probably top tier. He's already extremely hard to catch, but if you can't even CC him... well he'd be broken. \n\n*Note: Tristana's rocket jump can still be cancelled by displacement abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"SpookyGrr","date":"2016-08-03T15:12:32.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not sure if this has been updated but a while back i saw a tristana hit by a morgana snare then jump to a different location","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-03T15:42:00.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SpookyGrr, \n\nHere's a youtube video that might be able to explain it better. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STOwEW-425c\n\nUnfortunately it's the only one i could find.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cucked by      S","date":"2016-08-03T14:46:28.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmfao and I just made a post about how overloaded ekko is.
