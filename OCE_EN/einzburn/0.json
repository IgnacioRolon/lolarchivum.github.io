It contains personal information that can be used to track you.\n\nBut anyway, I still read it. There is either a problem with the way your DNS is configured or you just have really bad upload speeds. For now, I suggest switching back to your default DNS, unless if in doing that, RADS fails to launch.\n\nBy default configuration I mean to install it without changing any settings, like the installation path. Not too sure what entails it on Mac, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Einzburn","date":"2015-01-27T23:55:30.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohh. I've tried changing back to default DNS.
