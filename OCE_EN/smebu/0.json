Welcome to patch 5.23, the oneafter preseason. Unlike some of our pre-preseason patches before this, we're being more bold when it comes to balance - surgical tuning works once we have a deep understanding of the game ecosystem, but since preseason has introduced so much change, we want to make broad, impactful changes to get a firm grasp on what's going on.","url":"http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-523-notes","image":"http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/patch_notes_banner_30.jpg?itok=O1iNIvYM"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"&quot;USE &#039;EM OR LOSE &#039;EM: All Promo Helper bonuses will be reset at the beginning of the 2016 ranked season&quot; \n\nDoes whatever rank you gain during the preseason pointless because it will reset during the start of the official season?\n\nExample: I am Silver4 and want to try to get to Gold as soon as possible. If I get Gold during the preseason, will the reset & send me back to Silver4? Or will placements place me around what I ended up with at the very end of preseason?","replies":[{"poster":"TheHungryPerson","date":"2015-11-29T08:27:21.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Preseason rank has always been a token rank, Riot has never indicated otherwise.
