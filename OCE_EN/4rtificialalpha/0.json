Didn't play much about 150 games total and made it to silver 1. I jungle main and been smashing talon lately. You always start really low! \n\nI mean from bronze to silver 1 in 150 games is pretty good would have made gold if I had more time to play. I plan on plat this season! Get Internet in 3 more days then I'll start the climb!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Midnightatom","date":"2017-02-26T06:10:26.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nI'm a JG main with top/support as my secondary. I haven't done promos for this season yet. Feels shit to say but I was bronze 2 last season but it was the first season that I played and I did my provisionals as soon as I hit lvl 30. I believe I am much better now. You are welcome to add me. I'm keen to go for some norms first if you'd like to see how I play and see how we go after that. \n\nI won't be offended if you don't want to play with me. And good luck in getting to plat.","replies":[]}]}
