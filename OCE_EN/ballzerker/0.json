Just last night I was loading into a game and after the champ select ended and the client minimized it just went to a black screen.  After about 10 seconds it comes up with an error message saying that I can&#039;t connect to server.  After awhile and trying to re log, reset my router, flush my dns, restart my computer, etc. I find that nothing is working.  Then after 15 minutes of trying suddenly it just loaded my game after trying non stop the whole time.  \r\n\r\nSo this happens every game after this first random time. So far I&#039;ve tried turning off all the firewalls, changing various router settings, a fresh install of league, and several other recommended settings changes, including all the RADS error solutions.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T07:57:08.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA on OCE boards.\n\nAnyway, it could be related to your ISP specifically.

We both have Rogers internet (Ontario Canada) and it sounds similar to the long standing comcast issue.  Thanks to this we both have missed out on participating in the event for half the week.
