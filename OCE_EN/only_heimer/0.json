Now, even after this losing streak, i am still sitting on a positive win/loss ratio. Problem is, I&#039;m one loss away from being demoted again and IF this happens, which it probably will, i will be WORSE off than where I was placed even though I still have won more games than I have lost. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of fucked up elo system is this?

MMR is what dictates who you actually play against. This is why in silver (my rank) I sometimes see plat players, because they have gone on large loss streaks tanking their MMR to silver level.

I still gain 20+ points for a win. lose roughly 17-19 for a loss. the only thing i can think of that is the problem is promotion games. I have won a lot of promotion games which count towards win/loss ratio but you do not receive any kind of LP for them BUT you do lose LP when you lose promotion games (and lose the series).\n\nabout MMR, so basically the match making system is broken. the whole point of MMR and match making in general, especially in a TEAM game where you are matched with RANDOMS, is supposed to make the matches even. there is something inherently wrong with the system if it is continuously matching me with 'inferior\" opponents and then also has the audacity to recognize that I'm \"supposed to win\" and then punish me further for losing. this may work better if it is a 1v1 game but it isn't. If my MMR has tanked due to a lose streak then it should be treating me as equal to those that it is now matching me with.\n\nI don't believe any other game i play or have played in the past has allowed people to go backwards on the ladder if they have a positive w/l ratio. the timing of win/losses and streaks should be irrelevant. again, there's something inherently wrong with a system that over rewards/punishes for streaks ESPECIALLY in a team game with randoms.\n\nI agree that MMR should be visible. I believe it was in the past (before i played this game). furthermore I think it should be the determinate for rank. Once you reach a certain MMR, then you rank up or rank down. Simple as that. They need to get rid of the possibility that someone in \"gold\" can be matched with silvers because of hidden MMR. If they have silver MMR, then they should be silver.\n\nAlso, promotion series (as pointed out at the start) are a huge problem. I understand that they have them as a guard or check against people climbing, but they just don't work. The fact that they now give you \"free wins\" in a series if you previously lost it shows that they realize there's something wrong. They should not count towards win/loss and therefore should have no bearing on MMR and LP. Better yet they should not exist.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-02T23:11:47.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately this is the case in a world with imperfect people. Doesn't matter how good you are everyone has bad days and invariably those people end up playing against lower \"skilled\" players. \n\nThe problems all come from the fact that our ranks are based entirely off win/loss. The best ranking system I have ever used (and it had itself many many problems) was halo 3. Even if your team played absolutely horribly and you lost the game. If you played above your own or at your own average level, the chances of you ranking down were lowered substantially.\n\nPersonally Riot should implement a system where if you play at your average or better and still lose a game the system should make you lose points still, but not as many. This can be easily implemented as they already have the backbone built in. The ranks you get for a champion after the game are based on your average and doesn't care about win/loss. I've played numerous games (support main) where I have gotten S+ and lost a game. \n\nSo if in those cases I lost half the amount of points it wouldn't seem so bad. This encourages players to try and climb if they consistently play well but everyone else on their teams play badly. \n\nAlso a pet peeve of mine. Riot seriously needs to implement the 2 top levels of champion mastery based entirely off getting first S then S+ ranks. This separates the actual \"mains\" from the \"I played XX games and got max mastery\". I am sick of playing with lvl 5 people only to find out they have no idea how to play a champion. /Sigh\n\n*Edit* - On the point about inferior opponents. The system actually does do this but not for the reason people usually think. If you play a lot of your matches on red/purple side of the map you are actually playing with slightly \"better\" players by an average of 100MMR increase (The total of 5 people's MMR divided by 5). This is because the red/purple side of the map is considered a disadvantage. So when you play on blue side you legitimately are playing with the worse team as blue side has the better half of the map. I have watched this a lot and it is 100% true.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
