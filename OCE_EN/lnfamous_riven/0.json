My next picks for top lane are Volibear, Dr. Mundo, Vladimir, Hecarim and Trundle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The sethoridian","date":"2015-11-10T08:19:48.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name: Seth or The Sethoridian\nRank: B5 but i play with a plat and she says im actually good but i don't play ranked USUALLY but in s6 im gonna play alot!!!\nMain Role/ Main Roles: i can play most roles but excel at   MID JG TOP SUPPORT. but i can still ADC and i mostly play top/jungle!\nChamp Pool: like a third of the champs i'll list as many as i can XD\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:36}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:9}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:238}}  sigh i think i have a few more actually XDXDXD but yeah :P and im from BRIZZY QLD AUSTRALIA (or close to it :P)\nand yes, ihave a good headset and a really good pc and skype/teamspeak :3 am happy to get any other coms system though :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-11-10T07:31:11.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't mind playing with someone new(as long as you're not salty).I'm a jungle main (mid main before) and wouldn't mind learning a thing or two from you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2015-11-10T05:31:30.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bro, I only started this year and joined ranked before i was ready for it so I'm bronze 5.
