Basically it is a subscription based service that gives players exclusive Esports related content, much like other sports provide, including Interviews, stats, analysis and replays beyond the normal LCS broadcasts. it would also give rewards in the client like borders and icons and here is the kicker **a BRAND NEW QUEUE** exclusive to subscription members. \r\nNow I know what you are all thinking &quot;Pay to win&quot; &quot;longer Queue times&quot; &quot;how does this help ranked?&quot;. hear me out first, here is how it would work:\r\n\r\n* this subscription is for Esports enthusiasts and will help like minded people connect\r\n* the idea is only people who are interested in the competitive side of League of Legends will subscribe\r\n* this will not effect regular ranked play\r\n* this new queue will have its own &quot;elo&quot; system but is geared more toward pairing players of similar experience, not win/loss.\r\n* it will have much heavier penalties for bad behaviour (e.g. afk) because it is a premium service with stricter agreements, you can always go play ranked if you get banned for a day or 2 from premium queue\r\n* this has the potential to replace the &quot;ranked team&quot; queue from yesteryear by allowing more serious teams to compete against each other without the inherent &#039;randomness&#039; of dynamic queue, that being said you could play both solo, duo or with a team in this queue. \r\n* as for queue times, yes they will be a fair bit longer but less strict with matchmaking rules because it is assumed the people in this queue are going to be more skilled and knowledgeable than general ranked, so that should buffer things somewhat. \r\n\r\nhopefully this will bring some more variety to the game and give players a chance to adapt to different &#039;meta(s)&#039;  than in current dynamic queue (e.g. lane swapping and level 1 strategies{{item:3340}} ) because players can be better relied on to be strategically minded  and teamwork oriented. More Esports content can only help make it more popular and, just like in conventional sports, make the viewing experience sustainable in the future. \r\n\r\nthanks and please share this around, leave your opinions and any questions or improvements in the comments\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nSam &quot;TheSaint&quot;{{champion:67}} \r\n\r\nTL:DR\r\nIdea for a premium Esports Service with exclusives and rewards as well as a new queue for more competitive Ranked play.","replies":[]}
