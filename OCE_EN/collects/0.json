Ended up in Low priority que for like the 3rd time ever so as you do I contempated quitting and didn&#039;t play this account for over a week. Thought fuck it and started playing again.\r\n\r\nI have to say for a fact the positive experience blew my mind. Gone where the teemo/lux jungles and the literally horrid low skilled players and I was put with hardened players who literally really really wanted to win. We all knew our roles and these randoms played like how I would expect ranked players to play. So eventually I got out of low priority que and suddenly the trash talking zero map awareness trash can players where back in force literally had a 3/11 cho call me the worst player on the team... Not taking that shit lightly so I ended up chat restricted for the 3rd time in my life (been playing since beta). Now I have no idea how this happened but suddenly again I am put with the same hardened groups we all know our roles and play to win. So call me crazy I am going to keep this rolling and see if I can keep the restrictions going to see if I am crazy or if this is actually where the good players are being sent.","replies":[]}
