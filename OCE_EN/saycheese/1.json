This way your opponent will think twice about going for that last hit.\n\n- instead of the various scrolls dota has, league has \"summoner spells\". universal spells that everyone has (everyone at max level at least) you don't have all the summoner spells from the start, but they unlock as you level your summoner level, aka your account.\n\n- Another thing, league is a bit more forgiving with mana-usage ( this got a bit less forgiving since they kicked out the mana-potion). If you find that you run out to quickly you can decide to get one of the mana-regeneration items.\n\nAnd that's about it I guess, you should be able to get though the early levels without fucking up to much :) \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
