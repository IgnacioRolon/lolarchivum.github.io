Have played a couple of games at an internet cafe and a friends house for a lan but only found out what scripts looked like when I searched for &#039;scripting&#039; on Youtube after I got the message.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve put in a support ticket asking for feedback because I&#039;ve put over a thousand+ hours into the thing and just over $550NZD so to lose it is a pretty rough feeling. I guess it&#039;s harsh as I&#039;ve really been trying to improve with a friend giving me coaching and finally made it to Silver 2 in pre-season then got out of Bronze in season 6 with hopes of making gold.\r\n\r\nAnyway started playing in 2014 and have basically had a good teammate or honourable opponent ribbon solidly since.\r\n\r\nTldr: Can someone please look and see if my acct can be unbanned? If LSI is a forbidden app then I&#039;m SORRY I&#039;ll never use it again and will record my stats and gameplay some otherway.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback or news from anyone that&#039;s had the same as I&#039;ve seen a few of these posts around the boards in other regions.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nCandlewick","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-11T10:38:33.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Candlewick,\n\nLSI is not an application that Riot is currently taking action on. For suspensions regarding 3rd party applications and modifications, these are generally related to software that provide inherent advantages, such as automated jungle/ult timers, scripting software, and frame of view modifications. If you allowed another player to access your account, it's also possible that this player used 3rd party applications on your account.
