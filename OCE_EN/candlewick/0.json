Have played a couple of games at an internet cafe and a friends house for a lan but only found out what scripts looked like when I searched for &#039;scripting&#039; on Youtube after I got the message.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve put in a support ticket asking for feedback because I&#039;ve put over a thousand+ hours into the thing and just over $550NZD so to lose it is a pretty rough feeling. I guess it&#039;s harsh as I&#039;ve really been trying to improve with a friend giving me coaching and finally made it to Silver 2 in pre-season then got out of Bronze in season 6 with hopes of making gold.\r\n\r\nAnyway started playing in 2014 and have basically had a good teammate or honourable opponent ribbon solidly since.\r\n\r\nTldr: Can someone please look and see if my acct can be unbanned? If LSI is a forbidden app then I&#039;m SORRY I&#039;ll never use it again and will record my stats and gameplay some otherway.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback or news from anyone that&#039;s had the same as I&#039;ve seen a few of these posts around the boards in other regions.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nCandlewick\r\n\r\nUpdate: Apparently LSI is OK according to community members. Waiting to hear from Riot with a little more hope :)","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-03-11T17:57:26.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scripting is really looked over heavily by the staff of the game. \n\nSo most likely even though you make it out you weren't, you probably were scripting and are now making a plea to get it revoked and trust me you wont get it revoked. It is EXTREMELY rare for them to revoke a permaban. I personally have never heard of it.\n\nJust start a new account really and be smarter with how you play the game.. Don't know why you would put half a grand into the game then cheat in some form. My fun account alone i have easily 1500$ worth of RP stuff. There is no way i would use cheats while on that account if i ever did and i wouldnt because cheating is for morons.","replies":[{"poster":"Candlewick","date":"2016-03-11T23:57:12.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Volcanuz,\n\nHave been looking over the boards and there are a few people with the same issue and the outcome was never good once it got this far. Have basically accepted there won't be a review/change and the account is lost.\n\nI've started a new account but am just a little sad to have lost my first account when I'm certain that I didn't knowingly use anything that gave me an advantage. As you say, it would be dumb to ever risk an account since cheating in a video game is stupid. I mean I was just proud to have actually worked hard to improve and get out of Bronze during the actual season.\n\nThe only positive thing I think is now I get a fresh MMR but I just feel a little in shock that the account is gone and I haven't been given any info regarding what I am accused of using or anything. All I've learned is maybe don't use LSI and only play on my home computer... expensive lessons in time and $","replies":[]}]}]}
