She&#039;s a no skill champ. She can miss a few skillshots and still delete enemies. She&#039;s too mobile. A master of kiting. Uses her sex appeal to distract people. Too much damage, especially her Q. And Riot has the audacity to let her keep moving while she uses Q along with the movement speed burst. You can&#039;t catch her unless you have a gap closer. Usually the gap closers would be too predictable, so she would charm you and do so much damage that you would have to back off. The only gap closer that is effective on her is flash since the gap closer is instant.\n\nIf you see people die as Ahri a lot, they&#039;re obviously playing her wrong. Ahri should not put herself in any danger unless the player knows that the enemy team is distracted from their own allied champions. She should NEVER be the first to dive into the enemy team. She can easily initiate a battle by landing a clean charm, WHICH IS EASY. Because she is OP and charm should be nerfed.\n\nI don&#039;t wanna ramble on too long. Just play Ahri. Most safest pick. Face rolls everywhere. Best mage at the moment. Crazy AOE damage while keeping herself out of danger. Here&#039;s the best way to deal with her. Once someone gets a CC on her, stack more CC at her and instantly remove her from the teamfight. SHE IS A PAIN! AND SHE SHOULD BE NERFED!","replies":[{"poster":"AliGantz","date":"2016-01-29T12:27:54.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Show me on this doll where you were touched...","replies":[{"poster":"Specs","date":"2016-01-31T00:16:49.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL AHAHAHAHHAHAHA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-30T03:26:09.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And yet, lux and malz have higher win rates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-29T09:15:15.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"welcome back","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-29T09:30:37.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kylar Alice,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=6rlelIKp,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-29T09:15:15.957+0000)\n>\n> welcome back\n\nI even remember this one","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-02-01T18:47:33.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As some one who plays Ahri,\nShes super squishy, when her ult is down she is very immobile compared to other mobile champs, and her ults cd is average in length, not too long not too short. \nShe was in s4 early s5 a bit of a monster but her damage has already been scaled back. Q and E are skill shots and her mana costs are relatively high so don't call her no skill. \nHer charm while very effective if it hits, has to hit, is short duration and blocked by minions. So you have plenty of counter play there. \nHer q is actually kinda slow moving and has a rather obvious telegraph cast so you should be able to dodge it and unless she double taps you with it its damage is meh.\nTLDR Ahri has a lot of burst but there is a lot of counter play to her so man up and learn her kit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-01-30T16:14:02.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
