I am extremely pissed off as to what happened. I have really bad internet, ok? Getting a new one would be too expensive at the moment. Now I've been loyal to this game and yes, I did spend a lot of money on skins. Cause I like this game. My internet has now gotten old and disconnects or lags at really dodgy times. Times when EVERYONE uses the internet. Freakin Dodo, I swear. \n\nBut, I do my best to play fair with the other gamers. When I disconnect, I always do my best to get back in. And I do. The thing is that League of Legends of kind of glitched sometimes. When the internet connects again, the game doesn't really connect until I exit out of it while giving me a warning about a leaver buster. TOO BAD! BECAUSE I HAVE TO LEAVE AND JOIN IN AGAIN! So I join the game again and do my best.\n\nWin or lose, I still get the leaver buster. 20 minute wait for 5 games. But this has happened several of times. And it's really frustrating me. I will get new internet soon. But come on. How is this fair towards me? This is too strict. The leaver buster is too severe. It's aggravating. I just bought a DJ Sona skin and wanted to play it the game. But I picked the time where the internet was being a little shit without much warning.\n\nCan you fix this system? I don't afk in my games on purpose. Most of the times my internet is fine, but it has random times where it disconnects or lags a lot. And I want you to lift my leaver buster. I don't want it right now. I've had enough trying to wait.

The amount of time that a person has to not input action for to be considered \"afk\" should be increased from five minutes, because it usually takes a person around ten minutes to get back into game after disconnecting.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't likely going to change. Not sure why; maybe I'll be enlightened one day.\n\nFor now, I suggest you only play when you know your internet is going to perform better.","replies":[]}]}
