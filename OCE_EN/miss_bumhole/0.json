Because a lot of gamer girls I see usually just feed, and it really makes my gender group look bad. Like you guys look down to us and only think of us as objects. So I really wanted to prove a point. What do I get from the enemy team? Negativity. Wow. They were being sarcastic and then suddenly calling me a biiiitch who needs a good bang. Then they started focusing me the early game and harassed me to the point where I was 0/6 KDA\r\n\r\nSo I did my best to not give into this rudeness and negative behaviour. Enough was enough. Katarina can easily catch up, I was using her this game. I was waiting for the right moment to jump into the fight to do a kill steal, because I needed a few kills to get back into the game properly. So I got my first kill on one of the guys who trash talked me the whole game. Then that's when I started owning them and made them my biitch. In the end, I was 12/9 and had the most kills in my team. \r\n\r\nSo as we got into the end game lobby, I just laughed at them. Pretty much spammed \"AHAHAHAHAHAHA, GO GAMER GIRLS!\" and they had nothing good to say back. They felt embarrassed. One of them tried to make a comeback by being sarcastic, but why would I be mad. He was pissed since he was telling me how much I sucked at the game. It made me feel good that I got to carry my team and proved them wrong that I didn't suck.\r\n\r\nSo quit disrespecting us gamer girls. A lot of us a good at League of Legends. Deal with it!","replies":[{"poster":"Side Line","date":"2015-01-08T12:17:43.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah the rude behaviour is not so nice towards gamer girls.

I don't do that in my games. It's best to just let them think you're a guy, otherwise you're asking for even more abuse, or you're probably just trying to show off and make them compliment/like you. It doesn't work like that. The internet is full of young teenage boys who think it's okay to abuse women online. \n\nAnd for the record, I do not 'feed every game'.
