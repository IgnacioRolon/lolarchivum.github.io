They have already prevented duo across two tiers (for example bronze and gold cannot duo) so why not prevent it across tiers unless it is say silver I and gold V? At the moment, when trying to rise a tier you are generally already playing those people anyway. Right now I am hating the Divisions and Tiers as they mean absolutely nothing. If MMR works perfectly (I know this will never happen but) you should never rise divisions as if you are winning and losing half of your games exactly then you will never get through promos as after reaching 100 LP (so just after one win) you must win two out of your three next games. That is winning three out of four games at the right stage which shouldn&#039;t happen. Now I am _**NOT**_ saying that it is impossible to rise, I know it is. What I am saying is that it is impossible to reach a &#039;balanced&#039; stage where you are the same skill level as everyone else.\n\ntl;dr what is the point of having tiers and divisions if they have no effect on who you are playing?\n\nEdit: For clarity this talking about bronze to low gold tiers.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-07T09:02:37.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  They have already prevented duo across two tiers (for example bronze and gold cannot duo) so why not prevent it across tiers unless it is say silver I and gold V?\n\nThe difference between bronze and gold is not the same as the difference between silver 1 and gold 5","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-06-07T09:43:19.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you do not deny there **IS** a difference between them.

As far as I understand it, it is possible for someone to have an MMR an entire tier below their rank. To expand on that, if you had a play whose rank was Bronze V and a play whose rank was Gold V but both their MMRs were at a Silver V level it would be entirely possible for them to be in a game with each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-06-08T02:48:12.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is the stupid part. It should be that the person in gold V is only paired with the people in gold V and he will quickly be demoted.
