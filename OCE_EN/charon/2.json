I normally go mid Viktor and normally win lane and try to secure dragon but no matter what i do something happens like jungle/bot lane just lets dragon get taken or i have to try and defend top and mid.\r\n\r\ntl;dr i get fed but i cant be everywhere at once\r\n\r\nso the question is: what do i do if im fed such as push mid all day or roam bot?","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-15T09:14:54.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah... dont play victor if you want to climb, hes pretty much the GP/Galio of SoloQ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kwang is God","date":"2014-12-15T01:32:10.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seeing that you are in Bronze, you can literally carry a game single handely  especially when you are using an AP carry. \n\nYou have to win lane EVERYTIME not just normally to carry in bronze, you just can't rely on your taemmate. \n\nSometimes its much more important to STAY ALIVE than die from trying to contest dragon when your team does not even respond. \n\nIf you're fed, the general way to snowball further is too watch your lanes, see which lanes you can most likely get a kill in and gank those lanes (ie if you see enemy bot lane is overextending, roam bot and get a double. Same thing for top lane)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Playco Armboy","date":"2014-12-14T11:42:02.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately there isn't much you can do without a more mobile champion if anything I suggest picking up a different champion for ranked like zed or ahri someone with more mobility so you CAN be everywhere at once and zed has a really good split push. Yasuo is also a strong pick but you have to master his early game or you will end up being next to useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2014-12-14T11:01:21.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get a few early kills, roam quickly. Viktor can gank lanes great with his w, and if your team has another stun it becomes very easy to land. Roaming bot early with the jungle after 2 or 3 kills will allow you to shut out their ADC completely. Top lanes are generally tanks, and if so, let them fight it out, late game their power won't be too significant compared to a fed bot lane. If there is an assassin top however, like Zed, Pop up there a few times, just to keep his power levels down. But, even while ganking, keep an eye on mid lane, as your opponent will be getting free farm, try not to spend too long in wait for a good time to gank. Dragon as an objective is very powerful early game since preseason, so after a gank bot a quick 4 man dragon should give you a healthy lead, and may bait their mid lane and jungle for more kills. If you rush a Lich Bane on Viktor, staying in a lane to push after a gank is a great idea, as you will gain map control. Careful of assassin's like Akali coming and cleaning you up after your ganks, as champions like this can snowball out of control. \n\ntl;dr Roam around, mostly bot, try to secure objectives after successful ganks but keep an eye on mid\n\nGood Luck","replies":[]}]}
