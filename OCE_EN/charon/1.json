Win or loss. This still needs to be a major factor in MMR no matter what\n2. Kill participation. People always say \"objectives win games\" but having a number advantage helps secure those objectives\n3. Warding. Riot would need to add something which prevents people spamming wards in base but warding is a major part of LoL\n4. Objective control. Things like taking dragon, taking turrets are all important and having good objective control is paramount\n5. Champion and role diversity. If you only play Kat mid and troll whenever you don&#039;t get mid then you are not as good as someone who has mastery of all roles\n6. CS. This would be very minor but if someone consistently has 300+ cs they deserve to be recognized\n\nAll of these would be dependent on what role you are playing which, as we can see from the frequently played champion, is able to be recognized and so when you play support you are not expected to have a lot of CS but have more wards, and when you play top you are expected to have lower kill participation but more CS.\n\nSecondly this should affect your LP\n1. People who DC, AFK in base or something along those lines should take a percentage of everyone else&#039;s LP loss\n2. Length of game. If you manage to delay the game to 50 minutes you deserve to lose less LP than a team that surrenders at 20\n3. Vice Versa for point 1 as if you win a game which was a 4v5 most of the way then you deserve more credit\n\nAll of these points would not be major but would just be something to help differentiate people more than just win/loss\n\nIs there anything I missed?\n\ntl;dr if you don&#039;t want to read  it don&#039;t read it and don&#039;t comment","replies":[{"poster":"5 Crow 1 Fiddle","date":"2015-04-02T11:41:08.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem isn't MMR, its the strategy diversity riot always talk about.\n\nWhy are you feeling one-sided? because they are better than you at one thing, and that one thing cost you the game.\n\n1. strategy diversity keep lowering in league\n2. The way to win become narrows\n3. It all comes down to how well you complete a certain task, instead of creativity \n4. Team coop and vision is everything\n5. It all comes down to how well you complete a certain task, instead of creativity \n6. You can no longer play freely because there is dragon now, every 6 minutes you need to report to that\n7.

What if you happen to get a feeder on your team 9/10? It can happen. Most of don't have the time to grind 100 games to rise a tier.\n\nFirst point: I never EVER mentioned making KDA a factor. I am beginning to think you never read my original point\n\nSecond point: AFK's aren't going to be doing anything to get kill participation, and true feeders don't get any kills and assist they just die. I think you can't tell the difference between a bad player and a feeder.\n\nThird point: If you lose the game with 4 dragons to their one you don't get anymore recognition than if you lose 0 dragons to 5\n\nFourth point: Yes I meant to type \"does make you a better player\" don't know why I didn't. I also am sick of twelve year old whining on and trolling because first pick banned their favourite champion (most often zed)\n\nFifth point: I think you missed my point which is you can pick a champion for whatever way you want to win. If you want to pick someone who is good at pushing turrets fine. If you want to pick someone who is good at farming and turns into a beast late game then that is also fine\n\nSixth point: it is pretty hard to carry when you are supporting a Caitlyn who gets grabbed by blitz everytime its up, the yasuo lost lane to a kassadin, the naut is dcing every five minutes and the top lane is frozen, so i think the fact we held out deserves some recoginition","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-03T02:00:19.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">The theory \"because you are not feeding then there are four people on your team to feed and five on the other team\" is all based on luck.

None of the enemy champs should stop you from doing your damage and getting instantly out (especially at bronze)\n\n4 days ago, Ez ADC, 4/3/2, this is a 30 minute game, you probably had early kills, why did you not snowball this yourself?\n\n4 days ago, Thresh support, 0/12/11, sure you have 50% kill contribution, when you also contribute all those to deaths this doesn't help.\n\n3 days ago, Thresh 1/6/1, 3 days ago, Hecarim, 1/10/3, 2 days ago, kennen, 2/8/3, none of these are even close to acceptable.\n\nJust as a note, your average KDA in ranked for the last 20 games is 1.58, a decent player in any elo, hits around 3 KDA, your most played champion (thresh) has a 75% win rate, and a 1.87 KDA, your winning that often, and can't even hit a 2 KDA.\n\nQuit complaining about the MMR system and check the problem you bring to a team, because you may not be totally the reason for your losses, but i can tell for sure you ain't the reason your winning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-04-02T03:13:32.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your idea, however am not sure of equation for adequately describe this as of yet.\nI will put it on my to do list.","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-04-02T10:21:32.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would have to be extremely complicated and not worth the effort, I was only really looking to see what people thought of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-02T06:05:59.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah this would actually be great.
