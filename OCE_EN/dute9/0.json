Why can i get banned for being toxic in lol? 50% of the game is talking and 30% playing and 20% troll (Or that is what it feels like) I just find it strange that i can banned for typing a word or being anoying, if people don&#039;t like what i type then why can&#039;t they mute me and that&#039;s it, why do i gotta get banned and watch carefully what i write, i understand geting banned for cheating, and runing it down mid. i feel so useless when someone on my team says that i don&#039;t deserve the win beacuse i failed on gank, then later just go feed enemy because i failed once,it&#039;s like being hold hostage, if i type somthing i get banned, if i don&#039;t type anything the other guy wins. it rly depresing to see and this happends usualy 1/5 games, i know the people who feed are &quot;hopefuly&quot; gonna get banned  but some of them get away, i wish there was alowed and if it&#039;s so insulting to people can&#039;t we trash talkers be together so the 1% can be nice to each other and the trash talkers stay in one game so it&#039;s all balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Probaly sound very stupide for &quot;wondering why being toxic is not allowed&quot; but i just want a clean and structured answear that maybe can change my mind.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-14T01:46:53.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"25 game chat restriction for calling someone a dumb%%%% and having a debate why i shouldnt help someone who is inting my lane.

The mute feature isn't a protection against toxicity, it's a protection against continued toxicity.\n\n2. **Muting only hides the behaviour, it doesn't address why it is or isn't ok.** If players know they can get away with calling everyone racist/sexist/homophobic/etc slurs or general abuse because \"they'll just mute me\" it encourages that behaviour to continue (no consequences). That's a pretty shit example to set, especially in a game rated _M (13+)_, and *will* bleed out of the game and into their day to day behaviour. That's not the kind of community you want to foster anywhere, but especially in a *team* based game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatchandKiss","date":"2018-10-26T12:05:26.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"If you can't say anything nice don't say anything at all.\" That rule applies as much to League as it does to everything else in life.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-15T10:02:33.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your spelling is terrible, spend more time in school and less time on Lol please.\n\nTrash talking is fine if you follow the rules.\nYou can trash talk all you want as long as it is game related.
