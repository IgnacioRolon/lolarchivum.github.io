First try logging into the account that isn't working on another computer if possible. If it works there get back to me and we'll go from there. If it doesn't work there either and the other account does you are going to have to submit a ticket to player support (include the pastebin link in the ticket) so they can take a look and work out what's causing it.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-13T14:54:01.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll get some of the Wrenchmen from EU and NA (whoever replies first) on it since ours are unavailable atm :) I'll get back to you once I have an idea of what's going on, I do player behaviour so don't really know what I'm looking at, but I'm sure the error code means something to them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Declined","date":"2017-05-13T08:50:33.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Extalix,\n\nIn order to get your problem looked into, we would need to have a look at your LeagueClient log from this incident.\nIt's somewhat odd that you're able to log into one, but not the other account, so to be on the safe side we would like a copy of BOTH LeagueClient logs, one from when you weren't able to log in, and another from when you were able to log in, make sure we can tell apart the logs when you upload them.\n\n#LeagueClient Log\n\n* Go to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Logs\\LeagueClient Logs\"\n* Select the latest \"LeagueClient.log\" file\n* Open it using notepad or a similar program\n* Select everything (ctrl + A) and copy it\n* Go to [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/) and paste the content there\n* Set the expiration date to 1 week\n* Submit it\n* Share the link with us\n\n***\n\nAs I'm from EU I don't frequent the OCE boards much, therefore please respond to Seras Dragon instead of me, and remember to include the logs.\nIt is imperative that you use the reply function to Seras Dragon' post and not mine, cause I probably won't see it for quite a while.\nNo logs, no helperino :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-05-13T05:57:40.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Extalix,\n\nUnexpected errors are usually the result of poor connection to the servers, that is, not everything is being processed to log you in due to communication failure on the way to the servers.\n\nThis error wouldn't be account-specific however, could your provide some additional details or clarify your issue for us please?","replies":[]}]}
