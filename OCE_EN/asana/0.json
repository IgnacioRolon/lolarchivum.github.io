It was one of the dreams the plagued him even when he was mortal, a beautiful clashing of wings and gold, blood splattered across every surface, and something else he couldn&#039;t quite see. It was almost as if his visions had a life of their own, looking back at him, telling him: find out for yourself, we won&#039;t reveal everything to you. \r\nMalzahar knew he was mad. He knew this before the void consumed him; and he knows it better now. The world is constantly shifting, and he is all too aware of it, although the groans as the earth beneath him eventually falls on deaf ears as he becomes obsessed in finding this war-torn paradise. \r\nHis rage and madness grows as his quest to find the paradise continues. One night, in a sudden bout of insanity, he buries half his disciples, laughs as some run away screaming at the images in their mind, and spends the time until dawn slowly breaking the spirits of those who are left.\r\nAnd it&#039;s not until he kills a few of his voidlings, his own summoned voidlings, that the void decides that it has had enough of Malzahar&#039;s obsession. It shows him the way to the paradise: through the body of one of the immortal warriors. \r\nThe void feeds him more information that Malzahar laps up greedily: the warrior was fighting in a losing war against her sister, and had discovered a spell to open a small rift to the void, to absorb some of the immense power within the darkness.\r\nAnd when she opens the rift, the void tells him, its voice like the softest silk brought back by the bravest warriors from the spider queen&#039;s lands, and at the same time rough like the sands of Shurima scraping over the ruins of a lost country.\r\nAnd so Malzahar closes his eyes, and looks beyond his homerealm.\r\nHe sees nothing at first, then gold and purple and another indescribable colour comes into  vision; they drift in, like a cool breeze in a hot summer&#039;s night. Coming in and out of sight, Malzahar felt peace for perhaps the first and last time in his life.\r\nThen the &#039;breeze&#039; becomes faster. Flashing in front of his eyes like lightning, and he could hear thunder as well. \r\nNo, not thunder. Sounds like thunder. The flapping of wings... or were it screamed warcrys? Malzahar let himself dwell in these fantasies for a moment, before opening his eyes once more.\r\nAnd now there was a clear scene in front of him: a woman, with her back turned to him, wearing shining silver and gold armour, a helmet discarded nearby, and hair flowing backwards, pushed back by the force of the purple, pulsing thing that writhed in front of her.\r\nSome small part of Malzahar&#039;s conscience, the part that remembered, however vaguely, the feeling of being mortal, of being human, of being unburdened by all these visions, cried out desperately. The purple thing was evil. Or was it? The void part of him asked back. Or was it just creating a new world, a new world that could be enjoyed by the creatures coming from the void? \r\nTo make a new world, you need to break an old one, whispered the soft but rough voice. \r\nMalzahar could only watch as the woman reached towards the ball. He could only close his eyes as he heard the terrified scream. He could only listen on as he heard a soulless scream, one he had heard once before, when he became of the void, and then all was silent.\r\nSlowly, he opened his eyes. Splattered across the floor, was a mass of swirly purple liquid, that seemed to be slowly gathering to form. It was as if the floor was covered with purple glow-worms, casting an eerie glow on the surroundings. \r\nHere is your vessel, the void&rsquo;s voice said, its voice echoing off the walls of his mind. Take it. And you will be able to live in this paradise&hellip; the voice hissed out the last word, almost as if it pained it to say the word. Go, Malzahar&hellip; this is what you have wanted, is it not? I do not grant wishes easily&hellip; take the vessel&hellip;\r\nBut he couldn&rsquo;t. The writhing purple mass disgusted him. It was what remained of the beautiful, winged being. And what remained? Her magic being slowly eaten up by the void? Her body turned into mush by the power of the void? \r\nThe disgust turned into pity. She had tried a terrible spell, known she had to pay a terrible price, to win this war. And the spell had failed her. The rift had opened too wide, and she had let too many horrors spill out into her. Now the war-torn paradise was ruined, tainted by the purple stains of the void. \r\nThe purple mass was gathering now, piling itself until it was the height of what the woman once was. Then it began to form features; a sharp, angular nose, wide, unseeing eyes, a thing but wide mouth, hands with crookedly long fingers. So many traits that could be considered beautiful, but exaggerated just to the point that the purple woman was nothing except a horror.\r\nYou have missed your chance, Malzahar, the voice seemed childishly happy as it said these words. I saw that you could have been a great prophet, and gave you power, but you let your mortalness take over. I cannot have such an abomination controlling the void. Goodbye, Malzahar. \r\nAnd Malzahar can feel the void slip from him, slither away. He can feel his own features shift, the tattoos sinking into his skin, disappearing. And finally, finally, his eyes stopped burning, and he could see. See with his eyes, not with the filtered vision the void had gifted him with. And his surroundings seemed so much brighter, so much more beautiful than he had remembered it. And it was his world. It was Runeterra, his beautiful homerealm.\r\nThe woman was still standing in front of him.\r\nBut he didn&rsquo;t care. He could feel the hot tears running down his cheeks, he could feel the rough sand beneath him, and he could feel so many emotions at once, the proper emotions that a human should feel, happiness, rage, sadness&hellip; not the empty, the voidness that he had felt before. \r\nAnd with a bright sun shining on him, Malzahar thought to himself, I&rsquo;m happy. It was a quiet, subdued and almost wary thought, as if he expected the void to take over again. But when it didn&rsquo;t, Malzahar laid back and laughed. At first, it was an alien, chocking sound, almost as if his throat and mouth wasn&rsquo;t used to it, as if he was speaking a language he didn&rsquo;t understand, but then the laugh changed, and he could feel the humanness within himself again.\r\nAnd he laughed and laughed, until his throat was dry and burning, but he could still feel the happiness, the strength of it, the pure rawness of it. All he could think was, I&rsquo;m free.\r\nMorgana.\r\nA voice sounded out. It was the woman. \r\nMalzahar looked up and the woman stared back blankly. Her eyes were what Malzahar&rsquo;s once was, burning with a purple fire-like substance, unseeing of the real world.\r\n&ldquo;Morgana.&rdquo;\r\nThe croaked word barely made it past his cracked lips, but it still sounded so ethereal, so unnatural that he couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder at the sound of it.\r\nThere was a moment, and the woman, no, Morgana, smiled at him, a smile that was all teeth and no happiness, and she pointed one pointed, elongated finger at him and he could feel his body fading away from him, turning into golden sand.\r\nIt didn&rsquo;t matter.\r\nHe was happy, and he held onto the happiness as he felt himself fade away. Nothing mattered, because he could feel this warm, glowing, swirl of emotion within himself once again.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-07T02:17:24.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was one of the **dreams the plagued him** even when he was mortal - ?? what does that mean.\n\nAm sorry to say, if the opening is flawed, most would not read the rest.\n\nAs for the rest of the points this piece of writing convey. It has no meaning. Characters are introduced out of no where. and when you mention \"warrior losing war to sister - It sound like you are talking about yourself. Because it is so random, and pointless to mention about a war; When the reader havent got any info about the world to grow any attachment\"\n\nHate to be the bearer of bad news. But damn, it terrible...","replies":[]}]}
