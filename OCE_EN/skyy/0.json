The easiest solution is to just reinstall League, but that sucks and takes too long. Here's what I do:\n\nStep 1) Open windows explorer.\n\nStep 2) Navigate to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\\"\n\nStep 3) Create a new, empty file in the latest version folder named \"S_OK\", with no extension. Restart League with admin privileges.\n\nIt should scan for the files and then continue downloading the rest of the patch. Also, if you set a custom volume for League, then it will reset. Not inside League itself, though.\n\nIf you need any help with it, just ask.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Revannchist","date":"2016-06-23T15:29:12.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is pretty late reply but I'm having the same issue and can you tell me how to create an \"empty file\" I really have no idea!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-24T05:43:29.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Revannchist,realm=EUNE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=6yZmxBBM,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-06-23T15:29:12.832+0000)\n>\n> I know this is pretty late reply but I&#x27;m having the same issue and can you tell me how to create an &quot;empty file&quot; I really have no idea!\n\nHeyo!
