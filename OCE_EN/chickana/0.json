I have a G500s logitec mouse (wired). I&#039;ve had it for a fair while (3 or so years) and it has served me well for everything. Now Lately I&#039;ve been having issues with the game randomly lagging at points but that is a different issue (I think). Around the same time these lag spikes started to become a problem my mouse started to randomly disconnect during games as well. Strange thing is this is only for LOL that it decides to muck up. Times it commonly disconnects/stops working are: \r\n\r\nLifting the mouse to re-adjust its position\r\nWhen holding the mouse at the edge of the screen to move the camera\r\nTwitching movements\r\n\r\nSo now I&#039;m curious to know whether this is a mouse issue, laptop issue (yes I&#039;m using a laptop atm...), or, since it only happens in LOL, a LOL based issue.. I&#039;m no tech expert so if it&#039;s obvious to you then please enlighten me. Note: The only reason I&#039;m posting in a League of Legends board is because as I stated it only happens during League games.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-19T23:13:27.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try the following.\n\n* In device manager, under Human Interface Devices, select USB Input Device, Properties, Power management, Untick Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-17T05:15:14.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a driver issue? Try updating your graphics drivers and your mouse drivers (if it has some). That's my only suggestion :(\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]}
