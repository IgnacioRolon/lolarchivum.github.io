I find it amazing that the only 2 games I ever play where I&#039;ve abused someone (and by abuse I mean the typical &quot;you&#039;re an idiot how are you that bad blah blah blah&quot;) but to be perma-banned for it when I play with people who are far worse and have never had any action taken seems like a joke? My account history could be reviewed as well to see that I consistently get the new &quot;most honorable&quot; awards and try to help other players and offer constructive feedback. Sure if i had been incredibly toxic in multiple games all the time I would understand, but I haven&#039;t been. So I&#039;d love a reason as to why I&#039;m apparently only a part of 0.006% of players to be banned when I&#039;m nowhere near as bad as half the crap I see? Not to mention that the stuff I say isn&#039;t even as bad as whats said to me in the games I played? Is it because I&#039;m not a baby and don&#039;t report someone for saying stupid things like &quot;go kill yourself&quot; that they get no punishment but I do? \n\nLong story short, apparently 2 games is enough to get you perma-banned even though others are far more toxic and say far worse stuff in those games. Nice one Riot.\n\nEdit: Is there anyway to contact Riot to actually get support and to have this looked at? Because this is incredibly frustrating to say the least considering the time and money put into the account... Doesn't make me want to keep playing the game because of 2 incidents where I'm the one being targeted and I bite back? Maybe something should be looked at considering people who purposely try to tilt and aggravate others yet receive no punishment...","replies":[{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2017-06-25T09:38:03.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter that you're \"only toxic sometimes\", its the fact you are being toxic in the first place, which is what Riot is trying to get rid of. You don't get banned for being toxic for one game, even if you are extremely toxic. Everyone has bad days and riot respects that, so either you've been reported a lot before and considering you've been previously banned it would most definitely not help out your situation.  And people DO get punished for being toxic, like exactly what happened to you. It happens to everyone who is being toxic and gets reported for it, its the tribunal system. How about you don't get toxic and flame people. I report anyone i see being toxic, not because: \"oh my feelings were hurt im a sook\", its because i dont want anyone else \nto put up with the toxicity in their games. Its OUTSTANDING how many people tend to forget there is a \"Mute Player\" option right next to their champion on the scoreboard, literally press it and you wont ever hear from them again. Bam, wam and in the bag, they can't flame you. And using the \"They flamed me first\" excuse is just childish, be the bigger man/woman and get on with it :) \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Bilgerats","date":"2017-06-25T11:05:18.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i havnt been toxic for atleast a month, and ive only been banned once before, and ive been playing since the start of season 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Actuality","date":"2017-06-25T09:48:58.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the thing, I'm happy to admit I was toxic those 2 games and deserved a chat restriction or a short term ban or whatever. But no, it was just those 2 games, and in the same game that I got perma-banned for I was told to kill myself and continuously flamed, but because I didn't report them, 0 action. They can go read the chat logs if they want and they'll clearly see that. \nRiot doesn't respect that everyone has bad days because if they did it wouldn't be a permanent ban for 2 incidents. \n\nI'm normally never toxic and as stated, try to openly help people, which is usually met with \"F*** off kill yourself\", I get 2 bad games where I'm tilted and it's right to perma-ban? Even the people I play with are shocked because they say far worse than I do and yet I'm the one to receive a ban.\n\nNormally I do just mute all in games but everyone has one off games that just get to them, it seems ridiculous that hard earned money and time can just be thrown away for nothing all because someone has a bad day? That's pretty counter intuitive to trying to prevent people being toxic because you're likely to just make them even angrier.","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Bilgerats","date":"2017-06-25T11:02:23.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the point of my comment is to point out the fact riot is punishing people for being a toxic asshole very rarely, but not the regular toxic assholes, thats what i think is unfair.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2017-06-25T09:55:14.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its good that you are admitting to it, but honesty does not always lead to forgiveness. I understand what you mean and how its unfair for you. I agree with you on the most-part. But I also get salty and sometimes....toxic. But I always try to maintain it and continue on playing. If Riot was soft with their tribunal there would be way more people going around tell people to kill themselves. Which is what they DON'T want. Sometimes a hard player base requires an even harder ruling fist. {{champion:254}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Filthy Bilgerats","date":"2017-06-25T11:01:45.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did not tell him to kill himself, i called him shit but i didnt tell him to kill himself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Filthy Bilgerats","date":"2017-06-25T08:48:44.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was toxic ONE game toward ONE player that started shit talking me for literally no reason, i said nothing to him prior to him flaming me, and i got a 14 day ban off it. i do admit i said some things, and that i was extremely toxic, but only that ONE game.. and i think its stupid that my account has been suspended over one game, when people do that stuff every game they play. so i very much agree with you, and think its unfair and shitty of riot to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Actuality","date":"2017-06-25T09:49:44.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets not count the fact over $1000 has been spent on the account and loads of time put into it.
