Ive 3 full accounts with every champ and most skins, spent $100&#039;s  if not $1000&#039;s on them, loved the game, so $$ don&#039;t matter, but almost ready to hang the boots up. and yes all you ppl will say its me the only one i can control and etc etc. but try playing in bronze/silver! after this you will agree with me about this, its sad to see lol go like this but &quot;endofdays&quot; is coming. my main concern with this is the new players busting to reach lv 30 only to play ranked and this garbage what awaits them,","replies":[]}
