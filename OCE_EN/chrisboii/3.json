That is, they are raging at their teammates who are 0-2 in lane, making them play worse. I'm not saying that you are doing this, though your shoddy English skills don't help much.\nif you keep a positive attitude throughout, your team will feel more relaxed, YOU will feel more relaxed, and you will play better. And there will be less trolls and ragers. I just got promoted to B4 yesterday, and there were very few angry/careless people in my games.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-06T01:06:46.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">your shoddy English skills don't help much.\n\nNot everyone has to speak perfect English to be considered a good person.\n\nI mean, like, what if you got beat up by some French dudes because you mispronounced \"Baguette\" or something?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-04T08:12:06.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wut","replies":[]}]}
