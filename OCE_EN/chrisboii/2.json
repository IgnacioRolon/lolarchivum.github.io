The same guy that just went 0-10 in a bronze game might well go 10-0 the next game  against the same players if an early gank or something goes the other way","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-05T10:52:18.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked matchmaking is fine, normal matchmaking is whats completely fucked and has been fucked since the release of this game, they should really fix it, challengers should never ever be matched with an unranked, i don't care what mode it is, it's unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-05T11:01:46.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never have problems with challengers in my game.. Sometimes they're  literally chilling and giving 0% of cares whether they win or lose. I know that the matchmaking is fine. You win games you lose games..

In normals it can get pretty crazy, especially if people join parties with friends. I've had Diamonds and Challanger players in Silver elo. \n\nThe seemingly inconsistent game difficulty is just due to lower elo players not knowing how to play from behind. So as soon as someone gets a small lead, everything goes to shit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ivy Valentine","date":"2015-10-05T10:16:36.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because generally players are volatile and once a lead is established it's hard to reclaim it without punishing a mistake heavily\n\nNot matchmaking, just life. Watch some challenger games, it even applies up in the higher echelons.","replies":[]}]}
