I&#039;ve created work before but it&#039;s been low quality and as such I would like someone to assist me in creating highlights/clips of myself that can be put together and then shared among YouTube, Facebook, forums etc so that I can grow and gain attention. If you are interested or know someone who might be please add me in game (Kylar Alice) so details can be worked out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T02:03:27.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend offering some incentive if you want someone to help you out, not many who can do what you're asking likely have the time to do it for nothing. But I might be able to help you a bit here.\n\nAs far as PC/Programs go, you don't need a beast computer to record good footage, your graphics card is the most important for that. So what graphics card do you have? \n\nIf you have an Nvidia one of even average specs it can probably utilise the Nvidia recording software which is by far the simplest, cheapest (its free with the card) and most versatile (without being complicated) screen recording software I am aware of. It can't do some of the fancier things that the more complicated/expensive ones do, but it will capture screen and audio at full res with no noticeable impact on frames. You can choose to capture mic audio or not as well. The best function of it by far is Shadowplay/DVR but I'll let you google that if you don't know what it is. The downside is the same as any recording software in that you need a lot of space to hold recordings because they get big fast. \n\nSecond would be, do you have any editing software at all? I'm assuming no given your post. I use After Effects but I had a permanent school license for CS6 that included it, I got lucky with that, most editing software is very expensive, After Effects included. I'm afraid I don't know any cheap ones of any kind of quality I would recommend.\n\nI would also recommend including your youtube or facebook links here, because highlights/montages are incredibly broad. Unlikely anyone will bother if they don't even know what kind of content you want to make.\n\nThere's also the fact that if you intend to mark edits etc it sucks all the creativity out of the actual editing process which is why most people who are capable do it, and if you don't, then it's essentially their work with your footage. I think you need to reconsider your partnership angle a bit better.\n\nI'm not trying to be insulting, just provide constructive criticism, I hope I can help you a bit in your endeavour.","replies":[]}]}
