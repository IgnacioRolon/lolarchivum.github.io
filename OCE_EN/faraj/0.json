I honestly believe this will work considering people will get the lane they are comfortable in and they will gain more lp and boost the league community in a whole. Lets leave bronze for the new players and give other people that are stuck there a chance to rise and be the best that can. Thanks for reading :)\r\nTL;DR\r\nMake a team builder ranked where you are guaranteed to get your lane ;)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-29T16:46:30.832+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what they ARE doing.\n\nGood to see you keep up to date and just request things they ask for.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-30T03:56:29.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just adding some sources here, it is definitely something we have in the pipeline.\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/02/red-post-collection-lyte-on-tribunal.html#1\n\n> **Lyte** also reiterated that they are currently working on a ranked version of Team Builder:\n> \"We're working on a Team Builder version of Ranked that is just selecting positions.

I'm not sure I agree with the delay part.\n\nI would highly suggest you watch this video it gives great insight into the kind of behvaiour we are seeing in game. (Especially watch the **\"Analyzing the Player Behaviour Problem\"** bit)\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n\n**Key part**\nMost players you come across (98%) are not inherently toxic players. Most players are neutral to positive **most** of the time but have outbursts every now and then due to a combination of reasons (real life factors, previous games,etc).\n\nWhen one of these normal players has a bad day or whatever that's when they are on edge and easily frustrated. In this situation I believe the more points of friction we can remove the better. Why wouldn't we look to remove as many points of conflict as possible through the design of the game? e.g. team builder, and default all chat off.\n\nChampion select right now in my opinion fosters conflict, it is common to have multiple people on the same team fighting over the same role.\n\nIf we removed this point of conflict, players can focus more on team compositions and working together.\n\nI do agree TB ranked and current ranked are different things, that's why I asked why you wouldn't want current ranked to be **replaced** by TB ranked considering it has the huge benefit of removing conflict and allowing our players to play the role they want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-29T17:12:29.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pick order works fine thanks friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-30T06:34:06.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obvs not for everyone thanks friend","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-07-03T06:54:24.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"kk pumpkin","replies":[]}]}]}]}
