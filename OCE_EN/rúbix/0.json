One from the original animation in which the path was sent by the player (or player model) and the animation of the hook latching onto the enemy champion. I feel like this hook should not have caught, but during gameplay, it felt like the hook teleported forward as if the rate of the hook traveling increased and latched onto me. I&#039;m just curious about how the hitbox might look on Thresh and how it registers on a champion being caught.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBrtGSkAA8c\n\nYou can view the video and pause it around 13 seconds frame by frame and you can clearly see 2 hitboxes. I do not really have any knowledge on hitboxes, so I can not be sure of how skill shots with cc interact upon landing on the target. I&#039;m most likely wrong about the hook not being able to land, but I guess I might as well get some insight on how cc registers upon catching a champion&#039;s hitbox.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-22T01:59:41.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that looks a little dodgy to me..\n\nIm afraid I can't offer too much insight on how the coding of hit-boxes work, but the layman version is that there is an invisible circle around your champion, and an invisible square around thresh's hook, and if those two shapes touch in any way, however slightly, you will be affected by the ability.\n\nThe great thing is, that they are both _invisible_ and so you have to rely on the visible animation only which is layered over the top _(which more often than not, does not line up correctly with the actual coded hit-box)_. Hence situations like this, where apparently the two invisible shapes have touched, but the animation/models clearly haven't.\n\nSomeone once told me that the hit-box on thresh's hook is actually a T shape, and is wider at the end where the hook is, and because of how the shape is coded, rather than the shape increasing in _length_ as the hook travels more distance, the shape just gets _larger_, meaning the hit-box actually increases in size the further the hook travels. However this is just hearsay, I have no evidence to back that statement up, but it would explain a lot of the suspect hooks we see.\n\nYour situation does look more dodgy than most though.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-22T03:19:48.557+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To my knowledge, this might also be partially Lucian's hit box moves slightly behind him when he E's so if he E's too late to dodge something, things will hit.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-22T05:47:13.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yep, and tristana's hitbox doesn't move until around 3/4 through the w rocket jump animation, meaning she can appear like she's already gone over a wall or to safety and you can hook her by grabbing (as a hook champ) or condemning (as vayne or poppy) the spot she jumped from and pull her all the way back.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-24T09:43:01.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an issue with Lucian's e, not thresh q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-23T03:23:35.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://imgur.com/D6kCQyt\n\nLeague of legends ladies and gentlemen","replies":[]}]}
