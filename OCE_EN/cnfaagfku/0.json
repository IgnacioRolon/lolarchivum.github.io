They usually make you win a couple of games and get you to promo when you start playing first 3 hours. Then riot makrs you keep losing games and leave me broken hearted after playing for 10 hours. I never let myself get addicted to thinhs except tobaccos but I think ranked games are way more evil than pockey machines in the casino. I dont know who invented this system but they should make it +18 and should warn ppl so they dont waste time. Riot ur evil and shoud be punished by justice for inventing this system. Anyone know number for help.lines ?","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-05-18T05:46:07.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres mental helpline","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-05-18T09:59:40.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol just git gud m8","replies":[]}]}
