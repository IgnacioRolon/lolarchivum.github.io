And that is to make it into the up-coming challenger oceanic series.\r\nYou must have (or are willing to) experience in high ranking 5v5 teams.  \r\nIt is preferred that you are of Diamond 5 rank in solo queue (at least), but we are taking anyone of at least Platinum+ who are willing\r\nto impove not only as themselves, but mostly for the team. \r\n\r\nThe midlaner and myself (ADC) were previously in a Diamond 1 team. And our support Diamond 2 team.\r\nOur analyst is here for a helping hand for all who are selected into the 5 man main team. \r\n\r\nSo if there is any questions, or if you just wanna chat, add:\r\nIGN: Truesh0t (Captain)\r\nOr\r\nIGN: ESC Static (Analyst)\r\n\r\nThank you, and I hope to see you on the Summoners Rift.","replies":[]}
