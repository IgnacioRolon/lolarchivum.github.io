Everyone (that includes you) makes mistakes.\n.\n2. Someone playing differently than how you want them to does not necessarily mean that player is playing wrong or bad.\n.\n3. You can't control other people, and nor should you be trying to. Focus on what you can control i.e your own gameplay.\n\nFocus on what you could be doing better, instead of what other people could be. A random player from one game isn't going to affect your rank half a season down the track, your improvement will. It's also worth mentioning that you've plateaued. You're at a pretty stable 50% WR, which essentially means Gold 4 is your accurate rank, and unless you up your skill, you won't up your rank. \n\nIf it feels like you're beating your head against a wall and not getting anywhere, it's because you aren't, but you can fix that with a perspective shift and some longer term goals. Plateauing can be a shit feeling. It feels stagnant and like you're never going to reach higher. My recommendation would be to hop back into normals for a bit where the stakes are lower and you can focus more on individual skills before trying to tie them all back together in ranked.\n\nNow that your win-rate is stabilised you should be focusing less on the game to game W-L and more on your overall skill. Is your map awareness not as good as it could be? Maybe your CS is lower than you'd like? Maybe your wave management could use some work? Start looking for things to improve in your own play, and you will see *gradual* improvement in your rank.\n\nIf someone is bothering you or tilting you, just mute them. Chat is useful, but not when it is causing more harm than good. Pings are plenty for most scenarios, and if they're abusing pings too, they probably aren't communicating anything useful anyway.","replies":[]}]}
