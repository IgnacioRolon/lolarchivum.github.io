So as of 5.5 i have found a simple bug, i'm not sure what causes it but no matter. I have found that a talon who has used their ult whilst ignited will no be seen. i have tested this near pinks with and without ignite. this only seems to happen near a pink ward. the last game i played my team placed a pink close to a tower (within about 600 units) and i had placed ignite on talon, neither the pink nor the tower granted vision whilst he was ignited however whilst he wasn't we had complete vision of him. This seems to be a bug with ignite and true vision.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this happen before?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T06:39:28.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but I thought it was intentional.
