I&#039;m not going to lie it was fairly bad and I probably deserve This, but I think perma is too much as I have had no prior warnings as I have only recently started being toxic and racist I don&#039;t know why or what is going through my head and I know that I have messed up big time. I have spent a large amount of money on my account and feel very ripped off. I&#039;m just wondering if there is anything I can do to remove the ban as I know what I did was wrong and i will try my hardest to not be toxic or anything like that in future I apologize for what I have done. I really just want my account back even if it was a 100 day suspension or perma chat block or restriction but I really think that perma ban is to much. I know there is little chance of this happening based off what I have said in my recent matches. But I have to try. Please can someone help me I promise I will never ever be toxic racist flame or even swear towards another player again, I would really just like to play the game again without having to put in another 2-3 years worth of game time and a crap ton of money into another account, thanks for reading and I appreciate any help or even clarification on if anything can be done.

Two games of racism is well within the bounds of reasonable for a permanent suspension.\n\nBasically any severe behaviours can skip you punishment tiers, as it becomes less a \"can we reform this player\" and more a \"we need to get this behaviour out of the community\".\n\ntl;dr You will not be getting your account back. You're free to start a new one, but continue with the racism and you'll be perma banned again very quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cherubi","date":"2016-11-09T10:23:15.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> $1000 that i will never see ever again,\n\nDon't be toxic, simple.

Riot takes a firm stance against racism, sexism and homophobia and engaging in this kind of behaviour can and will skip punishment tiers straight to the permaban.  \n\n_why?_ because if you are playing league of legends, it is assumed you are above 13 years of age. Even before this age, with your underdeveloped pre-frontal cortex, you should know that being a racist/sexist/homophobe isn't ok! In IRL if you were to do the same kind of thing you could [easily lose your job](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/pr-exec-fired-racist-tweet-aids-africa-apology) or even get [yourself into a really dangerous situation ](http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/blogger-gaye-clark-gets-death-threats-over-racist-howto-guide/news-story/68792d4c8b6286f23314ad6d35978172).\n\nSuper sorry, but it is highly unlikely that you will be getting your account back, as they have the chat logs and even you, yourself admitting you were being a racist. \n\nSomething to take away from this, is to learn not to be a ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ in your games. Even if you are super frustrated, take it out by verbalising IRL instead of typing into chat. Its way easier, and you can't get punished for it. If it doesn't help your team, or you would be pissed af if someone said it to you or a member of your family/friends, don't type it in chat!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-06T00:27:15.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many reports and bans have you had before lol? :s I've only had like a 1 day and 3 day ban then went straight xD","replies":[{"poster":"Hellvast","date":"2016-11-09T09:54:19.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont know how many reports but shouldnt be alot, i have had no bans or prior punishments so idk why its straight perma","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-09T20:09:03.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hellvast,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=znVNdKEX,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-11-09T09:54:19.279+0000)\n>\n> i dont know how many reports but shouldnt be alot, i have had no bans or prior punishments so idk why its straight perma\n\n:l you must'ave gone full blast no no http://giphy.com/gifs/no-tom-hanks-wag-figure-3o85xyklT2t8VVjxxC/fullscreen      https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2e/03/3b/2e033b7bb006b71f01b8df9fd4722cea.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-11-05T13:00:42.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito doesnt really COMLETELY perma ban you most times, they just dont let you play the game for maybe a month they should have gave you a note on when the perma ban is gone","replies":[{"poster":"Hellvast","date":"2016-11-05T22:44:50.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all it says is that the account is permanently banned, but ill just log back in in a years time and see","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-05T01:37:53.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, tell us what you said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-11-05T01:11:56.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for our entertainment, tell us something racist you said.","replies":[]}]}
