Ive managed a few ARAM games that seemed to of let me stay but for most of the game im at 800+ ping and stand around and dont do much, or if im extremely lucky, i get my normal 30 ping for about half the game. I called up my internet provided (Optus) and told them that our internet was running slow (Which it was). They said that they would send a tech guy to fix it (which he has because our internet is no 5 times faster) the only thing is, im still getting the insane ping spike for league. Now im wondering maybe its not my internet but maybe the riot servers? This isnt a \"Hate Riot\" or complaint. I just solely want to know if others are having the same problem and that it actually is/isnt my fault.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-14T06:55:46.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not getting these ping spikes, but I am noticing a slightly increase in a few times that I do lag.\n\nThere are some problems with how the game is communicating to Riot's servers, so wait it out a few days to see if they fix it. Otherwise, you can try out your connection here http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/\n\nYou'll need Java for it.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Steins Gate 0","date":"2015-01-14T08:40:28.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what i got\n\nSummary of Noteworthy Events\n\nMajor Abnormalities –\nYour ISP's DNS server is slow to lookup names \n\nMinor Aberrations –\nNetwork bandwidth may be low \nNetwork packet buffering may be excessive \nYour computer's clock is slightly slow \n\nMay you explain what this means?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-16T02:55:29.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Major Abnormalities –\nYour ISP's DNS server is slow to lookup names \n\nI hear Optus's default DNS is rather crap. This is what I expected. DNS is basically what your computer uses to find the names of everything which you're accessing by the internet, and the DNS itself is located on the internet, not your computer. By the way, DNS stands for Domain Name Server.\n\nIf you want to try Google's Public DNS (which has a really good reputation), [follow these instructions](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4).\n\n>Minor Aberrations –\nNetwork bandwidth may be low\nNetwork packet buffering may be excessive\nYour computer's clock is slightly slow\n\nThis confirms that something is causing your internet to be slow. Do you find that when you are browsing sites, going through web pages, occasionally it just takes a while to load a page, even though it shouldn't be any more intensive than the other pages you were just on?\n\nAnd the clock, it may actually be the issue of everything here. Go into your time settings and sync it with the internet.\n\nDo each of these one at a time, and tell me of the results of what you tried.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
