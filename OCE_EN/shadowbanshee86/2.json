When i open shop, look at stats, moving around items. Whenever i try, which is generally needed a lot, the game freezes for about 3 seconds before catching up, its it not dramatic in its effects on my playing but its still really annoying. Is this something to do with the game or is it my computer??????","replies":[{"poster":"ShadowBanshee86","date":"2015-10-17T09:17:30.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also when i enter the game it has the sounds but takes about 15 secs to actually show the map, when i alt tab i need 2 restart the game and exiting the game takes 4ever.
