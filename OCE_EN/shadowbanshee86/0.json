I'm sick of it, put in an appeal system so we can say why we left the game, and if its unfair u can revoke it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-18T09:56:07.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Yeah I left this game because my internet and PC are trash as fuck and I cannot afford a SSD so it takes 20 minutes for my toaste- PC to boot, please unban\" - OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShadowBanshee86","date":"2015-03-20T05:21:47.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how many fkin times do i need to tell you people its not my computer.
