However, this is not because of myself intentionally leave games, but my computer crashing, and / or internet cutting out. Is there any way I can stop my computer / client from crashing so I can prevent LeaverBuster in the future? All my settings are on lowest and disabled / enabled appropriately to make my game run smoother. Furthermore, I have gone through and removed unneeded things on my computer taking up hard drive space, so there is really nothing more that I know of I can do. I am sick of having to wait for 20 mins each game before I can play (having waited 3 hours and 20 minutes to play in total over the span of the last 2 days), so any help would be much appreciated. \r\n~ Thanks, Defusionist.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-12-19T00:02:05.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Let's troubleshoot your connectivity issues first.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) If your crashing persists, we'll move forward from there. \n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/su16_keyart_1920x1080_0.jpg?itok=6nj8mHjj","replies":[{"poster":"Defusionist","date":"2016-12-29T09:19:55.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used the hextech repair tool and it said everything is ok, however I still continue to crash. Also, a new problem has started to happen where I join a game and go into the loading screen (with all the champions, masteries, names, etc) then when all my friends join the game and buy there items, I have a pitch black screen with the LoL mouse there, and the only way to fix this is by shutting down my laptop. This has happened to me twice now and I don't know what the problem is.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2017-01-18T06:37:34.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black screens in Champ Select are due to connectivity issues with your network and the servers.
