My support **ACCIDENTALLY** over stayed, causing FartKicker14432 (Kindred) to not reach level 2, and because of this she fed bot lane. After these events, a series of negative words were thrown at me and my support. The 0/16/0 Kindred was reported by everyone on the team, and we hope Rito games will either ban her, or demote her. People like FartKicker14432 are the bane of League Of Legends.\r\n_\r\nThank you for reading this, and taking it into account","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-12-10T12:41:14.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice name and shame :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-10T09:56:20.576+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't name and shame etc etc so on so forth","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-10T23:25:32.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next time just send a support ticket, don't name and shame on boards.
