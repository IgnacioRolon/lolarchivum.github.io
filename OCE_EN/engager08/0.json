Star Guardian Lux is a blatant rip-off of Sailor Moon, right down to the music, and there are countless other examples of that: But that&#039;s not what we&#039;re here to talk about. \r\n\r\nRiot, even while being provided a copy of medical records, doctor&#039;s testimonials, along with a full copy of the Americans with Disabilities Act, continued to provide me with template answer after template answer, then after, total and complete radio silence. My account had been banned a few times before for having outbursts, but the information was provided to the company on numerous occasions. \r\n\r\n&quot;Rodney suffers from a severe case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder resulting in higher than normal levels of anxiety, especially when confronted with situations of confrontation and abuse. This can result in out-of-character behavior. As his physician, it is my belief that, while some aspects of this game are completely predatory, the experience as a whole is therapeutic to Rodney. While sometimes exchanges can be toxic, the overall social aspect of the game makes it superior to the normal console game, as well as the nature of the gameplay itself being very short-sighted makes it superior to other online interactive games. It is my sincere belief that not allowing him to play this game will cause him due harm.&quot;  \r\n\r\nIn addition to that, riot was also provided with 10 years of medical records and reminded of their legal responsibility to make reasonable accommodations for those with disabilities. I offered them such an accommodation, requesting that my account be put in permanently restricted chat, so that I not even be afforded the possibility that my disease would take over and flood the chat bar with absolute insanity--I&#039;m in no way denying that some, if not most of my behavior was unattractive. \r\n\r\nThis request was met in the same way as all of my official documentation was--A template answer and the request to be put on permanent chat restriction wholly ignored. When the request was repeated--radio silence. \r\n\r\nMany of you probably have had a similar experience or have a condition which makes you not totally responsible for what you type in the bar. To the rest of you-- Whether or not you wish to acknowledge the existence of mental illness does not make it a fallacy. Riot was provided numerous opportunities and even suggestions to provide me with a safe playing environment. They were reminded of both their ethical and legal responsibility to do so, which they willfully ignored. I eventually was met with a permaban after an explosive conversation which erupted from blamatory remarks made toward my refusal to follow a bad invade. \r\n\r\nI could, on my own, seek compensatory damages, as Riot Games was provided more than enough time, information, and cooperation refused to even actually speak to me. As well as &quot;due harm&quot; being inflicted on my mental health from this permaban--Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress would not even be a reach at this point--it&#039;s what happened. That&#039;s not even counting all the money I have sunk into this game for what my physician refers to as &quot;predatory content.&quot; \r\n\r\nHowever, it would me much more productive if there was a collective of people with similar experience. Ignored, for whom riot did not even engage with you when you tried to ask for reasonable accommodations. For this reason, it is my belief that a class action lawsuit would be more appropriate and more successful against such a massive company. They have blatantly ignored the ADA, their consumer, as well as their responsibility to operate within the confines of constitutional law. For this, they cannot be allowed to bully their consumer. \r\n\r\nI am not a toxic person. I am a relatively normal guy. I work as a publicist, social media manager, and private teacher at a local music store. I&#039;m a dean&#039;s list student my final year of University. I&#039;m the principal English Hornist for my collegiate orchestra. I couldn&#039;t do any of that, particularly my job, if I had an abrasive personality. Any of you who have ever played the game, particularly if you kinda suck--like me--know you are met with significantly higher levels of stress and confrontation than you ever would be in real life. \r\n\r\nThe fact remains that, even though I agreed to the terms of use, those clauses within the terms of use that violate the basic premise of the ADA are not legally enforceable. It is my goal to gather enough support from those of you who have been effectively stripped of your rights by the LoL administration to file a class action suit against the company--Something they would actually feel and be compelled to change their policy to be inclusive of the 26% of Americans living with a mental disorder. \r\n\r\nHave a lovely day. I hope you will join me. The fields of justice should be just for everyone--Not just those with normal neurological pathways. I will share my contact info with those who respond that also need help seeking justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-06-08T06:36:37.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) this is OCE dont use American stats for this? \n2) It was your choice in playing LoL and putting yourself in such a 'stressful' position \n3) While yes, Riot probably should have tried to help you, do you know how many people a) play Lol b) try and contact riot? \nI have depression and anxiety, does that mean i should play only bots so i dont get panic attacks?","replies":[]}]}
