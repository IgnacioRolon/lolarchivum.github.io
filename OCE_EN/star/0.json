When the Oceanic server first was released, i ran the biggest free mentoring group. It wasn&#039;t as amazing as i hoped it to be, which was mainly due to my time constraints, but i made several great memories, and some even better friends. Most people i mentoring gained a couple of divisions- nothing too incredible, but noteable.\n\nAnyways, i&#039;m looking to select 2-3 people to personally mentor over the next couple of weeks (or longer), where i can share my knowledge and improve you as a player overall.\n\nWhy could i be a good coach for you?\n\n-Good game knowledge (i&#039;ve been playing since season one).\n-Highest achieved ranking was Diamond 5 64 LP (average game MMR diamond 2)\n-Achieved diamond in ranked 5&#039;s\n-Done coaching several times before\n-Have been an analyst for several teams.\n\nI think i could definitely be a good coach/ mentor. So the question is, could you be a good student? If you&#039;re interested, write a detailed description in the comments below (please don&#039;t just friend request me). Minimum current elo/mmr is bronze 2 (i&#039;ve never been lower, so i don&#039;t know how to coach anyone lower). I&#039;d prefer to coach bot lane or mid, however am fairly decent enough in all roles.\n\nI&#039;m taking rolling applications, so sign up before they are all gone!","replies":[]}
