It's so much better that you might wonder why the hell Riot doesn't just make its own voice chat system. Because it would be a terrible, terrible thing.","url":"http://kotaku.com/why-league-of-legends-should-never-have-voice-chat-1701036810","image":"https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--mShJKTkS--/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_north,h_358,q_80,w_636/mwcrxi4e1kgrmfcucd1w.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A video I found although funny is there any real reason to why League does not have a option for it, I feel that a more stable inbuilt gamechat would allow for better communication or is it just a feature that is too hard to maintain,","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-01T13:52:54.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also more appropriate for **Miscellaneous**, or possibly **Player Creations** for the video.\n\nAnyway, Riot is not against the idea of voice chat, but if they do it they want to do it in such a way that doesn't enable toxicity the same way as in other games. They want to do it right. As it stands right now, toxicity in VoIP during LoL matches isn't bad because the players have to opt into it and make an effort to make the call group; when voice chat is available by default for everyone it hands a new avenue of toxicity to abusive players on a silver platter.","replies":[]}]}
