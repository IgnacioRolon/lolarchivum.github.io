I know you can search for a champion but having different categories that each player uniquely made would allow for more decisive picks as you&#039;d know where to look if you were supporting this match you&#039;d have all your supports listed under the category already so you could quickly see what you could use for that match.","replies":[{"poster":"Wittle Wolfy","date":"2016-01-01T05:01:00.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I might have placed this under the wrong board as I am new to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-01T13:50:39.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be more appropriate for the **Miscellaneous** board. This board is mostly for technical support questions.
