If all you want it for is school, Minecraft, TF2 and LoL, then I would highly recommend a Mac. I run a MacBook Pro 11\" retina display on OSX Yosemite, and the graphics are amazing, the speed is amazing, and the connectivity to my iPhone is amazing. Best thing on the market imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-09T04:24:57.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It might get 50-60 fps in LoL. and It might get 60 fps in TF2.
