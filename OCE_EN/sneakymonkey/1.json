As it is, the bulk of bot accounts are just being levelled to 30, then sold, while only a small portion are grinding for BE (since that usually occurs *after* the account has reached level 30 and is viable for sale). If you were to take out the necessary levelling, then *all* bot accounts would be grinding out BE (since they'd all start at level 30 with none, or near enough) *and* exist *only* in level 30+ games, as opposed to being rather predominant in pre-30 games.\n\nI'd honestly prefer if Riot did what Garena does and limits every individual to only one account, requiring ID to actually make an account (but then, there's obviously certain issues with that in most regions with a LoL server).","replies":[]}]}
