Currently we are ranged from silver 2 - Gold 1 in our personal ranks and we are looking for a fifth person around that range. We are interested in progressing more as a team than individual players so you will need to have a personality that is conducive to learning.\r\n\r\nWhat we are looking for / requirements.\r\n\r\nMust be able to play most days after 4pm.\r\n\r\nPlay one of these roles Support / Mid / Jungle. \r\n\r\nMust have a microphone and use it.\r\n\r\nMust not be elitist / arrogant (this one is very important).\r\n\r\nMust be prepared to lose some whilst we learn to work more effectively as a team and iron out play styles.\r\n\r\nMust be able to listen to a shot caller.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like you we&#039;d be more than happy for you to give us a try and you may add me in game (Vucari). If you have any questions please feel free to respond to this thread or just message me in game.\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\nVucari","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-04-09T04:35:29.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Im crispy.
