For example, Swain's Q and E proc the full effect but his W and Ult only proc 33% of spellvamp(20% SV becomes 6.6% SV).  \nIf an ability applies 'On-Hit Effects'(meaning Lifesteal, Crit and/or redbuff etc) then it will NOT apply spellvamp.  \n  \nDue to it's reduced effectiveness on AoE abilities, it is rarely built.  \nThe few champions that can effectively build SpellVamp are Akali, Cassiopeia, Kennen, Mordekaiser, Morgana and Vladimir.  \nA few champions used to be rather effective with SpellVamp but have since shifted to a more powerful build path that has no need for it, these include: Ahri, Fiddlesticks, Kat and Ryze.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-03T23:07:54.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually DoT spells (providing they are not also AoE or multi target spells like fiddle's E) fully proc spellvamp, swains Q and E fully apply it, the same with Malzahars E and R and mordekaisers R ect. ect.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-02T03:23:47.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spell Vamp heals for Q,W,E,R and certain actives, Life Steal applies to all Auto Attacks","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-02T21:50:26.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all Qs Es Ws and Rs apply spellvemp though\nNasus's Q Miss fortune's Q and Ezreal's Q to name a few","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2015-01-02T23:48:45.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any abilities that apply on-hits benefit from lifesteal instead of spellvamp.
