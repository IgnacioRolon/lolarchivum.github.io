Depends on your connection. A good idea is that it'll take roughly as long as it took when you first got the game (that is, downloading the whole 3GB.)\n\n2. We don't use megabytes. As I said, the game is around 3GB. I can't be specific because I just deleted League off my system, but that was it.\n\nIf your Riot Games folder is what-the-crapGB large, then I think that you've downloaded a copy for the game from multiple different regions. The client will not delete out-dated or different region versions of itself. Might be a good idea to just reinstall League entirely to save up some hard-drive space.","replies":[]}]}
