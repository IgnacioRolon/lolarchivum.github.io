I&#039;ve noticed that the que times are just atrocious over here. Usually a game takes 3-4 minutes to find in NA while over here in OCE I&#039;ve found myself waiting for forty minutes before I started a new que, now I&#039;ve waited eleven minutes in this new que. Is it the fact that I&#039;m level thirteen right now, or is there something else that&#039;s wrong here. I understand that it&#039;s currently 11:24pm where I&#039;m at right now in Western Australia but fifty plus minutes is rediculous.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}
