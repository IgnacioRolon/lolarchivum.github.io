Players will get a stock standard rune page that will help both AD and AP and roll with it, hell, I have seen some who don't even have a full rune page going into Ranked because they spent all their points on getting champions to get past the pass mark.\n\nNow if Runes on the other hand had a pass mark to stop them going into Ranked, different story.\n\nMe on the other hand, I haven't brought any runes in years, I built up what I think is adequate for how I play, I have enough runes for FOUR full separate rune pages that will give me completely different runes on each page, basically all the good runes on each type. Now if I was to mix them up I could setup almost anything needed.\n\nAll I am missing is AS, GP5, HP, HP5, MP and all the per level and utility ones.
