Ive have a potato laptop that I play LoL on, but the problem ive been facing is that my my LCU is just honestly very slow. Can you guys make some optimization changes in the new LCU that would benifit potatos?\r\n\r\nMy specs are a i3 forth gen dual core running at 1.7ghz and running a HD4400, not impressive but it holds up.","replies":[{"poster":"ServerLord","date":"2017-02-08T12:15:53.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fear you may just need to do that 'upgrade' thing. A desktop will be cheaper and if you are dedicating to league you can buy a pretty decent setup for around 800 AUD. (Mind you the graphics card will set you back another 500+ AUD). I got an I5, not sure the specs etc for $711AUD + shipping postage etc, but the graphics card alone cost me $500 bucks. \nThe thing is, are you using this laptop for school or work? If that is the case, but you still want to have a laptop and play league you are going to unfortunately upgrade to a better one, and laptops are alot more expensive due to how they are perceived. They are versatile, easy to transport and you can use them on the go. But they will never be able to compete with a desktop since they have only so much space to fit in the graphics card, memory etc. \n\n   The client (new client) is very slow and personally its just horrible. I downloaded the new client but can't stand it. Not sure if your issue is with the actual client or the ingame client, but either way an I3 is obviously not going to preform as good as a more expensive I5 I7 etc processor even in a laptop. \n\n Not sure if this helps, but if you want to play league as it is currently, and they will update and implement more cpu memory hogging aspects since the game IS the highest rating game of its genre type, you will unfortuantly have to buy/upgrade and there is limitations with laptops and also older desktop pcs.","replies":[{"poster":"Ertytheqwerty360","date":"2017-02-11T01:57:12.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well uh, this laptop my mum gave me for school work, but it holds up League just fine.
