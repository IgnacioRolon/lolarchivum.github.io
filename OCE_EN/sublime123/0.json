With that in mind, were you using all chat much and, if so, would you be willing to provide the chat logs for that (you should have received an email with the chat logs, if not you can submit a [separate] ticket to Support asking for them)? Also, do you think it's possible one of you friends might have taken offence to something you said and reported you, or even just reported you as a joke (I'd recommend asking, just to be sure)? I imagine you're talking about using a lot of terms and attitudes that the system would have picked up on quite \"happily\", so there's a possibility it's a joke gone awry (best to rule it out, anyway).\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll try to answer as accurately as I can (or find another volunteer, or Rioter, who can).","replies":[{"poster":"Sublime123","date":"2017-11-25T12:04:17.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks a lot, I'll try to ask Support","replies":[{"poster":"Sublime123","date":"2017-11-25T12:04:44.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I found out Tzuyu, one of the 5 man reported me as a joke","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-26T03:45:59.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That might explain what has happened here. I imagine there is definitely behaviours that are treated severely in your chat logs, so really any report from a team member would have triggered the system into action. I'm not sure if it would be possible to have the punishment reconsidered in this case, though I'd say your best bet is to have your friend (the one who reported you) confirm that it was not a serious report. Honestly, I doubt the PB staff would decide that is a valid reason to revoke the ban, but it's worth asking.\n\nWith all that in mind, I'd say it's important to let your friends know that \"joke reports\" aren't a good thing. Reports will always be taken seriously by the system, so if there is *any* behaviour that might be questionable in the reported game that's a possibility of triggering the system, such as what has happened here.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2017-11-26T09:15:38.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=siKc2P99,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-26T03:45:59.030+0000)\n>\n> Good luck.\n\nYeah GL on finding new mates...

That said, if someone in that pre-made reports another, I think it *should* be taken seriously, as that person has a full understanding of what's been said (and it's assumed they're being serious with their reports).\n\nThis specific situation with Sublime123, however, doesn't really fit that as it's a case where one person didn't consider the consequence of their \"joke report\", which has resulted in one of their friends taking an unnecessary hit from the in-game systems. That said, I don't think that reports amongst pre-mades (even 5-mans) shouldn't be considered because they're assumed to be friends and *some* of those people jokingly report their \"friends\" without considering the consequences of that. If anything, that comes down to a combination of a moment of bad judgement on the part of the player, and a lack of clarity from Riot.\n\nAll I can really say at this point is that I hope Sublime123 is able to work it out with the support staff (though not holding my breath) and, even if that falls through, that they, along with their friends, learn a valuable lesson about the report system from this situation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2017-11-24T11:36:26.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so if you were in a 5man, who reported you?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-11-24T11:39:27.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exhausted,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=siKc2P99,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-24T11:36:26.020+0000)\n>\n> so if you were in a 5man, who reported you?\n\nIts automated over certain phrases and words.

It doesnt need a person to report you...\n\nFrom what I understand, that is a bit inaccurate. While the chat infringements are most often dealt with by the automated system, it still needs reports from players to review a case. No report means no review by the system, and that's one of the flaws that exists (though not an easy one to address without dedicating a very significant amount of resources). That said, there are certain categories (or perhaps, as ThatsBS has said, \"certain words/phrases\") that are treated more severely than others, such as suicide encouragement, racism/sexism, homophobia etc.\n\nIf I had to guess, it was probably one of the people on the opposing team that reported Sublime123, resulting in the punishment. Though, without more information on the specifics of this case I'd say it's hard to determine whether this indicates a (potential) problem with the system.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-24T12:44:57.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh you think there's only a potential problem with the system with what has been coming onto boards as 14 day bans?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-24T12:51:50.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'm thinking is that this case might indicate a different problem to what everything else is indicating.
