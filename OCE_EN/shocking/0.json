No\nAhri supp? NO!\nAhri jg? NOO \nAhri adc? REPORTED!!\n\nWHY does the meta have to be like this? can&#039;t riot just make some assassin like champion that can play other lanes?\nI mean you have kha zix, rengar and nocturne.. that&#039;s about it. But if I want to play akali or leblanc I have to mid only.\nNow I KNOW it&#039;s something I have to deal with, and I also know that a lot of reason why some people mid all the time is because there\nfavourite champions have no other role other than mid, and even if they do  have a back up role for that champ they'll get flamed in chat for not midding. That&#039;s all there is to it.\n\nWho else agrees/understands with me here? I suck at explaining but if you could understand the point I am trying to make, and what are your thoughts on this topic?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-07T11:41:22.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact is meta exists for a reason, you can beat meta champs by just flat out out skilling your opponent, but otherwise meta champs tend to win out.\n\nAs for the meta of the example and Ahri being a mid laner, fact is that is what she is, there's no real point putting her in the jungle cause that's just a pain in the ass for her, playing her top will see tanks shit on you, playing her support can work, same with ADC, but they both work less then her mid laneness.\n\nAs for only playing assassin's mid, the reason is simple, because top lane your only options are to assassinate the top/jungle/mid, this limits your options, especially considering top and jungle are going to likely be tanky and be able to survive your burst, mid on the other hand is exactly what an assassin want's because it's easy to roam bot lane that way (which always has one squishy.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-07T13:15:18.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Okay for starters, Ahri, LeBlanc and Akali CAN'T JUNGLE so don't even mention that.\nNo, they just can't. Doesn't matter what combination of runes/masteries you try, it wont work.\n\nWhy don't you take Akali top? Because most champions there will DESTROY HER!\n\nI've said it before many a times, the meta doesn't FUCK you, the meta is very fluid, but you have to LEARN that certain champs just don't fucking work in \"non-meta picks\".\nNow let's take a look at top, why would Akali or Ahri be bad in top lane I wonder? Probably because they'll meet Renekton, what happens then? It's not pretty.\n\nEach position has champions that WORK in that position, other champions can work but it's difficult for them due to the match ups they'll meet, then there are the champions that WONT work at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-07T22:33:27.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I love that fact that he already clearly stated that Ahri, leblanc and Akali cant jungle, the whole point of his post revolves around the fact that they can only mid, so there really isn't any need to tell him again that they cant jungle, because he does know that, if he didnt he wouldnt be here posting about how they cant, he'd be out there jungling LB.\n\nalso he never says that the meta fucks you, his post is saying that its unfortunate that if you are an ADC main you miss out on playing champs like rumble, which is true, i had that problem too, you want to play a certain champ but you don't like the role they play and so you cant play them like you want. He isn't asking to break the meta in any way, he is just stating his disappointment that he cant play his favourite champs in his favourite role. he's allowed to be disappointed, gangplank is one of my favourite champs but i cant play him mid which is my favourite role because he just doesn't go there and i don't like playing top that much, I'm not asking for that to be changed but i am disappointed that he doesn't work as a mid champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-08T01:48:00.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But you can.\n\nI main jungle, but I have no problem going ADC to play Sivir one of my favourite champs in the game, or mid to play Morgana and Karma.\nI fucking hate top, but I still go there without complaint to play champs I want to play there.\n\nJust because you main a role, doesn't mean you can't leave it for five minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-08T05:24:21.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not saying its a problem, i go top and adc a lot to play some champs, the point is:\nsay i really liked nocturne i just loved what his abilities do and how he looks in his eternum skin etc.\nbut i really hate the play style of jungling (i don't but this is hypothetical) so playing nocturne means i have to play in a way that causes me to not have fun, not do well and not enjoy the experience of playing nocturne, i would much rather play him as a support champ which is a role i feel comfortable with and enjoy, but i cant do that because he isn't a support and can't go anywhere except jungle, \nso the point that Shocking is making is:\n\"its a shame you cant play some champs where you want to play them\" its a simple point.\n\nhes not asking to change anything or insult anyone, he's just saying that he wants to play ahri in a lane that isn't mid but cant, and is expressing displeasure at that fact.\n\ni really like playing graves, but i really don't like playing adc, and that means i play graves a lot less than other champs because i would rather play karthus mid than play graves bot, and i would make that choice every time. but if graves was a mid champ i would play him a lot more often. it doesn't mean i can never play graves. but it does limit the enjoyment/amount that i play him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shocking","date":"2015-09-08T00:46:21.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you read me like a book.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shocking","date":"2015-09-07T14:31:52.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"why you so aggressive man what the fuck did I do to you =(","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-07T15:31:52.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm aggressive because people are stupid, and I have to explain this around 50 times a week.","replies":[{"poster":"Shocking","date":"2015-09-08T00:45:08.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You sound very pretentious.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-08T01:47:47.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hardly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-07T23:37:47.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"akali CAN jungle, she has above average clear speed and her W is a ms boost and slow for opponent for potential counterjungling. yay proved you wrong now i dont have to read the rest of your post cos its probably wrong too get rekt lol","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-08T01:44:58.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really?
