You should be prepared to fill and have a couple of core champions that you can fill in each of those lanes. If everyone wanted to simply main a lane or two, then more probable than not, every game would start with two or three people fighting or unhappy with the lane they've been forced into, because they wanted mid and they wanted to carry. Learn to fill, and games will be more enjoyable, cooperative and sometimes you'll get mid or adc, or someone else will fill and you'll get your pick. If you're smart, you'll main support, because if you call fill, 70% of the time, you'll be support because no one thinks you can carry with support. Oh how wrong they are…\n\nAs for mid or adc, and which carries games more? Well any role can carry. It's not about getting kills, it's about carrying with team work. That means vision, ganks, objective control… ADC and Mid just usually get the credit and most kills, but I've seen a mid Lee Sin with 40 kills lose, and Kats going 23/1 have to surrender in 20.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that carrying through low ELO isn't about lanes. It's about you and how much you help your team. Every lane can carry. It's up to you. I'd personally stop thinking about what lanes you want, and what others want. When you can learn to carry from anywhere, that's when you'll truly understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Shocking","date":"2015-09-10T02:35:53.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you master splinter","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-10T08:58:17.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome grasshopper.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Macka","date":"2015-09-10T00:21:06.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to fill and make the team environment friendly and co-operative.

I think just play what you are best at, like I am not very good at playing mid but I am good at ADC and I don't mean like good at as in you have played a lot of games in that roll, I mean that it almost just comes naturally to you.

Assassins tend to be picked and get fed pretty often in low ratings, and even a good adc player will have a tough time dealing with a super fed assassin, especially since you should never expect your teammates to know how to protect you in bronze. \nMid is a good role to carry from but like you said, its super popular, so you'd probably be lucky to get it in half your games and will need to be adept at other roles too.\nIf you're looking to main only one role I'd honestly say that any of the other 3 roles are better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-09-09T12:51:20.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I don't know anyone that has actually climbed solo que to diamond as adc only by themselves\n\nHow about, I don't know, almost every LCS ADC? If you watch their streams a lot of ADC mains just ADC their way up to Master on their smurfs.\n\nIn lower (but still Diamond) Elo, check out \"Loserfruit\" on Twitch (OCE streamer). She soloQ's as ADC only (unless role taken) and makes it to Diamond.\n\nTruth is, you can climb to Diamond with any role. Yes, even support. In fact, the higher Elo you get, the more support mains you encounter, since support is the least-effort way to climb.\n\nAnd no, you can't claim that this is only because \"ADCs are competent in higher Elo\" - I myself climbed from Bronze V to high Silver playing support only when I first learned the game a couple years ago (now I'm high Plat and fill any role, but I don't play much atm).","replies":[{"poster":"Shocking","date":"2015-09-09T14:25:54.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, you've gave me some self-belief.
