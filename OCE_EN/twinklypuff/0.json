So I&#039;d like to ask how do you go back to playing your account when you have forgotten everything ? \n\nI assume I will be playing with players at the level I was before I quit, still pretty noob, but at least not helplessly noob like I am now. I don&#039;t want to screw up peoples games just because I am back to noob status. Does the game make any concessions for people who just came back, will it reset my elo or something ?\n\nI&#039;m just trying to avoid a flame-fest.","replies":[{"poster":"moneycyrus","date":"2016-12-31T13:23:21.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you mute people every game through /mute all","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-30T12:16:37.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I would recommend you do is first try to remember what your favourite champions that you used to play were. If you can play what your brain was trained for 2 years ago it will help get you back into the mindset for league.\n\nThe next thing that I would recommend that you do when getting back into the game is to find a good group to play with. You can have a look in chat rooms or post here on the boards in the team recruitment area. Having a good group to play with will not only make learning the game again a fun experience but will give you real opponents to play against in normals.\n\nAfter that I would say try to stick to he basics. Rebuild basic mechanics such as where to position, how to move around the map, csing and etc. Once you start focusing on the simple things it will help rebuild your brain to the level it used to be at.\n\nOther than that I would just say focus on learning. League has changes a lot over the past few years and is always changing with new things too learn. Keep playing and go into each game having one thing that you want to focus on improving and you will be back up to your level of skill that you were in no time.\n\nIf there is any specific questions I can help answer or anyway I can help let me know and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"TwinklyPuff","date":"2016-12-31T02:04:45.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Elam, \n\nThank you very much for taking the time to reply. I played one bot game yesterday, but it wasn't very fun. I chose a intermediate Vladamir but the bot AI are still rather terrible. \n\nI remember when I started playing this game I just used to play co-op vs bots for a very long time because I had no confidence. I was talked into trying a PvP game one day and I didn't fair too well and the very people who invited me to play were bagging me out. From that point I was always too nervous to play in PvP because fear of letting people down and getting flamed. This didn't change until I found that playing drunk was the only way to calm my nerves. \n\nSo for the next year I would only play if I was drunk. But I haven't had a drink for over a year now and I'm back to my usual nervous overly sensitive self. I don't even know if it's even possible for me to play this game without being drunk, but I don't want to start drinking again.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-31T07:56:16.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh yes I understand those feeling very well but the important thing to remember is that you don't have to play normals all the time once you start. So what I would recommend you do is build yourself a bit of a plan to build up your confidence when going into normals.\n\nWhat I mean by this is before you go into a normal game start out with a few co-op vs AI games to remove any rust that you may have. Let's say about 3 games of AI for now. Then after those 3 games play one normal. Repeat this ratio until it starts the feel natural.\n\nOnce you get to the point of it starting to feel natural decrease the coop games and increase the normals. So two coop games to start and then two normals. Once that's natural go one coop and then as many normals as you would like.\n\nThe important thing to remember is it is all about learning. Don't feel stressed to perform instead feel excited that you are making progress towards a goal. Apart from that when you are playing your games keep any eye out for positive players to add so that you can queue with them to help remove some stress of playing alone.\n\nI hope that this helps and if you give this a good let me know if it works. If you have any more questions let me know as well. Good luck mate.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"TwinklyPuff","date":"2016-12-31T13:30:52.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, some really good advice there. \n\nI did a co-op game a few hours ago and it was much more fun than the Bot game I played earlier. Then I played two ARAM games and I sucked pretty hard but nobody said anything nasty, but I still felt bad because I was letting everyone down and I hate that feeling. \n\nSeems I need a lot more practice. Still I'm happy that nobody has been flaming me. It feels like there is a lot less pressure on me in ARAM games because we all share the same lane. Think I'll try a few more co-op and ARAM games and hope I don't ruin it for the others. \n\nThanks again man, really appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-31T23:32:30.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! Arams are a great place to start getting yourself back into PvP games defs play some more of them. Keep going mate you are already seeming improvement. \n\nAlways keep in mind you aren't letting your team down you are simply learning different things than they are. Everyone needs to learn to get better, you are just learning different stuff to them.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-30T08:13:59.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would probably play around 10-15 bot games to get the \"feel\" of the game back then try out a normal game and see how it goes","replies":[{"poster":"TwinklyPuff","date":"2016-12-30T08:19:35.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds boring but I think your are right. \n\nOn another note I think someone has hacked my account.
