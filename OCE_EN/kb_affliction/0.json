I can see my friends that I duo with on the list, so I am asuming that my name is offensive which is really bizarre as Crockedthread6 has no relation to offensive langue. I would love for my summoner name to be on the statue as diving is a loved hobby, and the reef being some what close to were I live is brilliant. If there is any way of me being able to have my name on the statue that would be terrific. If there is another reason why my name wasn&#039;t there i would like to know.\r\n\r\nP.S has this happened to anyone else?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-01-14T05:58:29.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a lot of people who are having this question, it turns out that they didn't actually play 3 games within the timeframe with an ocean weak champ on their team.","replies":[]}]}
