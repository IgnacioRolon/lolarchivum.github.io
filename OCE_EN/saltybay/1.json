You should be entitled to use homophobic slurs?\n\nSuicide encouragement and discriminatory slurs (racism, sexism, homophobia etc) are all classed as no tolerance language for which you receive on a single warning (14 day, perma if you have already received that 14 day for chat offences).\n\nYou can appeal the punishment through [player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you really want to, but I can basically guarantee it will not be removed or reduced.","replies":[{"poster":"Watthe68","date":"2019-01-04T14:55:13.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=2a22Q4EE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-12-29T10:30:14.817+0000)\n>\n> So just because someone was being a jerk in a video game they should end their life?
