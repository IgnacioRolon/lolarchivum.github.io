Keep in mind that response times may be a little slow due to it being the holidays, but do not create multiple tickets as it does slow it down even further.\n\nPunishments that are not given in error don't get lifted, and like others have stated you encouraged suicide and used homophobic language. These are two things that the community absolutely hates and have been pressuring Riot to act more harshly on. As a result, getting reported for this kind of language often skips you past the chat restricts straight to the 14 day ban.\n\nWhile it is incredibly frustrating to have someone flame and start the chat war, it is important to remember that you are judged on your behavior and your behavior alone. It is a game that can definitely push you a over the edge if you are having a bad time/have been outmatched/have ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ s in your game, but there is never a reason to tell someone to end their lives or resort to hate speech.

You don't know if they've been contemplating death that day, you don't know if someone just broke up with them, you don't know anything about them so you don't have the right to suggest to someone to kill themselves just because they did badly at league. \"%%%got\" is just hate speech, nuff said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShiroeTheVillain","date":"2018-12-29T08:38:19.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortantely ma man youll have to suck it up..
