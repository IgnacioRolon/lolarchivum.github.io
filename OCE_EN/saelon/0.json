Because we all know, we are supports we can&#039;t think for ourselves we are supposed to bow down to every other team member and listen to exactly what they say.\n\nThanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-16T05:59:10.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"we've already made a post about this on our boards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-16T13:32:01.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The thing is, he wasn't playing support when he was supposed to. It's quite simple. Support is a role that you take on your team during champion select. if the responsibilities of that role aren't followed, then you are not supporting your team. He annoyed a lot of players and Riot are taking action. Which is fair enough.\n\nHowever the way Riot went about it could be improved. What they should have said was \"The support player's primary roles are to provide vision control and peeling for carries. Since you didn't adhere to those principles but still queued up in that position, and annoyed many teammates and did it in many games, we will have to take action should this situation arise again. Please play your designated role that you selected during champion select as to not offend/annoy/disturb your teammates in future games. Thank you.\"\n\nThat way he can still choose what items he wants, there is no forcing someone to buy a sightstone, so long as he's still playing his role. For example he might go smite Sion support and get a trackers knife. Or whatever he chooses. By approaching it this way, Riot would not pigeonhole certain roles into buying specific items. And also prevent opening up a can of worms on reddit where the real issue can be transversed by the bad feedback that Riot gave.\n\nImagine if the top laner just decided to abandon the top lane and play a double jungle role because they think its a better meta. The same principles would apply.\n\nIf this guy wanted to try a different meta approach, he could have checked with his team firstly in champion select. Or queued with people who knew what he was going to do. The fact that he has so many mastery points on a certain champion is totally irrelevant.\n\ni've reported plenty of trolling double junglers and just about every single one of them takes a punishment. They might like to think twice before going against the wishes of their team and hindering its chances of winning the match by not communicating firstly or even compromising their own jungler, and also not getting approval to play their ulterior strategy secondly.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Saelon,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=FE5GgU53,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-16T01:24:08.529+0000)\n>\nBecause we all know, we are supports we can't think for ourselves we are supposed to bow down to every other team member and listen to exactly what they say.\n> \n\nAnd no, that's not true. It's fine to think for yourself. Thinking is one thing. Communicating is another. And there is nothing wrong with the support role at all.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-24T04:16:51.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rly, cuz i once got flamed at for not listening to everything my teamates said","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-24T05:16:21.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah and even though it might not be 'meta' if I'm doing well and at 10min in I see the 12-1-2, 105cs toplane vayne starting to get camped by the enemy jungle and mid, and my whiny adc draven is 0-8-0 with 14cs asking the enemy team to report his entire team in allchat, guess who is getting a new support and priority zilean ults?\n\nAlot of adc's tend to expect that's my responsibility to take care of them, when in reality we're all trying to climb here and if you're doing bad, I'm inclined to bank my hopes on other teammates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-11-16T02:44:28.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The issue isn't with him playing an off meta support the issue is him not playing support.
