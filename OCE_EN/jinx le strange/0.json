A couple more champions means you have more freedom. For example, if you struggle against talon, I would suggest picking up someone like Diana, who matches his \"in your face\" mobility and can burst him down just as quick. \n\nI would suggest playing with friends so that when you try something out and maybe it doesn't go to plan, they wont rage at you. \n\nFeel free to add me in game ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-15T00:18:32.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Against Talon don't fight him after level 5 because he does an amazing amount of damage which most people don't realise. If you hit 6 first then kill him then. Save your Charm for when he jumps to you if you can and make sure you're aiming your Q efficiently. Don't overextend by yourself because he can cover a lot of ground if he Ults before you see him and still almost kill you instantly without the first part of its damage. You'll probably want to get Zhonya's first.","replies":[]}]}
