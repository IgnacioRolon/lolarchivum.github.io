It is to encourage people to not leave the game , no point in the paragraph does it state that you can't leave the game ; it only state that if you leave a game while it is still active, it is recorded \n\nI assume the code of conduct were placed so that people don't leave before finishing a League games , it written as a warning not a rule therefore leave if you must (emergency or internet) or finish the game before leaving ! You do have the right to leave a game but do it at your own risk because you are basically ruining the \"game play\" of 4 other people that happens to be in the same queue as you","replies":[]}]}
