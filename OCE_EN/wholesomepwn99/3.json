When he rebooted his client, he was stuck on the reconnect screen, and when he pressed the button, nothing happened. While this was happening to my friend, I was stuck in the champion select screen, with the timer counted down to zero, and nothing happening. So, I tried restarting my client, and now I&#039;m in the same boat as my friend.\r\nWe&#039;re both stuck on the reconnect screen with nothing to reconnect to.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a link to the screen: https://gyazo.com/35c3eedf2c96227c256f753e756c224d\r\nI&#039;m sure a lot of you have seen this before, but unlike other times, the button does nothing.\r\n\r\nIs there any fix for this? Has anyone else experienced this before?","replies":[]}
