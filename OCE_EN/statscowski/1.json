It keeps showing the Support icon for my recent playstyle, when I haven't supported for over 20 games now.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this?\r\n\r\n(sorry if this is the wrong board, still not used to the new boards layout)","replies":[{"poster":"Statscowski","date":"2015-03-20T14:43:38.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still broken... it still continues to mark me with the Support icon when I was a Mage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Statscowski","date":"2015-03-19T15:08:35.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, now the LANE is bugged.
