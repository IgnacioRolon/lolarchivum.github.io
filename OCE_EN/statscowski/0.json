I realize they all seem to match with a specific genre of games.  Here&#039;s the list:\n\n**{{champion:103}} : Adventure\n{{champion:42}} : Shoot-em-up\n{{champion:81}} : Role-playing\n{{champion:120}} : Racing (with guitar hero weapon... why not?)\n{{champion:21}} : First-person shooter\n{{champion:92}} : Fighting\n{{champion:37}} : Rhythm**\n\nNow, Azir&#039;s playstyle involves calling soldiers to fight for him, as well as building turrets to repel the enemy team.  That sounds like... Real Time Strategy.  Azir is an emperor who leads his armies, which is essentially what a player is in RTS games.  He can call on blocky-style footmen, create square medieval turrets and push enemies with literal shield barricades.  How about it?  Arcade Azir to round off the Arcade series?\n\n**{{champion:268}} : Real-time strategy**\n\nCommunity ideas (thanks Nightjar):\n\n**{{champion:150}} : Side-scrolling platformer\n{{champion:74}} : Tower defense**","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-11T13:40:38.136+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's actually pretty clever, well thought out and reasonable. Unfortunately, with the release of jade emporor azir, there probably won't be another azir skin for a while and skins are released in bunches and I doubt there'd be any more niches for arcade skins outside of maybe sidescroller gnar (maybe some sort of crash bandicoot meets mario rip off?) or tower defense heimerdinger (possibly too similar to the azir one though RTS and Tower defense are quite different) and also I don't think riot ever looks at board content, nevermind that sometimes riot forgets OCE is even a region.","replies":[{"poster":"Statscowski","date":"2017-02-11T13:47:40.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thanks for the support, I was feeling down because of all the \"No\" votes coming in.  Those are good ideas too, for a total of 10 Arcade skins if they come true.  Gnar getting a power up to become Mega.  {{champion:150}} It's-a Gnario time!

Its not a huge stretch to imagine him in blue/purple armour, with green pixel trails coming from his arms, and 2D soldiers (like final boss veigar's joke).\n\nBut yea, there are themes that would fit him better than arcade.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
