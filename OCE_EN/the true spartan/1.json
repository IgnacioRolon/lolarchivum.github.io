Are smurfs fair or unfair?? Well if you ask me it is really unfair. \r\nThe main reason being behind this is it doesn't help low level players in the slightest. Yes maybe in ranked it might for example gold vs diamond but Bronze vs Diamond is harsh also. I'm level 17 at the moment and I can say for sure that playing against smurfs is ruining my gaming experience. That is all I have to say I could of said alot more but I thought I would leave it up to everyone to decide","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-13T22:41:15.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smurfs are super frustrating while you are trying to level up,  because you feel like you're always losing. They are usually also pretty toxic in the low level norms because they expect everyone to be smurfing, and can't actually deal with the patience needed to guide  new players. \n\nEven in ranked these players are super annoying to deal with, as they make the game super one-sided and also create a toxic environment where the one lane versing them appears to be feeding, and therefore attracts negative attention from team mates. \n\nOn the plus side, since you are almost always against opponents of a higher skill level than you, your play style will adjust and you will find it easier when you hit level 30 as it wont be much different from what you had levelling up (aside from runes and masteries).\n\n[The official riot stance on smurfs](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q9): \"_ Riot does not officially condemn or condone smurfing. We understand the cases where players make new accounts in order to help teach new players the game, but are working on newer systems to provide a similar experience in a more positive way._\"","replies":[]}]}
