Who cares about kassadin's ultimate how about lissandra's ultimate that chunks half the health of your whole team? Then she has her Q on a 2 second cooldown that chunks another half your health and an AOE root slow plus a good escape/gap closer.\n\nEdit: Nerf irelia too her stun is one million years and she takes out your whole health bar while you're waiting for the stun to wear off but by then it's too late.\n\nAlso nerf Nasus bro that's so BS you can build FULL tank and still 2 shot people and he is so hard to zone he can just play safe till he buys his first item then he free farms forever. Then he has the most powerful slow in the game which cripples ADCs SO much. I've seen so many games in the past week of enemy nasus' single handedly carrying by themselves. Same as lissandra where this enemy lissandra was 17/2 and carried her bad team\n\nI hope riot one day realises that picked in LCS doesn't mean they're OP, just that the person likes the champion. Why did Alex Ich main ryze, cause he's OP? No, because he likes the champion. This game would have so much more players if the balance team had brains.\n\n/rant over","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-23T22:54:45.406+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Nasus is getting out of control, then your solo laners and your jungler are all doing it wrong.\n\nLissandra Mid is short ranged and has super long cooldowns, still quite vulnerable to bursty %%%%%es.\n\nLissandra top on the other hand, IS a little bit strong although all in champions like Riv, Panth, Renekton, Irelia, Jax, Tryn etc can still out trade and kill her early.\n\nIrelia's stun goes from 1 to 2 seconds...
