Same thing to Ashe's old arrow, Nidalee's Spear and Mundo's cleavers. I find the same thing is happening to Kennen, Lee and Morgana's Q. I know Morgana's is meant to have a huge hitbox, but it's fair that standing barely away from Nidalee's spear and not getting hit is okay, but when you're literally standing to the side of it and you get hit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-24T12:01:34.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"git gud, l2dodge","replies":[]}]}
