Also kills don't worth as much as a turret because it gives global gold and denies enemy vision. Other than that Baron buffs and dragon buffs give you and your teammates a huge advantage against your enemies which of course is important to win the game. Objectives are easily worth more gold than a kill because it grants gold to all your teammates which increases the gold advantage of your team for buying items to become stronger.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-05-31T13:31:57.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you are Mordekaiser, in which case getting a kill (especially on a tank or marksman) almost ensures you an unguarded turret, even without winions! :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-05-31T09:51:33.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win>fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-31T01:08:28.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad thing about this post, there are people in bronze, that are willing to give up a penta kill for an attempt for an objective (they even failed the objective because i was annoying and nidalee.)\n\nIt's sad when you find this playing on a B4 account but not elsewhere on the ladder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-30T08:32:25.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kills is to set up for getting objectives because your objective in the whole game is to get the enemy Nexus and nothing else.
