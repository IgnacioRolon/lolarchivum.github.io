Or you could make his ult range a lot smaller so it's easier to lane against him without him all inning you as soon as you waste a taunt /damaging ability (but lets hope that doesn't happen because I like zed).{{champion:238}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-28T06:20:11.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wouldn't ask here go to NA where everyone else has realized that Zed needs real nerfs most of OCE loves Zed the way he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-28T08:23:03.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't.

While the AS nerf is kinda pointless for his assassination, it is rather impactful towards attacking towers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-28T06:43:52.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its a total joke.
