Assassins are meant to be high risk high reward. Kassadin can get shrekt in lane, build roa, and still be fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-24T10:32:30.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Batchy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WYF4gMAZ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-02-24T07:30:11.401+0000)\n>\n> To be fair it's pretty bad design when an assassin can get rekt in lane, and still do their job while building tank/bruiser.

He probably would picked up some kills or assists or csed really well and ADC probably wasn't full hp.\n\nThat or the Kass just farmed really really well in despite dying a few times.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2015-02-24T15:43:20.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare I play a hero with no scaling defense nor defensive items die to a character building just as offensively as I am!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-02-24T14:56:29.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin cannot 100/0, he can get close but he wont technically blow you up.
