No chance to miss and no chance for the other champ to dodge.\n\nInstead of nerfing its damage like they have on PBE why not just change it to function like his E. Dashes to the cursor direction and does damage to whoever it hits first.\n\nThat would mean if you messed up and hit a minion its just worked as a gap closer. It would give the other champ a chance to dodge. But if the damage stayed it would still feel worthwhile to actually land it.\n\n(I play a lot of Fizz, it will be interesting to see how the PBE changes affect him in game)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-25T11:09:41.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/bRM5LnY0-meddler-lead-champion-designer-qa\n\nperson who designed fizz was here for a Q+A the other day. interesting talking about Fizz's E.\n\n> Xypherous (NA)  - 5 days ago\nI'm totally responsible for Fizz's 'E' - and the intent was to make a frustrating skill that conveyed that aspect of Fizz's personality. I think my goal was something like 'Let's aim for something that feels like Shaco in terms of trickery/frustration without going too far.' In retrospect - it's probably worked too well in a lot of regards with that.\n\n> The idea for Fizz's 'E' was primarily to allow him to evade opposing damage without actually being durable - so that every now and then his opponents can choke Fizz and obliterate him and feel good about that.\n\n> Fizz was really meant to be a character that felt slippery enough so that you experience a moment of catharsis when you finally catch the jerk and annihilate him.\n\n> As to lane functionality, it was meant much more for the 'lower the poke he takes' rather than the 'instantly annihilate you with Q' that it's become. In hindsight, I wish there was way more incentive to stay on the pole rather than instantly double-tap to move faster.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-25T11:10:02.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't work on live balance directly these days, but the incentives to staying on the pole (and perhaps less damage on the double jump part of it) are generally good directions I think. **I'd also love to trim Mana costs from his other abilities and shove it even more into the 'E' to punish spamming it recklessly like you've pointed out.**\n\n> However, again, don't work on balancing directly. There's a bunch of super smart live designers whose job it is to make sure things look okay from a competitive angle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-25T11:09:58.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Change it so anyone will instantly die when trying to use it,\n\nWhile waiting to respawn, they will hear Morello's pre-recorded voice of \"HAHAHA GIT GUUUUUUD\" play on loop until timer is finished.","replies":[]}]}
