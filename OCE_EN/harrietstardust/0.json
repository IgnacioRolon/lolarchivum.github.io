They are as follows;\r\n\r\n1) Narcissistic junglers who cause very unenjoyable games\r\n2) Narcissistic casual players\r\n\r\nSo, the jungler situation occurred in a game I had tonight. The jungler was playing Hecarim, I was bottom ADC. I didn&#039;t have support, just Jinx, but that didn&#039;t bother me too much. What bothered me is that the jungler came into our lane EVERY freaking time the other team were low and swooped in and took the kill. This caused us to fall way behind because, as much as people say oh just get creeps, it just is much faster to get kills obviously. We did not ask for a gank, and we did not need a gank. The problem was that because he took SO MANY early game kills, we did not feed, at all. Okay, I said to myself, just jump in team fights and - nope, hecarim has literally taken every kill on the map. At the end of the game (and yes, we won, but not a fun game at all) the next highest kills was around 3-4. I personally got 0. I have never, ever got zero kills on that particular champ before. I&#039;m not amazing, but I&#039;m certainly not 0 bad. I&#039;m average. Of course, this meant that I had two choices. Farm, and risk being bulldozed by the other side who had fed (minorly fed still beats absolutely nothing) or join team fights and get picked off. It&#039;s just absolutely no fun for anyone else when an OP or very skilled jungler takes every single kill (just about) and denies everyone else. What happened to teamwork? \r\n\r\n_Maybe we should let people queue for 1v5 so they can really stroke their ego._\r\n\r\ntl;dr -- **how do I get out from under a greedy jungler who won&#039;t let me feed or build as an ADC**. The jungler could have won the game by himself if the rest of us AFK&#039;d. Just....really not any fun. Yeah great your amazing, go join pro.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to my second point/issue/whatever. Wouldn&#039;t it be much better to force people who trashed those who werent as skilled to always play ranked? Now, I don&#039;t mean those who are looking for a casual game. I mean those who are constantly up in arms about something. &quot;Why are you playing support when you&#039;re not amazeballz, why did you not take support when we already had adc. THIS IS A CASUAL GAME. Sometimes matchup&#039;s dont work, sometimes games suck, but it sucks ALL the more when people pick on everything you do. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s gotten to the point where I auto report if I hear someone ask &quot;what rank&quot; UM THIS IS CASUAL. I&#039;m rank 29, and yeah on my main I&#039;m going to kick (at least a little bit) of ass, but if I&#039;m playing someone I&#039;ve not played a lot (even if I&#039;ve played a few games in bots) that&#039;s just no excuse to ask &quot;what rank?&quot; like I&#039;m the most stupid player in the world. Incidentally, this was called when I was playing support because I was pretty much bullied into it. I decided to have some fun and play Nami. Oh boy, even though I had damn near 20 assists, my 0 kills was just a sin. Um, support SUPPORT, they don&#039;t take kills. If I take kills as support it was entirely an accident, or I&#039;m the only one that can take the kill. Yes, I&#039;m one of those people who does believe a support should just do that - support. Heal, kill creeps when alone, buy gear that gives you money on other&#039;s farms so you don&#039;t need to farm yourself. **Why the hell is 0 kills 20 assists bad for a support. **\r\n\r\nOkay that turned out way longer than I intended but I am looking for constructive ideas on how to personally continue the game when either of these things happen.","replies":[{"poster":"LyteHatesSoloQ","date":"2016-05-15T20:36:13.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if he kills people for you u should have enough free farm to be relevant and ahead of the enemy botlane.\nHe did everything right.\nYou said yo uare not amazing.

Work on it, try to get 200 CS by 20 minutes, then go better. Once you are good at CS you can then work to improve your dueling on top of that.\n\nJungles don't have to gank, they can gank whenever they want.\nAsking a jungler over and over to gank usually annoys them and you wont see many ganks after that.\nA jungler's role is primarily to set up map objectives and make use of the jungle. Ganking is secondary and they have NO obligation whatsoever to do so, no matter how much bot lane whinges.\nA good jungler is always scanning the play field for easy and rewarding ganks, we don't want to dive bot tower for one kill and a potential triple kill turn around with the enemy marksman getting enough time to clear two creep waves before backing safely.\nRisk vs Reward.\nIn your case the reward was high and the risk was low, therefore Hecarim will gank a lot in order to snowball quickly and hard.\n\nOh and be mindful if you take jungle creep, the jungler gains roughly 30-50 more gold from them than you do, it's work a lot more to them, you've got lane minions you can kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illidalian","date":"2016-05-11T23:41:12.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with 'fattyhotdogs' here.\n\nConstructive Criticism as follows;\n\nThe aim of the game is to win. How do we win? Destroying the Nexus. How do you destroy the nexus? Obtain objectives and push.\nCS &amp; and gaining objectives far outweighs the need for kills. I personally believe that if you are playing this game for the best 'KDA' you can, you are doing it wrong. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love being on a killstreak. Getting 10/0/10 (or something of the sort). It's a great feeling, but that feeling should be a bonus - not a goal.\n\nIf I was in your position, with a jungler ganking and obtaining as many kills as you say, I would be banking on it and getting as much CS as possible, and pro-actively looking for objectives. Jungler comes down and clean sweeps the enemy ADC and Support? Clear a wave or two then go for Dragon (if it's up). That benefits your whole team, while giving you more gold than either of those kills would.\n\nWithout a doubt, the game is a hell of a lot more fun when you are getting kills - but if kills are the only reason you're having fun, you're playing the wrong game.\n\nOnto your second point - Forcing people to play ranked is not the solution. Reporting people for toxic behavior is. Something I learnt recently is that we all have an auto-pilot that controls everything we do. From driving a car, to how we walk, to the tastes we enjoy and of course - how we react to other peoples behavior. It's ingrained into our psyche. Generally in games like this when people are making you feel bad for not being good at what you are doing; you need to take a step back and think to yourself - I'm not going to let this person make me feel bad just because I am not that good at it, or because I am not performing the way they think I should be. This is effectively using the decisive part of your brain, and turning off the auto-pilot. \n\nMute the player, communicate via 'Pings' and then report the player at the end of the game.\n\nGood luck to you, summoner.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-11T21:24:36.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got 2 points to give.\n\nIt's a casual game for Hecarim as well. He is there to have fun too. And boy did he have fun. Sure, it might have made more sense in a competitive game to give the adc a bunch of kills, but if it is more fun for him to take it why would he not?\n\nAlso, you have the wrong mindset about cs and kills. You know how many waves it takes to make as much gold as a kill? One and a half.....\n\nIn 30 minutes you should have had 240 cs. That's a whole fucking lot more gold than a few kills. And of your landing oponent was dying so much, you should have been farming easily and gaining more experience than him, and take that advantage to zone him out even further.\n\nIf you're playing adc, TAKE THE DAMN CS.\nSee that zed that got away from a teamfight with 10hp? Don't chase him for the kill. Go take that 30cs that's pushing one of your lanes instead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-11T19:59:39.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually get the narcissistic laner who complains about me not ganking when I'm low health in the middle of my first clear or frequently spam for ganks all the while shoving the lane in front of the turret. It's annoying as heck. \n\n The issue is some players have this mentality on where they have to carry every game and to them carry means having the highest number of kills. Personally if I play {{champion:24}}  or {{champion:5}} in the jungle I'll tell you I will try to hand every kill to my allied laners in the hopes that they would snowball their lane because these champions get really strong off just one or two items and will always have the dueling potential to take out squishy targets.  But the player carry mindset belittles their team quite a bit. Mind you overfeeding someone who is relatively easy to kill could result in handing over lots of shutdown gold to the enemy team each time he dies. \n\n**_I had a game where a fizz went 38/6/4 yet he still lost. Why? Because his team wasn't strong enough to win an actual fight where we would just focus fizz down and then eliminate the rest of his team. The game ended at 34 minutes so it didn't even drag out because every single time fizz died, we got an objective, a turret, a dragon or something important to achieving the ends of the dragon. _**\n\nAnyhow, as a support main, people suck. I once got crap off this rengar who decided to 1v1 an enemy rengar in the jungle. They both got to extremely low health I was playing Leona. I decided not to leave it to chance and ult, since I was in range for that. Turns out the ultimate was enough to kill the enemy rengar leaving our allied rengar at an odd 50 hp. Maybe our rengar would've succeeded, maybe not. I wasn't chancing it and I wasn't going to regret it if it gave our team extra gold and pushed the enemy rengar behind a bit.\n\nBy the way, if you're playing ADC aim to take whatever kills you can, be greedy, farm as much as possible, because you're the one who scales into lategame the best. It's really how you should play ADC imo unless your allies really need that extra gold. ","replies":[]}]}
