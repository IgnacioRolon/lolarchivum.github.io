It still requires me to pay 2600 rp rito pleaseee we want our accountsss!!!  {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-31T04:35:34.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nYour best bet will be to send in a support ticket and they should be able to help you out with the transfer.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"AgentViolet","date":"2015-09-01T16:00:05.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but it takes them like 1 day to respond I'm so scared that the free transfer will be gone tomorrow or the next few days.\nme and my friends are now worrying about this :/","replies":[]}]}]}
