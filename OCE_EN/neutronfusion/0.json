I hit level 30 a few days ago and am not sure about when I should start playing ranked. I&#039;ve heard people say to hit around 200 wins and be 10 positive. I am nearing 200 wins but am 17 wins from a 50% WR. I sometimes am not sure why I cannot win many of these games. It seems to me that other lanes very often lose lane and are not coordinated in teamfights. That is not to say that my gameplay is really good. This is not made worse by the fact that a lot of people play snowball-y champions such as Katarina, Yasuo, Xin Zhao, etc. I am a top lane main. I can play all roles to a decent degree and have 3 champions at least for each role. Can I please be enlightened upon 1) When I should play ranked and 2) How can I win more games more often.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-12T08:06:01.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already blaming \"other lanes\" and can't \"control enemy snowbally champs\". \nYou my friend, will be Bronze in no time 8)\n\nPlay ranked whenever you want. Its just a game. Not like it matters too much. Unless you care about your rank, in which case wait.\n\n1. You should have atleast 4 rune pages with a full set of runes for each position.  AD/ADC/AP/Supp\n2. You should have \"proper\" masteries.\n3. You should know what \"counter building\" is.\n4. You should have an average CS of 6.5 per minute to at least be Silver.\n5. You should know whose job it is to ward... EVERYONES\n6. You should know your role in teamfights (this varies champion to champion). Is it your job to jump on the enemy or is it your job to hang back and protect your damage dealers?\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=NeutronFusion\n\nHaving a glance at your games, you my friend are not ranked ready. Your builds alone tell me that. You literally NEVER buy boots. They are an essential item in League. You should have regular boots before your first complete item and have tier 2 boots as your 2nd or 3rd item finished.\nYou also only average 4-5 cs per minute which is low bronze level cs'ing.\nAlso I dont think you've ever bought a ward in your life.\nYou never swap or upgrade your trinket, even when a oracles would be extremely helpful against champs like Talon or Shaco {{item:3364}} \n\nWatch some streamers or Youtubers and learn how to play the game properly. Go into custom games or normals and focus on CS'ing. Make it your job not to lose any cs in the first 2 waves and that should alone be enough to get a lead on most lower level players.\nIn a custom game if you can get 36 farm by 5mins, you are \"ranked ready\" in terms of cs'ing.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-12T15:26:52.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">You should have an average CS of 6.5 per minute to at least be Silver.\n\nPlease there are people in mid to high gold who can't manage this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeutronFusion","date":"2015-07-12T08:52:03.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the very detailed reply! I do have quite a few questions though (they may be very nooby). Firstly, regarding the boots, I don't really see why I need boots. I don't exactly see the purpose unless I'm against a champion whose skillshots I must dodge. But then and again, I am probably wrong. With the runes, I really don't want to spend real money on the game so would two rune pages still be adequate? And, I do recognize that my gameplay is far from good but what is there that I can do to help my other lanes in the event if I do get a lead? Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-12T09:52:07.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 rune pages is the bare minimum. A rune page only costs 6300 IP. Which takes roughly 40-50 games to get.\n\nYour rune pages depends on the champions you play. Looking at rune pages you have 2 pretty good ones. So they are fine for now. I would suggest buying more eventually however.\n\nBoots are good as they give you more movespeed as well as minor battle stats. The extra movespeed allows you to move around the map faster not just in terms of dodging skill shots and things like that. Being able to get to dragon when it respawns as opposed to getting there 5 seconds later is a big difference. Also if your enemy has boots and you don't, they will have an easier time of simply running away from you since you walk a lot slower than them.\n\nFor Irelia, Getting Merc Treads or Ninja Tabi's is a HUGE help when fighting people. Merc treads reduce CC if your opponent uses stuns etc on you as well as giving you a little magic resist OR if you playing against an Auto attack champion, Ninja Tabi's reduce auto attack damage by 10% and give you a little bit of armour.\n\nThese stats can't be overlooked.","replies":[{"poster":"NeutronFusion","date":"2015-07-13T01:18:27.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok!

JOIN THEM. help them out. show your presence around the map.\nhav rune pages for multiple matchups (ad attack speed vs ad) (ad cdr vs ad) etc\nlearn your opponent. is he aggressive? is he playing safe. know when they hard engage because it could b a telltale sign of a gank.\nmap awareness-try to look at your map one every 5 seconds.\nbuy wards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scatman John","date":"2015-07-13T04:17:32.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i started playing ranked straight away.
