You had no defensive items and no armor penetration. It was more them being bad than you being good. On the plus side, at lest it will show up in your ranked stats regardless of how you got it.\n\nLike, you burned flash when you still had your E up and you ulted a full tank instead of riven/fizz.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Of Dawn","date":"2014-12-20T02:08:13.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My flash net was to dodge fish and riven ults :) nevertheless also i ulted for fun :)","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-20T09:35:30.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knight Of Dawn,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=shNALQxh,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-20T02:08:13.448+0000)\n>\n> My flash net was to dodge fish and riven ults :) nevertheless also i ulted for fun :)\n\n1. Riven didn't get close.\n2. You didn't flash net, you just flashed.\n3. Net would have been sufficient - Riven had used her dashes and was bogged down in CC.\n\nApart from anything most of the kills were last hits on squishies while you weren't even getting focused. 5/10 Penta. Not even upload-worthy.\n\nTry doing that against a team with half decent players and no item advantage. I'd much rather see a support get a penta against the scrub team you were versing.","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Of Dawn","date":"2015-04-12T02:36:21.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK next penta will be better thanks for comment","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
