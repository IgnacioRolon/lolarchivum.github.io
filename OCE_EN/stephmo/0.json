This is basically what it is, I can load the client, I can load the menus and I can choose champion but as soon as the game opens, it is just a black screen, no loading screen, no nothing. And then the bullshit part is that it says its a problem with my internet and I should restart my router, yet my internet is fine, I can watch YouTube, I can play other online games but LoL doesn&#039;t connect, any help would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-23T08:36:28.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me,\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
