Surely the game is finished by now, but it won't let me leave; only option is reconnect.\n\nI've restarted client, clicked recconnect, checked network connections (which are fine, I can still chat to people at the \"reconnect\" button screen). \n\nI'll have to move to playing something else, I don't have time to wait around clicking a reconnect button.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Braineatingbeast","date":"2015-07-04T12:04:12.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing today. Its not the servers, you got drop hacked. \n\nWe had a Nami support that was in her promos to gold. When bot gave away a doublekill the game disconnected for everyone. The idea of a drop hack is that everyone is forced out of the game and the game ends letting noone win or lose, so the guy that used it can still win his her series. \n\nApparantly there is a trick you can use when it happens.  When you keep spamming right click the game wont disconnect you using leaverbuster and the game ends normally when the minions push the nexus... \n\nthere should be an easier way to report people using it because right now it is pretty much going unpunished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarknessUnknown","date":"2015-07-02T13:29:41.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get this same message. I use a mac and have played fine with no problems for over a year. This happened to me 2 days ago and I just thought it was an anomaly (has never happened before), but it just happened to me again this morning. When I get the message my entire screen is black with only the message displayed and I get the option to retry or hit cancel. If i hit retry then nothing happens and the message comes back 10 seconds later. If i hit cancel I just remain with a black screen, my computer does nothing, remains frozen and I have to manually turn off my computer by holding down the power button. I'm concerned about the health of my computer playing this game now and the status of my account continually leaving games. It would be sad to leave leagues because I am a purchasing customer, but I may need to if I don't feel my computer is safe using it.","replies":[]}]}
