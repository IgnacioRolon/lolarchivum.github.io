It is. And we&#039;re all thinking it - I&#039;m just no-&quot;\r\n\r\nJinx was interrupted by Braum&#039;s voice. &quot;Stop, stop the both of you.&quot; All heads took turn to move in the direction of Ashe, silently begging her to speak. Although nothing was said, all that was heard was the dripping of water coming from a rustic pipe that seemed to have been hanging on it&#039;s last hinges for years.\r\n\r\nFinally, &quot;Who did this?&quot; Ashe whispered, her voice raising with each word. &quot;Did anyone see who did this?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;No, no one saw anything,&quot; Anivia reported, following with &quot;Neither did the enemy team, well no one is speaking up at least.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Of course they saw who did this...&quot; Ashe&#039;s teeth were now being grit, as though to stop her from doing something she would regret in that moment. &quot;The enemy team are lying through their teeth.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;What about the Players? There were hundreds of thousands of people watching the game today, they obviously saw something!&quot; Jinx said, her hand held up high in the air - proud of her discovery.\r\n\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t be silly. You know they replaced his body with a visual form so it would appear he was still alive.&quot; All heads turned to Ashe once again to make sure she was fine with what was being said, well as fine as one can be in a situation like this. Katerina continued &quot;Can you imagine the chaos Riot would&#039;ve caused if this hadn&#039;t been done? Tryndamere was a highly respected warrior and champion to the Players - knowing he was dead, and not just after the 30 second or so death timer would ruin Riot&#039;s career.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe ever so slowly sauntered out of the room and back onto the highly saturated green grass of the battle field (Summoner&#039;s Rift). Footsteps and wings followed behind her, not wanting her to be alone in fear of her doing something irrational.\r\n\r\nShe swivelled around to face them all, her bright blue cape dancing with her figure. &quot;I need...I want, the names of those on the enemy team.&quot; Her voice was a harsh as a rugged pavement.\r\n\r\n&quot;I believe it was Amumu, Vladimir, Taliyah...and um...&quot; Anivia replied, trailing off as she had forgotten who the two other members were.\r\n&quot;Miss Fortune and...&quot; Braum coughed, scratching his shoulder. &quot;And Aatrox.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe looked up from the ground into Braum&#039;s eyes that were also filled with tears from the loss of his good friend. She walked over to Braum until she was directly underneath his nose - he leant down. &quot;We both know who it was. We both know that they were sworn enemies.&quot; Ashe whispered with anger in her heart, into his ear, taking her hand off his in the process. He nodded with reply.\r\n\r\n&quot;We have a name,&quot; She announced. &quot;The next game held on this battlefield will mark the death of an enemy.&quot; With that she stormed off towards the fountain - Jinx trailed beside her, while the others could just stand there in pure shock.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ashe, you know I&#039;m all for crime and chaos, but even I think this a little too much.&quot; Jinx almost seemed nervous, which was very unlike her.\r\n\r\n&quot;Say what you want to say.&quot; Ashe paused.\r\n\r\nA hand was placed on Ashe&#039;s shoulder carefully. &quot;All I&#039;m saying is perhaps I will be able to get away with something like this, but not you. Your guilt will catch up to you.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe took a long deep breath, closing her eyes and then reopening them, looking directly into Jinx&#039;s wild eyes. &quot;Not before my sorrow does.&quot;\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n*30 seconds until minions spawn*\r\n\r\nAfter purchasing her weapons from the shopkeeper, Ashe was the first one to reach her lane - top lane, she was prepared to face off Aatrox. The live voice feed voiced concern of the Players about what Ashe was doing top lane. &quot;Is this some new meta I haven&#039;t heard about? How is Ashe going to do well against an Aatrox in lane?&quot; A player spoke.\r\n\r\nKaterina, Anivia, Braum and Jinx all gathered, trying to talk quickly so they didn&#039;t raise the suspicions of the Players.\r\n\r\n&quot;What is Ashe planning?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;How come no one tried to stop her before the game?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The machine is still broken, surely she can&#039;t be planning to take Aatrox&#039;s life - humiliate him perhaps.&quot;\r\n\r\n10 minutes into the game nothing out of the ordinary was happening. Bows were being flown as normal, walls were placed, blades were soaring and shields were being cast. No one had gotten first blood - or the last. Anivia had an inkling that something was going to happen soon so she decided to take action. \r\n\r\n&quot;Zed, Zed please listen to me.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Shh, you&#039;re going to draw unwanted attention to us,&quot; He responded, casting his shadow to his right.\r\n\r\n&quot;Relax, they&#039;re going to just think I&#039;m taunting you or something. Keep those blades coming and we will be fine.&quot; She threw out some ice at a minion. &quot;This is more important anyway than worrying about a few little heads turning our way.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;What is it?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Ashe is planning something. I&#039;m sure you heard about Tryndamere&#039;s death. His REAL death.&quot; Her voice was filled with sadness.\r\n\r\n&quot;I did, I didn&#039;t believe it though. It&#039;s Tryndamere, and the machine has never failed in all it&#039;s 7 years of existence.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnivia stopped attacking, hopefully the Players would just think she is letting Zed push the lane. &quot;You know about the machine?&quot; Her voice laced with confusion.\r\n\r\nAs expected Zed didn&#039;t reply. Many thoughts were running through her head in that moment, but she decided to put them all aside and focus on preventing the life of another champion. She roamed top lane, luckily for her timing - Aatrox had gone back to his base.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ashe, what are you doing?&quot; Her voice wavered a little.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;m finding my perfect moment to avenge my husband.&quot; Anivia noticed Ashe&#039;s hand was trembling - with anger or with fear, she did not know.\r\n\r\n&quot;You do know the machine still isn&#039;t working?&quot; Anivia took Ashe&#039;s silence as a yes. &quot;This is more than humiliating him in front of all these people at the fact he was beaten by an Ashe. This is death. He has friends, he has family...&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe stopped attacking and whipped around so she was facing Anivia, her grip extremely tight on her bow. &quot;Tryndamere has friends and a family too. A wife, which was me in case you had forgotten. He didn&#039;t deserve to die!&quot; She yelled, drawing the rare attention of some minions.\r\n\r\nAs Anivia was about to speak Aatrox appeared back into the lane, a smug smile (we can only assume) on his face, giving the impression he had heard everything. \r\n\r\nWith each sentence he gave, he drew a step closer. &quot;You must know it was an innocent game. I had no idea the machine was down, nor of it&#039;s existence in the first place. Truly.&quot;\r\n\r\nFor a moment Ashe considered his statement. &quot;You killed him, whether you were aware of it or not. My husband is dead, because of you!&quot; She spat out.\r\n\r\n&quot;I don&#039;t regret anything, I&#039;m glad that he is dead. I&#039;m not apologising, you must also understand that. What I know is by you shooting me with that little arrow you have there - is going to hurt you more than it&#039;ll hurt me.&quot; She slightly lowered her bow, but her drive never faltered. &quot;Sure, it&#039;ll hurt me for a second or two. But you&#039;ll be ruining Riot&#039;s reputation - you&#039;ll be costing the life of you and everyone YOU love.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnivia looked back and forth between Aatrox and Ashe, the three were oblivious to the stares from the Players - and that all the fighting happened to stop around them. \r\n\r\nAshe lifted her bow, directly aiming it at Aatrox&#039;s heart, well in her case the place where his heart should be. She was ready to shoot, ready to avenge her husband who died without reason; unfairly. Ready to shoot down a guilty man, not to be dead for a death timer, but to be dead forever. But a voice had stopped her...\r\n\r\n*Enemy team agreed to surrender. 4 votes, 0 votes against.*\r\n\r\nEnemies and allies had prevented the death of another champion, protecting Riot&#039;s reputation and the Players enjoyment of the game. For they believed in order for &quot;an average day&quot; story to be told, there would have to be a world for the story to take place.","replies":[{"poster":"Eldest","date":"2016-07-06T05:45:48.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love it <3","replies":[]},{"poster":"JinxedTunes","date":"2016-07-04T04:20:11.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i THINK i voted for it?","replies":[]}]}
