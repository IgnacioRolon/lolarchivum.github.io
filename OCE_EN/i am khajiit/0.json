With Vsync off and uncapped FPS my GPU load is much higher than with it on (at times almost hitting 100% load briefly). With vsync on, the GPU loud is much lower and it never hits anywhere near the top (even briefly).\nDespite the GPU load however, the temperatures were both at the same level ( just over 50 degrees C.).\nSo my question is that, will leaving vsync off put unnecessary work on my GPU? And is the fact that the GPU load can hit high points at times an issue?\nAlso, out of curiosity, how many of you do use vsync or at least an FPS cap? \nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-25T23:51:10.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, what's Vsync","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-25T10:49:45.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game doesn't tear (i never see it happen once anyway) so its fine to leave it off if you ask me. Considering im using a really low quality laptop (cant even run dying light or witcher 3 on ultra graphics without lagging, obviously it sucks balls) and mine doesn't tear, your gaming laptop should be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-25T10:44:02.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you have a nice monitor you won't notice much difference if you cap your FPS.\n\nWith Vsync on the game caps itself to 60 FPS (for me). WIth it off and uncapped I can get over 450 FPS. But I don't really notice the difference after like 80, so I just cap it at 144 or whatever this game has as its max.","replies":[]}]}
