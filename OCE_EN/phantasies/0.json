The entire page blanks out and I get the following text.\r\nError: 404\r\nPlayer not found\r\nThe requested player was not found.\r\nI have tested on multiple PC's using Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox but I get the error every time. I opened a support ticket in regards to this but was advised that it would be better if I posted it here. Is any one else having this issue?\r\nI have also attached a screen shot of the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"604bbh","date":"2018-01-08T00:07:21.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahaha","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:44:07.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I opened a support ticket in regards to this but was advised that it would be better if I posted it here.\n\nBut we usually suggest that it's better to create a support ticket!\n\nAnyway, I can shed some light on this.
