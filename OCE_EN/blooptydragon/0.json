I know it's annoying when people afk in ranked games but just tell yourself that it happens to everyone and it isn't just you. This game it's you who has the afk but in the next few games it's the enemy team who has the afk.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-30T12:22:55.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more often than not, it's either a blackout or the internet failing them from my experience. Australian's powernetwork isn't exactly reliable and we all know how dodgy our internet can be sometimes, especially when it's a promo series.","replies":[{"poster":"SÃ½ndra","date":"2017-05-01T21:09:10.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you make it sound like we are in some backwater country, i live about 25 mins outside of brisbane, and we havnt had a power outage in years, not even during the floods.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-02T03:17:41.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of the suburbs around Brisbane have underground power lines, which pretty much means (barring anything drastic) that unless the actual exchange goes out, we don't lose power. This simply isn't true of a lot of other places where they have above ground power, which ofc means that all it takes to knock out their power for a while is on power line going down. \n\nJust something to consider before you start saying \"it doesn't happen to me therefore it doesn't happen to anyone else\". Also, you seem to be implying that 25 mins out of Brisbane is far.... That just ain't so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-05-02T05:44:05.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Adelaide, even if you live in the city, it's very rare you go a month without a power outage. There is currently a statewide discussion about improving the SA power network and building backup infrastructure and securing an agreement with the power companies because of the frequency we get statewide blackouts, is a little much. South Australia is a joke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-02T03:20:03.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I live 20 minutes from brisbane and i lost power in the floods.
