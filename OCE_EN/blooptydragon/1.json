I&#039;m no troll i have spent far too much money on this game and its beyond a joke that I even have to worry about this, but what happens if I do get banned? Can I appeal it? cause I bloody well will.\r\n\r\nThank you for the advice in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-16T04:23:28.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So long as you are playing seriously and not intent feeding or afking or abusing your teammates or any of the other usual stuff then no, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nThat said, assholes aside and all, do try to be considerate of your teammates. Understand that supp MF isn't going to be the best with a lot of comps. Communicate with your team and be willing to compromise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-04-17T00:44:07.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played with graves' sups that built no support items. Stole as much cs as they could and kills, made sure I died by running away from any fights that broke out and then went back in for the kills.

Unless, of course, you've been reported for this for the past dozen+ games. THEN you should be worried. But even then, it would only be a 7 or 14 day ban.\n\nBut there should be nothing to worry about, anyway. MF Supp isn't a \"troll\" pick (unlike movement speed Soraka Jg, for example). It's just not the best in a lot of team ups. \n\nIf you DO want to be effective with MF supp, try to only pick her if your ADC has a stun like with an Ashe or Varus, since your ult will be very lethal, or if you have a bot-lane APC like Ahri, Annie, TF, etc. who also have stuns (or charms).","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2017-04-16T03:05:33.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is a pretty grey area, its basically down to luck, since penalties dont go off what you have done wrong but the amount of reports you get in my experience, like the top singed player in the world get banned for playing singed support(even tho he played well and would work as a team in a great manner) but the reasoning wasnt specific, they changed it up alot, but if its just the one guy getting mad you should be in the clear, but if you do get banned you cant be unbanned so gl","replies":[]}]}
