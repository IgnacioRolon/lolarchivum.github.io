Wukong's lore goes by the original Chinese classic Jouney to the West, which it besides the character names and a few traits, doesn't really share much similarity or connection with the Dragon Ball anime series, especially after Goku became an adult.\n2. Hatsune Miku is not an anime character, she is just a virtual persona created to represent a singing program (sharing music theme with Sona) of some sort for mostly easy recognition and marketing purposes. So I wouldn't say it's strictly an anime reference tbh.\n3. Pokemon isn't really famous for its anime series though, it's the games that got the fame, rest are kinda just bonuses.\n\nI am really not sure about Braum, since he is based on the community suggested champ originally called Angus. But whatever, I can let this one slide.\n\nBut yer the game definitely has quite a few anime references already, I gotta agree. \n\nEDIT: you forgot the best anime reference, TTGL Rumble though.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-11T19:46:09.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong shares quite a few personality traits, with Goku as well as colour scheme, also if Riot is going to make a champion out of that old legend of course they are gong to look at other characters based off that legend and they wouldnt have forgotten the most famous of them all.\n\nHatusne Miku is not from an anime she is from vocaliod, however her drawing style is unreputably manga/anime. i never said she was an anime characters.\npokemon is best known for the games and the games did come first (before even the manga) but skarners quote is \"Skar Skar Skarnerrr\"\nwhich is a reference to how pokemon say their names, this is more well known in the animo than the games, as in the games thy have their weird sound they make when they start a battle. and anyway it is an anime weather famous or not.\n\nand yes i forgot Rumble D: and thats like one of the best ones D: how could i?
