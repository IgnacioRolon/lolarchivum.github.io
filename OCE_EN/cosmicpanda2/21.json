However, there are a few amongst the bustling crowds of war mongers, and that is the Aristocracy. Although few in number ever since the rise of Swain, some remain alive and take pleasure in indulgence. One of their favourite luxuries are the clothing and decorations that are so delicately assembled by Noxus&#039; own master needle worker, Stella. She was a genius with the needle and thread, however, unknown to her clients, she is also a genius assassin, who uses the very same tools of creation for murder, often at the whim of the Noxian officers and generals who wished to see others removed without leaving a trace. She doesn&#039;t of course. She has made enough hand towels and blankets to soak up any bloodshed and her needles are always retrieved, and even if they weren&#039;t, who would ever think a needle could kill a man. While she is busily stitching together a coat or glove for one nobleman, she is most likely also piecing together a body bag for another.\r\n\r\nPassive: Needle-Point\r\nWhenever Stella hits an enemy with an auto attack, she leaves her needles inside the enemy, applying a stack of Needle-Point. Stella deals bonus X-X(based on a level)(+X% AD) physical damage to all enemies who are NOT affected by Needle-Point. The stack lasts for X seconds.\r\n\r\nQ: Splinter Stitch\r\nQuickly, Stella throws a handful of needles in a large come in front of her, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and applies Needle-Point. Deals X% bonus damage to all enemies NOT already affected by Needle-Point\r\n\r\nW: Threading through the Eye\r\nStella throws in a straight line a larger needle, this time with thread attached. If the needle hits an enemy, it deals X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and it causes all enemies around them that are effected by Needle-Point to be dealt X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and to become tethered to the target enemy for X/X/X/X seconds. If the needle hits a wall, the same effect occurs, but this time a needle is left on the wall and last for X% of the tether duration. All enemies who are tethered cannot move X units from where the needle is located. This ability will deal X% extra damage if the unit hit by Threading Through the Eye is NOT affected by Needle-Point.\r\n\r\nE: Spooled\r\nStella leaves a giant spool on the ground at her feet, which turns invisible and lasts X seconds. If an enemy affected by Needle-Point steps in the area of the spool, giant threads lash out from the spool and grabs the enemy, dragging them onto the spool, before the spool explodes, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD), and slows them for X% for X seconds. Stella can carry up to X charges of Spools, recharging a spool every X seconds\r\n\r\nR: Red Ties of Fate\r\nStella throws a red thread into battle, which then interweaves amongst all enemies affected by Needle-Point in the area surrounding Stella. The enemies are affected by Red Ties of Fate for X/X/X seconds. When enemies are under this effect, they receive X%/X%/X% of damage taken by any other enemy also under the effect. Furthermore, if one enemy bound by Red Ties of Fate is stunned, then all other enemies bound are slowed by X% for the duration of their stun.","replies":[]}
