However, these technological miracles don&#039;t appear out of thin air. No, they are made, through perseverance, genius and a lot of prototypes. The academy of Piltover produces many bright sparks who all seek out to create elaborate machinery to contribute to the progress of the city, but there is one student in particular, who is a slight anomaly in the class. Often Piltover prides it&#039;s self on pristine and perfected mechanics, but for Fidget, one of the Hextech Engineers, her numerous amounts of gadgets and prototype are thought to be... Messy. She doesn&#039;t really care much for neat polished drafts or final cut products. She just wants to get her plans made reality, see if it works, then move onto the next schematic. Had she not single-handedly dealt with a whole riot of thugs with a handful of her insane inventions, she may have been expelled, but after she showed that fear of skill and prowess, they decided to keep her... Just in her own campus... In her own house... In another city...\n\n---\n\nPassive: Scuttler-Bots\nEvery time a minion dies near Fidget, her tiny little helper bots scuttle the minion, giving her X mana and gives her a cog. When an enemy champion dies near her, she gains 10 times the bonus.\nFidget can spend cogs to buy upgrades at the shop for each of her abilities. She can only purchase one upgrade for each ability.\n\n---\n\nQ: Scrap Cannon\nFidget slaps onto her ally a miniature turret of her own design, which lasts for X seconds. The turret will aid them in all their attacks, the Scrap Cannon firing every time the ally attacks, shooting their target, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) physical damage.\n\nUpgrades:-\n\nHex Rockets: Scrap Cannon now shoots a missile with every attack, now dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) physical damage in an AoE burst.\n\nLightning Rod: Scrap Cannon now instead shoots a crackling bolt of lightning, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magical, and deals X% of the damage up to X number of nearby targets\n\nLaser Lens: Scrap Cannon now shoots a laser beam, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) true damage. Due to the heat of the gun from the laser, Scrap Cannon will only shoot every second attack.\n\n---\n\nW: Taser Dart\nFidget shoots in a straight line an electronic dart, which attaches to the first enemy it hits, sticking in them for X seconds. The dart deals X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage per second.\n\nUpgrades:-\n\nShock Collar: the Taser Dart now becomes a collar, which, when attached to the enemy, mini stunning them every X seconds, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage per mini stun.\n\nGravity Capacitors: the Taser Dart now becomes a gravity projector, causing the enemy to be slowed by X% for X seconds, increasing up to X%/X%/X%/X% for the duration. When the duration ends, they are crushed by the field, being dealt X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage\n\nTesla Coil: The Taser Dart becomes a Tesla Coil Plug, attaching to the enemy and deals X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage per second to the attached enemy and all enemies around then.\n\n---\n\nE: Craft Shield\nFidget Attaches a field generator to an ally, granting a X/X/X/X(+X% AP) shield for X seconds\n\nUpgrades:-\n\nTurbo Fan: the Field Generator is now a giant fan, causing the shield to take X%/X%/X%/X% less damage from projectiles and grants X%/X%/X%/X% movement\n\nFrost Field: the Field Generator absorbs heat from its surroundings, creating an icy layer of atmosphere around its target, causing the shield to take X%/X%/X%/X% less damage from non-projectiles. The Frost Field produces an aura that slows movement speed of nearby enemies by X%/X%/X%/X%.\n\nPower Re-router: the Field Generator now has a redirecting drive, causing the Field generator to shoot a bolt of electricity at any source of damage dealt to the shield, the bolt dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP).\n\n---\n\nR: Doomsday Device\nFidget throws down a tiny box, which then opens up and reveals her marvellous doomsday device, which is a massive machine gun cannon that lasts for X/X/X seconds. It will fire in a straight line a stream of bullets, dealing X/X/X(+X% AP) physical damage per second to enemies hit, dealing X% to all enemies hit after the first. The Doomsday Device will spin its aim around in a clockwise direction at a moderate speed. The Doomsday device has X/X/X HP, and can be destroyed.\n\nUpgrades:-\n\nEarthquake Generator: Her doomsday machine becomes a massive pounder, that stomps the earth, dealing X/X/X(+X% AP) physical damage per second to all enemies in the large area, slowing them by X%/X%/X% for X seconds\n\nLaser Beacon: Fidget throws down a small beacon, which then calls in her prototype orbital laser, which then targets the area around the beacon. Reactivating Laser Beacon will allow you to point and click an area within the beacons range to shoot a large laser beam at, which will deal X/X/X/X(+X% AP) true damage to enemies hit. Can be reactivated up to X/X/X times. \n\nBlack Hole Bomb: the doomsday device becomes a devastating bomb, which, after X seconds, detonated an explosion capable of collapsing a small area after detonation into a black hole for X/X/X seconds. Enemies who enter the black hole are stunned, and while inside the black hole, enemies will be damaged for X/X/X(+X% target&#039;s max HP) magic damage per second. The bomb has half the amount of lives as the Doomsday device, and the detonation can be canceled by destroying it before it goes off.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-03T11:35:05.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should of named him Fidget, the hextech spinner","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-03T14:44:07.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was just about to write that then i saw this hahaha\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/cu5OjF8FxHDSU/giphy.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-08-03T12:56:53.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the academy award for most original joke goes to this guy ^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-04T07:36:22.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heimerdinger in a nutshell","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-08-04T07:50:37.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing that this shares with Heimer is the augments, which In themselves are vastly different, and the ult being a turret to begin with","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-08T09:05:13.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just feels like heimerdinger","replies":[]}]}]}]}
