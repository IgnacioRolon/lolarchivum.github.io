They all ride to and from destinations in their specialized 3-seated motor-trike. A pilot seat for Fuji, and two wheeled pods on either side for Umi and Tak to sit inside. Together, they rip up through the streets of Zaun, the city they have come to call home when the three yordles were abandoned under mysterious circumstances on the doorstep of a very questionable, but surprisingly reliable parts dealer down in the slums districts of the fog washed city.\n&gt; Fuji is a talented driver and it is his nimble and dexterous maneuvers that allow the trio to get anywhere around the city. Never one to fear danger, he wheels, twirls and even doughnuts his way across both roads and battlefields alike, simply for style points.\n&gt; Umi is the most trigger happy of the lot, armed with a burst pistol, one very befitting his personality of opening up fire at any given point, often launching waves of lead when even slightly triggered to do so, which was often as Zaun was always a dangerous place to linger.\n&gt; Tak, the genius of the trio, is also the most unstable. Constantly toying and experimenting with dangerous chemicals and delicate mechanics, all while riding down bumpy hills while being shot at by unhappy clients. His brilliance has allowed him to develop what he calls a &quot;Chem-Lobber&quot;, a bazooka like device that he simply fills up with beakers and shoots at any undesirables.\n&gt; Together the brothers take on any jobs, that being delivery of goods or delivery of death, it doesn&#039;t matter, but one thing is for certain, they&#039;ll do any job, fast, and with style.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Passive: Umi and Tak\n&gt; While Fuji is busy driving their motor-trike, his triplets take care of the shooting.\n&gt; Every first shot, Umi will attack, doing a triple burst of attacks, each dealing only a third of their attack damage with each hit, but every one of these bolts are their own instance of damage, thus meaning that each bolt of this triple burst will apply on hit effects and can crit independently.\n&gt; Every second shot, Tak will launch a vial of mysterious chemicals that deals X% area damage around the initial target, while dealing X magic damage per second for X seconds (scales with level)\n\n.\n\n&gt; Q: Lead Tornado\n&gt; Fuji spins the whole Motor-trike around on the spot, while Umi does a rapid fire of attacks, dealing a burst of X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) to all enemies in an AoE around Fuji. For every enemy hit, Fuji gains X% move speed for X seconds, double bonus speed when hitting champions. If this spell hits an enemy Champion, the cool down is halved\n\n.\n\n&gt; W: Sweet Flip\n&gt; Fuji Accelerates forward at a ridiculous speed. If he hits any unit, he will use them as a ramp and fly through the air, doing a back flip before landing X distance away from where he launched. If he hits an enemy champion with this spell, he will deal X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(X% AP) and slow them by X% for X seconds. If he collides with a wall, he will ricochet off the wall, bouncing in the opposite direction of his initial cast, still able to flip off any unit during his bounce back.\n\n.\n\n&gt; E: Zaunite Molotov\n&gt; Tak throws out an unstable, flaming molotov, that when it hits a target or reaches its maximum range, explodes, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AP) to the initial target, and X% of damage in a large cone behind the detonation. If the molotov hits a target, they are knocked back and slowed by X/X/X/X/X% for X seconds. Killing a unit with Zaunite Molotov will cause that unit to explode, dealing the same damage as the cone blast in a small area around the unit. Enemy champions killed by this will detonate for twice as much damage and twice the blast radius.\n\n.\n\n&gt; R: Speed Lover\n&gt; Tak has developed a special fuel for the Motor-Trike, though no one knows what it is made of, including Tak. Upon activation, Fuji gains X/X/X% movement speed, and is able to pass through units for X/X/X seconds. As Fuji moves, he leaves a trail of flames from his exhaust, that deals X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage per second, the flames lingering for X seconds.\n&gt; When Fuji uses Lead tornado, he will twirl around three times instead of once, the cooldown redudction only proc&#039;ing once per cast.\n&gt; When Fuji uses Sweet Flip, Speed Lover increases the flip distance by X% and the damage by X%\n&gt; When Fuji Uses Zaunite Molotov, the Molotov will deal an additional X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage over time for X seconds.\n&gt; Whenever Fuji gets a kill or assist, he gains an additional X/X/X second(s) of duration to Speed Lover.\n&gt; However, due to the unstable nature of this wonder fuel, when Speed Lover wears off, Fuji is silenced, blinded and slowed by X% for X seconds, while he tries to get the engine to work properly. \n&gt;","replies":[]}
