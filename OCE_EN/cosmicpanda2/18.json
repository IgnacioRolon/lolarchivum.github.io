For Araki, he was just a boy, barely strong enough to even lift a sword or raise a shield. However, deep down in his heart lay a dormant power within his spirit, a power that only emerged in the Noxian invasion of Ionia. As a platoon of soldiers burnt down and slaughtered his village, an officer opened the doors of Araki&#039;s home to find the boy standing there, defiant of his commands to get out and line up with the others. Araki spat in the officer&#039;s face. Not one to take such a grave insult, the officer went to cut down Araki where he stood. The boy did not flinch as the sword came down to slice him, as before it could connect, an ethereal warrior emerged from the boy, and caught the blade. It then proceeded to punch the officer so hard in the face he was sent flying out of the village. Soldiers looked on in terror as they wondered what could have sent their superior such a distance. Their questions were answered when Araki stood before them all, his ally, which he named Blue Justice, hovering above him, knuckles cracked and ready for a fight. Needless to say, Araki&#039;s village was never more bothered by invaders ever again, however, the boy knew that others would be suffering, and so, with Blue Justice at his side, the pair set off to protect all the people of the land, one righteous punch at a time.\r\n\r\nPassive: Blue Justice, the Unbreakable\r\nBlue Justice is the material manifestation of Araki&#039;s spirt, therefore, is bound to the boy and follows his every command. When together, Araki has bonus (X-X Based on level) Armour and Magic Resist, and deals (X% max HP) as bonus physical damage to attacks. When separated, Araki has a X% reduction to AD but gains X% movement speed. All of Araki&#039;s Command Abilities send Blue justice away, and cause all his normal spells to turn into Return Abilities. Because Blue Justice is punching and hitting enemies with these abilities, all Command abilities apply on-hit effects.\r\n\r\nQ:Cracker Volley/Bloody Stream\r\n\r\nCommand: Cracker Volley-\r\nAraki sends out blue justice in a straight line, dashing through and dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage all enemies in his path. He will dash until he either reaches maximum range or collides with an enemy. When he stops dashing, he will break out into a flurry of punches, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage per second for X seconds in a cone in front of him. If this spell hits an enemy champion while Blue justice is dashing, Blue Justice will be facing that enemy champion.\r\n\r\nReturn:Bloody Stream-\r\nBlue justice will travel at immense speed, becoming almost like a dart as he dashes back to Araki, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage to all enemies hit in its path. When returning to Araki, Blue Justice heals him for X%/X%/X%/X% of all damage Araki and Blue Justice have dealt in the last X seconds.\r\n\r\nW: Break Down/ Roundabout\r\n\r\nCommand: Break Down-\r\nAraki gives a shout and Blue Justice flies up into the sky, before crashing back down to the target area, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and knocking up all enemies hit by it, slowing them down by X%/X%/X%/X% for X seconds\r\n\r\nReturn: Roundabout-\r\nBlue Justice sticks out both arms, before spinning around rapidly, making his way back to Araki as spinning tornado, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and knocking pushing them aside along his path. When he returns to Araki, the winds Blue Justice generated linger, granting the pair X%/X%/X%/X% movement speed for X seconds.\r\n\r\nE: Last Train/Standing Proud\r\n\r\nCommand: Last Train-\r\nAraki sends Blue Justice out in a crescent shape, who drifts along the crescent, until he collides with an enemy unit, in which he will grab them and carry them along in the direction of the nearest wall. He carries them for X distance but if he carries them into a wall, they are dealt X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage and are rooted for X/X/X/X seconds. If he fails to connect with a wall, he will instead deal only half damage and slow them by X% for the same duration.\r\n\r\nReturn: Standing Proud-\r\nBlue Justice immediately teleports back to Araki, pushing back all enemies near Araki and shielding Araki for X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) damage for X seconds.\r\n\r\nR: Steam Roller\r\nThis spell can&#039;t be played if Araki doesn&#039;t have Blue Justice. Blue Justice grows to massive size and rampages towards the target area, punching every one in his path, knocking up all enemies hit, dealing X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. When Blue Justice reaches the end of his range, he then turns around and rampages back to the area where he was cast, dealing the same damage and same knock up.","replies":[]}
