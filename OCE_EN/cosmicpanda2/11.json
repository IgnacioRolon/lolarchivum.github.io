But one must wonder, what is it that becomes of the bodies whose souls were so unjustly robbed of? For Corporis, a particularly demented spirit, decided on a plan. A plan to create a body, of bodies, one which would in theory posses the strength greater than any one man, for he would be made up of hundreds. So he set to work, possessing, and binding together, corpses upon corpses, weaving them all by dark magics and sinister incantations he had learnt in life. When it was done, Corporis was a huge, hulking mountain of bodies, whose limbs all wriggled and writhed, but managed to drag whatever appendage they could to walk along the earth. Things seemed successful for Corporis, however, bodies don&#039;t last forever, and he would soon need fresh flesh in order to layer upon his armour of the dead. Those layers in which he did not need, were discarded and became zombies to herald the approach of the Sovereign of the Dead.\r\n\r\nPassive: Supreme Undertaker\r\nZombies: Most of Corporis&#039; abilities spawn a zombie(s). Zombies have (X% of your stats) and last for X seconds. Zombies will prioritise whatever target you are attacking. Although fragile and weak, they make up for this with numbers, and their passive, &quot;Hunger of the Grave&quot;, which makes every attack from the zombies reduce the enemies AD by X% and Armour by X% for X seconds. This amount is increased for every zombie attacking the one target.\r\nCloak of the Dead: whenever Corporis takes X amount of damage, he sheds off a layer of bodies, summoning a zombie. When Corporis dies, he spawns X-X zombies (based on level)\r\n\r\nQ: Corpse Hammer\r\nCorporis rips a corpse of his body and wields it as a weapon. His next attack gains X range, and deals X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% Max HP) physical damage, and roots the target for X seconds. The spell will last for X seconds or until he attacks an enemy. When the spell ends, a zombie will be spawned.\r\n\r\nW: Crypt Cape\r\nCorporis arranges the corpses along his body to form a shield with X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) health. The shield lasts for X seconds. Whenever an enemy in melee range attacks this shield, the corpses will grab them with chilling hands, reducing their attack speed by X/X/X/X% for X seconds. When the shield timer runs out or is destroyed, Corporis spawns X/X/X/X number of zombies.\r\n\r\nE: Cadaver-Pault\r\nCorporis launches a handful of bodies at a target area, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) physical damage. Enemies damaged by this will be slowed by X%/X%/X%/X% for X seconds and for every enemy hit, a zombie will spawn in the area of effect. Double the amount for every enemy champion hit.\r\n\r\nR: Unhallowed Earth\r\nPassive: Every time Corporis kills an enemy, he spawns a zombie. If he kills or assists in killing an enemy champion, he will spawn X/X/X amount of zombies.\r\nActive: Corporis projects a large aura around himself that taints the very land he treads, slowing enemies in the aura by X%, and every second, a zombie will spawn for every enemy there is in the area, spawning X/X/X amount of zombies for every enemy champion. While zombies are standing in unhallowed earth, they gain X%/X%/X% attacks speed and X%/X%/X% movement speed. Unhallowed earth lasts for X/X/X seconds","replies":[]}
