They were a people whose names are forgotten, but their legacy lives on, in the form of their extraordinary devices and inventions. Deep in the heart of this abandoned city lay their most glorious creation. A four armed golem, which stood to magnificent heights, it&#039;s thick stone arms bound together by chains, allowing it to change its arm&#039;s reach by controlling its length of chain. It&#039;s carved face, once of a beautiful prince, has long since been rubbed away by the sand, erasing what little identity he had before the collapse of his empire. When discovered by Piltovian Excavators, he was fearful at first, and unleashed pandemonium in the ancient city. His multiple arms spun around his torso block, thrashing all those approached him. It was only when they subdued him and explained, with aid from a Shuriman elder, the golem was calmed. Repaired and refitted, he was named Asliha and made a guardian of Shurima, preparing him to protect from an invasion that felt near.\r\n\r\nPassive: Shatter Knuckes\r\nEvery fourth basic attack is a powerful Qudra-Punch, dealing X% of the targets Max HP as bonus damage, and knocks them back, reducing their AD by X% for X seconds\r\n\r\nQ: Crushing Grip\r\nAsliha launches out a chain fist in a line, grabbing a hold of the first enemy it hits, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. He holds onto them for X seconds or until they walk out of range. While he is holding onto them, he reduces their armour by X/X/X/X, and grounds them while he holds them, preventing any mobility abilities.\r\n\r\nW: Hammering Fist\r\nAsliha slams an extended arm down a long narrow area, dealing X/X/X/X(+X AD) physical damage. All enemies are damaged are rooted for X/X/X/X seconds, and after that, slowed by X% for X seconds.\r\n\r\nE: Aegis of Arms\r\nPassive: Dealing CC to an enemy champion will give Asliha a X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) shield for X seconds. Applying CC while the shield is active will refresh its duration and it&#039;s health.\r\nActive: All of Asliha&#039;s arms cross over one another, preparing a deadly stance. For the next X seconds, he will be braced, and if an enemy champion auto attacks Asliha while he is braces, he will block the attack and instead, extends out all four arms to punch the attacker, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% Damage Blocked) physical damage, and stuns the enemy. Asliha breaks his stance after the duration or if he has blocked an attack. When he breaks stance he gains X% movement speed for X seconds\r\n\r\nR: Storm of Fists\r\nAsliha&#039;s body grows in size, the very earth and sand raising out of the ground to layer on his body, granting him bonus X/X/X AD, X/X/X Max HP, and X/X/X bonus Armour for X seconds. During the duration, Asliha can reactivate storm of fists, up to four times with a 1 second delay between casts, causing all of Ashliha&#039;s arms to twirl about, dealing X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% targets Max HP) physical damage, and knocks all affected enemies back a medium distance. If an enemy is hit against a wall, they are instead knocked over that all. If an enemy is hit against the edge of the map, they are instead pushed towards their nexus.","replies":[]}
