The souls of the land are tainted and warped, and the whatever appeared living were nothing but vessels to unholy magics.  However, a lone priest of Demacia, Hector, has devoted himself to bring the light to the Shadow isles. However, the land is inhospitable to the living, and most people would be warped alongside the landscape. However, Hector was a devoted Priest, as well as an acolyte raised in Ionia before the Noxian invasion. His order trained him in the arts of manipulating the very life force that courses through all living things, and how to pass it from one being to another, so as to mend wounds and soothe souls. After being taken in at a monastery in Demacia, he learned codes of honour and justice, and when hearing of the tales of the Shadow Isles, he knew that it was his duty as a cleric to bring true life to those murky waters and cleanse the broken land with his healing touch, and smite the evils within it with his burning fist.\r\n\r\nPassive: Resonating Aura\r\nHector&#039;s training in the transfer of life force has allowed all of his attacks to take the life force out of his opponents, their energy flowing from them into all surrounding allies. All of Hector&#039;s basic attacks will heal all allied champions around him, excluding himself, for X-X(based on level). Hector&#039;s strict training has forbidden him to steal life for himself, and thus, all healing from life steal is halved and resonates to all surrounding allies, rather than healing himself.\r\n\r\nQ: Quivering Life-Force Punch\r\nPassive: Whenever Hector damages an enemy, he gains a stack of flow, stacking up to X amount of times. Double the stack gain when damaging an enemy champion. Every stack of Flow gives Hector X% attack speed\r\nActive: Hector dashes towards his target, delivering s punch imbued with gathered life essence. If he is targeting an ally, he heals them for X/X/X/X(+X% AP), increased by X% per stack of Flow, expending all stacks. If he hits an enemy, he deals X/X/X/X(+X% AD) magic damage, and can recast Quivering Life-Force Punch again, but only on allies\r\n\r\nW: Spirit Blast\r\nPassive: Whenever Hector heals an ally, he gains a stack of growth, stacking up to X times. Double the stack gain when healing allied champions. Every stack of Growth grants Hector (X% Max HP) HP regeneration.\r\nActive: Hector blasts the ground around himself, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) magic damage to all enemies hit by the blast, increased by X% for every stack of growth, expending all stacks of growth, and knocks them back, slowing them by X% for X seconds. Allies hit by the blast will be healed for X/X/X/X(+X% AP) HP\r\n\r\nE: Redirecting Current\r\nHector braces himself, palms flying out in a flurry in front of himself for X seconds, countering all damage he receives, drawing power from the enemies&#039; attacks, before sending a cone of energy behind him, healing all allies hit by X/X/X/X(+X% AP)(X% damage absorbed). Hector is immune to CC for the duration.\r\n\r\nR: Untapped Essence\r\nHector delves deep into himself for hidden power, letting forth the massive reserve of life essence within him to be released for a limited time. For X/X/X seconds, the cooldown and mana cost on his Q and W are reduced by X%/X%/X%, his Flow and Growth stack gain is doubled, and landing any of his abilities grant him X/X/X% movement speed for X seconds. Kills and Assists increase the duration by X seconds.","replies":[]}
