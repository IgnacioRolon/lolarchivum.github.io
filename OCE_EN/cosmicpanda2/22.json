A family name shared by those who have sworn to stand watch over the shadow isles, and act as vigils to the graves that inhabit it. When time calls for the Harrowing to arrive, and the spirits of the dead and wicked come calling, it is the Secrum&#039;s that answer the call, by tolling the bells. These bells are enchanted and help ward of the evil, but alas, it is not powerful enough to stop the oncoming darkness entirely. The Harrowing will always happen, but the Secrum&#039;s duty is not to fight the evil, but rather, alert everyone of the coming doom. The bell&#039;s toll so loud the people of Valoran can always hear it faintly ring in there ears. Often, they fall upon deaf ears, but to those who heed their warnings will be those who are the safest from the storm of spirits that is to come.\nThe Secrum bloodline has, however, grown thin, leaving only one living member of the noble watchers, Veronica. Unlike her ancestors, who, in the past, simply tolled the bells and prayed to the gods for sanctuary and for their message to be delivered, Veronica found their efforts to be in vain, as they are rarely heard by the mainland. Instead, she has taken up a blade, and has crafted a belt of bells, whose metal exterior inscribed the very same magics her family Bells have been given, allowing her to carry the magic of her family&#039;s history with her, as she embarks to mainland Rune Terra to confront the evil head on, and to give a voice to her family&#039;s legacy. \n\n\n\nPassive: Resonating Rapier\nVeronica has armed herself with bells not only on her belt, but also all along the length of her blade. Whenever Veronica hits an enemy champion with either an auto attack or ability, the enemy will be struck by bells and their whole body will echo the chime, making the enemy champion give off a visual aura of sound, that can be seen any where on the map, including brush, fog of war, and invisibility. Resonating Rapier lasts for X seconds\n\n\n\nQ: Vigilant Alarm\nVeronica places a bell down at the target area. The bells is visible, but can benefit from brush. When an enemy walks in the AoE of the bell, the magics within the bell awaken, and will fly towards the intruder, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage and slowing them for X% for X seconds. Each level in Vigilant alarm increases the AoE of the bell&#039;s trigger.\nVeronica can only have X/X/X/X number of Vigilant Alarms down on the map. Veronica cannot place a Vigilant Alarm where its radius would overlap with another Vigilant Alarm.\n\n\n\nW: Warding Chime\nVeronica attaches a bell to either herself or a targeted ally champion, granting a X/X/X/X(+X% AP) shield for X seconds. If the shield is struck by an enemy within X range of the person being shielded, the enemy is knocked back and has Resonating Rapier applied to them. Every time the knock back effect is activated, increase the shield&#039;s duration by X seconds, and refresh X% of the shield&#039;s health. Each level in Warding Chime increases the Knock back distance.\n\n\n\nE: Haunting Bells\nVeronica throws a bell at the target enemy. The bell attaches and sticks to them for X/X/X/X seconds. The Haunting bells project an AoE around them, and whenever another enemy with Haunting bells attached to them enters that AoE, both enemies will pulsate a burst of X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage every second while the the Haunting Bell Auras still have another Haunting Bell in its radius. Veronica stores up to X charges of Haunting Bells, which generate every X seconds. Each level in Haunting Bells increases the Haunting Bell aura size.\n\n\n\nR: Guardian Gong\nVeronica throws out the smallest bell she has, which, when landing at the target location, grows to massive size and starts chiming every second. Every time the Guardian Gong chimes, it pulsates in a large AoE a X%/X%/X% movement speed slow and a X%/X%/X% attack speed slow for X seconds. After 3 chimes, the Guardian Gong explodes, dealing X/X/X(X% AP)  -  X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage, the damage reducing for how far away the enemy is from the bell. The Guardian Gong has X/X/X hit points, meaning that if it is struck by X enemy auto attacks, the Guardian Gong is destroyed. Each Level in Guardian Gong Increases the Chime and Blast radius of Guardian Gong","replies":[]}
