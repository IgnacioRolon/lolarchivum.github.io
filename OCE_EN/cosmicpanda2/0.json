{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-07-05T12:35:45.025+0000","title":"Oberon, The Dream Child","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Lore:\n> Oberon comes from no nation, continent, or even dimension known by any of the material plane. Even the void cannot claim responsibility for his existence. He has never truly existed, yet is a constant presence among the world, a drifting, ethereal child, floating along the land, constantly in a state of deep sleep. His stirrings suggest dreams, and powerful ones at that, for wherever he passed, the dreams from his mind seemed to manifest wherever he roams, be it be it a pleasant night time vision, or a hellish nightmare omen. Those who have tried to hunt down the elusive boy have often been found passed out in sweet slumber, or have simply vanished. Though none speak to him, he is constantly found sleep talking, speaking cryptic lines of incoherent and unfathomable verses, many suggesting it being the way his people speak, wherever he hailed from. All that is truly known is that he will drift along, and will keep dreaming, his whole being drawn to nothing but raw power.\n\n.\n\n> Passive: Deep Sleep\n> If Oberon does not move or take damage for X seconds, he beings to gain stacks of Deep Sleep. Each stack grants X bonus spell range, and X% spell amplification, with a maximum of X stacks. Oberon loses all stacks of Deep Sleep if he moves or takes damage. At max stacks, he gains CC immunity. If Oberon were to take damage that would inflict CC, the CC immunity still is applied first before the damage.\n\n\n.\n\n> Q: Sweet Dreams\n> Oberon launches a wave of his most pleasant dreams, blasting a long ranged cone of mystical merriment, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage. All enemies hit by sweet dreams will charmed for X seconds. If targets are feared, Sweet Dreams instead stuns the targets for X seconds. If targets are sleeping, this attack deals X% more damage\n\n.\n\n> W: Yawn\n> Oberon lets out a big yawn, coating a targeted area in a fine vaporous mist at a long range. Enemies caught inside it will be slowed by X/X/X/X% of their movement and attack speed. If the enemy stays inside the mist for X seconds, they will fall asleep for X/X/X/X seconds. Sleeping targets will remain so until end of duration or until they are damaged by an enemy champion.\n\n.\n\n> E: Horrifying Nightmares\n> Oberon shoots in a long narrow range, a jet of dark and twisted visions of the depraved nightmares he suffers, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage to all it touches. All enemies hit by Horrifying nightmares will be feared for X seconds. If targets are charmed, Horrifying nightmares instead knocks them back X distance away. If targets are sleeping, this attack deals X% more damage.\n> \n\n.\n\n> R: Sudden Awakening\n> Oberon severs the dreams that he has inflicted upon his foes, but in doing so, will shatter their psyche. When activated, any enemy with a large area of Oberon, who is affected by Charm, Fear, or Sleep, will have their CC removed, but in turn, be dealt X/X/X(+X% AP). If a target was affected by Charm, they are Disarmed(Blind) for X seconds. If a target was affected by Fear, they are Silenced for X seconds. If the target was asleep, they are stunned for X seconds.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Loughlin","date":"2017-07-30T07:50:41.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, its a bit powerful at a range.
