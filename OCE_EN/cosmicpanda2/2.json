Due to the rising number of assassins from Noxus plaguing the home ground, a special task force was created from the most dexterous and cunning members of Demacia to take down and intercept these would-be hitmen. Although virtuous are the people of Demacia, Venator, the only one of his force remaining, is consumed by a force greater than justice and honor. He is driven by cold-hearted duty to his land and his people, and will forgo his own humanity and honor to preserve the glory of his homeland, by any means necessary to stop any stray dagger or poison slipping into the bodies of those he is sworn to protect. Feared among Noxian Assassins, and Ionian Ninjas, Venator&#039;s whole training and arsenal is all carfully crafted to bring down each and every one of them.\n\nInnate Passive: Disarming Strike\nVenator's attacks and abilities all break and maim his enemies, inflicting a X% AD and AP reduction (Scales with Level) for X seconds. Additional attacks and abilities reset the timer\n\nQ: Crippling Dagger\nVenator throws out a well aimed dagger, which cuts into the target, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. The knife slices into the muscle and bone, causing the enemies to be grounded (exactly like miasma) for X/X/X/X seconds\n\nW: Poised Strike\nPassive: Venator has X/X/X/X% reduction from the next instance of damage from an enemy champion. X/X/X/X Second Cooldown\nActive: Venator readies himself for an incoming attack, blocking the next instance of enemy champion damage (Both ability and/or auto attack). He then leaps towards the enemy he blocked, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% of damage blocked) physical damage to them, and ministuns them, interrupting any channel they might be using\n\nE: Muffling Smoke\nVenator Leaps through the air, and upon landing, releases a large smoke bomb that deals X/X/X/X(+X% AP) per second, slows by X%, and silences and near-sights all enemies caught in the smoke. The smoke lasts for X/X/X/X Seconds\n\nR: Detain\nVenator surges out of the shadows in a line, colliding with the first enemy champion hit, dealing X/X/X(+X% of Enemy AD/AP, Whichever is higher) Physical Damage, thhen carries both Venator and his target further forward, before rooting the enemy champion for X/X/X seconds","replies":[{"poster":"Spiritofryu","date":"2017-01-16T08:16:12.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn you really hate assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-16T08:20:48.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes\nyes i do\nas a mage main, and a fighter main whos lane always gets camped by the mid, i hate assassins","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-16T09:58:44.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was very well thought out. \n\nI don't think it needs critiquing so much as acknowledgement that yes, Venatori would sht on assassins, and probably every other class of champ in League.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-16T10:18:27.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but as you may have guess, unlike most assassins, he actually lacks escape, and his E would most likely have a long cooldown\nso there is that as a bit of a weak point\nbut i thank you for your feedback\ni made Venator in a flash of spite after playing 10 games as a mage in a row laning against an assassin\nThe whole concept focus on the idea of taking everything that you use to expose and exploit an assassin, and throw it all into one champion","replies":[]}]}]}
