This is because of an ancient Void Portal that managed to tear its way through into the physical plane was open long enough for a singular beast to come forth. Muh&#039;Thra. While stranded and alone in this dark cavern, Muh&#039;Thra possessed one great gift. The power to give birth to more voidlings, ones who would strive to survive whatever environment they are born in, and with their mother nearby, they would grow up to be strong, fearsome beasts. Now, biding her time patiently, Muh&#039;Thra is gathering an army of Frost Voidlings in preparation to take over and devour Frejlord. She has, however, now been forced to seek meals that would give great strength to her young so as to ensure that the strongest are born.\n\nInnate Passive: Motherly Embrace\nThe Closest Ally Champion and all non-champion units to Muh&#039;Thra is warmed up by her presence and gains X/X/X/X% Tenacity, as her body exudes out warmth that would normally incubate her eggs. If Muh&#039;Thra is alone, the passive effects herself.\n\nQ: Nurturing Parasite\nMuh&#039;Thra throws out a void larvae, which latches onto the first enemy hit, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) per second, for X seconds, slowing them by X% for the duration. If the target dies or the duration ends, the larvae is returned to Muh&#039;Thra, he can then recast this ability within the next X seconds to throw the larvae at an ally target, having the larvae latch onto and heal them for X/X/X/X(+X% of Damage Dealt) per second for X seconds, slowing them by X% for the duration. If she does not reactivate this ability, she instead heals and slows herself. \n\nW: Nest Invasion\nPassive: All non-champion units surrounding Muh&#039;Thra gain X/X/X/X HP regen\nActive: Muh&#039;Thra spends the next few seconds burrowing and tunneling, before laying her eggs and covering up the burrow, leaving a camouflaged nest, that produces 1/1/2/2 Frost Voidlings every X seconds. The Frost Voidlings last for X/X/X/X seconds, have X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) HP, X/X/X/X(+X% AD) Attack Damage, and inflict a X% movement slow for X seconds, each attack resetting the duration. The nest last forever, but can only have 1 nest at a time and can be destroyed in five hits.\nFrost Voidlings attack the closest enemy Champion, then structure, then minion, in that order of priority.\nFrost Voidlings gain X/X/X/X% Movement Speed when going towards an enemy affected by Nurturing Parasite.\nFrost Voidlings gain X/X/X/X% Attack Speed when attacking enemies affect by Stomach acids.\nFrost Voidlings standing on Feasting Grounds gain X/X/X/X Attack Damage and an X% increase to their slow\n\nE: Stomach Acids\nMuh&#039;Thra vomits up void-goo from her guts, to soften up any potential meals for her young. The goo coats all enemies in a line, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage per second for X/X/X/X seconds, while also reducing their armor by X/X/X/X for the duration. The attack leaves a path that slows enemies who walk on the path by X% and lasts for X seconds.\n\nR: Feasting Grounds\nMuh&#039;Thra turns a large area into a network of tunnels and burrows for X/X/X seconds. Every X seconds, X/X/X Frost Voidlings are born per enemy champion standing on the Feasting Grounds. Any Enemy Champion who dies on the feasting ground heals every nearby unit for X% of their maximum HP. Any enemy who walks into the feasting ground cannot walk out, but can teleport, flash, or dash their way out.","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-17T10:14:21.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What he's saying is that it doesn't capture anyones interest. Thematically and conceptually it borrows too much from other champions. Too be honest, with 130 champs out its hard not to see similarities.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-19T09:16:07.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i meant how is Muh'Thra like Rek'Sai?\ni assume he was talking more so kit or story or something\nthe only thing they have in common is they both dig holes and burrows\nbut Muh'Thra uses her ones for summoning while Rek'Sai uses it for mobility","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-01-17T08:26:16.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too similar to rek'sai..","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-17T09:33:49.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean?","replies":[]}]}]}
