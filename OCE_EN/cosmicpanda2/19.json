Johannes, when he was just an aspiring squire, was completely committed to the order, after being rescued from a young age by Iron Solari Knights. Ever since then, he had been training, reading, fighting and preaching every waking hour, hoping to someday prove himself as worthy to the glorious sun. The day came when a meteor crashed from the sky, and left a golden crystal in the crater. Being the first one to investigate the crater, Johannes had lifted the crystal, and then felt his body be lifted along with it. The gem had shone brightly and when the other knights of Solari arrived, they watched in awe as Johannes wielding what looked like a miniature ray of sunlight. The crystals seemed to resonate with him, as when others tried to wield it, they lay dull in their hands. It was decided then that Johannes was their true owner, and the crystal were cut and refined, before being fitted into a pair of fine steel gauntlets. Armed with these new powers, Johannes was soon elevated to the rank of Crusader, and with the power of his righteousness, he sought to carry out his crusade across Valoran.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPassive: Righteous Fervour\r\nWhenever Johannes damages an enemy with an ability or attack, he fills his fervour bar, which stacks up to a max of X. Champion Kills and Assists give X additional fervour.\r\nJohannes gains X% attack speed for every X fervour he has.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQ: Ave Solaris\r\nToggle ability. When toggled on, Johannes gains X%/X%/X%/X%/X% movement speed and can pass through units and over terrain. When moving towards enemy champions, he gains an additional X% movement speed. While toggled on, it drains X fervour per second. X second cooldown when toggled off.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nW: Deus Bolt\r\nPassive: Johannes attacks deal bonus X/X/X/X/X magic damage per X fervour.\r\nActive: Johannes launches an massive bolt of energy, consuming all his Fervour and sending out a ball of faith, that damages all enemies in a straight line, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(X% AP) magic damage, increasing by X% for every X stack of Fervour consumed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nE: Blazing Crusade\r\nJohannes dashes forward, blasting everything in his path, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% AP) magic damage to all enemies caught in his path. For every enemy hit, the dash distance is increased by X, double that distance when hitting an enemy champion. Blazing Crusade can be recast within the next X seconds at the cost of X fervour. This can be done up to a max of X times, the fervour cost increasing by X% each time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: Non Nobis Domination\r\nPassive: Basic attacks and abilities generate X/X/X bonus fervour for every enemy hit, and kills and assists grant an extra X/X/X amount of fervour.\r\nActive: at the cost of X% of Johanne&#039;s Max Fervour, he creates an illusion of himself that last for X/X/X seconds. The illusion will mimic all of Johanne&#039;s attacks and abilities, but receive X% of incoming damage, and deal only X% of the damage. Johannes can summon any number of illusions but each cost X% more for every illusion Johannes currently has. Illusion attacks and abilities do not generate Fervour but kills and assists do. Illusions cannot be controlled directly, but they will do every action Johannes does","replies":[]}
