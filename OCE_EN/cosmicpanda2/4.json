An unyielding soldier who was nothing more than a banner bearer, Zachariah pushed beyond all. Through the marshes, deserts, badlands and fields, his feet unyielding to the exhaustion and fatigue, carrying aloft his proud banner, shouting and screaming at all who passed him the glory of Noxus. His voice, though hoarse from his years of preaching, carried a force that made allies feel filled with vigor, and enemies filled with dread, for if the harsh elements and the haze of battle couldn&#039;t stop the march of Zachariah, what could. Armor broken and clothes torn, he never stops his march as he remains determined to preach to his foes the pride he holds for his homeland, and to reassure those of his allies who have lost faith.\n\nInnate Passive: Noxian Pride\nThe banner Zachariah carries projects an aura that grants nearby allies X% Movement Speed and X% Attack Speed, while reducing enemy Movement speed by X% and Attack Speed by X% (Scales with level)\n\nQ: Screeching Resolve\nPassive: X/X/X/X% Tenacity\nActive: Zachariah screams at the top of his lungs to encourage nearby allies to be strong, granting a X/X/X/X(+X% AP) Shield for X seconds. While the shield is active, it grants X/X/X/X Bonus Attack Damage\n\nW: Fear-Mongering Cry\nPassive: X/X/X/X% movement speed when moving towards an enemy\nActive: Zachariah gives a blood-curdling scream as he induces dread to all enemies in a cone in front of him, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage and fearing all enemies for X/X/X/X seconds\n\nE: For Noxus!\nPassive: X/X/X/X% damage reduction from enemy auto attacks\nActive: Zachariah Charges at the enemy, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) Physical Damage, slowing the target by X% for X seconds and leaves a path behind him, granting X/X/X/X Movement speed and X/X/X/X Armor and Magic Resistance. The trail last for X seconds\n\nR: Martyrdom\nPassive: Upon Death, Zachariah gives his final shout of pride, then after the delay, he detonates, dealing X/X/X(+X%AP)\nActive: Zachariah gives a mocking scream, taunting all nearby enemies in the medium sized area for X/X/X seconds, while giving himself X/X/X% Movement speed and X/X/X% Attack Speed for the duration","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-01-15T23:32:07.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to have this champ in lol, it's really different from other champs. He would be a nice support and I'd imagine him as a cross between jarvan and darius. I think the passive on r should be removed while the r is on cooldown though. I think he also needs to have a damaging ability tho, maybe replace e with this?\nE: FOR NOXUS!!!!\nZachariah charges towards a selected enemy then leaves a path behind him that deals x/x/x/x physical damage and making allies gain x/x/x/x/% of their movement speed. \nAnd the r should have a timer before it detonates. Enough time for them to flash out, but not enough for them to walk out with boots.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-16T04:35:52.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, that's pretty good\nAlso, the passive on the R, i was thinking of it being a delay, as he shouts something like \"NOXUS FOREVER\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-01-16T10:13:36.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Voice: Matt Mercer :) or Travis Willingham","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-16T10:23:10.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm... both gruff yet interesting voices\ni like it\nI was actually thinking of something more along the lines of Michael Dobson with a screaming, preacher voice like in Dawn of War when played the psycher\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpmiq8sTH0k","replies":[]}]}]}
