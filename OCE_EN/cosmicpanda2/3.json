He was a rogue that shifts along the sand dunes, and when he sees his chance, dives straight through his targets, not giving them even a chance to react before he has already sliced through them. Even the most armoured foes cannot withstand his blades, his attacks almost like sand, being able to slip under the plates of any metal and seep through even the smallest of cracks, his puncturing blades able to always find a break point. His greatest feat, however was his ability to rush in, and when cornered, fade away into the desert, a whole flurry of mirages covering his tracks as he fades from existence.\r\n\r\nPassive: Sanded Edge\r\nWhen Iibra critical strikes, be does not receive any bonus damage. Instead, all the damage is converted to True Damage. Additionally, Iibra takes time and patience before every crit, meaning that he has an X% reduction to Bonus Crit chance.\r\n\r\nQ: Dust Dash\r\nIibra fades into the sands, becoming un-targetable while he dashes towards the target location. He deals X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage to all enemies he passes through. Dust Dash can Crit. If Iibra crits with Dust Dash, he gains a Cooldown refresh. If he crits with any other abilities, X second cool down refresh to Dust Dash.\r\n\r\nW: Crippling Daggers\r\nIibra throws out threw knives in a cone shape, each one dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and slows the enemy by X% for X seconds. Crippling Daggers can Crit. If Crippling Daggers Crits, the slow is doubled\r\n\r\nE: Mirage Copy\r\nIibra spawns a replica of himself, which deals 0% of his damage, but takes the same amount he would. The replica lasts for X/X/X/X seconds. Every time Iibra lands a Crit, his replica will spawn another replica. Iibra can only have up to X/X/X/X replicas. These replicas will only spawn if there is at least one replica alive.\r\n\r\nR: Dangerous Sands\r\nIibra becomes invisible for X/X/X seconds. While invisible he gains X% movement speed. If he attacks or uses an ability while invisible. It will deal X%/X%/X% of the targets max health as bonus physical damage. If Iibra crits while invisible, he will not break invisibility.","replies":[{"poster":"Olliynx","date":"2017-10-02T15:09:23.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always thought it'd be cool to have a sand based assassin!
