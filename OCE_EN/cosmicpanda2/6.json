The bouncing attack will deal X-X(based on level)(+X% AP) bonus magi damage to the first target it hits.\r\n\r\nQ: Power Igniting Nitro Ball\r\nWalter launches a powerful magic orb, that bounces off of walls, and will only stop bouncing when it hits a target. The orb deals X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage. The damage is increased by X% each bounce, up to a maximum of X%\r\n\r\nW: Metal Sphere Sprint\r\nWalter dashes in the target direction, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage to all enemies hit in his path. If Walter hits a wall, he will bounce off that wall in a direction based on the angle of collision. Walter can bounce up to X/X/X/X times. Walter gains X/X/X/X% move speed per bounce for X seconds\r\n\r\nE: Gelatinous Utility Matter Sphere\r\nWalter launches six Spheres in random directions all around him, each going in a straight line. These spheres can bounce off of walls up to X times each. When colliding with an enemy, they explode, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) in a small AoE and leave behind a blob of jelly that slows enemies in it by X/X/X/X% for X seconds. The blob lasts X seconds. The spheres will explode after bouncing their maximum amount.\r\n\r\nR: Spiritually Telepathic Ray of Kinetic Energy\r\nWalter channels a singular blast of magic into an enemy, dealing X/X/X(+X%) magic damage and sending them flying back, knocking up all enemies in the air, dealing the same damage. If the target hits a wall, they will bounce based on the angle of collision, and be dealt the initial damage. The target will bounce up to X/X/X amount of times. If the target dies during the bouncing, then a orb will take their place and continue bouncing and knocking up enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2017-12-13T12:08:47.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And his favorite food is Pi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2017-12-10T08:23:11.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHAHA accronym: stroke, OI USE YOUR STROKE","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-12-13T10:12:31.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah...\nI didn't think the o would have been included since most of the time people dont include of...\nin hindsight... mistakes were made XD","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-12-13T10:13:05.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i meant for it to be Strke and for people to sort of get the bowling reference but...\nshit that cant be unseen... god damn it...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-07T06:33:17.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems cool, but maybe rename some of the abilities.
