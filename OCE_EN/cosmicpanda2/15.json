Little does the swordsman know that the true killer has been in Ionia all this time. Conshi, a demon who covers the power of the wind, seeks to be the sole practitioner of the art, and thus, sought out a way to destroy Yasuo, that being to first have him isolated, then weakened by his torments of solitude. Little did the Shogun expect was for Yasuo to become stronger from his trials and experiences. Although aggravated by the Warriors persistence, he saw this as an opportunity to do battle with a challenger worthy of his skills, for it takes immense talent to rouse Conshi&#039;s attention from his cloud in the sky, and to have descend upon the earth and walk amongst the terrestrials. He know seeks to confront the lone swordsman, to finish what he had started all those years ago, and prove himself to to be the one and only master of the winds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPassive: Way of the Warlord\r\nFor every second Conshi is in combat, he gains X-X%(based on level) damage reduction, up to a max of X-X%(based on level)\r\nWhen Conshi moves about or uses an ability, he generates Tempest. At max Tempest, his next Basic Attack will Crit for X-X%(based on level) and knock the target back.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQ: Kami Gust\r\nConshi slashes his sword down, sending a thin blade of wind out in front of him, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. Landing Kami Gust against an enemy grants you a stack of Gust. If you cast Kami Gust with 1 stack of Gust, Conshi will dash forward before slashing across, launching a crescent blade of wind which deals X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. Upon casting Kami Gust with 2 stacks of Gust, Conshi will leap into the air, becoming untargettable for X seconds, before crashing to the ground, sending a massive wave of wind in front of him, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage, and consumes all stacks of Gust.\r\nKami Gust can proc Demonic Tempest.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nW: Cyclone Cloak\r\nConshi coats himself in ominous winds, which for the next X/X/X/X/X seconds, negates all Melee forms of damage, causes the attackers to be knocked back X/X/X/X/X units.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nE: Storm Blink\r\nConshi blinks onto a target enemy, slashing about on entry, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage. An enemy cannot be blinked on more than once every X seconds. If you cast Storm Blink with two stacks of Gust, you will blink above the enemy, untargettable for X seconds before crashing down, dealing X/X/X/X/X(+X% AD) physical damage to all enemies around him, and consumes all stacks of Gust.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: Yokai Hurricane\r\nCan only be cast if Conshi is in mid air.\r\nConshi descends to the earth, accompanied by accursed winds infested with demons. When he hits the ground, the winds start to create a massive Hurricane for X seconds, getting larger every second. All enemies that come into contact with Yokai Hurricane are dragged inside. After X seconds, Conshi delivers one massive blow, which deals X/X/X(+X% AD) to all units caught inside the Hurricane, and launches them in the direction of Conshi&#039;s choosing during the Hurricane&#039;s build up. After casting, Conshi gains maximum Tempest.","replies":[]}
