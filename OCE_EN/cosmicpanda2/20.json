However, as Diana discovered, the ancient ways of praising the moon were eradicated. But by whom? The Iron Solari of course condoned and supported the act, but who carried out the deed? It was the order of the Pure Flame, a splinter cult that came to being after the Iron Solari were established. Considered fanatical and unstable, they were looked down on by their more &quot;noble&quot; sun worshippers. They did, however, come in handy in regards to the disposal of heresy. The bloody thirsty zealots of the Pure Flame loyally worship the sun above all else, to the extreme that they will gladly carry out any mission to eradicate the worship of any deity. One among their numbers, considered to be the most aspiring and pious of them all, was Tabitha. Even from a young age she showed promise, purposely branding her own hands on the hot steel of the cult&#039;s emblem to prove her loyalty to the cause, quickly letting her rise up through the ranks. While most warriors of Targon are known for traditional weaponry, the cultists of Pure Flame constantly sought out weapons capable of putting the wrath of the sun into their mortal hands. It was to that end, that Tabitha was the first to be gifted a very peculiar weapon. From the labs of Zaun, and blessed by the priests Pure Flame, she wields a flamethrower named &quot;Faith&quot;. It is fuelled by holy fervour and hatred for the heretics. It is by her hand that thousands burn in the night, all victims of their own worship.\n\n---\n\nPassive: &quot;Faith&quot;\nTabitha&#039;s holy flamethrower doesn&#039;t attack like normal. Instead, auto attack enemies will cause her to fire a continual line of fire in a short distance, damage the first enemy it comes into contact with, dealing X% of her AD every 0.5 seconds, dealing 50% magical and 50% physical damage, each instance of damage dealing on hit effects. \n\n&quot;Faith&quot; cannot Crit and attack speed does not increase the rate of damage.\nWhenever Tabitha kills and enemy unit, she gains X Attack Damage for X seconds and can stack. This bonus is tripled against enemy Champions.\n\nAttacking the same target will grant you X% Movement speed which increases by X% for every second you keep attacking them, up to a max of X seconds. X% of Critical Hit Chance is add to bonus AD.\n\nTabitha uses \"Fuel\" as her resource. Her auto attacks expend X fuel per second of fire. If she runs out of fuel, she has to reload for X seconds. X% of Bonus Attack Speed is converted into extra fuel.\n\n---\n\nQ: Fanned Fury\nTabitha adjusts the release valves on her flamethrower, causing the jet of flame from &quot;faith&quot; to become a large cone for X seconds. This damaging cone deals bonus X/X/X/X(+X% of Enemies Max HP) magic damage per second. Toggling this ability on will cause your auto attacks to consume double the fuel cost per second of attack.\n\n---\n\nW: Flame Cloak\nUsing one of the Pure Flame&#039;s Holy Relics, Tabitha coats her self in flames. She gains a X/X/X/X(+X% Max HP) shield for X seconds. While she has the shield up, all surrounding enemies are dealt X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% AP) true damage per second. Enemies who attack the shield within that aura of damage have their Attack Damage Reduced by X%/X%/X%/X% for X seconds.\n\n---\n\nE: Purging Fire\nTabitha ramps up the heat to her &quot;faith&quot;, causing her to shoot one long continual stream of white hot flames in a straight line in front of her. It deals X/X/X/X(+X% AP)(+X% AD) damage per second to all enemies caught in the stream of fire, 50% being magical and 50% being physical. During this duration, Tabitha cannot Auto Attack and is Slowed by X%.\nEnemies hit by Purging Flames will have all healing reduced by X% for X seconds, increasing by X% based on missing enemy health.\nThis Ability consumes 50% of Tabitha's Current Fuel. For every X fuel consumed, that is 1 second of Purging Fire's Duration.\n\n---\n\nR: Ascension through Immolation\nTabitha breaks the gas valves attached to her Flamethrower, causing her entire body to be wrapped in flames. From both fire and faith she transcends into a fiery Angel, sprouting two massive wings of flame. For the next X/X/X seconds, she has unlimited fuel usage, she gains X%/X%/X% movement speed, while also gaining the ability to pass through units and fly over terrain. Throughout the duration, Tabitha&#039;s ascension isn&#039;t without a price, as she produces and aura that deals X/X/X(+X% Target&#039;s Max HP) magic damage to all enemies around her, and deals the same amount as true damage to herself.\nIf Tabitha does during the duration of this spell, she will be able to cast in the next few seconds Zealous Overdrive.\n\nZealous Overdrive:\nTabitha's spirit will take her body to the air, then cause it to plummet to the ground, detonating herself into a fiery ball of fervent fury, dealing X/X/X(+X% AP)(+X% AD) damage to all enemies near where she crashed, dealing X% to all enemies directly under her. 50% of this damage is Magical, and the other  50% is Physical.","replies":[]}
