While Shurima now currently lacks in vital metals, the Muedan are resourceful and often salvage whatever lost travelers leave on their bodies as they collapse in the deserts. Using both hot sand fiery breath, the Muedan breakdown the equpiment into raw metals, to be used for later purposes.\n> Hetfield was the most skilled of all his kind, able to go as far as to bind the metal and sand he worked with to turn his scales into a vast array of metal blades and plates, making his whole body fierce and tough. He was, however, ambitious, and left his people and his homeland, in search of metals and minerals that would refine himself as a his own walking weapon and armory.\n\n.\n\n> Innate Passive: Living Armor {{item:3191}} \n> Hetfield&#039;s armor is embedded into his very scales, converting X% of Armour into Maximum HP, and X% of Maximum HP into Armor (Does not scale with bonus armor or HP granted by this passive)\n\n.\n\n> Q: Breakdown {{summoner:11}} \n> Passive: All basic attacks against an enemy champion steals 1/2/3/4 armor for 3 seconds\n> Active: Hetfield leaps forward, bringing down his mighty hammer in a line, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AD)(+X% Armor) Physical Damage to all enemies in its wake, and steals X/X/X/X armor from every enemy hit for X/X/X/X seconds\n\n.\n\n> W: Shrapnel Carapace {{item:3075}} \n> Passive: Killing 5 creeps grants 1 armour, killing a cannon or large monster grants 2 armour, champion kills and assists grant 5 armor, and epic monster kills grants 7 armor. Permanent stacks\n> Active: Hetfield Absorbs all nearby enemies, stealing X/X/X/X% of their armor, and giving it to him for X/X/X/X seconds. Additionally, he gains a X/X/X/X(+X% of Armour) Shield for X/X/X/X seconds, and when the shield either ends or is destroyed, it detonates and deals X/X/X/X(+X% Armor)(+X% AD) physical damage to all nearby enemies\n\n.\n\n> E: Forge Master&#039;s Fire {{item:3634}} \n> Hetfield releases a cone of fire from his mouth, dealing X/X/X/X(+X% AP) magic damage, melting their equipment, reducing enemy armor and attack damage by X/X/X/X% for X/X/X/X Seconds, slowing them down by X% for the duration\n\n.\n\n> R: Full Metal Fury {{item:3084}} \n> Hetfield achieves the highest state of his art, completely coating himself in metal, granting him X/X/X bonus armor, and converts 100% of his armor into Attack Damage, for X/X/X seconds.
