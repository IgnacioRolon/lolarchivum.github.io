They then appeared to leave and were soon replaced by another player. However, after reading through some of the chat, the player that appeared to leave was still able to chat to us and was oblivious to how he was invisible to us.   They couldn't see the new person that had joined and they disappeared when we got in game.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or something because I don't even know.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2014-11-28T11:08:44.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so did you get the 6 man team? o.O?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-11-30T06:33:11.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you donate me rp gift ;3","replies":[]}]}
