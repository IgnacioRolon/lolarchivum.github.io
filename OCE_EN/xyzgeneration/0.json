Just to create a nice and friendly atmosphere for the other players in game. \n\nEarlier toady, I am sitting on my last Milestone before level 1 Honour level, but after one game where I try to justify to my teammate that I am not a troll. I was then put back to Dishonourable with my rewards rights revoked and was penalised with a Chat Restriction. I would like to get some insights on how I can appeal to this, because I personally don&#039;t think I was being abusive or toxic to any other players. In the end I am the one getting penalised while the other person walks freely ruining games for other fellow players.\n\n(P.s. I have tried getting a ticket but it says I have to log in despite being logged in)  \n(P.p.s. Is playing Lux Support = Trolling? I feel judge upon and constantly fed negativity just because I play a champion I am comfortable with, if he told me not too before the game started I would've not play Lux, but the fact that nothing was mentioned and he was so toxic throughout the game)\n\nSincerely,\nXyZGeneration.\n\nGame 1\nXyZGeneration: Kass why are you ranting so much early on in\nXyZGeneration: not my fault someone got caught out\nXyZGeneration: Lux could totally be useless?\nXyZGeneration: Be quiet please, so toxic.\nXyZGeneration: Game haven&#039;t even started and Kass is already calling others useless\nXyZGeneration: So tilting\nXyZGeneration: Report Kassadin for Verbal abusive please\nXyZGeneration: Yea, so toxic early on\nXyZGeneration: Toxic teammate tilts hard bro\nXyZGeneration: I haven&#039;t done anything and she is calling me a troll? What?\nXyZGeneration: Naa, not inting\nXyZGeneration: You just caught me out\nXyZGeneration: And Kass didn&#039;t help\nXyZGeneration: If Lux support is a troll, then Kass please go support, I dont wanna be a troll\nXyZGeneration: I didn&#039;t know in bronze ELO it&#039;s a troll meta\nXyZGeneration: For doing what? You were so toxic before game even started\nXyZGeneration: Jinx got caught in jungle, I got blame\nXyZGeneration: You judge too early bro\nXyZGeneration: I want to climb too\nXyZGeneration: Just cause I play Lux, doesn&#039;t mean I am a troll\nXyZGeneration: Have never seen such toxic person\nXyZGeneration: I dont care what kinda Lux you played with in the past, but your behaviour is totally unacceptable Kass, too toxic\nXyZGeneration: Start ranting at 3mins calling me useless?\nXyZGeneration: Ward what bush when they are all visible? All you need to do is run","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-23T07:57:56.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login for the support page and the website (boards) are seperate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}
