He stated that you are given a grade based on your performance when compared to how well others have played the champion that you have that are a similar rank to you. What this means in your case is you are being compared to other people in your elo that have also played Yasuo and how well they have gone. \n\nNow in the post Socrates didn't go over a lot of detail on how specifically the grade is calculated. The reason being is that we don't want people to farm for specific stats like CS and K/D/A instead of focusing on winning the game. However he did reveal that the stats that are considered when giving you a grade are those associated with winning the game and I quote.\n\n> \"However, the variables are fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winning.\" - Riot Socrates\n\nWith this in mind we can begin to speculate what stats are included in giving you the grade that you get. **Keep in mind that anything from here on out is not confirmed by Riot but is instead speculation by the community. So treat it as such, do your own research and see what works best for you with your own opinions on how it works.**\n\nThe first and most obvious thing that majority of people talk about is CS score and K/D/A these stats are what could be the most easily compared to other people from your rank playing the same champion that you were. Though if you took the K/D/A & CS from a game that was 40 minutes long compared to a game that is 20 minutes long the stats would be completely different as more minions would have been able to have been farmed in the time frame of the game along with more opportunity for kills. With this in mind the game length is something also to consider as to how these stats would be divided up. These are things to keep in mind when thinking about the rank that you get and understanding why you got the rank that you did, but I personally think that there might be more to it than that.\n\nYou might have noticed that when Socrates talked about what influences grades he talked about things that are \"Fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winning\". With some speculation we can also include objectives such as towers, dragons and barons to the stats that could be kept track of and included in the formula for your grade.\n\nOne thing that players often point out that you can do to get an easy grade is to play a role that the champion isn't often played as. The reason for this is if you played Annie in the mid lane you would be expected to get a lot more gold from kills and CS then to if you were to play Annie support and you would expect this to be accounted for. Though this is something I would recommend being careful when doing as there are roles that champions are not supposed to be played in for a reason and you might come out as someone who is trolling to other people.\n\nThe last bit of speculation I have is one of personal opinion. When you first start to play a champion you would think that the system might give you a bit of lee way with how well you can do to get the grades that you want to. Going 8-1 on a champion that you have played for 2-3 times might give you a higher grade than going 8-1 on a champion that you have played many games on and might even be your main. This is something that I have noticed in person experience when doing well on champions that I have not played a lot but again is personal speculation. This might be what you are experiencing though with the two games that you described.\n\nWith all of this in mind and a lot of speculation out of the way, keep going mate and you will get there. Do some experimenting and see what works best for you.\nGood luck out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-10-28T12:26:51.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 word CS, also it's based on overall statistics of players in your ELO or just in general, not Riots fault","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-28T07:10:53.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">i remember in one game i wentt 19/2 and got a s-\n\nInteresting cause i couldn't find that game, so unless your talking about a non-yas game (which doesn't apply as different champions have different requirements for an S.) then your not actually using an actual game.\n\nThat said it's very possible that your 7.3 CS a minute is partially why you got that S, seen as it was a short game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-28T00:16:24.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably due to factors such as gamelength, cs, warding, pinks destroyed, towers taken, assists. Also kda wise 12-1 would have a higher average percentile than 19-2 since yasou is a champion where the average kills is probably pretty high and the standard deviation for kills is probably quite large. Whereas the deaths average would probably also be pretty high but the death sd would be very low. Hence the 1 less death would improve your z-score percentile much more than the 7 kills would. Basically being below the average death count is more important than being above the average kill count for a snowbally hyper carry champion like yasou.\n\nStatistical Analysis!","replies":[]}]}
