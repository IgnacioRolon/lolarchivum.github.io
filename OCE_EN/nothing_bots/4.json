Either way, magic doesn't seem to play a part in the PROJECT: Skin line.\n\nMagical beings seem to be made into 'Battlecast' instead, (and PROJECT: Katarina's splash art, hints that PROJECT: and Battlecast, are from the same universe.)\n\nThe PROJECT: Skins all have things that join them together in their theme:\nHair turned white\nHuman\nNeon Tech\nArtifical/Cybernetic skin\nClean digital particles \nAdvanced versions of old weaponry\nnon magic\nPROJECT: Initiates, are either power-hungry, and obey the enemy to obtain it (Zed/Katarina). Or they are striving to live out their lives in peace and come to grip with who they once were.\n\nAzir doesn't fit much of that at all.\nHe has no hair to turn white\nhe isn't human\nhe has no skin. (and what skin he has is covered in feathers)\nhe has no weaponry to upgrade (and its pretty hard to upgrade something thats made of magic)\nhe is magical \nand he is neither power-hungry (he already has all the power he needs) or trying to live out his life in peace (bringing back an empire is not en every day task)\n\nHowever the Battlecast skins have these in common:\nSemi-human or monster \ncomprised of machines\nmessy fire/oil particle effects \nbuilt in weaponry \nrobots\nmagical and non magical\nBattlecast members seek only to unify the world and make it stronger by upgrading it.\n\nAll of that fits Azir's profile much more than PROJECT:, even the Battlecast goal is more similar to his own than the PROJECT: one\n\n\nSo its unlikely that Azir or any magic user will get a PROJECT: Skin. But from the way you describe it (Robots and metallic and stuff) it sounds more Battlecast anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Nothing bots","date":"2016-08-04T04:13:22.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol kk ill change the tiltle :D","replies":[]}]}]}
