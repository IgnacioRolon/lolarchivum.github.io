Solution I found that worked was to manually set your DNS address, or to use a VPN.\n\nVPN is relatively easy to set up, for programs do everything automatically for you, though most are commercialised and put ads in your browser. Manually setting up your DNS is complicated but you can do it using the tools that came with Windows.\n\nTo do that, go into Control Panel>Network and Internet>Network and Sharing Center(re if you're using the superior language pack)>Change adapter settings. Locate your current internet adapter (the one that is active) and go into its properties. In the list of the window that appears, scroll to the bottom and select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). Click on Properties and you'll finally get to the DNS address. Change it from \"Obtain DNS server address automatically\" to \"Use the following DNS server addresses:\", and set the Preffered address to 8.8.8.8 and Alternate to 8.8.4.4.\n\nJust be warned, doing this could stuff up other programs that connect to the internet, so be prepared to set these setting back to their defaults. Hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
