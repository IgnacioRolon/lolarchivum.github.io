The more you play it, the better you should be able to counter it. However getting mastery 5 on all champions kind of defeats this as you aren't focusing on a handful so you have a broader knowledge base with less depth (unless you are playing an obscene amount of games). To be honest, some of the best mechanical learnings I have gained have come from watching LCS games over the years. Especially listening to analysts who know in depth knowledge about specific interactions (ie. you can qss a malphite R then flash whilst still in the air to avoid extra damage from his E and autos)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maoi","date":"2018-01-03T18:12:28.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery 5 on every champion would be a huge waste of time. \n\nYou really only need to play a champion once to develop a decent understanding. \n\nIf you want to learn a champion try it out in a custom.

But I'll tell you this getting level 5 on every champion can be very helpful giving you good outlooks on every champs play style and mechanics. But getting a level on a cahmp doesn't help your ranked. Your ingame knowledge and understand on what to do in certain situations and the ability to adapt to those situations is what will make you a better player.","replies":[{"poster":"lolHarV","date":"2018-01-03T05:34:39.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Exactly what I meant, just wanted to know if it would help my ranked","replies":[{"poster":"a grub","date":"2018-01-03T18:26:13.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"i totally agree, you couldn't be any more right!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
