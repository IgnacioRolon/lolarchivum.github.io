Bitch....I made it from Bronze 4 to Gold V playing {{champion:268}}  Lee Sin just doesn&#039;t work for this elo, so i normally pick {{champion:56}} or {{champion:19}} both amazing/broken champs you could ever play. I switch between crit an Lethal Noc, 1 shot wonder, an usually pick Warwick if a tank is needed. I pick {{champion:75}} If I really want to tryhard, usually destroying top lane an winning late, but completely understanding if the rest of us feed. {{champion:412}} Is my support pick if I get auto filled, do all I can to keep the team alive. Not much to say about him.. {{champion:119}} was my hard stuck bronze 1 champion, won games, lost games, couldnt escape from that hell because of my toxicity, So I started maining {{champion:75}}.\r\n{{champion:64}} Is my favourite jungle/all around champion, doesn&#039;t get boring, I usually get really fed whilst playing him, mainly play norms with him, since lee Gold Elo is pointless......Thanks for reading this...&quot;help&quot;........&quot;me&quot; \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"gangsha1ger","date":"2018-01-01T00:12:36.903+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are layers upon layers of things that higher tiers understand better than lower ones. So if you are truly wanting to climb, here are my tips.\n\n1) Play more, and play consistently... you don't have a single champion that you played 30+ games on in Season 7\n2) Main one role and have a backup role and play those consistently. **Don't deviate from these roles**, even when things are going badly. This is your learning phase. Looking at your op.gg, stick with two champions for the roles. For example. learn Nasus and Gnar top, while having Azir and Annie mid, or Warwick and Nocturne in the jungle. But don't main three roles, choose only two.\n3) Use Thresh/Annie for support, in case you get autofilled to support.\n4) Play Lee Sin in normals but not in ranked. Lee Sin is one of a couple of champions (twisted fate, yasuo) that players need to have greater macro understanding than their opponents for him to be successful, and not just be good at the champion.\n5) Don't play normals, play ranked.\n6) When you reach Diamond 2, then the real game begins. You will understand what I mean when you get there.\n\nGood Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"lolHarV","date":"2018-01-01T01:14:14.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-12-31T23:03:17.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Play starcraft 2, the game where natural development is visible in your rank.\n\nI am gold 3 in league after 5+ years dedicating myself to learning it inside and out and making it my goal to play professionally with over 6000 ranked games played.\n\nAfter 1 year dedicated myself to starcraft 2 and STEADILY CLIMBED to reach masters.","replies":[{"poster":"lolHarV","date":"2018-01-01T01:15:21.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did try playing starcraft 2, I got really into it, had good apm an knew wat to do an when to do so, mained terran, great game, but dont think that stage has happened to me yet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Doublehit","date":"2018-01-06T08:43:28.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, for a guy who was hardstuck silver for alot of seasons and ended up 80lp Gold 1 at the end of this season, probably the biggest thing for me was game knowledge. there are easy as champs such as Xin for example that are good for ranked right now and allow u to focus on the map alot more rather than your game mechanics.  A few other things \n\n1. Pick 2 roles and main them. Learn every aspect of the roles you enjoy and don't  just play a different lane every game. ( and champ) \n2. Watching streams on twitch can help if u really focus on what they are doing and you if  think about why they are doing it and why it makes sense. \n3. In my opinion your champion pool probably needs to be smaller, yes have some champions you're okay at if u really need to fill but try and get your main \nroles every game and yeah azir you should probably stick away from you might of gotten that far with him but the skill level changes after silver 1 i would say. \n4.  Be a meta slave. their is an argument that if u are really good at just say riven for example you can climb being a 1 trick which is true, but for me i found sticking to the meta and actually knowing the champs is how i climbed for example Sej Xin and shyv were all in meta at the end of the season and i knew these champions like the back of my hand and i climbed quite quickly. \n5. I have noticed your fav champions are ones that are with a high skill cap, leesin, draven, azir etc. you might have to switch to more basic champions if u wish to climb. \n6. Be present. Focus on the game, don't alt tab and make sure you are actively thinking what is the next move you should make in game, actually focusing on the game helps alot, also avoid talking in chat, i started muting all and its surprising how chat even when not directed at you can actually Fuck you up mentally. \n\nP.S didn't even realize GangShaiger just pretty much said everything i did haha.. but its correct. Climbing isn't fun.. its aids. but you gotta decide if u want to climb or have fun. Normals are always there for fun. :) good luck bro.","replies":[]}]}
