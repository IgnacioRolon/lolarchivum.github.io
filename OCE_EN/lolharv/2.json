He's one of, if not the weakest bottom lane AD in the game at the moment. He's better played in middle lane but you need to be able to stomp lane and basically make your opponent irrelevant then win before 20 minutes because after that you're not really a hero anymore because you fall off pretty hard.\n\nAlso you're Lucian build is awful. There are far better options than triforce and CDR boots. \nYour boots should depend on the enemy composition/who is actually going to kill you. If they have a lot of AD AA champions or one is your biggest threat, Tabis are really good. Merc treads are good if CC is what's going to get you killed. If you can get away with zerkers, they are your best option for DPS. \nYou can do CDR boots if you really need more dashes but only ever if your build already gives you 30% CDR. 10% on it's own does nothing and getting to 20% doesn't justify this option.\n\nThe three viable builds you should do on him are as follows.\n\n* The most common build (And probably the best build, good vs just about everything) is - Botrk > BC > PD/RF > IE . Your fifth item will depend on your situation and you may some times wish to build these in place of your 3rd or 4th item. They could be MScim/BT/GA/ER/LW/Some defensive item.\n* This build is better vs a squishy team but leaves you squishier than build 1.\n    I'd probably do this build if I was playing him bottom lane - - ER > SS > IE > BT/LW > Situational 5th item.\n* Or - IE > SS > BT > LW > Situational 5th item. Personally I prefer build 2 to this one because I value the CDR more.\n\nNoteworthy items.\nPhantom Dancer. Being a 500 range change, you will always be close enough to a hero for the passive to take affect. The 12% damage resistance and MS is invaluable due to you short range. You'll be suprised how often this item is what keeps you alive. Paired with Tabis can make you quite tanky with 22% damage reduction from AAs\n\n\nRunes for your primary tree:\n\n* **PRECISION ** - PTA > Triumph > Alacrity > Coup De Grace\n\nSecondary tree should be:\n\n*  ** DOMINATION ** - Sudden Impact > Ravenous Hunter\n\nGood ads to play are ADS who scale well into late game and can do well at two items (Vayne/Kog/Twitch/Trist)\nThe main issue with them (Most ADs really, but these ones more than otheres.) you will need your support to carry you to that point before you're really relevant.\nThis is one of the biggest issues with ADC atm. Just how dependent you are on your support to get through the early game to early/mid game.\nAlternately you can play ADs who scale OK but are more about the safety in their kits. (Ezreal/Xayah)\nEzreal has a blink and can farm and fight from very far away. This is valuable throughout the whole game as you can be more independent while staying safe.\nXayah's ult let's you dodge just about everything in the game. She has good decent damage and CC. She can be difficult to get good at though due to feather management.\nIf you think you can rely on your team (Since you're playing in silver division that's unlikely...) you can play more utility ADs (Jhin/Sivir/Varus/Ashe)\nVarus Ult can initiate for your team, Sivir speed boost can get your melee carries into where they need to be and Jhin can catch people similarly to Varus with his W snare and ult slows. Ashe is probably the weakest out of the four since she's basically a walking ultimate and doesn't have the wave clear like the other three. Her E can be quite useful to scout for ganks, missing enemies and objectives.\n\nYou can look for builds at Champion.gg and Probuilds.net\nStay away from MobaFire.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-24T00:17:20.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teamwork is what wins games.

I look at damage to objectives, not kills. What use is getting a whole bunch of kills if you do nothing with them? In low mmr games i do dare say scores don't mean anything if you're farmed up and looking for objectives rather than picks and fights. Because the gold you accumulate will, in the end, be useless and feeding the enemy shut down gold when you mess up which then puts a strain on your team which could in effect be worse than getting kills in the first place. Obviously league is a team game so you should also communicate and try to work towards objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"novastreamer12","date":"2018-01-23T15:48:03.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"kills aren't the only thing that matter in a game, you have to take in dragons, how your team is coping with people, paying attention to lanes and how hard their being pushed, one person can get a lot of kills yes but what should happen is once that person/ people are out for a while that frees up openings to take out towers and get objectives.","replies":[]}]}
