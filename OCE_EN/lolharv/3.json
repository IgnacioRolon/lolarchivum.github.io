Top full ad/tank, AP Supp, Mid AP/Hybrid. or ADC) improves the fun factor, plus ruining a yasuo/lee/ali/leo's day amuses me to no end (regardless of position)\n\nBut changing it up often helps, i play a fair amount of mid/top as well, so if i get bored of him, i swap out for other champs (i have mastery 3+ on EVERY champ, and every supp (across multiple accounts) at Mastery 7","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2018-01-10T11:44:14.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I was a Sion main I would take him top with rejuvenation beads and then build into GLP.
