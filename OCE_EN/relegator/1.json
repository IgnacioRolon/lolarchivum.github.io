Or should I say my account was permanently banned. I lost an account with $850+ worth of skins and such on it for lacking control over my actions and emotions. Yes, I was a toxic player and after losing this account, I simply said to myself I would simply start anew, working my way up from the bottom to the top. Well in approximately 2 hours, I&#039;ll be coming off of yet another ban for toxicity on my new account, losing control by letting my anger out at a troll for counter jungling my own camps because I did not save him in a gank. While this was a immature thing to do on his end, by insulting both he and his family I created more issues whilst simultaneously crossing the line and stooping to his level, if not lower.\r\n\r\nI see the consequences of my actions now, and in the past 2 weeks of being barred from league, have come to terms with my anger and see that I must reform. In a few hours i will return to the rift a new man, having uprooted the toxic weed that I was for so long and planting the seed to soon grow into a beautiful sunflower. I will report back on how this goes.\r\n\r\nSincerely, Relegator","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-05-14T07:47:30.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, id always treat them like bots, you cannot tell them what to do or where to go, so why try... I know this sounds cut throat, but until i believe you get in a higher elo where the team cohesion is better, its best not to try. You might be able to encourage them to do something, but that would take a long time and you could be wasting your breath.. (Hence the auto ping system being implemented).. Nothing worse than an argument surfacing as both parties usually dont pay attention fully to the game...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-14T01:30:22.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Approximately 10 hours ago you returned to your original state","replies":[{"poster":"Relegator","date":"2017-05-14T03:57:52.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't flamed yet :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-05-13T13:11:28.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate,\n\nI'v been playing since the beta, I'm really bad, but i love the game. \nIv never been banned thankfully. Sure iv been reported on many times no doubt, iv never let much get to me from the other players. \n\nIf you loose the game, so what. The *hand your dealt* next time might be in your favor. \n\nThat's the only way to look at it. You cant change them, only your self as I'm sure you have realized now.\n\nIm trying to get our of bronze, iv been in two promos tonight so far. No one to blame but me for not getting there yet. Thats the way i see it.\n\nGl on the rift ne ways.","replies":[{"poster":"Relegator","date":"2017-05-13T14:18:10.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly that, although i will say i was in bronze in s3 and s4, got to silver, then silver 1 before ban. I did lose games because of bad play and toxicity, but alot of games (In fact about 45%) were lost through either trolls, and i dont mean trolls by \"Oh you took my cs you're a troll\" i mean by them instalocking an adc and running mid building ap cause they got support, or them afking because we lost first blood. But you're right, games are lost by yourself, but you aren't always to blame. Trolls seem more prominent on oce than anything else though imo, cause i used to play on na and it was fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
