If you forgot to, and have screenshots, submitting them to Riot Support @ https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us should get the person in trouble.\n\nJust remember, they might not be instantly perma-banned due to punishment tiers. If they are already out of a 14 day ban and in bad standing, then they will be perma-banned, otherwise they will go up in tiers until they either reform or get banned. They will only skip steps due to extreme severity of what they say. Here are the punishment tiers:\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-10T17:57:01.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is all about resilience!

I've been experienced so many games with toxic players. and i did report but what happened after was, I met that toxic player again and he was being dirty again.
