You can think of it as a Giant phone book that tells applications where to send internet traffic. For example if you type in google.com, how does your web browser know what server google exists at? The answer is it checks with a DNS to see what the address for google is and, depending on where you are, it will give your browser an address like 74.125.224.41 (you can actually bypass your DNS by just putting that IP address into your web browser, though this server is probably no where near you and will probably be pretty slow)\n\nThe reason switching to a public DNS (8.8.8.8 - 8.8.4.4 = Google) can fix this issue is they are updated much more regularly than private DNS' and are more secure, since hacking a private address is considerably easier than a corporate one like google (depending on your security settings)\n\nUnfortunately in cases like these there are many issues that can be causing the same symptoms. If switching to a public DNS is not working for you I strongly suggest that you submit a ticket to https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new so we can help to troubleshoot an issue that may be unique to your situation.\n\n\nPost Script: Thank you Pyongarie for the guide!","replies":[{"poster":"Sheybawy","date":"2015-11-03T09:30:04.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello bro, I got the same problem after shifting from using wifi to stable dongle connection, if you have the time could you please suggest me some other steps where i can manage my DNS problem, the google dns doesn't seem to work on mine, if it helps the riot support site wont even load...  thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyongarie","date":"2015-01-10T08:45:38.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi DavieB, \nThanks for your kind explanation.
