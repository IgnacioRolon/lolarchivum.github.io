I love the theme of this, quite spooky actually. Another surprise clip shown during worlds. \nWhat champions do you think the new Project skins will be for? \n\nIf you listen closely, you can hear a gunshot (maybe a Jhin R shot?), a Vi q charging?, and A vayne auto attack? \n\nDon&#039;t know if that determines what skins they&#039;ll be but damn. I guess if it was out of those three, the voice speaking could be vayne. The 2nd image seems like a female character to me, possibly with something covering the face, but it reminds me a lot of project ekko. \n\n","replies":[]}
