On the page it says Jan 28 till Feb 8. No shop for me yet. \r\n\r\nOh and one more question, don&#039;t 1350 sinks usually go on sale? If so how come the Caitlin skin didnt go on sale, plus it&#039;s the first time launching it unlike the riven skin that has a discount at launch but now it&#039;s 1350.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-01-28T08:37:19.121+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dudes,\n\nThe website is wrong, it will be enabled tomorrow (January 29) with a rolling start so it _should_ be in the AM but it could be later.\n\nWe're working on getting the site updated.","replies":[{"poster":"koreoes","date":"2016-01-28T09:02:09.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah okay^^ thank you for the info~","replies":[{"poster":"RamboSprinkles","date":"2016-01-28T09:18:59.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.

Saw another post about this but now I can't find it. According to the patch notes, it should be  available.

That is a good guess. That is the only idea that seems to make sense so far. Fingers crossed. Riot could definitely be more clear about this.
