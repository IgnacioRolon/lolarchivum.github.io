As I started to use the new features, I realised actually how much I hate BE now like you can&#039;t even grind for BE unlike IP. It legit cost 3000 BE to get level 6 mastery on a champion??  Why?","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2017-12-09T03:12:01.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a whopping 180k BE after the conversion and I spent the lot on chromas. now im down to 8000 and I have champions to upgrade to mastery 6 and 7 which im just going to wait until i get the appropriate champ shards for since 3250 and 3900 BE is just ridiculous. I saving for the next champ since we can't reroll 3 champ shards into the new champ if we own all of the others. honestly there are a couple of things they should at least try:\n1. mastery 6 and 7 should cost nothing (or just for players with a high honour level or some shit)\n2. getting an S- or higher should also give you 50-100 BE (so it doesn't interupt the xp leveling *[coughbotsgrindingcough](http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=toucanceleste)* )\n3. should just give people 70% - 100% of BE equivalent to IP from last seasons for completing a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DillanTheVillan","date":"2017-12-08T23:23:05.641+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks to that riot also killed the misery champion shard which you can get for 3850, if you buy all the champ for under 3250 you can basically get 4800 or 6300 for 3850, but now it is just disgusting fucking shit, i played for 4 days and i get 550 Blue essence , are you fucking kidding me, back in the days i can get 4800 for 4 days and also fucking disgusting is riot wanted you to pay RP to buy champions more faster which once so ever have no effect on game play. i miss league back then, sigh rip ip","replies":[{"poster":"Hazed doggo","date":"2017-12-09T22:29:04.308+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You legit can't even get BE.
