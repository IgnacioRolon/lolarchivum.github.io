Then I got to silver 2 in preseason 8 with this account with an mmr or 1400 around about, now when I started to do my placements I get placed with new players and can&#039;t do anything cause I&#039;ve lost 7 games in a row because of new players on my team. Now it says my mmr is actually fucking 800... and going to be placed in Bronze 5. Actually??????","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-16T06:01:41.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that MMR listed on sites like OP.GG *don't* use Riot's calculations, they use their own, so at best they are an estimate, and can be (especially in placements) wildly unreliable. RIot's calculations are hidden to prevent abuse of the system.\n\nThat said, preseason rank has very little weighting on your MMR. As stated in the notification that popped up when season started, you will almost always end up a little lower than your previous *end of season* rank.\n\nIf you were previously unranked on this account, then likely you will be placed in the realm of B1-S3. New accounts start ranked at roughly S4 MMR.","replies":[]}]}
