I've dealt with toxic pros before which I had always found strange since I can just go on their op.gg and see who they are. This guy is rank 12 and I didn't think this type of thing would happen in Challenger.\n\nIt was my 0/3/2 Trundle game which you can watch for yourself to see how it unfolded, he was also spam pinging me all game and saying things like \"d3 jungle no mom\" and I didn't type a single word back. The reason I didn't gank gank was because I didn't see any good opportunities, and I shouldn't be trolled just because someone doesn't like my gameplay and thinks he can take matters into his own hands.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2020-02-27T17:49:59.187+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saw this on NEACE stream. Guy played like Hashinshin, tping to his death, lol. But yeah he shouldn't have trolled you, being a pro is a priviledge. [Oza explains it well here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njpVHKqD7mQ)\n\nWhat does the average Joe get from all of this discussion?\n\n1. In this meta, play proactive as jungle.\n2. Riot matchmaking is stupid (there are about 10 threads on EUW boards about this atm). Rank 12 Challenger should not be in D3 game.\n3. OCE pro scene took a step backwards when OOL was removed.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Jxmmi","date":"2020-02-28T03:02:12.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh damn you were there lol, nice to have someone else look at the game.\n\nAnother point I would mention is if you have a pro player on your team. They are not less likely to be toxic/troll a game, but possibly even more likely, because they feel like they are better than regular players since they are established. I feel like pros really given privileges such as Riot Accounts just to have another account to troll on.\n\nFrom this point I think I'm gonna stop raising my expectations when I see pros on my team, and just think of them as anyone else. If they still troll me because I didn't do exactly what they wanted, at least I wouldn't have been caught off guard.","replies":[{"poster":"Daniel Snaith","date":"2020-02-28T03:04:21.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you guys ever see Scott Pilgrim Vs.
