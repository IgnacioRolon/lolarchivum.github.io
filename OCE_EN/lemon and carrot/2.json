Tencent has bought all shares from Riot, you guys recon there will be some different affects? ( Eg. players, gameplay and even skins? )\r\n2. What is your most hated champ to lane against? Why? ( Brand of course )\r\n3. Anyone have thoughts on improving report system? ( Eg. Telling you that the report was read or processed )\r\n4. Anyone think a champion is unbalanced? Like, their kit ( Eg. Burst, Sustain, CC )   &lt;--------- Brand was here {{champion:63}} \r\n\r\nCmon guys, share thoughts don&#039;t make the &quot;Boards&quot; feel boring!\r\n\r\nYup sharing is caring!

I also hate him mid and late because all he does is sit in top lane and have no impact on the game until he can just walk up past your entire team and 2 shot your turrets with his q. In mid lane I hate to go up against those high burst champs that can 100-0 in under a second, Annie, Veigar, a good Brand player and so on, I play a lot of weird mid laners like Galio and swain and they can be strong but its just so annoying to get totally ruined within a second before you have any tank stats. I main ADC so in my opinion it really depends for me what champ I am playing, I usually play Sivir and with her I hate to go up against a Kalista because in the early trades she does huge damage with her rend and that is next to impossible to block with your spell shield, mostly because you used it to block the supports cc... I also hate vayne, in pretty much all situations due to her nasty as kit, the mobility, the damage the cc and invisibly the passives she has... everything ... its not a good time. and I also really don't like vsing a Leona, she is so brutal when played right especially against Sivir because you can't spell shield her pull, you can black that damage from it (not a lot) but not the pull itself... which is totally stupid and quite possibly some kind of overlooked bug because it blocks blitzs pull, thresh hook, darius ult.. everything.. but not Leonas pull.... wtf... as a support I don't like pretty much the same with the adc but also I don't like blitz, if my adc is not great and gets pulled my blitz early.. then its really hard to save them because either I get in front and get pulled instead or I try and fight which is usally not an option because they are under their turret and the adc is already dead. in the Jungle I just hat invade champs like rengar who just sit at your red, smite it half way through and then kill your ass because you weren't careful enough.\n3) I think the report system does need work, to often in game there are toxic players and so on and even when I report them, still things don't change and there are still toxic players, I think they need to hit harder with chat bans, for people who get reported for toxic chat and such like, where even just like 3 reports is enough to get you a restriction so you can only type like 3 words to agree or not with your team about decisions.. and if they get reported on that just chat ban them again, I think the system needs more punishment for players but not totally outright ruining it for them because we still want people to play the game (unless of course it is repeated bad behavior over and over again in which case... yea ban the s**t out of them).\n4) I think quite a few champs are pretty unbalanced to some extent... however This is why I liked ranked, you get to ban away some of the worst champions and then either pick a counter champion or a safe (escapes or cc) champion if you have to pick before the other team. it reduces the amount of pain you get in lane and makes the games more fun and exciting. for example I think Riven is pretty broken so she didn't get banned and the other team has picker her up I would either pick a safe champion against her like Garen or something, where as in normal's you just get landed with a random champion as if you get placed against Riven you better hope it wasn't the day you decided to play that squishy little champ that you never play but thought you would try it out. Even so I still feel like there are some broken champs for me in the low silver elo that I am in right now and I have a list: Riven, Mundo, tahm kench, fiora, Gangplank, Jax, quinn, Zed and Yasuo. I am sure there are a few more that I haven't thought of but for now thats all good.\nSo that pretty much is all I have, please excuse and spelling mistakes or blatant errors, its early in the morning (for me) Have a great day, and good luck on the rift. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lemon and Carrot","date":"2016-01-05T06:39:57.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=nice guys,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=P1ubzt2h,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-27T22:20:43.906+0000)\n>\n> Yea I like to talk about LoL! :3\n> 1) I don't know a lot about the whole shares thing with Tencent, but i am sure (not really) that they would still keep the employees and the teams working for LoL, they might have the power to make all the decisions but I really hope they can see LoL is in a pretty good place and keep updating and working on it just like it has been. \n> 2) In the top lane my most hated champ to lane against is either Nasus because he is soooooo boring he will just sit there and farm ignoring all your poke and harass with is life steal passives and then after he has some serious tank stats (around level 6-7) he just slows your ass and beats you to a bloody pulp unless you can get out in time...
