No Alt+Tab no Ctrl+Alt+Del no mouse movement, anything. Every time it happened I had to manually reboot my PC by holding down the Power button on the computer and by the time my computer rebooted it was always too late, or it would immediately do the same thing as before.\r\n\r\nI gave my game a break until today (9-01-2016) and it is still having the same issue\r\nI connect, play for 10-30 mins I get the black screen of death, have to reboot PC\r\nRepeat.\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-09T13:02:54.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nSounds to me like you're having issues with your GPU potentially overheating or your graphics drivers crashing.\n\nFirst off let's eliminate any other potential causes.\n\n*  Update your graphics drivers.\n*  Close any other unneeded processes before playing to free up resources.\n\nIf those suggestions dont resolve your issue its possible your GPU is overheating, next time you play monitor your GPU's temps, there's many tools available to do this, however my choice is SpeedFan.\n\nIf your temperatures seem to be in excess, you'll have to open your computer up to clean the fans on your CPU & GPU, probably your entire case.\n\nWhen was the last time you cleaned out your case?\nDoes this occur with any other graphically intense game? Or just league?","replies":[]}]}
