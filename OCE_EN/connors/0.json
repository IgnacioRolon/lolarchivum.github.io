Putting voice chat in league of legends would improve team communication, improving game play and individuals enjoyment in the game, it would also prevent the hassle of \"setting up a team speak chat room\" or finding that strangers Skype account. Voice chat definitely needs to be put in League of Legends, pls rito","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-02-23T01:23:35.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If voice chat was introduced into league, instead of cyber bullying from toxic people, it will become a more serious problem such as verbal harassment and people leaving mic's on unintentionally or people just yelling jibrish into the mike being a 'troll'.\nOn the other hand it would be good for ranked 5v5's or pre made games where **communication** is key, previously stated in Connors argument.\nRiot would also have to implement a system where people would be banned or punishments would be laid down to stop the abusive nature of some people who give a bad name to the league community. \n{{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} \nFurthermore it should also be an option for when you join a que it has chat enabled or disabled for people to decide. \nIf this was implemented there must be an option for muting the disturbances.\nOverall I believe it would be a great option that could be used to the benefit of winning games from communication + decision making within a game but would attract some attention seekers to do wrong. Likely this will never happen.\n\n~sparklefart OCE","replies":[]},{"poster":"mastermind39","date":"2016-03-16T00:06:27.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo true also play this guy plllz i begg yooou ---------> {{champion:5}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bomatsu","date":"2015-02-25T14:51:29.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Skype is fine for me.
