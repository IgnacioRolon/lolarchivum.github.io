While the puppet master is casting this spell he enters a semi statis illusional state and cannot be hit by non magical sources.\r\n\r\nR: Steals all buffs/shields/spellblock/resurrect effect from an enemy champion and places them on yourself\r\n(imagine how powerful it would actually be if picked into a tahm kench/lulu/master yi/olaf, someone that can really boost themselves and then just to take it away from them.\r\n\r\nPros: Good pick into a team with plenty of buffs\r\nCons: Needs a teamfight to utilize full potential\r\n\r\nIdea 2)\r\n\r\nCommando\r\n\r\nRole:\r\nADC (600 range)\r\n\r\nMain idea: Theres not really many champions in the game currently that have to pick out opportunities based on like a time limitation or such as of now. I actually liked that wolf chap in primitive wc3 dota that was stronger at night time.\r\n\r\nQ: Pulsar signal\r\nPassive Send&#039;s out a pulse every 30 seconds that disables the map of nearby enemys and turns of wards placed by them for 10 seconds (800 range)\r\nActive: Overload pulsar signal, implodes the signal around the commando to deal damage to all targets inside the circle as the pulse travels back towards him. (So this would be only activateable when the passive triggers)\r\n\r\nW: Land mine place a mine underneath you that will explode in 3 seconds, if any enemy walks near it or over it this will be reduced to 0.2 seconds. Will deal damage and opponent hit will lose vision for 1 second.\r\n\r\nE: Commando will jump a certain range maybe 500 range and fire 3 shots at a set angle (maybe a mechanic like click drag similar to rumbles ulti whereas the first click picks the jump location and the drag sets the angle)\r\n\r\nR: Final last blows\r\nWhen Commando would die he instead goes invisible for 15 seconds and loses 15% move speed\r\nHe can reactivate when in melee range of an enemy champion to deal something like 200/300/400 damage and if this damage is fatal the commando revives himself on 1% health. (Doesn&#039;t revive him if he doesn&#039;t get a kill with this skill)\r\n\r\nSo this adc is not an all out skirmisher would lose in most 1v1 situations but still has the ability to win via vision disruption and outplaying the opponent with the land mine ability. Through skill can potentially die, if he has good awareness of the enemy flash cooldowns etc can stalk enemies and pick opportune times to try revive turning situations that look like the enemy is winning a battle into devastating losses.\r\n\r\nPros: Good choice into passive lanes and especially into squishy teams where his ultimate can be more effective.\r\nCons: Bad against hard engage adcs","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-08-19T02:22:04.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tgis sounds realy cool man\nkeep it up","replies":[]}]}
