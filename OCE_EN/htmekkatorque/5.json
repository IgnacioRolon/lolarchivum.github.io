Okay so I think the first crux  that I&#039;ve found was solo nashor with no items. Riot please. Like how do you do that?\r\n\r\nMy first thoughts...\r\nBaron Nashor moves quite slowly so you can disposition him then move to your target location at the last second but you still have to time it between his blasts. Idk thus far I&#039;ve been trying to do this and I&#039;ve only made it like 2/5&#039;s of the way through it at most.\r\n\r\nAlso Penta kill... I&#039;ve gotten to the 5th boss without dying so many times 1 hit from killing her but died with one hit to go so frustratingly painful Ik. So my current strategy was the move speed item + the thing that ignores shields (makes pix super easy) but I&#039;m thinking of swapping movement speed out for the extra reach because some of the bosses look like they&#039;d be in range a lot earlier with that extra range.\r\n\r\nAlso 600 poro saves... While I&#039;ve not attempted this yet I&#039;ve got a PB of about 500 while aiming for pentakill but I was thinking maybe just start from the beginning and try to not kill the bosses for as long as possible (sounds counterintuitive which is why I haven&#039;t tried it yet) but so therefore minion waves are always at their easiest. idk.\r\n\r\nAlso share your thoughts on anything you&#039;ve given many attempts and found a solution for/overcome through some clever methodology. :)","replies":[]}
