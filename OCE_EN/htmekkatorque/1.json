Roles shouldn't be important as this is a semi serious team and I'm sure if you're good you'll be able to play a few roles and will just fill as required (hopefully we will consistently be playing you in the same role though).\r\n\r\nMust be gold+ (preferably not gold V because that generally indicates that you might be anywhere ranging bronze -> gold performance)\r\nIf you underperform you will get benched/ cut from the team (sometimes cold hearts just need warm smiles :) )\r\nIf you play a champion I do not permit you will also be instantly cut (simply because I want to try get organised team comps working whether it be poke, dive etc but I feel having an overall decent team comp will make up for a weak laning phase). Of coarse we'll try adapt some popular LC's comps with whatever champions we have available to us with reference to guide sites and pro matches.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nIGN : HTMekkatorque\r\nRank : gold 3\r\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\r\nSupport: Alistar, Janna, Leona, Thresh,  Blitzcrank, Karma\r\nTop: Irelia, kennen, rumble, volibear, jax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf interestted fiill in these details as I have and add me to friends list in game,\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Dogma","date":"2015-01-23T12:26:55.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Dogma\nRank: Gold III\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\nSupport: Thresh, Leona,Nami,Braum\nADC: Lucian,Graves,Ezreal,Corki,Jinx,Caitlyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"LW Endless","date":"2015-01-19T11:12:27.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : LW Endless\nRank : Plat 4\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\nADC: Draven, Lucian, Ezreal, Kog'maw, Tristana, Graves, Ashe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jigokusai","date":"2015-01-16T03:02:47.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : Jigokusai\nRank : gold 5 (decay from gold 1, been back for a month or so )\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\nJungle: WuKong,J4,Nunu,Lee Sin,Elise,WW,Gragas\nSupport: Leona,Annie,Blitz,Fiddle,Nunu\nADC: Cait,Ez,Vayne","replies":[]},{"poster":"Indy Savvy","date":"2015-01-16T02:59:01.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : Indy Savvy\nRank : gold V (70 points)\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\nADC: Lucian, Caitlyn, Tristana, Ezreal\nJungle: Vi, Jarvan IV, Wukong, Lee Sin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hi its Gosu","date":"2015-01-15T21:35:15.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN : hi its gosu\nRank : gold 5 promos 4\nA list of champions you can play decently well:\nADC : Jinx , Vayne , Caitlyn , Ezreal\nMid : Syndra , Orianna , Zed, Fizz and Riven\nJungle : Vi , Lee Sin , Shaco","replies":[]}]}
