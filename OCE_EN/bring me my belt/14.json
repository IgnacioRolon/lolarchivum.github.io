Looking at your stats, it seems you've plateaued. It's not that you're versing the matchmaking, it's that your skill is accurately reflected in both your rank and your MMR.\n\nIn short, you need to focus now on improving rather than winning. You've got solid ADC stats, so maybe take a look at some of your replays, what could you be doing better. Watch a Gold or a Plat ADC mains replays, what are they doing differently from you? Same for JNG since you seem to be playing a fair bit fo that too.\n\nMaybe drop into normals for a bit and focus on smaller specific things when the stakes aren't so high. You seem to do pretty well playing from behind death-wise (i.e you aren't feeding just because you're weaker), but your CS is quite low even in your wins. Your warding is great in some games, but low in others etc. You get the idea.\n\nWinning lane also isn't everything. Lost lanes, especially when there's scaling hyper carries like Kayle involved, can still be big players later. Lane phase isn't everything.\n\nSome things, of course, you can't control. The Ezreal game they had burst on burst, and you had basically no tank cause Graggy was behind and Renekton went full damage, but that alone won't cost you a game. I assume the second image is damage done? You cut off a bit much there. Obviously, the Renekton was a bit of a weak link, but so was their Lucian.\n\nWhen plateaus happen, the game to game becomes less important than the bigger picture.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-04-04T18:15:09.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> When plateaus happen, the game to game becomes less important than the bigger picture.\n\nI know I have to focus on CS, which is hard in low elo cause how fast games snowball, most games are over instantly, because people don't know how to play from behind. All season I have dealt with multiple people every lobby playing badly/trolling/inting.\nI know the obvious stuff like warding and CS has been pretty meh this season. Though it seems, that every game I play everyone on the opposing team is just better and I am getting the bottom of the barrel and it is like that almost every game.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/ccfbf88c3ffaf8a60cb5c4961a10fa5b\n\nthis isn't even the worst example, we actually had a chance to win this game without kayle, but 1 person lost their cool with kayle and just ruined the game, and its the same crap every game. It is a team game I get that. but still my games have been bloody poor quality since I was in promos for gold I almost deranked back to s4. thats a little insane","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-05T03:40:42.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it's cliche but that's a big part of why I suggest normals. When your MMR stagnates ranked gets that much more frustrating. It feels like you aren't getting anywhere because you aren't. \n\nI'm certainly no stranger to it, it happened a lot for me last season. Of course, I'm a bit biased in that I never have and probably never will play solely ranked, but normals take the game to game pressure off and let you practice without the stress of LP loss.\n\nI'm no stranger to losing games to tilt and toxicity, I had a string of ranked games not long ago that were just *awful*. I do encourage you to remember though, that just because a player is doing badly doesn't mean they're trolling or doing it on purpose. \n\nTilt is a powerful thing, and it can make otherwise decent players make terrible gameplay decisions. Most of the time, they know what mistakes they have made, and pointing them out or engaging those mistakes will only tilt them more, even when you're just trying to help.\n\nUltimately, you can only control your gameplay and your mindset. You aren't going to change some random internet stranger's mind unless they want it to be changed, and especially not in the span of a game. So influence the odds you can, instead of railing against the ones you can't.\n\nDon't misunderstand, I'm not excusing the crap that some people pull in games, just that at the end of the day there isn't anything you can do other than report and move on that will have any real effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-04-09T05:03:45.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know there isn't anything I can do, in game or out of game, but having games that you win, and they aren't rewarding, because someone on the other team either trolled or leaves game, and then when you get the players that do the same thing. You cant upload evidence of such behaviour because of the rules set for the boards, Riot support can't do anything. People can post in forums and just looks like idiots, and it becomes a players word verses Riot.\n\nI am continuing to play, however their is something going on, and I feel as though the system is too heavily favored to penalized anyone who uses the chat log, I get thats its the easiest to penalize people, I am confident chat box is that strict now, that people are encouraged to misbehave in games. \n\nWhether its that there is too much damage in the game which I see the blame being put on, or not, this is by far one of worst toxic phases I have encountered.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
