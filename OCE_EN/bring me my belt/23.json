And people that negatively impact game play more than often are having a bad game. \r\n\r\nSo in all respect, why is it that if a player get frustrated. and only shows argumentative behaviour, with no abuse towards others. Why does that player receive a instant penalty. however a player that just continually ints because he can't have his own way passable as 'having a bad game'\r\n\r\nThe screen shot below, please explain how I am supposed to 'play out' the game. \r\n\r\nhttps://gyazo.com/41b89175fe1ebf840841d950134745b9\r\n\r\nI asked support previously with a screen shot from a different game, they replied with, your stats are decent, you should be able to grind if you ignore these games.  How am I supposed to ignore these sort of games when 9/10 games I play is the same thing, multiple players giving up minutes into the game because they are ganked early etc.\r\n\r\nI feel as though other games that are 'competitive' have a better grasp on dealing with these matters.\r\n\r\nP.s. Yes I am pissed that I received my latest chat ban. linked below\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/lO9kzR1p-yes-chat-ban-me-again","replies":[]}
