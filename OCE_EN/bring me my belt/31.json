Those 6 people were flaming that guy that was afk or inting.. my team or not, this game is cancer. nothing is being done about the crap that is actually making this game shit. I've spent the week or so playing a decent amount of dota (yes because of TI) and those games actually feel great to play, games on here it is gambling","replies":[{"poster":"Sesilan","date":"2019-08-26T13:11:40.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First time in gold? That's average behavior.\n\nYou'll see that quite alot, it'll seem like nothing gets done but those players do EVENTUALLY get punished, it's just taking the time to finally get those punishments handed out.\n\nIf you feel that strongly about the two games, why don't you make a definitive switch to one or the other instead of chop-changing between them? You'll find a lot more harmony just sticking to the one game, riding it out until you're at a decent elo (Which won't save you, there's trolls, ints and afks in ALL elos, the higher ones just tend to see it less commonly) and enjoy the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-08-31T07:10:01.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"and its not going back and forth between games, its I'm playing dota because this community here is stupid toxic and for what ever reason, Riot can't seem to work out how to fix it, they have a honor system, they let players the receive a penalties play ranked straight away. There is so much they can do, with the tools they have implemented to fix this crap, I've played this game for 6 years, I've had 1 account perma-banned for alot less than im witnessing now, and year after year this game gets more toxic, and Riot just don't give a fuck. Unless it complete ruins there number 1 priority of getting money for flashy skins. they don't really give a fuck about their player base","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-08-31T07:01:27.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got chat banned earlier in the year for saying foff to my support that was clearly trolling, he was walking circles around lane tower from as soon as we spawned onto the rift, 20 minutes circling that same tower not doing anything, my next chat ban was because I reacted to a top lane who would watch his team fight, then intentionally int. my 3rd chat ban was because I said trolling f, because again I had a support who decided top support the top laner because they were duo bot, neither of those players received a penalty unless they just got chat restriction.  Chat punishment is so stupidly strict, people are aware if they dont have their way just troll in game and punish the people on their team that are trying to play the game.","replies":[]}]}
