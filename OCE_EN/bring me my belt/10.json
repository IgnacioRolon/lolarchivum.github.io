While punishments do follow basic patterns (as outlined in that article), they are largely determined on an individual basis. Without at least the chat log, there is basically nothing we can offer you here on boards. Ideally, you would include punishment history as well if you want any sort of depth.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-01-28T08:52:53.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't care that I got chat banned what I do care about is the lack of effort and attention put into dealing with trolls and inters. people that are actually there to ruin game play. Other games have improved their system so why is Riot incapable of doing so. Instead of insta penalizing the chat log, perhaps that has something to do with increase number of trolls, maybe because it takes 6 months to become honorable.\n\nEither way the community is toxic, yet the only people that get penalized reliably, are the people that use the chat log. after singular games in my opion, 3-4 games seems resonable. but if Riot want to penalized people who abuse chat in single games compared to people that want to troll, I am better of ruining the game than using the chat log. \n\nChat log is mutable. a players ingame behaviour is not. Quick math, the system encourages people to troll and affect the out come of the game. over a chat box that is easily mutable.  I don't give a rats ass about being honorable if people want to troll games fucking oath ill speak my mind then ill mute them as I have always done","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-28T13:11:15.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are three main things that contribute to the idea that trolls/griefers/inters don't get punished. I'll preface this by saying, I assure you they do.\n___\n**.1. The difference between feeding and intentional feeding.**\n\nEven when you are in the game with someone, it can be difficult from a player perspective to determine whether someone is feeding because they're tilted (which is, unfortunately, a big ol' snowball effect) and someone who is feeding because they decided to be an asshole for whatever reason.\n\nRiot have a lot more background info and data that goes into determining what's an intentional pattern, what's a tilt pattern, what's a \"my lane is just better than me\" pattern, etc, etc.\n\nThat's not to say that inters don't exist, because they obviously do, but there is more consideration to a punishment than simply how many deaths someone has.\n___\n**.2. Trolling/Griefing vs Disagreeing.**\n\nLeague is incredibly diverse, and no game plays out the same way. There is no one *right* way to play League, and in any given game there are multiple routes to victory. So is someone ignoring your Baron call because they're griefing and want to mess with you, or are they ignoring it because they disagree with the call and think it will get you all killed?\n\nUnfortunately, human nature dictates that we don't like admitting we are or could be wrong about things, or that someone could be more right. Someone ignoring your advice, no matter how logical or sound you think it is, doesn't mean they are griefing you or intentionally trolling. More often than not, it's simply that they disagree with your decision.\n\nTilt exacerbates this badly. If someone has dismissed your calls as meaningless they will ignore them regardless of how sound the logic is behind them.\n\nThose that have a solo mindset and fall into this trap all the time, are going to be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to ranked (teamwork is an important skill too after all) so try not to worry about them too much. Rank is after all, largely about the big picture and not the game to game.\n\nOne thing you can do to mitigate this is to understand that following through on a questionable call as a team, is still generally going to be the better option than following through on 5 different calls that alone, or leaving your team to 4v5/3v5 while you go off on your own. Wards help a lot here too.\n___\n**.3. How to determine intent.**\n\nThis very much ties into the first two points, but it is essentially the largest hurdle any system faces when issuing punishments for gameplay offences.\n\nChat is fairly simple. The expression of intent is right there in plain old recorded English (or [insert other language here]). There are still borderline or questionable instances, but for the most part, chat makes intent quite clear. Gameplay, on the other hand, can be a trickier nut to crack. Most cases are pretty straightforward, but sometimes the system needs a little extra evidence before issuing a punishment.\n\nThe last thing Riot (or anyone) wants, is to ban someone for having a bad game. It sets a *very* bad precedent and is generally an awful scenario for all involved. The unfortunate consequence is that gameplay punishments can sometimes take a little longer to issue than anyone would like. \n\nIn no way is it an instance of \"we are punishing chat *instead* of gameplay\". Both have their code of conduct and both are punished where appropriate. It is simply the timeframes that can differ on a case by case basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-01-30T02:26:09.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its hard to solo carry this game these days, this game is very hard to win when people are actually disrupting play, trolling and greifing is stupidly obvious, especially when they are spamming surrender and its declined. If its to difficult to punish people intentionally ruin game play, unless its racist, sexist threats. don't penalize people from singular chat logs? I see more people ruining game play than using chat  Riot is asking people to intentionally troll at this point.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITlJYsnXs0o&amp;t=17s","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"2manysooks","date":"2020-02-02T05:35:09.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best thing you can do dude is mute anyone who talks, do not respond to them at all. This game is not on your side if you try and defend yourself.

I dont type in chat ever now. So because of riot report garbage communication is zero.\n\nIf you can put up with ignoring everyone then you can try enjoy the game, If you cant help yourself and have to chat/talk to feeders/abusers/noobs/trolls back to others youll be reported no matter what you do.\n\nIll also add, I never type in chat and play the game properly and I have been at honor1 for along time.
