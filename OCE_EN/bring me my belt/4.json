All it says is that the agent believes your questions were answered in a previous ticket and they opted not to repeat themselves.\n\nIf you want to discuss your interaction with support, I'd recommend posting the ticket the agent mentioned (ideally including your messages as well as their responses). Without those, there's isn't really anything anyone here can actually discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-04-29T17:44:12.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A chain of tickets that date back to the end of last year.\nI am not going go back through these tickets.\nWhen they can't even tell me why I was penalized over singular games, when they repeatably mention that consistent behaviour is the reason I was penalized, and there is chat logs from singular games.\nThey can not give answers to those questions because they have no input to crap that is actually happening in games, they even stated that, there for no reason to have a support page. nor can I post proof of how toxic games are because its against terms.
