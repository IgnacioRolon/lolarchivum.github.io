EVERY game, atleast 2 trolls, inters or afks. I've got to gold 1 once this season and gold 2 another 3 times. ill get to these ranks then get literally detrimental matchmaking until I drop back into sliver and I have to start over. and it is the same crap over and over. I see little verbal abuse than what has been in previous years, it is like everyone has worked out, hey lets troll instead. but someone types a key word in chat, they get insta-chat banned and have to wait 5 months to be honorable again. the system actually pushes people to affect the out come of games. Riot say to mute chat if people are being abusive right? we can't mute gameplay, so let people be abusive, let us mute them.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-26T01:52:02.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FINALLY, someone else who freakin seeing it how it is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-10-25T12:24:06.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/24d99a85f3ee970a630d88bbb9f0ec4c\n\nEvery single ranked game I play same result, untill I get demoted back to silver, then have to climb to gold 1-2 again, rinse repeat. same process 4 times this year, actual hard stuck because of griefiers/trolls","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-24T03:18:32.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish for that too to be honest. \nUnfortunately the complexity of the mmr and points system is probably as far as it's going to go for the moment. As I'm sure your aware of the new releases Riot has coming for the future, league of legends is more than likely going to be very similar to what it is now. \nWhat you're asking is a big project in itself let alone to co-ordinate with everything else that's happening. \nBesides, isn't learning to carry part of improving your game?","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-10-24T10:44:56.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless your smurfing you cant really be expected to carrying yourself every game? with the changes happening for next year solo carry would be harder as well.

My point is, I can only assume the system is designed to give every player, no matter the rank, an even and equal opportunity to develop their skills and enjoy the game for what it is. The owness is then placed on to the player to use what ever tools available to them, (within the rules and guidelines) to develop themselves and progress through out the ranks. Also, Riot does hugely rely on us, (the players) to notify them of things which are genuinely a problem in game (notably, that is where the problem lies between what riot deems an issue and what the players have to deal with in game). \n\nIdeally, yes I do agree, Riot should be putting more tools, guides and other helpful resources in place. That is in a perfect world though where anyone (namely you or me) can just pipe up in a forum and request what we believe to be relevant additions or issues in the game and have it addressed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-10-24T16:14:06.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"unless your smurfing you cant really be expected to carrying yourself every game?\"\n\nI mean even smurfs (and this is more leaning on the side of pro's) have some trouble in certain ranks due to just how shit the matchmaking is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2019-10-24T13:24:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quitters are easily identified but trolled aren't so i doubt that will happen","replies":[]}]}
