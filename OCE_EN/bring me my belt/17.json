You don't see the All Blacks just walk off the field at half time and go down to the pub because the game is looking like they won't win.\n\nThe whole argument of \"Oh well its so I can get into another game and not waste my time in a game thats already lost.\" is just an excuse for people not willing to try.  I have won countless games where it looked absolutely impossible to win.  Theres always a chance _(hey, the enemy might even disconnect for some reason, it's all happened before)_.\n\nPlaying into a losing game isn't fun, if you don't want to do that, fair enough, the game is supposed to be fun, if you're not having it, stop playing, I won't fault you for that.  But, if you want fun, play normals.  If you want to do the absolute best you can to win, then play ranked, but don't give up as soon as shit hits the fan.\n\nQuite frankly, I don't give a f*ck what dodging or surrendering strategy the challengers/pros do.  \nName one, just one, sport on the international stage, where quitting halfway through a game is an acceptable thing.  You play a game to the bitter end, whatever the outcome.  Out of respect for your team, the enemy team, and yourself.  If league wants to be a game where dodging and surrendering is an acceptable strategy to climb the ranks.  Then maybe it doesn't deserve to be on the world stage.  Think about that next time you press that button.\n\nMy friend and I almost never surrender.  And because theres two of us, no one else can pass the vote.  And we win SO MANY games that are 'certain' losses.  Because we don't quit when everyone else does, we have so much experience playing uber defensively, we know _**exactly**_ how our champs feel when behind and under-farmed/fed, we know how they will perform, and when they will spike again.  And we manage to pull games back quite often.  If I actually played ranked, then we would probably win a solid 30/40% more 'lost' games than most people we play with.\n\nYou always see that one Zed that is 0/9 and leaps into battle in exactly the same way as if he was 9/0.  Thats what you become when you don't play out your losses.  You get really really good at playing well when you're winning.  But don't know **** about how to play when you're behind.\nDon't be that guy.\n_______________\n\nTo look at it from the other side.  Yes I can appreciate that statistically in terms of pure numbers, I can see why it's appealing to cut losses and begin the next game.  League is a coin flip, most of the time its a 50/50 chance wether you win or lose.  If you see the coin about to land on tails, catch it and throw it again right?  No need to suffer through the process of having it land and everyone look at your defeat.  It makes sense, you can fit more games into less time, more chances to win _(although people don't realise that you have equal chance of losing again as well, in which case you have crammed in more losing games by surrendering)_.\n\nBut you really have to decide what you play ranked for.\nDo you play ranked to see the best you yourself can achieve, and be proud of?\nOr do you just want a shiner border than everyone else?  It doesn't matter how.\n\nAnother of my friends was boosted, he has a far shiner border than the rest of us,  but you know what.  It doesn't mean anything.  \nBecause we know he didn't get it, and he knows he didn't get it.  It's not an accurate representation of his skill.\nBut he does have a nice shiny profile and a nice flash skin to keep, no denying that.  \nA skin that I will never have now, and he always will.  And it doesn't matter how he got those things, he has them and I don't.\n\n**So if it's purely the outcome that you want, then by all means do whatever you can to achieve that.  Dodge and surrender and play only the most broken and in meta champs.  But don't you dare say that it was you and your hard work that achieved that reward.  You exploited the system and thats how you got your edge.**\n\nIf you quit when things look rough, you're not playing to the best of your ability, whatever rank you achieve, isn't the rank you deserve.  Maybe you deserve higher, maybe lower.   You may have the rewards, but can you look at them and think _\"I sweat and bled for this!\"_\nI you can, good for you.  But don't ruin other people's games just because you can't be bothered trying when things get difficult.\n\nThis is all just my opinion of course, But I don't believe in the mindset of:\n_\"Oh I'm losing, this one doesn't count! The next one counts!\"_\n\nIf you don't accept and play out your losses, then your wins are meaningless too.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-17T10:08:12.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the surrender feature is there just incase, 4 players dc for instance, but the other team doesn't want to end and holds you hostage, or there is a bug that makes the game unwinnable, the immortal nexus.

By adding a surrender option, it has lead players to use this as a strategy in itself, and devalued the respect for player's time invested in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-03-22T01:53:40.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you ever watch snooker? they concede frames all the time even though they can theoretically still win it if they try and get x amount of snookers. but it isn't worth it most of the time. it's the same concept.... in a game like league, there comes a point where it is literally not worth investing the time and effort for such a low chance of success. ranked is a grind just like a snooker match. in our case 1 match is like a frame. the exceptions may be a promo match that is going to decide whether you go up a division, just like a match deciding frame in snooker (although in professional snooker even in this situation players concede the match quite often).\n\nbesides, don't act like in professional sports, a team doesn't ever give up. sure they don't just walk off and forfeit, but that's because sport is a bit different to the concept of being able to just queue up for the next match with randoms immediately after.\n\nlook at NBA for example. if a team is really far behind, what do they do? they sit their top, ie most valuable/highest paid players, put on their rookies and reserves and see the game out. they've accepted the loss and have given up (then the winning team usually does the same). it's not worth risking injuries and using the energy for such a low chance of a win. of course, in the playoffs, especially if it is a do or die match in the series, they will still try. but the regular season is a grind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-03-21T09:45:54.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They get paid to be on stage.\n\nI dont know how you guys link things together.

It plays the same role as endurance in a real game.  \nPlayers don't get faster/stronger/taller as they score, like you say.  But as the game progresses, they do get tired and slower and sloppier, and those people who train for those times, get less slow and less sloppy than the other players.  So the same thing happens just in reverse.\n\nAlso league has a power ceiling.  With a few exceptions like Veigar.  No champ gets stronger than a 6 item build.  So even if the enemy is snowballing, you can ALWAYS catch up in the end.  It doesnt matter how much of a gold/xp/item lead they have. You can always catch up.\n\nThe trick is just to know how to stall out the game long enough to reach that ceiling.  \nFunnily enough, a thing you don't get to practice if you surrender.\n\nIf your argument is about people who AFK, then just make the surrender vote unanimous. AFKers get kicked from the vote anyway, so it shouldn't be a problem.  But I've still won tons of games that were 4v5 from the beginning.\n\n> if you were to give 100% in every single game that is incredibly 1 sided against you\n\nExcept that it's not an actual grind. It's not an RNG chest at the end of some raid.  \nSheer number of games won't necessarily advance you.\nPlay 2 games of ranked a day, give them your all.  Do that every day of the year, play normals to chill and practice.  You'll be much better off than throwing hours and hours of average playing into ranked.\nIts a quality over quantity thing.  In my experience, you advance more by playing 10 and winning 8, than by playing 40 and winning 20.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-03-18T14:59:31.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure endurance can be a thing depending on the sport, but that does not apply to a league match (i guess unless the match goes for over 1hr or something) so it's not really a comparison. besides, team sports generally have a thing called substitutions, but this convo isnt about that.\n\nremember, we're talking about seriously 1 sided games (or at least i was) so if you catch up that much in that kind of a match, it's because the enemy team allowed you to more so than anything you did. this is entirely possible to happen, especially in low elo for sure. not as likely in higher elos. either way, i feel it's generally not worth it betting on that outcome.\n\nbut it is a grind. not sure how anyone can argue that a ranked season isn't a grind. the amount of games you play doesn't change that. even you said games are a coin flip. playing less games isn't necessarily going to mean you will win more. you're still grinding your way to whatever rank you want (assuming your goal is to climb) by playing 2 games a day, especially as long as the system is entirely about win/loss ratio when playing with randoms.\n\nin terms of afk. i just got done playing a game where a duo d/c pretty early in the match. im assuming they live in the same house. it was a 3v5. we tried because it was a norm. but as you can imagine we still lost. why should 1 person be able to hold the other 2 hostage in a situation like this? like you said ranked isn't about fun. you even talk about trying to play higher quality games rather than quantity. so how can you want it to be unanimous in a situation like that?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-16T20:36:40.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarinoPower","date":"2019-03-19T05:22:30.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My take...\n\nI play this game for fun.

I don't have the option to end a game unilaterally.  In the worst cast scenario (AFK before 3 min) you still need at least half of the team to agree with you. Most of the time you need between 66% to 75% of the other players to agree with you.  Heck, before 20 mins you need 100% of the players to agree with you before you can end the game.   \n\nIn the 20 mins scenario, if 4 people vote \"yes\", and 1 votes \"no\", the one that is not \"considering\" the rest of the team is the lonely voter.

I don't really play ranked, and when I do its usually flex with a friend, so we just block the vote anyway.\n\nFrom that comment, it doesn't sound like you actually consider everyone else. It is quite clear that you don't. You  block it because you want to and that's it. Doesn't matter if 3 of your other teammates are not having fun and want out. You just block it because you can.\n\nHaving the surrender option is needed because this is a GAME. This is not a job (and even in most jobs you can quit and walk out).  \n\nRemember clicking on surrender is NOT the say as going AFK or giving up.

Sure in a normals when fun is the objective, by all means 4 people's fun overrides 1 persons.  But in ranked the goal isn't fun, the goal is victory.  So you shouldn't have the option to take that away from the one person in the team who is still trying to achieve the objective.\n2. I never said I wasn't a hypocrite.  And it still doesn't make what I said any less truthful, because it doesn't matter what I do, the fact of the matter is that you didn't consider everyone else.

WRONG. _**This is a game... the goal is ALWAYS to have fun**_. The only people that may not be here for fun are those that are getting payed. This discussion isn't really about those people.\n\n2. It is not a flaw when it is impossible to do.  If two people want to surrender, two people want to keep playing and you are the 5th person.  You are forced to make a decision and decide to either surrender or not surrender. One of the factors of that decision is to consider the opinions of the rest of your team.\n\nBasically, when there are different mutually exclusive options (surrender or not surrender) in a group, you can consider all the options you want, still you pick one side.  Either surrender or don't.  I consider the opinions of my allies before a surrender vote, but that's no the only factor.\n\nBasically, this is not a flaw in my reasoning.\n\n3. Words have context.  In the context of a league of legends game, it means that you are not playing anymore to win.  Of course, this happens after a surrender has been FINALISED (as there's no more game to play), but just calling a surrender vote doesn't mean you have given up. \n\nIf you are still trying to contribute to the game, you have not given up.  There are many cases, were there is a surrender vote at 15 or 20 mins, and I tell the ally \"I think we still have a chance, give us 5 more mins, and if it doesn't work I will also surrender \".\n\nAt this point, even the person who called the surrender, might still try to win. If he is still trying to win, he hasn't given up.\n\nBut if the enemy team has 20 kills advantage, baron , 3 inhibitors, in your base, 4 of your team are dead and you are playing soraka. Well, if you decide to just stay in base, you have given up, if you decide to fight out , you haven't given up.\n\nGiving up in LoL is not about what you THINK. It is about your actions in game. Actively trying to win (even if you think you don't have a chance) or going AFK at the fountain. 2 completely different things","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gerk","date":"2019-03-20T15:53:51.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heres my thought on removing FF from ranked.\n\n[NAME REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]","replies":[{"poster":"Gerk","date":"2019-03-20T15:56:01.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thankfully didnt have to play with this guy on my team, someone dodged.
