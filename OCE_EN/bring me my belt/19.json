There is a honor system, use it as a requirement for ranked, or do something to improve the ranked game play experience. I&#039;m forcing myself to play the game because I have spent a decent amount of money. I still enjoy playing the game, but the players are another story. This isn&#039;t people being tilted and doing silly mistakes, it genuinely feels like people are intentionally ruining the rank game play experience. I&#039;ve played the game for a while, I&#039;m a silver/gold, you can mute chat but you can&#039;t control what they do in game because they don&#039;t get their own way","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-02-08T09:38:12.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a better suggestion than what they have now, nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2019-02-08T09:23:52.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honor takes too long to level up to be used for ranked, and honor gets reset every season.
