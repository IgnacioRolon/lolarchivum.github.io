Why don't we gain lp on how we perform in a match, the system is basically already with the after game scores. If i play shit and my team carries me why do I deserve 30lp just like the guy who carried us, or vice versa if we carry why do trolls and feeders sometimes get free wins. And again if I have a bloke rage quit in game, or gets banned for being a dickhead and we lose the game why the hell do we still lose lp, the games just a joke it really is at least dota you can kick trolls and get bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-01-16T10:35:37.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also get penalized within a few matches for obvious trolling or afking, and you cant go straight back into ranked if you are penalized. I'm not a fan of low priority game/jail thing, but atleast restrict those players who intentionally ruin game from playing ranked until their honor level 1. They implemented it JUST for 'rewards', maybe use it for something that actually matters too??","replies":[{"poster":"Testikills","date":"2020-01-16T10:48:04.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah look i'm obviously all for tougher penalties for people who do the wrong thing, but thing is that doesn't help the people who they have already ruined the experience for. I mean in OCE man I swear every game has someone who is just spiteful or so full of themself on my team or the opposite team. We need things in place to protect players that are already in the games that have been ruined, these guys getting banned after my match I don't give a fuck about really","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-01-16T11:25:17.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not just OCE I watch a few higher elo players in NA and HOLY POOP","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
