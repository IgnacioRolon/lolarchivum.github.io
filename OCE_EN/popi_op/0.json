Why you ask? Well for your entertainment of course, after all you are the one that controls us aren&rsquo;t you? Sending us to our deaths again and again, have you no soul, no guilt, no regrets? No of course you don&rsquo;t, monsters don&rsquo;t have souls do they? Well let me tell you this &ldquo;Summoner&rdquo; one day you will realize what you have done and you will pay dearly for it, but until then have fun playing your &ldquo;game&rdquo; after all it must be a real riot controlling other peoples lives, who they kill, how they are killed. You known some of us just wanted to help others, now all we do is kill. Well I guess my time is up, the rift calls me to battle, I wonder who I am to kill today, not that it maters anymore anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"AdcStoleMyAs5ist","date":"2016-07-12T01:29:57.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't forget the mass-slaughter of countless minions.\n\nAt least we _intentionally_ spare the Cannons, amirite? {{champion:412}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:01:12.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Ahri please don't hate me I only play this game because I love you Q_Q","replies":[]}]}
