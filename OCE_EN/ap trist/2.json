I am not a fan of tanks or bruisers and really liked Poppy since she could be a hyper carry and i personally found that extremely fun, as well as her design being awesome. Anyway would i be open to justifiable bans if i play her as a hyper carry even if its not optimal and i am potentially losing my team the game since other champs would fit that role a lot better. I understand the fact the whole game is about winning with &#039;fun&#039; somewhat taking a backseat to it but I wasn&#039;t really up for getting back into league except for the Poppy remake.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nOh and sorry if this is in the wrong board.","replies":[]}
