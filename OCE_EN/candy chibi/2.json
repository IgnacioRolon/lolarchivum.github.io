If it's too sensitive the screen can get pretty wild on you and make it easy to lose your champ. Not sensitive enough though and it can make urgent movement/vision difficult.\n\nDo some practice in some custom solo games and play around with all the settings to get the right feel. Using space to re-center is a must have imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-09-27T06:39:43.955+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like maybe you're playing without space bar? By default space bar with relock the camera for as long as you hold it, so if you are struggling to follow your champ in fights you can hold space, then just release when you need the extra screen space and vision. That's how I play anyway and it works well enough for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-27T06:37:57.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The better question is how do you play with a locked camera, if you lose yourself while looking around the map press space bar and it will bring you back to your champion unless you have changed your key bindings","replies":[]}]}
