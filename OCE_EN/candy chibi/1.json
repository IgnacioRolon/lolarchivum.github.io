Although you can go {{item:3072}}  or even just {{item:1038}}  then go into your attack speed item. Usually {{item:3085}} but {{item:3046}}  is also good.\n\nMy Jinx full build is usually something like: {{item:3031}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3139}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3072}}\n\nFirecracker Jinx is her best skin but the Slayer Jinx is cool too (though you can only buy it on Halloween).","replies":[{"poster":"Candy Chibi","date":"2016-05-07T07:25:39.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you BarryButcher for this.\nPersons say me to pick an ignite on adc --'\nThe items is very good thank you\nAnd i can say you i have all the skins of jinx ! :3 i have slayer mafia and fireckarcker. thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-05-07T10:17:36.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heal is what most ADC's take.  Ignite is err... You can take it if you really want it, but heal is a generally better option.
