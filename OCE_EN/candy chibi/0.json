She is very safe, has consistent DPS with AOE dmg output thanks to the commonly used hurricane build. She also has long range, traps, a slow and gapclose and very long range execute. This makes her SUPER safe as a pick in a majority of team compositions and is one of the easier ADC's to play in general.\n\nAside from that she is just pretty strong overall for ADC's at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-19T20:30:46.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drrrrrraaaaaaaavvvveeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-19T09:40:30.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I like Jinx because at some point in the game, you just do AOE crits and melt the enemy team from a safe range. It feels really good. Plus, her attack speed buff makes CSing and getting objectives a whole lot easier.","replies":[]}]}
