Thanks for your time, I&#039;ll be waiting for a reply:) \r\n\r\n {{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"VaniIla Magik","date":"2016-12-03T22:13:38.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be abused man thats why you cant do it imagine the higher elo players where the population isn't very big a loss of 20lp and a gain of 45 points in total. will never happen","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-03T23:42:55.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very stupid idea.
