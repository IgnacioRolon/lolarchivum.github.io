I was solo and the counter kept ticking so I was like okay, then when it got to zero it kicked me out of queue and I went to go queue up and now I&#039;m sitting here for another full 20 minutes. This isn&#039;t all, I&#039;ve also had trouble inviting and joining certain people&#039;s games etc, I&#039;ve repaired my client and it still didn&#039;t do anything, please fix. Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Davidson","date":"2016-08-17T08:22:41.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been happening since yday, i was at an internet cafe too","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-17T06:37:31.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like it may be the result of a connection issue on your end.\n\nCould you please run through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article and let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]}]}
