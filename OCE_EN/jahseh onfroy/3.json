I get bad people who I swear aren&#039;t even level 30 yet on other peoples accounts EVERY SINGLE GAME. And it&#039;s not that I can&#039;t carry it&#039;s simply that I cannot carry these teams... Can you please look into my matchmaking algorithm and see if anything is twisted because Jesus Christ it&#039;s getting out of hand, 2 years in and it still hasn&#039;t changed.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-10-29T01:52:41.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain and I think that the only way to move forward it to hope and pray that it is your enemy who gets all the noobs and not your team :) I personally think it get better as you move up through the ranks.. bronze 5 was literally the worst thing in the game but as soon as I got on a roll and started climbing things got a lot better. Trust and good luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-29T08:10:22.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you get trapped in bronze 5 put your account details on the board after telling your friends your leaving this one to make another account. Unless you wanna try and leave Bronze 5 but I wish you the best of luck. I personally recommend duoing with a Silver 1 or 2 so you get mixed with bronze 1 or low silver.","replies":[]}]}]}
