I have received no updates or any communication at all for a whole fortnight. Last I heard (3+ weeks ago), I gave them my details and they said they were passing this on to the team handling this specific area. Is anything actually happening? I'm super stoked we are getting this stuff, don't get me wrong, but waiting a month? With no word? It has really soured what could have been an awesome thing!\n\nI just want an update. Seriously. \"We are on it\". That's not too much to ask right? Riot always lauding their own transparency, but this feels pretty opaque ><\n\nI post one of these every now and again, but have never gotten a red post back. I just want someone to tell me what's going on and have no idea where to turn. Updating my ticket yields no response, which further makes me think I have been forgotten about.\n\nNot cool Riot, not cool O.o\n\nAnyone in a similar situation? God I want my twitch so bad it hurts =P","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-12T11:23:03.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the robots said that to me, I eventually got a response saying they can't do anything about it.
