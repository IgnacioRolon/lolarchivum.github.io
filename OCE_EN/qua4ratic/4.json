I appreciate it will take time, but after sending several tickets to support just asking for an update and getting no response, i'm getting quite frustrated. Last I heard (two weeks ago), my info had been passed on to the team handling this stuff, but I never heard anything from them.\r\n\r\nI just want an update -  surely that's not too much to ask?\r\n\r\nI'm super grateful referrals form NA are being credited, but couldn't the process be more transparent? Just let me know how far along you are. or at least reply to me saying 'We are on it'. Hearing nothing just leaves me wondering if its ever going to happen :(\r\n\r\nA reply would be greatly appreciated, as I've now given up asking support, they don't seem interested in replying,\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T09:41:10.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they are robots.

But a fortnight later, I'd like to know what's happening and haven't had any contact back  O.o","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-01T04:29:24.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a real shame.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Qua4ratic","date":"2015-03-01T03:17:57.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's even been longer than that, here's a shot attached.\n\nIs this how long support takes? Never really had to deal with them, fortunately. Or is this just not 'important' enough? I just want an update ffs, I don't mind at all how long it takes, just keep me in the loop? I am ultimately grateful Riot is doing this at all, but when it's handled like this it ruins it somewhat >","replies":[]}]}
