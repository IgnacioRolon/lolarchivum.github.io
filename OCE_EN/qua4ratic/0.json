I ask, because I got quite  few people into the game while we were languishing in NA and it felt pretty bad when we left NA and that progress didn't come with me becuase OCE didn't have refer a friend then :( hell, if i move back while its' free, would i get it then? Does that even make sense? I don't care that much, but the acknowledgement with a cool skin would be sweet :D\r\n\r\nI sent a ticket to support when the new refer a friend was announced but as always they were vague and unhelpful and I can't even recall exactly what they said. Perhaps now that the program is more imminent they'd be more helpful, but I'd love a local rioters take on this. Shouldn't we be acknowledged for introducing people to the game even when we had 200+ ping to grapple with? \r\n\r\nI'm sure i'm not the only, LoL is huge, no less so in OCE. But with all my friends already rapidly addicted, who else could I refer =P\r\n\r\nThanks ","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-01T23:54:57.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I already have the refer a friend skins though.","replies":[{"poster":"Qua4ratic","date":"2015-02-02T07:14:19.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From back in the NA days?\n\nthat shouldn't stop anyone else having an opportunity to get them though :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Qua4ratic","date":"2015-01-31T13:21:18.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, so we aren't getting it at all?\n\nweak sauce Rito :(","replies":[{"poster":"Aesirs Chosen","date":"2015-01-31T22:55:44.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there was another thread that had a red comment, said that we would get it but it might be delayed.\nNo word on whether we would get any past progress.\n\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/IJIEEbYa-refer-a-friend","replies":[{"poster":"Qua4ratic","date":"2015-02-01T09:10:39.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I saw that back then, I assumed that the extra time had now passed and that's why I assumed we were getting it :D\n\nSent in another support ticket, they said they couldn't comment on a not yet live feature ><\n\nNo actual specifics on whether OCE even gets it, even though I specifically asked.\n\nFingers crossed I guess...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2015-02-01T04:01:50.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea make a deal, if we dont have refer a friend program put grey warwrick and medical twitch on the shop for us to buy it, really like that 2 skin and it makes me feel sucks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-31T11:35:15.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the feature Riot should be scrambling to bring to OCE, since other features are denied due to population.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-01-31T11:30:07.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was meant to be in OCE a while ago.
