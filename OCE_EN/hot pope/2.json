{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-11T08:42:26.663+0000","title":"Riot gave me a chat restriction for escalating anger from repetition","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"im sorry riot, im not going to take this lying down, this is a very unfair chat restriction, in game 1 I was trolled super hard by a premade 4 team. Only because I took an extra wave so I didn&#039;t get pushed to tower and lose my tower before starting the thing that comes before baron, our master yi who was premade 4 with the rest of the team got angry at me and took the pushing buff and let the minions get to my tower and destroy it, not only that but he waited at base until I got out of the lane to go to the camp and I waited there and lost 2 waves of minions in return, I gave my team extremely valuable information that no other bronze player would give, telling my team to take advantage of it and they completely ignored me, just from this game, I got 4 reports, my team got a report from me and the whole enemy team who felt bad for me after poppy ulting a whole team away after I ulted 5 people as malphite. I was in a good mood until premade 4 team started to troll me. If there isn&#039;t a justification system in the tribunal, I&#039;m sorry, but the system is not working correctly. I am a very salty summoner but it&#039;s games like this that make people salty, premades should be 2 or 5 only, our team was super fed and lost on purpose just to make me angrier than I already was when they trolled me. Extremely justified.\r\n\r\nGame 2, I was in a terrible matchup from champion select, I though the enemy was running lux support and instead went mid so I went morgana thinking I&#039;d have countered her. Then the enemy team picks blitzcrank and I&#039;m thinking oh well I can counter blitzcrank but our adc was playing jinx and wasn&#039;t moving in between auto attacks to land last hits on creeps and she got pulled every second pull because I had black shield down. She was csing like a god but when she started dying she really fell behind and forced the whole team behind with how fed the enemy adc got out of it, this was a ranked game, I couldn&#039;t report her for being unskilled because riot took that away, it needs to come back, I&#039;m sure you get a whole lot more unreasonable reports than real ones but this jinx seemed like she had played beginner bot games all the way to level 30, I wish I was kidding. &quot;Turretting&quot; is a very bad style of play that should only be used when there isn&#039;t remotely a sign of danger, not moving in between auto attacks, just auto attacking. having blitzcrank in the enemy team in the lane with pull up and being in front of the allied minions while turretting is complete misplay, there isn&#039;t an excuse for it, league of legends has the longest tutorial period in any game ever, this was a ranked game, it is to be taken seriously and constant misplay can&#039;t be swept under the rug, im not a pro but I&#039;ve played since season 1 and many games I&#039;ve made crazy plays and almost every game I&#039;m a shotcaller because no one else in this elo can take charge and make proper decisions, its when these decisions are ignored that everything goes south and constant repetion of instructions makes everyone mad, in gaming and real life, a boss who has to repeat their instructions more than once is going to get fed up, I don&#039;t WANT to be the shotcaller, no one takes responsibility to be a shotcaller, and with the game knowledge and sources of higher level play around me, I&#039;m always kept up with what&#039;s strong, what to look out for, what to punish, what to avoid, I don&#039;t care how salty a team is, as long as they want to do their best and are sincerely apologetic of their mistakes, I&#039;m more than happy to play with these players, it&#039;s Australia, probably the strongest language country in the world, insults are practically customs, repetition and increased annoyance after repetition is more than justified, if you can&#039;t by any means understand my point of view and how salt is produced by things like this, then you could just add a system that doesn&#039;t just take elo/mmr into fact but also game experience, someone who just got to level 30 just by doing beginner bots over and over shouldn&#039;t be matched with someone that started ranked play in season 4 and has played in multiple accounts in 2 servers since season 1. There should be a reason to click the option when you make your account &quot;seasoned veteran to MOBAs&quot; in terms of difficulty matchmaking, because it isn&#039;t making a difference, I&#039;m not being matched with experienced players in my team lmao.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Riot needs to open up whole chatlogs and not just the person who was reported and pick the real offender out of the two, not force both because one party chose to be a player who&#039;s hard to play with or against. Stop taking things out of context and form it as a trial for all parties involved, by law if someone kills someone else in means of self defense it is completely justified by the law systems and don&#039;t even have to pay any charges. The way that the tribunal is run is as if it were preschool children throwing sand at eachother in the sand pit, one kid gets completely blinded by sand while the other kid is just covering his face and throwing it blindly to try to stop the other. As childish as the league community may seem, I feel like we should be treated like adults and with it, the tribunal should also take a look at why the player was provoked to say this. In most cases you&#039;ll find that the other players were a lot more toxic in terms of their play or even their words.\r\n\r\nI shouldn&#039;t have to complain about childish cases like this, neither should Riot treat this as a chance to give out as many restrictions to players as katarina gives daggers. I hope you take this case and very very similar cases to this (which happen extremely often) properly in the future.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll leave you with the chat logs of just me so you can criticize me further if you want to, but I&#039;m sure if you collect the logs of the whole game (which you&#039;ll have because they were also reported except the jinx because I couldn&#039;t actually report her for being an inexperienced player) and you piece it together, you&#039;re going to see things much clearer.\r\n\r\n- Hot Pope\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nHot Pope: whos top?\r\nHot Pope: laneswap in

I don't killsteal and have never cared when someone flash ult executes something that I could have finished with an auto attack even when I played mid or adc hoping to get fed. Why? because all I care about is being competitive, if the enemy is dead we've achieved something to put them at a disadvantage and can use that to get an objective for free. Opportunities are ALL I play league for and Riot takes my power to shotcall away for putting people in the line that they genuinely deserve to be in. If you're not landing 1 blitzcrank pull, I will understand that it's tough to land, I'll understand that the enemy team has a morgana, I will understand that you don't want to play aggressive because their jungler is camping bot (extremely rare case). I will not understand or put up with them just running into the enemy team and putting our whole team at a disadvantage just because they felt like it, it's ranked, do your best and play to win. I'm now considering only ever playing with my friend irl and focusing on other games, dropping my hours to as much as less than a game a day. There's a lot of games which don't force me to yell at trolls because the games themselves are anti-troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-13T09:04:05.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1TWuMzlG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-11T08:58:54.215+0000)\n>\n> It sucks when other people are being toxic towards you, but responding in kind only makes it worse.

The actual extent of what people go to to troll is to the point where it makes me not want to play the game but not playing is an offense. so instead I try to play, they anger me more, I can't just NOT say anything, im pissed, i can't stop myself from being angry, no one can, Riot, no one can, we all were made with all feelings. it's like someone throws a shoe at your head and your only choice is to ignore it. keep ignoring and see what happens, they'll group up on you, throw shoes, gum, gluesticks, rulers, pens, anything they can get just to poke curiously waiting for something to happen. are you REALLY just going to let that continue? I was given tolerance for a reason, if Riot doesn't justify this I will forever speak extremely badly about the tribunal, for all this time that it has been completely non-existent and I complain for there not being one, I put 4 reports in and receive 4. If Riot didn't read the whole chatlog, and put it in the hands of the tribunal ONLY showing my posts, then that's a moronic way to deal with it. If you allow people to be thrown stones at, while being the moderator of the situation and punish the victim, the victim is going to be extremely un-trusting of the moderator, being in this case Riot and the tribunal. It's not me being a keyboard warrior, which is really what Riot is targeting, I'd say that to their face if not act on their behavior, it makes me human, not aggressive. Bulls aren't generally aggressive until they're taunted. Why wave a red flag? By doing this Riot actually have made me dislike them more than the troll team. Not only that but I've played 7/10 games of my chat restriction since I received the restriction and it resets after every game saying 10/10 with the same 2 chatlogs seen in this thread. \n\nWould you rather lose players who were being trolled and uninstalled the game because they couldn't deal with it or would you rather force solo low priority queue on trolls who would still actually play because they want to play with their friends again? Extremely stupid way to deal with things, Riot and the Tribunal, I couldn't be more disappointed, legit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-11T09:31:55.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ScvAJG51V4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-15T05:16:01.090+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Deserved chat restriction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-11T09:11:05.540+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You were an ass, that doesn't excuse the premade being an ass, but you were an ass none the less.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-13T09:07:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I wanted the team to win though, I was doing my best to help, words don't help a team win, actions do, their only actions were to troll.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-13T09:35:46.839+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Hot Pope: shittiest gank\nHot Pope: poppy\nHot Pope: you are trash\nHot Pope: you knocked her away\nHot Pope: ok premade %%%gots.\nHot Pope: nice chains\nHot Pope: you sure?\nHot Pope: report poppy please.\nHot Pope: you're an absolute fuckwit\nHot Pope: you will never ever get a job\nHot Pope: because you lack teamwork\nHot Pope: i hope you fucking rot scrub.\nHot Pope: i dont care if you're a fucking terrorist mate.\nHot Pope: stop being a fucking dingaling and push a lane\nHot Pope: im reporting all of you for griefing\nHot Pope: i hope you know\nHot Pope: youre the kind of %%%%s that make salty people\nHot Pope: without you there isnt salt in oce\nHot Pope: **please hang yourself with chainsaw chains**.\nHot Pope: cancer team\n\nThis is just bits and pieces from the report log that you showed.\n\nPlease tell me how this is going to help you win, or how this was helping, please i'm intrigued, especially the second last line which i bolded for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-15T02:05:30.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1TWuMzlG,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-03-13T09:35:46.839+0000)\n>\n> Hot Pope: poppy\n> Hot Pope: you are trash\n> Hot Pope: you knocked her away\n> Hot Pope: ok premade %%%gots.\n> Hot Pope: nice chains\n> Hot Pope: you sure?\n> Hot Pope: report poppy please.\n> Hot Pope: you're an absolute fuckwit\n> Hot Pope: you will never ever get a job\n> Hot Pope: because you lack teamwork\n> Hot Pope: i hope you fucking rot scrub.\n> Hot Pope: i dont care if you're a fucking terrorist mate.\n> Hot Pope: stop being a fucking dingaling and push a lane\n> Hot Pope: im reporting all of you for griefing\n> Hot Pope: i hope you know\n> Hot Pope: youre the kind of %%%%s that make salty people\n> Hot Pope: without you there isnt salt in oce\n> Hot Pope: **please hang yourself with chainsaw chains**.\n> Hot Pope: cancer team\n> \n> This is just bits and pieces from the report log that you showed.\n> \n> Please tell me how this is going to help you win, or how this was helping, please i'm intrigued, especially the second last line which i bolded for you.\n\nI like how you read the whole chat log, oh wait you didn't, Riot kept that from you. By the way the \"nice chains\" was actually a compliment, leblanc landed 1 chain that stopped me from dying and then after the enmy flashed behind her trying to get away she landed the purple chains striaght after they flashed without getting the snare from the first chain, and it chain-cced perfectly, this was of course in the early game where they just wanted to reap free kills wherever they could. This was a premade 4 that had the intention of trolling before they started the game. I got 5 man ultimates as I actually said and you didn't take it as part of the context because all you focus is on the negative, poppy knocked all my 5 man ults away and the team disengaged when I got gamechanging ultimates that would have easily got us won fights, they were doing it on purpose just because I stayed for 1 wave of minions at top and master yi took the rift thing and recalled then started to jungle, I said it could have gone to better use and from then they started trolling. I wish I could show you the clip, you would laugh at Riot's portrayal of me compared to my team. I'm sure that a terribly toxic player shouldn't make a toxic player look any better, I more than understand that, my chat restriction is more than over, and I fear that with the attitude that some players use (like afking and trolling) I might have to disable my chat completely until I don't get any more of those players, just last game we had a lucian who facedove into a fed xin zhao over and over just to try to prove he can do something by himself, the only thing he achieved without the whole team peeling xin zhao off was feeding, he then afked when we were coming back late game, and now I can't report him because I'm stuck in an endless \"Waiting for stats\" page. So I have to ignore it and go about my business constantly taking toxic behavior to the face and being unable to report it to riot while I get chat restrictions for getting trolled by a premade 4 in a ranked game. I have to skip waiting for stats just because. Poppy had got me killed by knocking someone who I flashed away from into me and then she died too. I told it as it is in terms of teammates, I don't care who you are in real life, if you put 100% into the game then you're playing ranked correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-15T05:12:10.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how you ignored the fact that you basically told people to kill themselves, by hanging themselves with chainsaw chains.\n\nI don't give a fuck what they did, that is totally unacceptable, and in my personal opinion deserves a straight ban from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-16T02:07:55.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They told me they hope I get cancer.

I don't care what you take more seriously, but if you troll a game in the lcs, you are fired, shamed on social media everywhere, flamed for it, obtain a terrible reputation, and you'll most probably never play in a pro team again.

Even Dota 2 has a \"if someone leaves or afks, it is safe to leave the game without a timer for you\".","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-16T22:38:05.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You know what, i am making a ticket with this boards thread in it, and i hope you actually get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2016-03-20T10:02:27.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think you're getting way too personal with this case, you shouldn't be hoping for anyone to get banned, kind of ironic.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
