I was on game 6 last night when my area suffered a blackout due to weather conditions, FACT, no doubt my team lost and I received a \"leave\" status for that match. However it has been recorded that I have played 7 out of 10 games, so I am curious, where is this 7th game I have played? it has not been recorded ANYWHERE, because it does not exist.\r\nSo am I to believe that riot has ghosted me an extra negative result game due to my leave, of by which was \"out of my physical hands\" or \"result of severe weather\" sorry but I cannot control the weather I am not a god, it would be nice, but lets face it, just human. so is riot penalizing me 2 games for one which was,( hang on if you have ever posted a ticket you will LOVE THIS) \"BEYOND MY CONTROL\" heard that before?\r\nappreciate a red response although that's probably BEYOND YOUR CONTROL too huh.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-02T07:57:12.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">sorry but I cannot control the weather I am not a god\n\nMade me giggle.
