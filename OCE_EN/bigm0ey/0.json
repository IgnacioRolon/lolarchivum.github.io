But he is extremely weak when it comes to defense and does not have any  escape mechanism whatsoever. He can barely escape a gank and always needs to have his W ready in order to have a higher chance of escaping so he can either slow them down or stun the enemy jgler or the enemy laner, but even his W takes a long time to roll as well. and his E is almost useless and it takes even more longer to stack if your going for AP Twisted Fate{{champion:4}} , I mean look at his win rate and ban rate, and his popularity, he is extremely difficult to play with and is long due for a buff/rework","replies":[{"poster":"Courtless","date":"2020-02-07T11:29:37.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely does not need a rework. Could do with a slight damage buff and a slight decrease in channel time for his ultimate but apart from that Twisted Fate is a very fun champion to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2020-01-07T09:50:31.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You brought up the things that make him balanced lol\n\nHe is a burst mage, he's designed to clear, roam, kill and repeat, having an escape would make him broken, same with having defensive stats any higher than they are.\n\nStun card - designed for this exact purpose, so that no brain gold or lowers can't just faceroll and win because they have Gold card up always, if you wanna escape a gank, ward, and don't over extend without vision\n\nE - Free gold???? what do you mean useless, he gets 1-6g for any minion he kills with stacked deck or otherwise, its called learning to farm, maybe try it sometime\n\nWR/BR is subjective, and doesn't actually indicated whether a character needs a nerf or buff, unless they are ridiculously low or high\n\nDifficult? No, skill requiring? Yes","replies":[]}]}
