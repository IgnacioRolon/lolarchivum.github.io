To me personally, it seems like a 750rp skin. one way that they could of made the skin more valuable would be to change the color scheme of her Q animation. instead of using the same Q color scheme, they could of maybe added in a little bit more of the victorious color scheme (blue, silver, gold) into in Q tale animation and even do the same for her W and E. this will help to separate it from the rest of the Sivir skins.\n\noverall, the looks of the character does suit the theme of the victorious well, good job RIOT on making the skin but a few little tweaks would make it truly a victorious skin to talk about","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-30T00:45:23.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like it, but if I had to find something I'd want to change...Her hair for one, brown feels kinda boring for a Victorious skin but that's just personal preference talking. The only other thing would be the colour scheme on her armour. All the other Victorious skins are a mix of silver, gold and blue, so it seems a bit strange that Siv is suddenly purple. I understand they like to slowly evolve themes like these but maybe if it was a...blue-r purple? The silver on her armour is really blue tinted too and I kinda wish it would be less so.\n\nBut that's my take, in the end I still love the skin it just doesn't match the others as much as I think it could while still being a cool and unique skin :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-29T23:28:53.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's meh for me.","replies":[]}]}
