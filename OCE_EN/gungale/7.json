As some of you may have already heard, Calvin &ldquo;k1ng&rdquo; Truong has moved on to join Legacy Esports as their new AD Carry. Before we continue, we would like to take a moment to thank Calvin for his memorable time with us, being a crucial part of our success last year.  \r\n\r\nFollowing Calvin&rsquo;s departure, Samuel &ldquo;NADA&rdquo; Woo will no longer be with the team. After trialing NADA along with several other supports throughout the preseason, we decided to go with another candidate. Samuel joined us at a critical time last year after the retirement of Trevor &ldquo;ChuffeR&rdquo; Lao, and we wish him the best of luck with his future career.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, we&rsquo;re excited to announce the acquisition of Quin &ldquo;Raes&rdquo; Korebrits and Mike &ldquo;Cuden&rdquo; Le! Both new faces to the professional scene and will be beginning their careers in the OPL as Dire Wolves AD Carry and Support respectively. On top of this, Richard &ldquo;Perfection&rdquo; Su will now be known as &ldquo;Phantiks&rdquo;, an alias that he has previously gone by. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I am grateful for the opportunity to be Dire Wolves new AD Carry. You will quickly see me take the title of the best ADC in Oceania and I am excited to represent our region at the World Championship&rdquo; - Quin &ldquo;Raes&rdquo; Korebrits\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It has been my dream to play in the OPL and I am honoured to be joining a team with some of the best players in the region. I look forward to proving myself as the top support player in Oceania.&rdquo; - Mike &ldquo;Cuden&rdquo; Le\r\n\r\nTeam Owner and Manager, Nathan &ldquo;Rippii&rdquo; Mott had this to say, &ldquo;Finding replacements for k1ng and NADA was definitely a challenge, however, we are extremely happy with Raes and Cuden and are confident in their ability as fresh young talent in the scene. Combined with our established players on the other side of the map, I am excited to show Dire Wolves fans our new lineup in OPL 2016.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nFollowing these changes, the DW LoL roster is as follows:\r\nCurtis &ldquo;Sharp&rdquo; Morgan | Top\r\nLachlan &ldquo;Sybol&rdquo; Civil | Jungle\r\nRichard &ldquo;Phantiks&rdquo; Su | Mid\r\nQuin &ldquo;Raes&rdquo; Korebrits | AD Carry\r\nMike &ldquo;Cuden&rdquo; Le | Support\r\n\r\nWe hope you will continue to support us this season! #wolfpack","replies":[]}
