I had the blue animation thingo around my character but I couldn&#039;t execute a minion for the gold until I had another stack. I know for sure I had a stack of the relic shield beforehand but after I finally gained another stack, it only gave me one. Just found it really annoying that the relic shield shows the blue spherical animation (as I had a stack of relic shield when I sold the item) but I don&#039;t get to see the timer for the next stack, and when I do get the next stack, I don&#039;t have the two stacks I should have.\r\n\r\nNot a gamebreaking bug but could affect games and not sure if anyone else has pointed it out so I thought I would.","replies":[]}
