I had 2 wins and 2 losses, this game decided whether or not I would rank up. However in my last game I had died to the mid lane whilst taking scuttle and was abused for it, shortly after the talon on my team had began to feed the enemy on purpose without giving a reason other than you mad, after he fed 8 kills Shen left due to Talon. I honestly think that this it was unfair entirely and this isn't the first time it has happened in promos and other ranked games\nIf you care to see I have left a link above.\nHas anyone else experience this kind of obnoxious behaviour in ranked or is it just me\nAnd if there is actually anything I can do about this please let me know, other then reporting him\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T13:12:40.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">other then reporting him\n\nHow do you expect that to happen?
