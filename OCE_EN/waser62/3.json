Rest assured that we haven't forgotten about you, and you will still be getting your prize - it's taking us a little bit longer to put together than we expected, though. I'll try and provide an update as soon as I've got one - you're totally right that we should have reached out before now with some information.\n\nThanks,\nAchenar","replies":[{"poster":"waser62","date":"2015-09-26T08:25:17.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks cheers for the heads up","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2015-10-21T00:52:42.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Waser,\n\nA quick update - I've just popped your prize in the post!
