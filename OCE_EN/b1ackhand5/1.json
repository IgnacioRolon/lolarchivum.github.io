However, player behavior in League has been at record bests due to a few different systems that were implemented while Tribunal is being re-worked.\n> \n> 1) The new LeaverBuster has been out for 2 months now, and has pushed leavers/AFKs to a record low in the history of League. I'm hoping to share more data around this when we wrap up analyses.\n> \n> 2) The machine learning system has been extremely aggressive at combating racism, homophobia, sexism and death threats. Right now, these types of behaviors show up in approximately 2% of games globally. An interesting \"test\" is to think about your last few games, and think about the last time you actually saw someone use the \"n\" word, or c*nt, or similar obscene phrases.\n> \n> 3) There is a new intentional feeder detection system that has been banning out intentional feeders outright. We have a record low in number of players who are actually intentionally feeding (the old days of 0-20 and 5 Zeals are gone).\n> \n> But, this is not an excuse for the Tribunal's delay. It just turns out that re-working the Tribunal required re-working several foundational pieces of League, such as the Report System's backend, how chat logs are generated on the platform, and how websites/front-ends are created across every server. When players think of \"just\" re-working the Tribunal, they don't think about all these other pieces which are each complex systems.\n> \n> In addition to the above, the new Tribunal will have the ability for players to review positive behaviors and reward players with in-game bonuses, and some algorithmic upgrades to improve efficiency of the system, accuracy in detecting troll voters, and improves overall system accuracy.\n> \n> I'm happy to answer some questions for a bit tonight, but apologize for the delay in the system coming back.","replies":[{"poster":"b1ackhand5","date":"2015-07-21T01:00:32.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=2JEdgxqN,comment-id=00000001000000000000,timestamp=2015-07-03T01:03:08.225+0000)\n>\n> Not sure how you got that impression?

But there are still a hand full of people that still showing negative attitude.\nHere are some suggestion and questions:\n2)  The machine learning system need to have more words put it and detecting sentences as well rather than just the word, as people sometimes use offensive words for a different meaning rather that cursing their teammates, i.e. \"F**king c**t didnt you hear the ping\" \"S**t this n****r is good\"\n3) I would like to know at what k/d does Intentional feeder detection system detects as feeding, and maybe the system needs to detect a lower feeding k/d as people will feed right of the bat when they didnt get the role they wanted of they just got bored of the game from having a losing streak as all the league tier have the same format making it harder for people and me in the lower tier to rank up.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-21T02:14:51.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nGlad that things are getting better from your perspective.\n\nAs for your points;\n\n1) The machine learning/instant feedback system doesn't just detect certain words. \n\"The system does not just look at words, and tries to learn phrases. In fact, \"gg easy\" is considered a very negative phrase by the system today.\"\n\nYou can also see a good answer about something similar here - http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/130891598530\n\n2) The intentional feeder detection system doesn't only look at Kills/Deaths ratio. There are a lot of other factors we take into consideration as well. This is something that has been asked by the community before because they were afraid they would be punished as an intentional feeder for having a bad game.\n\n\"We'd rarely (if ever) ban a player for having one poor game--we may ban a player if it's super, extremely obvious they were intentional feeding in one game. We have a huge dataset at our disposal and can clearly see what's typical for a game, and what's one, two, three standard deviations for a game. We can also determine how you normally play in one game with a brand new champion first how you play in another game with a brand new champion to determine how much of an outlier one of the matches were.\"\n\n\"One of the reasons this test took awhile to prepare was because we were looking at dozens of variables to determine what would be a good identifier of an intentional feeder versus a player just having a bad game.\n\nBecause we're starting conservatively, we'll be aiming the tests at higher severity cases of intentional feeding first and then reviewing if there were any false positives. Once we're confident in this initial test, we'll expand the tests to include more nuanced forms of intentional feeding.\n\nSo, for the first test, because we're being more conservative with the net, super confident in its accuracy.\"\n\nYou can find both these comments by Riot Lyte here - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/oH6zB1eg-detecting-and-banning-extreme-intentional-feeders","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kirst93","date":"2015-06-21T09:14:02.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Im sorry but this answer is a cop out...
