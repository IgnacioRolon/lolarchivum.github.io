Just like it suggests I want to give a rundown of currently &#039;OP&#039; champions **cough** urgot **cough**   {{champion:6}} and I would love the communities feedback on who is currently OP? So far I&#039;ve seen {{champion:8}} Vladimir at work, Ahri, Azir, Draven, Vayne, Alistar and a few more. However really looking for your opinion on who is OP? Would love to know what people have been struggling against and loving.
