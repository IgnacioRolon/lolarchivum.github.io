This time it&#039;s Koi Nami\n\nI started off with the Purple version (All lulu mains know why purple comes first)\nAfter finishing the colour palate swap I had to change the background because for whatever\nreason purple didn&#039;t like the original so I went with a sunset.\n\nAfter adding in the glows and some extra effects to give it a nice fantasy like feeling while still trying to keep\nto it&#039;s oriental look I got what you see here https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3z68E\n\nI also was nice enough to make the yellow one as well\nhttps://www.artstation.com/artwork/4OWqq\n\nI really hope you like them, I&#039;m still new to this so they may not be the best but I will get better.\nIf you have a chroma you want to see made into the splash or me to make a custom one of your choice out\nof existing splashes please let me know {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2017-10-31T20:55:34.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanna see a chroma version of mecha sion please, It will be good if it's similar to transformers.(Bumblebee/Optimus Prime/Megatron).","replies":[]}]}
