This happened every time and made it extremely annoying to try and stun because she could just get away anyway and avoid my W and damage.\r\n\r\nThis really needs to be fixed because it&#039;s making playing against these kind of champs really annoying and unfair {{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-29T07:24:16.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trist's W has an activation time but not an interruptible cast time which is what makes it look weird, there's a wind up but not one that can be interrupted with a stun. \n\nA snare/root will stop her jump because it disables movement, but a stun only disables action, so even if she gets stunned she will continue through the air and just be unable to do anything else. \n\nIt makes sense if you think about it, she's flying through the air, even if she gets stunned that's not going to stop her trajectory.","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-10-31T16:22:47.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but isn't Morgana's Q a root?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-01T03:53:23.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was under the impression you were referring to Morgana's ult.
