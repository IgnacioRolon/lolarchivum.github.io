Maybe perhaps have the hosting region be allowed to have 3 (since hosting countries in most sports usually have some sort special thing).","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-09-21T13:46:27.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree with that defiantly, 2 teams is fair. What isn't fair is giving the big regions  who are known for winning 3 teams or more while\nsmaller ones get 1. It just means we will get knocked out sooner :( why didn't they let both chiefs and DW in to worlds? would of made things better","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-09-20T10:02:57.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.\n\nThey've already changed the format to include the \"play in\" tournament which will allow lesser teams such as OCE, Japan, Turkey etc to play against the 3rd/2nd seed teams from \"bigger\" regions.\nCertainly more fair then having all the smaller regions fight for 1 spot at Worlds. Now 4 spots are up for grabs.\n\n**For smaller teams to make it to Worlds, thats a big enough feat then to actually think about winning it.**\n\nAlso Team seedings were based off MSI results not just given away. The reason Korea has 3 auto qualifiers is because SKT won MSI. The reason Gigabyte Marines (a team from Vietnam) are auto qualified is because they were the highest ranked \"Wildcard\" team at MSI which also meant Vietnam get 2 spots instead of 1, with their 2nd seed going into the play-in.\n\nI think its more fair then ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-09-21T13:49:57.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still it would be nice if we could at least have 2 teams minimum per region.\nStill rooting for DW regardless, its our region after all despite all the hate being thrown","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-20T10:27:29.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate the third Korean team is better than all of Opl put together. Riot is pretty good at changing worlds to reflect the state of the game. If it was just one team from each region it would just be a team like SKT trashing the smaller teams on the way to an easy worlds win.","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-09-21T13:48:15.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean either way it seems SKT is going to beat everyone, still that said does Korea even need 3 teams? they have SKT\nand that's all they need apparently. As said below maybe 2 teams for each region would be better instead of 1 minimum.

Which this year would be longzhu not SKT. It's to make worlds competitive. \n\nThe FIFA World Cup doesn't have one or two teams per region. Cause other wise it would simply be whoever qualified come Europe or South America winning every four years. \n\nThere are ways for the smaller teams to get more than 1 team into worlds. They just need to perform well at MSI. Like the gigabyte marines, which is why the GPL has two spots. \n\nNot to mention some of the smaller regions only have one good team. Take Lyon gaming for instances from Latin America North. They have won that league like 8 times in a row. But they got trashed at MSI. What chance does a second team from that league have?\n\nRiot is pretty good at changing things as the smaller regions get better. I wouldn't be surprised if we get a permanent CIS spot in the groups. Depending on how Gambit do. The play ins are a good thing. It gives the smaller teams a chance to knock off the third place teams of a region. If in a couple of years another region is destroying the third place team from one of the regions with one it will probably get taken away from them and given to one of the up and coming region. Frankly I will be suprised if the LMS hold onto there third worlds spot. Flash Wolves and AHQ never seem to live up to the hype so I'm not sold on a third team from there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
