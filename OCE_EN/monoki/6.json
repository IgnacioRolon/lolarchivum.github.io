I&#039;m sorry but yes there are plenty of champs out there\r\nthat you think should get pretty ultimate skins but at the end of the day can&#039;t we even consider how much work and effort went into making this skin?\r\nI met someone who worked on the DJ Sona skin and she said it took 2 years! so how about stop complaining when these people\r\nworked their asses off to make this skin for us. \r\n\r\nI play lux and I&#039;m happy they made her a new skin, yes they just did the star guardian thing but guys that&#039;s not even a new skin for lux, only an update and a bunch of new skins for OTHER CHAMPIONS! it wasn&#039;t JUST ABOUT LUX\r\n\r\none more thing, why am I suddenly being complained at for playing Lux as a support now?\r\nshe is a support!\r\n\r\nStuns, slows, shields, CC and I don&#039;t know if you all have realized this but .... NOT EVERY SUPPORT HEALS YOU.\r\nI&#039;m just saying there&#039;s no Issue with playing Lux as a support and sorry if you have had bad Lux player&#039;s but\r\nas a Support main and lvl 6 Lux who get&#039;s a lot of good feedback from their team during game.

PF Ez was more ambitious than anything they'd ever done. So was SG Udyr, and DJ Sona, and now Elementalist Lux. There's a whole lot of new stuff going into these skins AND they have to make it all fit within League's world and art style.\n\nYou seem to think art, especially art on this scale with this much collaboration is easy, and that just ain't so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2016-12-11T09:31:01.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize how much went into it right?\nthe comment here explains it all","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-12-23T10:30:59.895+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Monoki,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=r19JEEE7,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-12-04T21:32:12.244+0000)\n>\n> yes they just did the star guardian thing but guys that&amp;#039;s not even a new skin for lux, only an update and a bunch of new skins for OTHER CHAMPIONS! it wasn&amp;#039;t JUST ABOUT LUX\n> \n\nIt was originally only Lux, similar to how Battlecast was originally only Xerath.

Firstly there are supports that do similar things just better. Take Morgana for example, she has better cc, a much better shield and still does damage. Where as Luxs abilities are more about blowing up targets. \n\nNow don't get me wrong you can still play her as support. But then again you can support with almost anyone which leads me to the second reason. \n\nThere are people who take lux into the support role but don't actually support with her. Sure they buy the support item first but after that it's just straight damage. They basically just play mid lane Lux out of the bot lane. This problem isn't just found with Lux but it's definitely there and it's probably being exacerbated by people wanting to use her new skin. When they don't get mid they take her supp even if they have no intention of supporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2016-12-21T13:33:33.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, still there are some of us who support her really well and actually support","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T03:27:38.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except for those full ap lux support with full ks cs steal and no support item","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T03:27:05.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not complaining she got a skin, im complaining people only play her because of the skin","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2016-12-21T13:31:34.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg we have simillar names XD\n\nand i feel ya there.
