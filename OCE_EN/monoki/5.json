A lot of creators/fan-made skin concepts are just people who love to create. The designer is obviously a fan of League, and a fan of Morgana. She wanted to contribute something in his/her own way and then share that with people who ALSO LIKE Morgana and League. The creator had an idea and wanted to bring it to life, then share the idea with others. There's nothing wrong with that and I see no reason for you to shit on her for it.  \n\nSkins don't always make sense or fit with the champions, sometimes they're for fun by Riot. For example: \"Kitty Kat Katarina\". Do you really think an assassin (part of being an assassin is being undetected and blending into surroundings) would be dressed in an all white, skimpy cat costume? How about the \"food\" line of skins featuring Pantheon, Leona, Olaf and Akali? Do those make sense? How about Definitely Not Velkoz? Not EVERY skin makes sense, sometimes Riot just likes to have fun and the community enjoys them. \n\nStop being rude, and either say something nice or say nothing at all.

I'm not trying to say that Riot has made skins that don't make total sense in the past, but I disagree that SG Syndra is one of them.\n\nIt's not like they're trying to follow the Sailor Moon story exactly that's not the point of the skins. Uranus and Neptune (MF and Soraka) weren't exactly \"puff girls\" in the show, and they aren't here, they're the more mature and less naive guardians and can be downright brutal at times if the lore we're given is anything to go by. \n\nI hardly think Syndra would fit with the original team, but she fits in just fine with the new one, and she's implied by everything we are given to be somewhat separate anyway, (it straight up says most of her team is suspicious of her) which matches Saturn as one of the outer planets. She was technically on their side most of the time but she had her own goals and motives that were sometimes less than savoury and always questioned.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-10-11T04:51:14.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe instead of Pop star\nyou make it \"Soul\" music\nand its even funnier that way because one song that belongs to the Genre \"Classic Soul\" is \"Stop in the name of love\" which would fit her Q\njust a thought :3","replies":[]}]}
