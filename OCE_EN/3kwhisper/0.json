The last few games I&#039;ve had, someone or a Duo has given up and intentionally thrown the game because they don&#039;t think it is &quot;winnable&quot;.  if we use the term &quot;winnable&quot; we will more or less see the result that almost all situations can be won by either side be it the enemy side is up 10k gold and 15 kills or the score is 30 - 2 that can still be won.\n\nIs this what league is now? just people giving up based on champions and on the skill of your team members? or is this always been the case either way I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any point playing ranked in silver - gold at the current moment\n\n(Possibly unrelated to this topic)\nI don&#039;t see people giving up in battlefield/callofduty I've observed this and I see each player fighting till their last weather it be one kill or one ticket left on the clock they still battle it out till the end so why cant we in league of legends do the same?\n\ntl;dr\n\nStop giving up and actually play you never know if victory is around the corner or not! {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-05T04:10:11.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree for the most part. \n\nI am very sick of people calling \"gg ff@15\" from first blood/first tower. I'm also pretty done with teammates trying to call a sneaky FF when we lose a team fight or an objective, which are actually so tiny when we look at the bigger picture and see that both teams are mostly even. \n\nOf course, there are always times where a surrender might actually be your best option, to save your mental. \n\n* You don't really want to drag out a game where everyone is flaming each other\n* It can also be pretty obvious when your team stops trying, and you wont be able to make a comeback with a team thats going on autopilot mode.\n\n>or is this always been the case either way I don't think there's any point playing ranked in silver - gold at the current moment\n\nI hate to tell you, but it  doesn't get better the higher you go up.

Especially the way people play in bronze even if your down by a shit load of gold you can still win off of late game mistakes by the other team. \n\nWith that said it can be difficult sometimes. When some of your teammates are behaving like idiots, sometimes I don’t want to put in another 20-30 minute in a game I think they are going to throw. For example in a normal game I played recently our tyrndamere jungle kept running down top lane by himself and trying to take towers. Sure he got kills, but he always got collapsed on and died. And since he was dead half the time we had trouble defending our base.  Now we ended up winning the game, partially because I was nasus and partially because the other team opted into a bad fight. But quite frankly winning that game was not worth the 20 minutes I spent dealing with the trynd and our tayilah who was saying some pretty derogatory things in all chat. \n\nSo yeah sometimes people give up to early. But other times it’s justified.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2018-02-05T02:17:03.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking similar thoughts for quite some time.

Maybe you suffered major packetloss or spikes in ping, maybe you were camped, maybe your jungler was feeding and that spilled over into your lane, maybe your team was slow to follow up on engages, often meaning you didn't survive. Maybe your support is a piece of... that didn't peel for you because they're autofilled and so are just going through the motions and don't really care about if they win or lose.\n\nYour deserved rank depends on your overall performance of tens, if not hundreds of games. Overall just throwing a game is childish. In the grand scheme of things it doesn't really effect anyone's climb, it's one game out of many, but it does leave a bad aftertaste when you have some self-centred egotistical bastard who's trying to throw the game or spam ff, simply because the jungler hasn't ganked their lane, and it's now the junglers fault that they died 1v1, 3 times in the first 8min.\n\nI've had 3 ragequitters in 22 ranked games on this account, either disconnecting, sitting at fountain or running it down mid like 3 times before sitting at fountain. Overall it isn't much, and the fact that I'm a little rusty after a near 2 month break from league, is more likely what dropped me to mid silver this season, but having a ragequitter in a winnable game leaves a very poor taste.\n\nIf your team can win multiple 4v5 teamfights without you, the game was winnable, and they probably could have won the game if you weren't such a crybaby.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-02-06T03:40:52.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"not all games are winnable. every high elo player says that. \n\nif i have won a game that looks like ive inted its because i have farmed up to the same gold that the other team has. or my assists are high. \n\nif my jgler and support are rather doing nothing to help anyone in the team then they do not deserve the win. in life you don't get a free ride without losing something and guess what you don't in this game either","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-06T21:49:29.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"in low elo, throws happen, wombos are devastating and miracles can happen. In higher elo, players are better, less likely to throw, and would be better capable of closing out a game, but in low elo, so long as the nexus isn't dead, the game is very much still in the air.\n\nAlso you've had games where you've straight lost lane, but your botlane and jungle were so fed, that the toplaner you fed just got obliterated the moment he tried to fight them. They ended the game, they didn't really need you. Did you deserve to lose and go to a lower rank though? I don't actually think so, because yes they carried, but overall your performance is higher than the elo you were playing at. You might have been beaten by that enemy toplaner, but you're still overall better than other toplaners in your elo.\n\n In MMR systems it isn't about how you do in one game, it's about how you do in all of them.\n\nAlso life isn't fair, some people in life do get free rides, and some people have unfortunate circumstances. But at least in league, if you don't belong in a rank, over the course of many games, you always end up where you belong. So in a sense league is fairer than life, and you don't need to try to balance the scales because all you're doing is pissing off the other players on your team just because you have an issue with one guy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-02-05T02:07:21.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good call","replies":[]}]}
