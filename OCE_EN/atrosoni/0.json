I'd be on 60%-98% and would have no idea the game had started because I'm still waiting to join. and when the remake happens I'm still stuck there. the only way I find out that the remake happens is because the loading screen crashes and I go to reload it to try get into the game. I'm just curious if I'm not the only one that this has happened to and if there is a fix for it I would appreciate it a lot cause I don't like the fact I'm ruining my teammates game because of the client screwing up without me knowing.

If some suggestions seem obvious then I apologise but I'm covering all bases here.\n\nYou should be able to tell if you're loading screen has lagged/crashed/disconnected from the little circle in the corner that goes round and round. If it stalls for more than a few seconds, chances are something has gone wrong and you should try to restart.\n\nAs for solving the issue, this kind of thing can have a lot of different sources so it can be tricky to nail down. So far as I can tell, this isn't a widespread problem with connection issues or the patch, so it's probably something local and/or specific to your setup.\n\n___\n\n**.1.** Alt-tabbing can greatly reduce stability in loading screen, particularly if you play in fullscreen. If this is an issue you experience a lot, it may be worth avoiding alt-tabbing in load, and/or switching to windowed fullscreen if you haven't already. \n\nWindowed fullscreen can either help and hurt performance depending on where the deficiency lies, but it generally increases stability when switching between programs.\n\n**.2. ** Check your task manager for any programs siphoning too many resources. Most things won't cause any grief in this department, but if you're running any other resource-heavy programs while you're trying to play League, they could be pulling too many resources and causing a failure.\n\n**.3.** [Check your connection](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). There could be some drama happening between you and the server that is causing load to fail, so give the fixes in this article a go.\n\n**.4.** Run a client repair. his can be done through the little settings gear in the top right > \"Run Full Repair\". Could be your game didn't patch properly or some such, a client repair should catch most of those sort of things.\n\n**.5.** If all else fails, submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). They'll be able to walk you through step by step and can evaluate logs and such to give more specific advice.","replies":[]}]}
