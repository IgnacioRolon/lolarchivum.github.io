Riot took it out several years ago to undergo some improvements, but it seems like that's been forgotten about. Best way to deal with troublesome players is still to report them, then the system will pick up the case(s), review the offending player(s) and dish out punishments as required. It's important to remember that the system wont work properly if it's not receiving reports.\n\nAs for appealing the punishment you received, all you need to do is contact support (found [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)), though if you've retaliated to these players you probably wont get the result you're looking for. It's important to remember that retaliating does nothing to help the situation and that toxic behaviour is against the rules period, so it doesn't matter who started it. As Tele said, if it's that much of a problem you can utilise the mute feature to help get through the match and report in the post-game lobby, that way you're a lot less likely to do something that puts you in a bad position.\n\nIn regards to the report system feeling useless, that's understandable. However, it generally only requires a single report for a player to be picked up by the system, which is something a lot of players don't seem to know or consider. As long as you don't have a history of false reports, your reports should be doing enough to get troublesome players picked up by the system and undergo reviews.","replies":[]}]}
