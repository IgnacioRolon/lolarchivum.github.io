They only recently made it on PBE that you can change the colour you are, so that you are always blue and the enemy is always red no matter what side of the map your on.\n\n2. you mean like exhaust and stuff? Items/spells that add debuffs to enemy rather than buffing yourself?\n\n I guess, but Exhaust is like a all-in-one debuff. Reduces damage, slows and increases your own damage. Also, they added that red smite which is like a debuff, so yeah. They seem to be going down this path.\n\n3. i agree summoner spells to a touch up. Buffing heal has a HUGE impact on the game though (in terms of Assassins becoming useless) so its touchy subject. \n\n When they buffed heal it became the choice over barrier. I mean, summoner spells are just like \"meta\" changes. I remember when the ADC used to take ignite because it was important for them to make sure to get the kill.\nWhat I think would change the game a lot would be a nerf to flash cooldown. However, it would probably mean that champions without a dash or require a flash to be \"viable\" would be even less popular.\n\n4. OP. Having an invisible tracker on a player that follows them. I mean, if it only lasted like 10 seconds but cost the same as a ward, then maybe.\n\n5. no one has a circle around them to show their \"effective\" attack range","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-21T10:55:00.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=the4nr,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=IAh4iBoK,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-20T04:59:39.596+0000)\n\n> debuffing runes/masteries/items/spells/summoner spells: it doesnt sound quite nice at first but this could add another layer to your gameplay in different ways. would you gamble out stats and abilities for a more diverse playstyle or would you stick to what you know.\n\nnah its the same as is.\n\n\"should i adjust these runes or stick with what i know?\" same question different scenario, it wont really change that.\nit would probably just slow down the matches more due to less buffs from like, anything and im pretty happy with current match times thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-20T05:33:46.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about those {{champion:133}} changes that were \"leaked\" on the PBE late last year?\nYou know the ones I'm talking about Rito, now make it happen.","replies":[]}]}
