Fuck. This. Shit. Called. Making. Him. Untargetable. \n\nYou're making him even MORE broken by giving him a mini malphite ult on a ~14 seconds cooldown, that is literally asking for trouble. Make it unstoppable during certain conditions is okay, making him untargetable makes him even more disconnected to his lore than he currently is. Aatrox doesn't dodge your shit, he tanks it and beats your army to pieces so bloody majestically that it inspires people as an art.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-10-23T05:06:55.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but riot's gutting the lore as we speak so there goes that argument","replies":[]}]}]}
