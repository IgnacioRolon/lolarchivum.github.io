Who you think would fit my playstyle!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ieo19/help_me_pick_a_main_who_do_you_think_would_fit_my/","image":null},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so my names Surgical on the oceania server, I have been floating around the b3 nearly b2 mark atm and am looking to main 1-3 champs so I can learn game mechanics and improve my elo.\r\nAtm I love thresh (though don&#039;t play a lot of him he is a champ I enjoy playing). I love his pick potential, his skill cap and mechanics, his amazing utility and his skin and personality also.\r\nJinx is another. I love being able to switch stances and am beginning to learn basic positioning and creep wave manipulation/also how to use your creep wave).\r\nI am an improving irelia player, as much as i find her OP if you have good matchup,item,powerspike, rune setup knowledge, i am not enjoying her as much as I thought i would though i get a good win rate with her and know a few of her matchups.\r\nI have played a few games of Hecarim top (Not enough to form a massive consolidated opinion of him but so far really enjoy him due to his dominance in lane and his tp ganks. Would appreciate further opinion.\r\nI&#039;ve been playing league for about 6 months now and love it.\r\nSo really, I am looking for a champion that I mentally enjoy and that fits my play style, I have been using a video I watched last night which uses root causes and psychology to help pick a champ and funniest thing is it&#039;s written by a thresh main, so thresh is probably going to be one of my three &quot;to mains&quot;. Video for reference if your not sure what a root cause is, can be found here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljeTiPBStEE\r\nOk, so the traits im looking for are as follows. If you know a champion that fits over 50-75% of these traits please list them below, if you think they have more than 75% caps your post with &quot;HIGH TRAITS&quot; so i can short list them.\r\nTrait&#039;s im looking for:\r\n-Fun to play. -Safe/strong laner. -Dominant in lane. -Can roam if need be. -Viable. -Mobile. -Good kill pressure (This trait is borderline wanted, almost classified as preferred but not essential).\r\nTrait&#039;s that are preferred but not essential. -Can turn team fights easily by themselves or assist others in doing so. -Global presence (TF ult, Shen Ult etc). Honestly not paramount at all but would be nice to have.\r\nI am more happy to take all elo&#039;s into consideration but, would value elo&#039;s gold or above more as they potentially will have more sound and accurate advice than lower elo&#039;s like myself!\r\nAlso, if your passionate about your champ and can even teach me or link me to good resources to learn or maximize your potential with them I would really appreciate it!\r\nCheers,\r\nSurgical","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-01T06:56:39.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're wanting to roam, mid is the best lane for you, and in the mid lane, Ahri is in my opinion the most versatile champion there is. I've played lots of games on her and I still to this day find her very fun, she is an extremely safe laner and she is a good lane bully once you understand her kit a little better. She has great roaming due to mobility and wave clear, she is viable, has been for a while. She is very mobile and has a tonne of kill pressure. \n\nI mentioned her versatility right? She is most commonly known as an Assassin, even after the nerfs, but in terms of turning team fights by herself, I've gotten pentas and quadras but just playing her as a backline mage, with plenty of aoe, cc and self peel, she is a great teamfight mage if you want her to be.\n\nShe can be a Kite mage, pick/control mage, assassin, teamfight mage, support. She has aoe, single target burst, cc mobility, true damage, long range abilities, short range abilities, sustain, pick potential, teamfight potential. You can also change up her build to whatever you want it to be, she's very versatile with that. I always go Morellos first, pretty much no matter what, as I just like having the cdr and mana regen boost early on, and then I go situational from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-01T06:30:31.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually top laners don't roam so you're better off with a mid laner if you want to do so badly enough. In fact, I think you should avoid top champs as they have Nasus and tend to be separated between farm champs and kill champs.\n\nFun to play is very opinion based, I'll get more onto it later\n\nElise definitely fits some of these, along with Yorick. I'd definitely recommend Udyr if you really enjoyed Jinx's weapons as top lane Udyr is practically ungankable (BEARTURTLEBEARTURTLE) so he dominates lane very well, is unique and has 4 abilities to worry about rather than an occasional ulti and can roam if it's REALLY required.\n\nNidalee is pretty great too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-31T22:58:05.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am also an irelia and jinx main, I think morde is something you should try.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-08-31T18:02:44.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Morgana Mid or Support is a very safe pick. Easy to learn and great especially when it comes to team fights. Grab a Zhonya's, flash in there, ult, activate Zhonya's and the team fight is turned. You want roam? Give her some Golden Nikes and she's ready to go! Insanely long snare and natural spell vamp to boot? GG.\nSeriously she's only 1350IP if you've never played her.\nI also love Hecarim (TP + Homeguards is insanely fun, run ignite as well and you'll almost always net a kill). He also seems a bit stronger since they added Deadman's Plate.\nCaitlyn and Jinx are my favourite ADCs. May no one ever escape a team fight on low health :3 Cait also has traps and a net to escape (works through walls so you know!) which makes her laning phase a bit safer than some other ADCs.\nAhri I also find super fun.. And if in danger you can always ult to escape! (Or to better position yourself, charm your attacker and proceed to 100 to 0 them)\nAlso Pantheon's ult is -practically- global if you haven't considered him already. \nNot Gold ELO but I think we have similar tastes and these are champs that win a lot of games for me I've found by asking my friends questions you're asking here ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"A NaCl n Battery","date":"2015-08-26T23:06:39.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to suggest Vladimir, imo hes fun to play but that might be because he was my main for a while, he is definitely a safe and somewhat strong laner, he is relatively mobile with his W, although i do take ghost on him if playing him mid, i wouldnt say he has good kill pressure but he definitely does alot of damage around level 8-9, and then will only go on to do more as the game progresses, he is very item reliant so you need to be good at csing to make him work, he can easily turn a teamfight with his massive AoE damage from E and ulti. the downsides to vlad is that he doesnt have any form of hard cc, he can struggle if he gets camped and due to his kit you will find you are pushing wave after wave so he is quite vulnerable to ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-26T08:50:00.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cho can be fun top and mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-08-26T04:32:05.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee, Have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Surgical","date":"2015-08-26T05:11:13.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hungry, if your being serious and not troll (i am just wanting to make sure as sometimes people talk stack here if you catch my drift), umm i was thinking of learning her as she seems really good, but do you reckon she would be a good match based on the traits and is she still viable atm post nerfs? :) Ty for the taking the time to reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-08-26T08:42:23.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm transferring to OCE tonight becuase of the NA server location changes so feel free to add me.\n\nI made the recommendation based on the traits you wanted.\n\n-Fun to play - Debatable, each to their own on this one,\n-Safe/strong laner - Safe? 4-2s cd manaless jump, check. Strong? Spears that chunk + auto harrass + heals, check\n-Dominant in lane ^\n-Can roam if need be - Did I mention the manaless jump? Goes over small walls too!\n-Viable - Everyone is viable with the right amount of practice\n-Mobile - That jump\n-Good kill pressure - Once you hit a spear it's all orge\n-Can turn team fights easily by themselves or assist others in doing so - Good poke/counterpoke, AS boost for adc in fights\n-Global presence (TF ult, Shen Ult etc) - I'll refer you to that jump again.\n\nPersonally haven't play her much so can't speak on viability, but if she got nerfs something about her must be strong, so maybe it's what you are after, she seems to fit the bill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-08-26T04:59:41.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think your issue is about not knowing champions you enjoy to play like obviously you've mentioned skills you like tf, shen etc. but I think more just maybe you need to learn a bit more like what is a safe first pick, what are your niche counter picks going to be. But like I think twisted fate is an amazing pick but in a meta filled with about 70% assassins I would not be first picking him.\n\nBut then try like focus a few high skill cap champs and then main those then have a more basic secondary champ role. Maybe try learn ahri or bard.","replies":[{"poster":"Surgical","date":"2015-08-26T05:13:28.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mekk, ty for taking the time to reply i was thinking ahri the other day apparently shes really good. Would you say she's still viable and also is bard to high skill cap atm, his ult looks so hard and is he outclassed by other supports such as thresh who or anyone else, also chime runs etc can they be the end of my poor adc or cause me to get outscaled. Then again one may argue this comes with experience at the end of the day. {{champion:103}}  {{champion:432}}","replies":[]}]}]}
