Here are my reasons why i want it.\r\n1. People play seriously compared to normal 3s. In normal 3s no one plays serious in fact people actually afk or troll very often, and it just puts people off it. However in ranked you have to find your own 2 other players but because it is ranked people are actually more inclined to join you to play 3s.\r\n2. Longer queue, when ranked 3s was up yesterday i experienced a way fast queue then i did with normal 3s. That just shows the experiment worked and people are actually enjoying and wanting to play 3s, when there isn&#039;t ranked and you pair up as a team of 3 the queue time can actually be up 15 mins.\r\n3. It is fun, ranked 3s with more strategic importance and weighing makes it more fun, quick and most of all fun.\r\n\r\nSo please if we do have 3s up can it be ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-05-07T12:44:52.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't see why they don't just rmove aram and give us ranked 3's...\n\nMost people who want ranked 3s would be willing to wait 20 mins for a game.","replies":[{"poster":"My Blue Buff","date":"2015-05-08T07:51:30.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM is a huge game type for riot.
