You should continue to work with **Riot** support, but I'll try to give you a hand as well.\n\n**First, a few really basic questions so I can make sure you're doing stuff right:**\n\n1. _Have you already checked in-game to see if you automatically got the First Strike border?_\n \n I've got a feeling this is your issue. If you get a blueprint normally, you receive the icon WITH the First Strike border. **Riot** is saying you got the icon automatically, therefore you probably got the border automatically too. \n\n Make sure you know exactly what the [border](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dP7EiMmUENk/V479NJtcTcI/AAAAAAAA83Y/FXa5EPiMBnURmrw3O05CkVpNn07qTCDowCLcB/s640/%255E7CCEC7FBBD1DF01D108A9D6370F477521ED80B42D0F3294C4E%255Epimgpsh_fullsize_distr.jpg) looks like so you can accurately tell me if you have it.\n\n2. _You're checking for your project caches in the Hextech Crafting tab, right?_\n\nIf this was a mistake from **Riot**'s end, then there's a good chance that they'll give you the First Strike border even after the event has ended. \n\nDon't panic please!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dance xD","date":"2016-08-16T15:54:38.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody else having this issue?
