Having it stored on site means that after an update, you would have to still redownload it, causing additional download size, but would allow item sets to persist over client repairs.\n\nHaving it client side would mean you can add additional item sets when not connected to the net. Such with LSI. I would also like it so that i can save a back up of them so i dont lose them when i repair my client. \n\nWHICH btw, i dont know the file path of the item sets, if anyone know plz post.","replies":[]}]}
