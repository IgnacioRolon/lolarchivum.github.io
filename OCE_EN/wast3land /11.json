Her play style for me takes a bit to get used to and i want to make sure i have it right, so does her combos. Also, is essence reaver good on her? Since her E garuntees 2 crits?

Should focus on finishing defensive items depending on how your lane is going, but ravenous should usually be a must-get item for splitting potential. \n\nI'm no Fiora main or expert, but these are the basics I know.\nCame across a guide I read when attempting to answer your question, could be of great help as it's from a Master tier player:\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/actually-master-wip-6-18-top-lane-domination-w-fiora-445898 \n\nhavefun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-08T03:26:46.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in pubs build her full crit its troll but super damage","replies":[]}]}
