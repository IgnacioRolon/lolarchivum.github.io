He says Yasuo is cancer and doesn&#039;t seem to find anything that can help him. He is more worried about the Mid/Late game part of Yasuo not so much the lanning phase. As a Riven main i find it easy to beat a Yasuo but he seems to find that i am baised as i don&#039;t play/main adc.

I can also suggest that Darius {{champion:122}}  hard counters yasuo. Start playing darius maybe in the top lane and you can easily knock him into the ground late. \nI dont know if this helps since with blind pick you can't counter pick but when i play darius andd get put against a yasuo iit makes me a very happy person. ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-13T23:16:33.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tell him to git gut & L2 position.","replies":[]}]}
