Next season does my MMR reset or does it count into effect for season 7? If someone could explain in detail, that be great","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-23T23:22:43.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't  quote me here. My assumption is that if you have not completed your 10 provisionals you will not have placement mmr. So i *assume* next season you will sill be regarded as an unranked / never placed account. \n\nPlease be sure to note this is just my assumption and I'm most likely incorrect.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-10-24T05:44:52.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it ok if i can see where you found this information or if there is something online by Riot or a video explaining how it works and just post it on the baords?

So, for example, if you ended the season at an MMR equivalent to Silver 3 you'd get \"reset\" to Silver 4, while if you ended the season with an MMR equivalent to Silver 1 you'd get \"reset\" to Silver 3.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken the formula is (X+1200)/2 = Y where X is end of season MMR and Y is start of season MMR. So an MMR of 1200 (higher end of Silver 5, if I'm not mistaken) would end being \"reset\" to 1200. Similarly; 1300 to 1250, 1100 to 1150, 1400 to 1300 and so on.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-10-24T05:43:33.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i'm 6 games in Provisionals and i don't intend to complete it, and my current MMR is 1120, because it seems like people can't seem to be bothered with ranked since it's 2 weeks till season ends, and unless Riot has officially said something about MMR on uncompleted provisionals, i'm gonna asume since the account is still technically unranked, it should count as unranked for next season.","replies":[]}]}]}
