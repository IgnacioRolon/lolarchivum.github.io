It makes you think harder, play more cautiously, and be in a better position to recognise enemy mistakes - rather than just charging in and making your own mistakes. Just something to think about :p Mirror matches are the best way to see where you're at with a champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-21T03:43:15.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me put it this way, mirror match ups basically incentivise that both players go ham on each other because their power spikes at each level are the same. That the only difference between the two is A) their creep score and information of what's going on.","replies":[]}]}
