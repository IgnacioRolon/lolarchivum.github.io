Does it act like it&#039;s a brand new account because it&#039;s still unranked? or does it take the current MMR of the placements and go off there? If someone from Riot could answer this, that be great\r\n\r\nTy","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-27T05:49:42.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How other seasons have worked: You get a MINOR reset to the average MMR. If you are lower, your MMR gets a little better, if you are higher your MMR gets a little lower.\n\nYour MMR of the previous season is like 90% the deciding factor of where you place next season more so than the result of your next seasons promos.\n\nFor example. An unranked new account that goes 10-0, might get Gold 1 or so. An account that was Silver 3 which is roughly where an unranked account starts, can go 10-0 in placements, and might only get Silver 1.\n\nReal world example, i finished last season Plat 5 (but had like Gold 2-3 MMR). I went 7-3 in my placements and got placed in Silver 1.\n\nHOWEVER with the \"shambles\" that was dynamic que, there are people calling for a Full MMR reset next season for at least the Solo/Duo que, so until Riot state what will happen, we don't 100% know yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-27T04:48:39.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1914689","replies":[]}]}
