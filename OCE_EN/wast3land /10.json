Ikr same. Here is a tip for you low elo players ( High Silver - below ) EVERY champion has counter play, maybe if you weren&#039;t sitting on your ass all day complaining  about why a champ is OP and shit, why don&#039;t you try and do some research about how to play against them. Blaming the champion isn&#039;t going to help you improve and you dam well know it, you just use it as an excuse for why you lost X game. Why don&#039;t you try to see that you have done something wrong, you know that X champion has that for his ability, and work around it. For instants, Since i am a Riven 1 trick, Yea sue me, i know my matchups pretty well, even the once that counter me, so i find myself barely blaming the champs when i lose, usually it&#039;s either i played badly or they played well, simple, champs has nothing to do with weather someone wins or loses lane if you know what your doing. Played against a Malphite and i get lv 6 before he did and killed him at half HP, he then writes &quot;Wow broken fan champ deals 700 damage in one blow, you know Riot fucked up&quot; this line really cracked me up because they guy was building FUCKING AP XDDD. Like bruh? Another game i played against an Arelioen sol and got fb at lv 4, (all this games were in norms btw) him and his lil bronze duo then went on and said &quot;wow playing the easiest champion in the game, you shouldn&#039;t feel proud&quot; xDD, None of this games have i been toxic btw, never said a bad word back, i replied with &quot;If you can find a person that is of Plat and above that agrees with your statement, i will gift you a skin&quot; he then replied with &quot;Yea, just ask everyone in the LOL community&quot; xD. Didn&#039;t realise that everyone in the LOL community was Plat, dam i must be missing out, cause i&#039;m only in Gold. You get my point, if you think a champ is OP or Broken in any sense, then why don&#039;t you do all of us a favour, and show us that they really are broken by playing them for the next 3 games, and going positive in all of them. Yea sure, i&#039;m gonna get hate for this, but you know that i&#039;m not wrong. Many examples can be taken from this, someone once said TF was broken, someone else said Malphite was broken, if a champion is truely broken, don&#039;t you think the community or even Riot would do something about it? If Riven is Truely &quot;OP&quot; and &quot;Broken&quot; then don&#039;t you think that&#039;ll come to Riot&#039;s attention?  Just admit it, you lost to that one lv 7 Jax top lane, not because he was broken, but because he played better than you did :) Also made a post, Out of this 3 champs, who is the most &quot;Unskilled&quot; of them all, have fun :D","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-04T10:57:27.941+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You said you are gold\n\nOp.gg determined that was a lie","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-11-04T12:23:01.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Underrated post.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-11-04T22:28:29.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Loool.
