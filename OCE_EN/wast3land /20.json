As we all know, knowing if an enemy has any summoners before a gank would greatly impact the outcome, but more importantly, knowing what summoners the enemy has will create a garunteed outcome if one knows the stratigic plan to abuse it. We all know that there will always be a top laner, be it your team or enemy team that brings ignite from time to time, there is a way that you can abuse the enemy for taking that summoner, or help your laner to abuse his summoner on the enemy. For one, you must realise that because the enemy top laner has ignite, they are most likely going to play aggressive for early first blood or kill preasure to zone the other laner of CS. You can use this to your advantage knowing that the enemy will be pushed up and try for an early gank, chances are by the third wave of minion around four minutes in, the enemy will be pushed up to your laners turret, use this opotunity to gank your laner getting them a headstart. As we know that the enemy does not have Teleport, abuse that fact, and help your laner shove the wave into the enemies turret, by helping your laner push, you are garunteeing their safety against the enemy jungler, not only that , but you are making the enemy lose CS as they go to waste by being exacuted by the turrets. This will not only garuntee that your laner will not be needing any help soon, but will also garuntee you free gold and experience by helping your laner push the wave. Just be careful to not over extend when the wave has been shoved in. Using this strategy, you can be asured that your top laner will have a lead thefore allowing you to preasure other lanes in order for them to win knowing that your top laner will not need your help anytime soon. If your laner is the one with ignite, be cautious that the enemy jungler is looking for an easy gank, be on gaurd for a countergank and always take not of the time before you attempt to counter, make sure to notify your top laner then you are there when needed so when the time comes, they will be prepared. As your top laner has ignite, it will be an easy 2v2 asuming you both are prepare, getting an easy double kill. Since your top laner has ignite, this will be the start of the snowball as the enemies are either forced to farm under turret or call for a junglers help. As soon as you spot the enemy jungler heading top, warn your top laner so they can be prepared, if you are heading or near top side, you could go for another counter gank, but if you are not, you could use this knowledge to either counter jungle the enemy, or take objectives down bottom lane like dragons or turrets. I hope this helps anyone who has trouble with ignite top laners, wheather it be the enemy snowballing, or your laner getting snowballed. \r\n\r\n- Wast3land (Top laner)","replies":[{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-12-25T00:54:47.542+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tldr for this is basically, abuse summoner cooldowns and camp top if they have ignite.\n\nForgive me if this seems mean, but it's my opinion, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong \n\nLook, as a jungler, i don't really care about what you think i should do, that's not your job, you're a laner,  the only job you have is to win your lane and not feed, sure, it's okay to do stuff like call baron or dragon, but it's up to me as a jungler on if we do it or not, my job as a jungler is to win us the game, meaning, i don't care what you think, i will only gank you if i think it's worth it, not because you want me to do so, i only gank if i think it's worth it, I'm not going to fix your mistakes, if you die in lane i most likely will ignore ypur lane from then on unless the enemy laner really messes up, i won't gank your losing lane","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-25T02:51:07.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, ganking a losing lane is pointless as time could be spent helping else where, but many junglers do not seem to know how to abuse summoners in the top lane as they seem to have have this \"Top is an island/farm lane\" which is far from the truth.

If an enemy laner has ignite, chances are that they will be the one pushing up, not the other way around, the fact that you think otherwise is beyond me, and if you were talking about your laner having ignite and pushing up, a Jungler should look for a COUNTER gank, not a gank, there is differences between the two, i'm sure you know that\n\n-Wast3land (Top laner) ","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-25T09:13:00.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that said if a toplaner doesn't have tp, even simply ganking top and forcing the enemy top to back shortly after they've come back to lane with items is a big advantage since the enemy will lose out on cs, xp and map pressure and maybe tower whilst he's walking back to lane. Not every gank needs to be a kill and sometimes just showing your presence top can force the enemy toplane to play a little less aggressively, making it harder for them to abuse their ignite.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-12-24T20:52:30.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too long to read, but yeah its not Jg prob helping you to get ahead, if jg want he ganks its that simple in saying so if enemy jg keep ganking ward your own lane and if necessary just go back if you see 3-4 people, whats the point staying in lane and dying and then losing tower, its better to just lose the tower.\n\nRegards\nMid laner","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-25T02:59:37.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some poeple do not know what they should do after losing a lane, and yes, that is their problem, but is helping a laner snowball and making sure you have your laners in a good spot good for the jungler as well as the laner a bad thing?
