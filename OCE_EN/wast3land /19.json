He played Draven, a champion he is not very good at to be honest, and he lost to a mirror Draven with TP, i told him off a bit cause i was not only mad but a bit confused as to how that happens and i don&#039;t think he&#039;s very interested in me apologising. He thinks i'm Toxic even tho i've never really said anything mean. He says that every champion that can kill him fast regardless fed or not is either Cancer/Broken/Unskilled. He doesn&#039;t seem to like it when we say that the champ isn&#039;t any of the above, it&#039;s his bad positioning thats the problem. He plays really passively and doesn&#039;t seem to know what to build half the time, he once went Banshees over of BT last item on Jhin even tho he had no life steal and said that it was for the CC. He doesn&#039;t understand that all champions have counterplay and think Zed/Riven(My Main)/Yasuo/Lucian and many more are easy to play and take no skill despite never actually playing them before, he refuses to look at guides or search for advice and always argue against them when he does. Need help, what could i do to help him, what should i do, was i a dick for telling him off?

There are things you can do to improve your game and especially being mirror against a tele Draven he should have no problems in lane unless he is either pushing hard to turret with little to no vision and getting ganked by the jg and/or he has a shitty supp. But still things can be done to make up for a bad supp. Really there is no excuse. I assume he is a bronze-silver player; have you asked him what he thinks his skill level is at tier wise?","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-05T23:50:05.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he would talk to me i would xD","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-05T23:54:14.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wast3land ,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nRP61AE3,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-11-05T23:50:05.952+0000)\n>\n> If he would talk to me i would xD\n\nAw stink.
