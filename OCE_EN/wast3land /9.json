It hurts so much cause i actually wanna be decent at her.

Remember to save it for crucial abilities and CC. Higher level players tend to use W less than lower tier players. By holding onto riposte as long as possible you can force the opponent to hold their key ability as well.\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/turbo-mode-data-behind-your-spell-spamming\n\nTry to think about each death, and if you could have used Riposte better.\n\nObviously the basics of Fiora are to make sure you use your mobility to proc the vitals.\n\nIn terms of moving outside of lanning phase and into mid game/late game remember Fiora is a duelist. She excels at 1v1's or maybe even 1v2's, effectively pressuring other lanes while your team is pressuring at the same time is what you want to be doing with Fiora.\n\nIf you do need to jump into the fray as a team fight breaks out, flanking the AP/AD carry is usually the thing you want to be doing. Fiora isn't tanky enough most times to walk through the front line CC and go for the back line. Usually flanking allows you to get into that duel scenario with priority targets without having to use too many cool downs getting there.\n\nItem's - Fiora relies on damage and sustain. So make sure you build for it. I see you are building Hydra which is good. But Tri force and ghost blade I don't think are ideal.\n\nCore items for fiora tend to be \nDMG\n{{item:3074}} - life steal, aoe split push, damage\n{{item:3071}} - A bit of health, Armour reduction, damage and CDR (more Qs)\n\nSurvivability\n{{item:3053}} \n{{item:3026}} \n\nSituational\n{{item:3065}} \n{{item:3812}} \n{{item:3072}} \n\nBoots\n{{item:3111}}\n{{item:3047}} \n\nTL;DR\n\n* Flank\n* Hold Riposte as long as you can\n* Split push\n\nThe rest is situational and will come down to experience =D good luck man!","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-10T23:58:47.190+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, that was actually really helpful :)))))))))))))))))))))).
