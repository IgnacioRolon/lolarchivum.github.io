Play 200 games on them and learn every little detail about that champion. How much damage they can do, their power spikes, proper builds/runes/masteries, their win conditions (split push/teamfight) etc\n\nPicking OP's can help. There are obvious champions that are naturally stronger than others so playing them will help you. That being said its more important for you to know HOW to play the champion well, then to play an OP. Better to play a REALLY good Wukong top then a really crap Trundle.\n\nYou are now Plat.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-15T11:11:23.575+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"still better to play a crap trundle top than a good teemo though, amirite","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-17T03:50:04.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better to take a dump on your keyboard than play teemo.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-17T06:29:19.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heck, its better to fly to New York and throw your computer off the top of the empire state building than play teemo.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Peever","date":"2016-02-18T00:59:35.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have some tips at my blog have a look :) http://jasonkid87.blogspot.com\n\nbut mainly like what some of them said master and be good at 2-3 champions but having the right mindset would help as well :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-17T20:24:02.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Choswen","date":"2016-02-17T04:15:42.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played lee sin in the jungle which helped me winning my placements eventhough i only got placed into silver 5, but i find being 4th or last pick helps if you can get the position you want to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-17T03:48:01.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wear loose fitting flexible shorts and chalk you hands frequently","replies":[]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-02-17T02:48:16.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play with some buddies.

(I usually won't take her against a vayne or a kalista but I have in the past and it can be ok) Just because I am so familiar with everything about her. and therefore I climb! but it takes that effort at the start, to really find a champ and stick with it. The best way for that is find a champ that you actually enjoy playing, no use picking something like malphite and just hating every game. that being said, I see way to many Lee Sins out there in bronze/silver for my liking, some are good, some not so good, I understand he can be fun ... but maybe somewhere in between, so they are fun and intense to play but not so hard that a failed play leaves you right in the middle of the emery team with out flash. But good luck and have fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-15T07:22:16.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play a champion that no one picks because of the mechonics...\n\nChallenjour inbound","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2016-02-15T06:28:21.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you want tips for climbing a ladder? or stairs?
