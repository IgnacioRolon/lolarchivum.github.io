We waited for 15mins before I decided to go as a support as it would be easier to find a jungler. The slot that was open was bottom lane, any role, so I went as a bottom lane/tank and hoping that I would join the same lobby soon. 15mins later I was still at queue and the leader of the previous team added me and ask if I was still on queue...\r\n\r\nSo me and my mates tried to replicate the same scenario, they need a jungler and I queued up, we both ended up waiting for 15mins before giving up.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the freaking queue system doesn't work or it just takes a very long time to find and match people properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-08T07:50:27.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno how you got that I get the roles I want in TB under a minute most of the times\n\nThere's a supply and demand factor, when you are at TB screen it will tell you which roles are needed more, it's better for player that's versatile in roles. I play all roles, less often at top since there's not much to do except farm, outfarm someone, or get outfarmed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-08T07:08:51.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realise TB matchmaking works differently depending which position/role/champ you pick, right?","replies":[]}]}
