The system works on numbers, not on player skill\n\nSo you could be a level 20, but so to could the diamond 1 smurf on level 20 account (this is stupid and they need to fix the system)\n\nI was lucky when i started playing league was still fairly new, but nowadays i go into lower ranked accounts and run into 9 other smurfs, who basically curb stomp me\n\nThe only benefit of this, is you pick up new skill quickly because you can see how higher tier players play, you just gotta look at the stomp as a learning opportunity rather than a stomp (trust me, this is super fucking hard to do, took me 3 years to accept it like this)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-02-01T00:00:36.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you should just quit the game now. snowballing/stomping is a thing in this game. it will happen in a high % of your games even when you're level 30+ playing in ranked. either your team gets stomped or your team does the stomping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-01-31T23:57:51.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're playing on a smurf. You're getting matched with other smurfs.\nUntil your MMR and the MMR of other smurfs adjusts, as DarkShade said this is a good learning opportunity as you're coming up against a wide range players with various skill levels that you wouldn't normally get the opportunity to face on a level 30 account where your MMR is more likely to be where it is supposed to be at and matches you with players more around your level.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-01T02:41:40.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"'matches with the same skill level' I call bs on that. Even on a lvl100+ account, OCE is such a small region that if you decide to play at like 1am and put up with a 20min queue time, you can eventually end up in a game with challenger players as a Silver/Gold.\n\n And here's a quick rundown of how that game will play out, one team has 3 challenger players, a diamond and a gold player, one team has 2 challenger, 1 diamond, 1 plat and a silver player. The winning team will be the one with 3 challenger players, and anyone who wasn't at least diamond will be near useless and have 0 game impact. \n\nThe Gold and Silver players would be benefiting their team more if they simply afk'd, and we learnt nothing except that we are bad and don't understand pathing/rotations. It wasn't a fun night for either of us.","replies":[]}]}]}
