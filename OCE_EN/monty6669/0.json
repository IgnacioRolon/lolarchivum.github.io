Instead just give him the most generic and bland Lore out of all of the champions,  and no longer ties into either Singed being his apprentice and Soraka falling from grace for him, and removing WHY he tricked in the first place from the story completely.\r\n\r\nSeriously, way to drop the ball on your &quot;storyline&quot; Or is that a teaser for singed and soraka being your next reworks?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-25T06:15:05.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are slowly cleaning up the lore and giving it better substance.\n\nTake Nasus and Renekton for example, they used to be from Space Egypt, which made no sense at all apart from some smoke and mirrors saying \"Oh they live in Runeterra now\".\nThen the Shurima update with Azir fleshed them out better giving a much more grounded story.\n\nPersonally this makes me quite excited for Morgana and Kayle to be visited.\n\nAs for Warwick, he's had two lore changes in the past and neither really made any sense, especially the parts about Soraka giving up her divinity for a man she didn't even know.\n\nWhile it's taking time, Riot are giving much better lore than they used to.","replies":[{"poster":"Monty6669","date":"2017-01-25T06:25:28.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AAYIpUPx,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-25T06:15:05.053+0000)\n>\n> They are slowly cleaning up the lore and giving it better substance.\n> \n> Take Nasus and Renekton for example, they used to be from Space Egypt, which made no sense at all apart from some smoke and mirrors saying &quot;Oh they live in Runeterra now&quot;.\n> Then the Shurima update with Azir fleshed them out better giving a much more grounded story.\n> \n> Personally this makes me quite excited for Morgana and Kayle to be visited.\n> \n> As for Warwick, he&#x27;s had two lore changes in the past and neither really made any sense, especially the parts about Soraka giving up her divinity for a man she didn&#x27;t even know.\n> \n> While it&#x27;s taking time, Riot are giving much better lore than they used to.\n\nBecause he needed her heart, so he made soraka fall in love with him, she fought for him and because she hurt people to save him the powers that be took her divinity and made her mortal so then warwaick could actually cut out her heart.  How does that make no sense? He told her a sob story, she fell in love, it was a ruse. Simple.\n\nBut also yeah, they might have had their place of origin moved around a bit, but  Renekton and Nasus are still brothers fighting against each other. Morgana and Kayle will always be sisters (what a bitch Kayle is)  GP and MF will likely always have their backstory.....","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-25T07:31:34.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And a divine being, being tricked into a false love doesn't strike you as weird?\nNor completely off key for what is essentially a god?\n\nTo me it's nothing more than a cop out, especially since Soraka is a support.\nOh no the weak support champion is weak because she was weak and pathetic over a mortal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monty6669","date":"2017-01-25T06:33:09.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Warwick's lore only had a part of the story, read Soraka's and you'll find out that it wasn't someone she  didn't know, they spent alot of time together, he visited her often, and Soraka fell in love with him.
