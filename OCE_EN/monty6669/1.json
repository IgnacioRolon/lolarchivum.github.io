A three stage advancement tournament, where each team plays a best of 1 against the doom bots in an increasing difficulty. ie. Round 1 level 80, Round 2 level 90 and round 3 level 100\r\n\r\n2. If a team loses, there are OUT!\r\n\r\n3. Final team placements are dependant on how fast they win (or how slowly they lose) against the doom bots.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought of this because the game time is pretty much fixed to less than 20 minutes, so with 8 teams could be played over a single weekend, as the most amount of games would be 24, and that would be a max play time (giving 20 minutes to each game) 8 hours. In a fast pace environment (much like T20 cricket) discussion and anaysis could be fast (around 5 minutes between games) and just smash into the next one. I think it would be fun to see the pro teams tackle this challenge.\r\n\r\nAgain this is not something I could possibly set up, it&#039;s just something I thought might be nice so, RIOT and those pro teams out there, who&#039;s game?","replies":[{"poster":"V 8 ","date":"2016-10-21T03:32:27.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yawn {{champion:427}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-21T04:00:47.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed {{champion:74}}","replies":[]}]}]}
