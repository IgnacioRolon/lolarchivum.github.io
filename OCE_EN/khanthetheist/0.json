I&#039;m a lvl 21 player on the NA server. I&#039;m really split between Ekko and Rengar. I mostly have mid laners, and I main and am good at Zed and Yasuo. Sorta good at Akali. I know that Rengar is a top and jungle champ, and Ekko is a mid and top champ. I like both their kits. Who would you say is more fun and rewarding and has more carry potential if played right. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-01-25T01:19:06.166+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are looking for a more fun champion to play i would say ekko would be the most funnest champion to play as you can juke and outplay, saying that you can mainly single handedly carry games/teamfights with ekko where as Rengar if you are more for making people rage by 1 shotting them and keeping them dead for the whole game (as a Rengar main its fun make them squirm for mercy). AND please don't go full ap ekko if you decide to go him its not useful in team fights he just gets bursted down so fast i find this build work the best, {{item:1402}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3001}} and depending on if you are vsing full ad or more ap damage go {{item:3110}} vs more ad or {{item:3065}} vsing more ap damage and seeing as lissandra is now being played more now its a good item as well on him it lets him heal more with his ultimate. \nHope you have fun mate :)\nIf you want i can help you with rengar builds as well if you decide to play him","replies":[{"poster":"khanthetheist","date":"2016-01-25T01:31:31.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info on AP.

Rengar is like freelo right now as he is like perm banned in ranks his burst is so insane with the ad changes and the change to the ad jungle item now giving 60 ad.","replies":[{"poster":"khanthetheist","date":"2016-01-25T21:19:02.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you for all your help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-25T00:48:41.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar is a bit easier to play, and can carry pretty darn hard when fed. I guess it's the same for Ekko, just being harder to play, but since you can play Zed and Yasuo well, I'd recommend Ekko. Better outplay potential, imo.","replies":[{"poster":"khanthetheist","date":"2016-01-25T00:51:39.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who would you say is more fun?
