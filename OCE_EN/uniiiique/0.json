No one has succeeded.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-13T01:32:22.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean the obvious and easier said than done answer is to wait out his E and dodge his ult. You kinda have to get in his head and predict it though. Bait out the E and all that. Think \"if I was Fizz would I be looking for an ult right about now?\".\n\nI would argue Katarina tbh, because even hitting her with *on target* abilities is a nightmare cause she's never in the same place for more than .2 seconds, and if she's got 3 daggers on the ground you just have to roll the dice and hope you picked the right one oh nevermind she jumped to you and killed you instead.\n#SALT\n\nI was about to say thank goodness I don't see her all that much, but then I remembered that's because I always ban her. I'll take a Yas or a Lee Sin or a fed af Riven over Katarina any day. \n\nI agree with you on Zoe though. Having played her and vsed her, in my experience she really isn't OP. I agree with the nerf to the trap arm time, it was a little dicey to get out of even on a good day, but if you're paying attention like you should be she's really not that bad. Call it encouraging map awareness. Like if you're vsing a Vayne and she condemns you cause you were standing next to the wall, that's on you not on the Vayne.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-13T11:47:58.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I used to be a Fizz main _(back when I was young and stupid)_, so I usually have a pretty good idea of when he's going to do his stuff. but that still doesn't stop him tower diving you and getting away scot-free.\n\nIdk, I just have issues with how his W takes time to charge up its damage _(to levels that are genuinely ridiculous)_, but you can't use that time to defend yourself, because he is untargetable, and you cant run away because you're slowed by 80% or knocked up. And when he does come down to earth, his _**utility**_ ability also does tons of AoE damage, AND also applies a 2nd slow, just to dispel any fleeting thoughts you had of escape. Then he just taps you with his W and you're back into a grey screen again.\n\n____________\n\nAgreed, Zoe is a menace, but she is a menace that can be played around with comparative ease. It's not that hard to stay behind minions, especially in mid lane. Her particles aren't the fastest and with the increased mobility champs have atm, it's not a huge stretch to predict and/or avoid them.\n\nand it's not like she has much followup damage, she has a massive nuke, but not an awful lot else. if you're alive after she slaps you with her E/Q combo, RIP Zoe. Most people run away, but they should just jump on her. Like Aurelion Sol, he has tons of damage, so people run away and thats what gets them killed. Just like Sol, the safest place you can be is right next to Zoe.\n\nI also agree with the E nerf, but I think the true problem is the drowsy time.\nEither it needs to be shorter to allow Zoe less time to set up her combo, or it needs to be longer to allow the victim a little more time to position themselves to make her paddlestar less likely to hit.\n\nAlso, the CD does NOT need to be reduced when she hits someone.\n\nBut I play Zoe, quite a lot, so maybe I'm a little more aware of her weaknesses than most. \nI think she does err towards the OP side, but she isn't as broken as people make out. But of course I'm well aware that we all don't like thinking our own champs are broken. So my credibility isn't exactly bulletproof on this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-13T13:36:17.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's hard for me to comment on Fizz because honestly I just don't see him that much, and I'm also rarely his target and/or his lane enemy so even when he is in games, I rarely have to actually counterplay him.\n\nAs for Zoe, I like her, but I've also played against her a lot more than I've played as her, and I really don't feel she's that much of a problem, even as slow/low mobility champions. She's got one thing that she does really well. Counter that and no problem. Her E being a death sentence of any decently high CC champ in team fights. Lux, Morg, Thresh. Really anyone with a hard CC.\n\nAs for the CD being reduced when she hits someone, remember that it's literally her only escape. She has low escape potential, with only one long CD ability to help her out, whereas most other champs have more than one or one more reliable something.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-13T13:48:46.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All points aside\nJust had this game:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c20d8f278f3ed4197002fab3cec81c44.png\n\nDraven can do it with a single auto attack and nobody panics, but Zoe does it with 3 abilities and this mystical thing called 'aiming' and everybody loses their minds.\n\nhttp://s.quickmeme.com/img/10/10f38cd121df7f0bcce42c5f19e8dbfc3790d20282aefdef975dd003a557c312.jpg","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fab You Less","date":"2018-01-13T08:19:13.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Akali...
