I've literally put so much time into this game on my account and never given anyone my details. The only third party software I can think I've been using is blitz of very late for tft?\r\n\r\nVery lately I've seen a notification when I come out of my games that my account has been logged on elsewhere but it was so rare (like twice) that I didn't think much of it, maybe I got hacked and they used some software? I don't quite know but it's quite ridiculous\r\n\r\nMy account is Juny\r\n\r\nPlease revert the ban, I grew up playing this and I don't want to have to start again","replies":[{"poster":"Arcade Gangster","date":"2020-02-15T06:30:16.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just had the same problem!
