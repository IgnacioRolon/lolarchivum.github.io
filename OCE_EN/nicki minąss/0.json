It's been some time now since that event with Diana and the elders. Just thinking about them saddens me. Maybe I should give my respects and visit again. Heading back on the way to my home I noticed and felt a strange aura. Looking around, then up to mount Targon I could see a dark path of cloud like substance form around near the eastern slops. My body started to quiver. This feeling I have never felt before. Get a grip Leona, I said over and over again in my head while my thoughts started to flow of all the horrible things that could have happened. I picked up my shield and sword and ran toward the Solari temple, heading up mount Targon I found it strange. No monsters .. none at all. I got near enough to see those were not normal clouds. I slammed my shield to the ground and raised my sword high up to the sky. A sharp blinding light shined forth from the sky hitting the dark mist of clouds and illuminated it. The light dimmed out... no effect ... except the fact that what ever that was, now noticed me. Attracted by the power of the ancient weapons the clouds started to creep forward. I needed to get away, I was useless against it. As I was fleeing down the mountain, I saw a cavern with a light shining. I ran into it thinking to take shelter. Heading further and further in a light grew stronger and seemed to take me off edge more and more. When  I reached the end there was a statue of a person with weird writings around. Reading through some of the writing i found it weird that for some reason it seemed to make sense. Talking about the sun and the moon but also something about stars and their guardians? Looking at the rest I read them out loud to grasp them all. Suddenly the light around me grew stronger and then suddenly my Armour started to glow as well and my shield and sword. They all started to change in form. Star guardian.. that's all that rang in my head. It made senses the sun is the a star and I will defend it ... I'll defend all stars including the one i'm on. Running out the cavern I cast my sword to the sky again. The sky opened out and a yellow like gleam shot out and come down with the similar but different sensation of the sun. This time it seemed to hurt the cloud making it flee. Then at the distance another light came down from the sky. It was silver as silver as the moon. Diana.
