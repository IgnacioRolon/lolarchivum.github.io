I can launch the game and then after I enter my login details, its loads, comes up with &#039;logging in&#039; for about 40 seconds until and error code pops up telling me I cant connect to the PVP network. After that it automatically closes league.

What ISP do you use?\n\nThis was reported by another player in Help & Support earlier today, and he was able to solve it thanks to a [suggestion from SephirothSG](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/lYxuY7JV-having-trouble-logging-in?comment=00010000) to change his DNS.\n\nLet me know if that works for you.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
