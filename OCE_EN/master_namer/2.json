You are probably playing on the Sydney servers on Overwatch (which can be confusing I know because you log in in the \"America\" platform).\n\nThis though doesn't explain why you are having issue with League.\nFrom the information I can gather, you are with IINET which is actually a good ISP.\n\nHave you tried to log in to the TOOLBOX and change some settings? You can optimize your connection for gaming and should greatly help (it did for me).\nBut again, not sure how to explain the difference with Overwatch.\n\nIf you are able to provide some more information on you NETWORK LOGS following this link, perhaps we can get to the bottom of it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#section-windows\n\nMM","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-02T00:36:32.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's insane, most people in North America don't get 32 ping to their own server. It seems to me like your ISP is doing some really dodgy routing when it connects you to servers.\n\nAlthough this raises a few questions:\n\n+ What happens when you connect to Sydney's Overwatch Server? Do you get 150 ping as well?\n\n+ And have you tried connecting to League's NA servers? What kind of ping are you getting there?","replies":[]}]}
