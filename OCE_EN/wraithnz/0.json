I decided to leave and got queue blocked for 20 mins. Stuff like this just makes me think that Riot is ok with all of the trolling because there is no option for me to just leave because opf a toxic player in champ select. I just don&#039;t feel like I shoudl be penalised for this, he shoudl because he is the one trolling yet here I am blocked from queue and he has gone to find another pack of summoners to piss off.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-02-25T12:13:06.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"News flash, riot has never cared!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-25T12:22:43.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=trolledallmylife,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=X0mr81fX,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-25T12:13:06.348+0000)\n>\n> News flash, riot has never cared!\n\nGlad to see you still on job with your crusade. /I kid","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-23T07:42:15.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you have like a team or something, stick with solo/duo queue bud.\n\nFlex from my very limited experience, has an abnormal amount of trolls for some reason. Like my very first game in it was up against a toxic 5-man premade.... not a great impression. But hey. I say stay away from it is better for your health especially if you're a soloman.\n\n............\n\nThat said, yes, Riot should find some way to put a report function in champ select. I get if poorly implemented it would be open to abuses, but this game really needs that now.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-24T02:18:35.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because flex isn't ranked, its a pimped up normals","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2017-02-23T08:05:47.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know that u lose lp and get a timer if u q dodge in ranked game","replies":[]}]}
