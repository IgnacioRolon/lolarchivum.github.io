I'm still going to submit a ticket and ask for it restored, might as well try.\n\nCan you tell me if there's anything that I can do on my end? The account mattered a lot to me seeing as I spent 50$ RP on champs and ranked it into platinum 3. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-23T17:02:29.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha, what? \n\nadmitting your account is not even yours AND that it was botted on\n\nyea.. im SUREEEE you will get it back. lol","replies":[{"poster":"Aray","date":"2014-11-28T05:37:35.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said the account wasn't mine, it's under my email.

Regardless of whatever expenses you have made on the account. \n\nThat said you should be grateful it is only a permanent suspension of one account and not an IP address suspension, because they are a lot more painful (but still manageable).
