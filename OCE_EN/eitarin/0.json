Preferably a jungler but I really don't care as long as you know how to win. Please look me up as Eitarin; shoot me an invite if you're down. I'll be on shortly after posting this.\r\n\r\nI might also be looking for a clash team because I'm not sure if mine's going to go ahead again cause the guy leading it is pretty done with league due to the same problem I'm having I believe. Anyway yeah let me know. \r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[]}
