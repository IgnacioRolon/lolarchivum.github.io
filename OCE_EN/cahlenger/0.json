You will not get a high speed just because you are on the NBN connection. The closer you are to the NBN node, the better the connection will be. You also need to take into consideration of the fact how many people use the Internet in your family and also environmental factors. I am right next to the node so i get 98mpbs with 8 ping. Find out how close you are to the node, compare prices and find out what is the best in your area by making a few calls. Please remember the main factor is how close you are to the NBN node. Not the ISP. Hope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"cahlenger","date":"2018-02-04T03:34:52.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah thanks for your response.
