I just realized the other day when I had to fill top that I have no idea who is in the meta in the top lane besides Illaoi and Garen. I know its a traditionally a tank, but who can be a good top laner? And are a lot of them junglers too (like Pantheon, Zac, etc)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-21T05:39:35.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't main top, so I wont go too in-depth here. But top lane is usually fairly brutal, and you need to either out duel or out sustain your opponent.\n\nHere are some decent picks in the current meta:\n\n+ **Tanks**: {{champion:54}} Malphite, {{champion:14}} Sion, {{champion:36}} Dr. Mundo, {{champion:106}} Volibear, {{champion:75}} Nasus, {{champion:86}} Garen, {{champion:44}} Taric\n\n+ **Duelists**: {{champion:114}} Fiora, {{champion:77}} Udyr, {{champion:80}} Pantheon, {{champion:102}} Shyvanna, {{champion:23}} Tryndamere, {{champion:48}} Trundle\n\n+ **Trolls**: {{champion:17}} Teemo, {{champion:27}} Singed\n\nI'd recommend trying out the tanks first, since they are the easiest. Also keep in mind I left out lots of other good picks like {{champion:133}} Quinn just to keep it simple.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-02-22T09:02:09.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm... If you say Taric is decent top I'll try it, though I am bias towards him being useless. I am happy that I seem to own most of the champs mentioned except Fiora, Voli, and Trundle.
