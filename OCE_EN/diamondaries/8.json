I&#039;m just here to ask about a good software to use to record my gameplay. I think I&#039;ve sort of hit a wall in improving my gameplay, and I think that watching me play a game and picking out things I&#039;m doing wrong will help me improve. So far, I&#039;ve tried OBS and LoLreplay, but neither work effectively. OBS doesn&#039;t make videos to a good enough quality to for me to critically analyse, and LoLreplay simply doesn&#039;t want to work. Any other software out there that can help me? \n\nAlso, if you know one that can somehow record it like it is in spectator mode, that would be brilliant. However, it isn't that necessary. \n\nThanks guys :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-04T06:01:36.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm using www.replay.gg and thats worked really well for me.","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-04T06:09:37.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its really good, since if your team is trash you can watch them feed over and over again :D","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-04T07:39:13.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"way more productive if you just analyse your own mistakes and improve with each game. no point getting your jimmies rustled by things you cant control.","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-04T21:58:20.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might come out sounding wrong but, what you there was nothing you can do to improve.

There are definitely games where all seems lost and there nothing you could have done. But I honestly believe unless you are top 50 player challenger there is ALWAYS something you could have done better. Even within the first 10 minutes we all make a tonne of mistakes, the most common being not capitalizing on enemy mistakes. Every player makes mistakes early in lane once in a while and challenger players easily capitalize and get kills/build leads.\n\nI would highly suggest watching this series by one of our local uni clubs UNSW - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\n2 Months ago I had a bad stretch and TL:DR - I went like 1 - 17 dropped heaps. I wanted to point out that in each of these games it was easy for me to point and blame team mates for the loss and just leave it at that. But after each game it was possible for me to review and learn something, this meant that even though I was frustrated and tilted and depressed I was still (hopefully) improving and learning after each game. When I go through this I always think about how this is only 11 games out of 524.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying every loss is on you and every win is on you. But every single game I guarantee unless you're faker you can learn and improve. If you can find joy in playing the game and improving and not just winning then you will find not only do you enjoy League of Legends more but you will actually win more in the long run!\n\nHope this helps man, GL HF on the Rift","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-05T00:22:12.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow Thanks for this, can already see it helping :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-04T23:33:31.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GCSBBlitzForever,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OqXVB7eM,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2015-11-04T21:58:20.332+0000)\n>\n> This might come out sounding wrong but, what you there was nothing you can do to improve.
