For me, the quick navigation bar at the top of the page is gone, which stops me from logging in and quickly accessing the boards after seeing what&#039;s new on League. I have to actually Google the website for the boards to get to them.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all your replies for solutions guys. The problems seem to have fixed themselves after a while, which is strange.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-26T23:17:47.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything fine for me......Maybe just wait a while, and it'll fix itself","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-11-26T23:32:17.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay...
