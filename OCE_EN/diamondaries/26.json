Are you hitting too much?\n\nThere could just be a bug that is not allowing it to work with spells, since on hit is basically an AA attack combined with a spell it could be that.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-11-15T01:14:06.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I tried it with Ezreal, Braum (who I was playing when I noticed it) and Pantheon.\n\nAlso, when you proc it, you get a \"buff\" that has the CD of bandit. When it expires, you can proc it again.\n\nAt first I thought that it just didn't apply to skills shots and AoE spells, since it never proc'd on Braum's Q or R. So I tried it with Pantheon, since his Q is a single target spell. It didn't proc off of that either, nor his W, E, or R. So then I tried it with Ezreal, since I thought maybe it didn't proc properly for melee champions. It would only proc off of his Q, which applies on-hit effects. Otherwise, it didn't proc off of his W, E, or R.\n\nAnd this is how I found out that it only currently gets proc'd by AA and spells that apply on-hit effects. So, either it's a bug, or the description of the mastery is wrong. It needs to be fixed.","replies":[]}]}]}
