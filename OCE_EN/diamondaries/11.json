I&#039;ve been getting really into jungling lately and was hoping if you guys could possibly post some good/strong junglers at the moment. My main go-to Jungler at the moment is Zac because I like the tank initiating disrupter sort of thing. Other than Zac I really don&#039;t have another Jungler I like.

Fyi Nunu's ult have 250%Ap scaling :D. {{champion:19}} Warwick is also an extremely good jungler and have quite an awesome gank too. Just get a blade of the ruined king and ult in the face of an enemy ADC and he/she will be dead or at least half dead. The best thing about this two junglers is you can stay in the jungle 24/7 and you don't need any leash to start jungling at all. Nunu is also very good at counter- jungling. The best thing about this two champ is they are cheap :D.

I did get into Nunu for a bit, but I find his role to be a bit niche, as I felt that his main role was to set back their jungler into irrelevance with his counter-jungle shenanigans. I did like how easy it was to secure objectives though, and he is decent for helping out with the towers with his Blood Boil.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-10T03:26:20.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin is good early too but not tanky","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-10T14:10:21.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try Ap Xin Zhao","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-11T05:52:12.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All right I will try out Xin since I really like him.
