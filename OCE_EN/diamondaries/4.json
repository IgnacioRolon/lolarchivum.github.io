You need to take some time off ranked games and start enjoying the fun side of LoL. For me, I usually get tilted because of the desire to climb but that has very adverse effect on my own mental health. You get more frustrated when you lose and that in turn translates onto the next game. This will continue to multiply until the very end where you will have a prolonged losing streak. By this time, you're almost done with league forever. To prevent this, take some time off LoL, however long you need. It takes me approximately a week to recover (I'm on my break right now) and it will also help you during your HSC trials. We've all been there but remember to prioritise the exams over games, use it only as a form of relaxation therapy, not  a mechanism for more stress.\n\nIf you need a duo partner to play normals/hexakill/event games, I'm up for it.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-16T00:39:16.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sweet, thanks man.

There a champs which you may see people play and go 'oh, he looks easy' and then you go and feed. But the simple way to put it is you don't understand the mechanics of the champ and why the person is playing it. Example being Ekko so many people playing him right now but are either a hit or miss in solo queue or norms where ever it be. But that is because they don't understand the combos or how much damage or even how to build him. When you are playing new champs it is best to understand what the best combo is for maximum damage and how much damage you are able to deal with this combo. A thing I regularly do even on champs I know how to play I constantly check how much damage each ability does after a item purchase just so I am able to calculate whether I am able to I can all in someone for a guaranteed kill.\n\nAs for tilt, best thing I find is simply removing myself from playing the game watch a movie or play some CS:GO whatever it may be, something that is remote from League is the best thing to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-15T04:32:32.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is weird as it feels just try and forget about League. Force yourself not to think about it and pick other things to do with your time than play or even go on boards. Seriously, log out and close tab, it helps. If you are constantly feeling bad about how you are going in game there is no reason to keep playing. As soon as you forget that negativity will disappear because it will no longer matter.","replies":[]}]}
