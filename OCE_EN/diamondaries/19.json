However, due to his rise in the meta and professional play, he is being picked and banned more often than he used to be.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I need another jungle pick. Can you guys suggest some junglers that have a similar play style as Zac, or at least good gankers that are tanky as well? Bonus points if they have a high damage build I can use periodically if Top picks a tank.\r\n\r\nThanks guys","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-17T00:02:16.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sej.
