Her kit has so many on-hit effects it isn&#039;t funny. Her ult passive proc will allow a longer dragon and lower &quot;CD&quot;, her W passive will proc twice, her E mark will proc twice, and her Q after an AA will proc Sated again after resetting the AA.\r\n\r\nNow, if you build her with on-hit items, like BoRK, Black Cleaver, Wits End, and Frozen Mallet, on paper it looks OP. \r\n\r\nSo here is my question; how broken is Shyvana with Sated Devourer?","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-28T07:07:56.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DiamondAries,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=I4sW6v8o,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-28T01:47:44.010+0000)\n>\n> So here is my question; how broken is Shyvana with Sated Devourer?\n\nWatch the last TSM vs C9 game to see Shyvana wreck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T02:15:05.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people done this. its bs she doesn't get hurt and she like 2 hits you","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-28T05:03:00.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I knew it wasn't original, but really the only League I've had is watching the OPL.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-28T02:40:04.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes been one of the most popular junglers since the item came out (and the only devourer jungler ive noticed in lcs), so yes, it's good.
