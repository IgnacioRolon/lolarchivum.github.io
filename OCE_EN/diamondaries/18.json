I usually have smart cast turned on for everything. \r\n\r\nIs this wrong? Should I turn them off and use regular cast instead? What is the advantage of having them turned off?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Eustace Fysher","date":"2015-06-05T01:43:52.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/nuHfVn_cfHU","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-04T09:15:13.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmmm ... I'll say that with regular cast on you can press say q and position it for use before clicking (say it was a skillshot), it would be more accurate than smartcasting. However with smartcasting you sac accuracy for faster reactions. Idk its a matter of personal opinion. Personally smart cast works better for me.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-04T22:52:46.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, that's basically what I thought. I really do prefer smart cast because it makes everything quicker.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-04T17:38:32.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have reached level, it is time to turn smart cast on for every spell and at least 2 of your item slots(for botrk and such). You will quickly learn the ranges of your spells and you will actually find it easier to land skillshots after a while because you are relying on instinct over an indicator. It also obviously gives you a quicker possible reaction speed, and makes it easier to perform intricate combos( one shotting with rengar , insec with lee sin etc)","replies":[]}]}
