I&#039;ve noticed however that my post-game stats are indicating a lack of contribution to the team. I just wanted to come to the forums to get some advice to try and improve my game, and see what I&#039;m doing wrong and (hopefully) right.\n\nFirstly, I have noticed that I usually place the fewest wards on the team and I am finding it a bad thing. Usually I swap out my warding totem for the sweeper the first time I back, along with buying a pink and a couple of stealth wards. I&#039;ve been pondering the viability of a Sightstone (obviously trading it in for a late game item) in the jungle role, but I just wanted to hear your guys&#039; opinions on it. BTW, I usually pink the dragon or baron pits when I can, while I usually ward the bushes near river that go into my jungle with my stealth wards. \n\nSecondly, I seem to make the least amount of gold on my team most of the time. I&#039;m pretty sure this is because of my farming though. I usually clear all of the jungle at first, but then I usually help out bot lane as much as I can so that we have control over Dragon. This usually leads to me only clearing one side of the jungle regularly, excluding the buffs because I&#039;m on top of those and often give them to the laners on my team. I know I should probably roam more and clear the rest of my jungle, but I feel that by leaving bot lane I am releasing pressure on that lane and that they are more vulnerable to ganks which, if the bot laners get killed and we lose Dragon, I feel is my fault.\n\nLastly, my KDA seems a bit lackluster. Now I&#039;m not having a sook about this, but I'm just asking for tips to improve it. I seem to die a lot, but I don&#039;t think I feed because I score way more assists than deaths (could be though, depends on your definition of \"feeding\"). In a typical game, my KDA is looking like 3/10/19. In my opinion this is average at best, and I know that me choosing tanky junglers like Zac (my go-to jungler) instead of carry junglers like Kha&#039;Zix isn&#039;t really helping that. \n\nTips would be great and thanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"span","date":"2015-05-28T06:09:37.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"try getting at least 1 camp on the way to a gank if your health and mana can afford it, just to keep your farm/gold up consistently. also, every time before you gank, check how close you are to leveling up. if 1 more creep kill will level you up before a gank, take the time to do it. that little bit extra damage/health may result in a kill/assist or save your life.\n\nI also like to get deep wards in enemy jungle as much as possible so i know where enemy jungler is. if i see enemy jungler at his red side camps, i go clear his blue side jungle, or set up a counter gank bot/mid if i cant clear his blue side quick enough. i do this not only to keep my farm up, but to starve out the enemy jungler so they don't impact the game as much.\n\nalso, instead of buying a sweeper, try upgrading your totum early so you can place 2 stealth wards, and use your raptor buf to clear enemy wards.\n\ndont know how effective you will find this, but its food for thought :)","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-28T09:13:37.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually used to do that, but then a friend told me to switch to the sweeper after my first clear to clear wards in brushes and things like that.

Thanks for the advice friend :D\n\nAlso, \n- for the first two buff spawns, you take priority m8.\n- don't go support level warding, ward river paths and places your laners missed when going ALONG your jg path.\nalso try deep warding in common paths to lane/ your jg if counter jgling (aka ward defensively when playing aggressive)\n- Dragon isn't the most important thing in the game like allied lanes, I get you want to keep it secure but camping bot will starve you out and put pressure on other lanes because they don't have any support to help them.\n- If you are about to level up before taking an objective, level up/ take some farm on your way if you can. Even if it costs you some time and its not super urgent.\n- Some champs who have health gain and some sort of armour buff will definitely be able to take dragon after their first successful jg path, like Rengar (assuming you are level 4, took every camp (except one big buff) in your jg, and have farming smite).\n- Ganks are for kills and objectives primarily (try not to take them early, your laner needs them more), not just pressure.\n**This** is the most important bit\n- If your team sucks and they can't wipe their asses without your help, don't blame yourself at all even if they are. This causes tilt and/or lack of participation and nobody wants that, not even you.\n\nFood for thought _span 8 hours ago_","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-28T22:26:35.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That \"food for thought\" you offered is quite a feast.

Try to decide what items you want to buy before you back so you know how much money you will need and can back with the 100-200 extra for wards and potions on top of big items. Only time you wouldn't get wards is if you die or are forced to buy with the exact amount for a big item like your cinderhulk or something. I would recommend staying with the warding totem and upgrading it on your first back after level 9. This pretty much eliminates the need to buy green wards after this point and saves in inventory slot. Also try to buy a pink ward every back when you dont have one on the field. This is especially important later in the game so you can clear vision on dragon/baron if an opportunity comes up(since you won't have sweeper). If you do go with sweeper you need to continue buying wards (saving a slot for this is quite important, buying 3 wards instead of filling up your last slot with a small item like ruby crystal or cloth armour is always better) and make sure you aren't wasting the wards (they're 75g each) and sweeper. Sightstone also isn't a bad choice on tank junglers.\n\nFarming: Try to pick your ganks a bit better so you aren't wasting time. Trying to gank when you're unlikely to get a kill or objective out of it sets you up to waste time or get counterganked and die. Also try to farm a camp or two on the way to a gank (especially if you're coming from base) and try to plan your route out so you dont end up somewhere with full hp and nothing to do on that side of the map. Once you are low and can't really gank any more you can usually clear several more camps before you back, so that you can immediately get out and help your team after buying. Later in the game when you can clear quickly and without losing much hp always try to grab camps on the way past.\n\nKDA: Having hardly any kills is fine if you have assists, especially on someone like zac. The high deaths is an issue though. It probably means you're not always picking good times to fight/engage or you get caught out frequently. My point about picking good times to gank also applies here, ganking when you're low HP and/or the enemy jungler is likely to be in the area can just lead to you dying when you try to gank. I also notice you dont take flash on zac, this is probably contributing to you dying alot in situations you could flash away from so you might want to switch to that. Carry type junglers like Kha'zix who are squishy and need gold to be effective are even more reliant on picking good fights and not wasting time in the early game, and get punished harder for being out of position so I probably wouldn't recommend them yet.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-31T10:37:40.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, thanks for the advice. I really appreciate it.\n\nWith the warding, I will try out keeping the warding totem for wards the next couple of times I play. Then I might try the Sighstone and Sweeper path for Zac, since 800g for practically infinite wards and 400hp is pretty decent.\n\nYour farming advice has been given multiple times in this forum by multiple people, so that just proves how liable it is. I will definitely be implementing this into my games.\n\nAs for ganking, I will try and work on the timing and choosing my fights rather than forcing them. Where I think I went wrong is where I thought that just forcing them out of lane was enough of a successful gank (which when you force a turret this is true) rather than making sure you score a kill/assist. As for the carry junglers, I do not usually like playing them because I dislike champions being super squishy regardless of the amount damage they deal, so this isn't as big a problem for me.\n\nAnd yeah I don't take flash for Zac, as a feel that taking Exhaust is better for securing kills and also that he has his slingshot for an escape, so he doesn't really need Flash. I might be wrong about this though, it really wouldn't surprise me at all. I might start taking Flash for the extra escape, if you really think it will help.\n\nThanks for the tips, I really do appreciate it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-28T05:44:33.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only get sightstone on lee sin (ward hops) and nunu? for counter jg.
