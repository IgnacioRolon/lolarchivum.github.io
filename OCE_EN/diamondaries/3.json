(Against scary enemy burst mage)\nMpen Marks, Armor seals, MR Glyphs, AP Quints (If you dont know if their AP and AD are switching lanes and the AD Zed is mid and Lissandra is top, or Lissandra is mid and Zed is top, although the Standard mage page can be taken anyway and is usually good regardless as you power spike off it mid game so you can play relatively safe regardless [mid lane is a relatively safe lane so you can take risks a lot of top laners wont and bot laners fight a lot so they usually take flat stats]\n\n(You can abuse this knowledge too by the way, with your own designs, just be aware of the strengths/weaknesses [a lot of them are match dependent also].\n\nTake hybrid marks with any of these pages or - sometimes, an enemy AP laner will know you outrange them or can bully with auto attacks a lot so will take flat armor seals to endure your harass so taking flat hybrid pen - is more useful, plus even if they dont take armor it can still help you harass them more, but them taking armor and you having hybrid pen makes their armor way less productive a thing to have taken in their Seals.\n\nAlso, taking Armor with CDR/L Glyphs or MR can help you endure a jungler as well (if they have an AD jungler or something, having armor can help you fight them or survive ganks also).\n\nAnother thing, taking AP/L Glyphs with any of these setups is standard for mages that (like cassiopeia or rumble) that don't use cooldowns to the same extent as champs like LeBlanc or Lux who benefit a LOT from Cooldown reduction.\n\nThe thing is, Top lane has become very dangerous this patch, so where people used to take per level runes for a lot of their runes anc back it up with items like armor items on their HP/L Seals etc, it's probably better to be taking a lot of flat stats there (And playing sustain/range/mobile/super tanky) - mid lane has become a slaughter fest so Id' probably incline towards flat stats a lot there too, Bot lane I would just go to the wall with the attack speed quints page and only take flat AD if I was say Cait and can just farm and bully from range and waveclear with Q so I can lane control and don't really miss the attack speed much plus I can avoid getting forced into trades by using Q to waveclear whilst trying to poke and make it to mid game relatively easily.\n\nJinx you may as well Armor Pen your Quints and just go for mid game as you can play safe to some extent with her now and still go aggressive - because of the way Fervor works it synergizes well with her pow pow mode as she can gain and keep stacks easily and doesn't have waveclear without fishbones but that also keeps up stacks and she was always good at controlling lane and now that she has a mastery that benefits her a lot (she unlike a lot of carries can keep it up consistently just through her design) Armor pen is probably the way to go.\n\nJunglers have better later sustain but poor early wave clear so even with them your flat stat pages are probably the best, \n\nSupports on the other hand are better with early aggression so the flat HP seems to be better along with opting out on Gold per 10 (you get more passive gold now, so it's better to go aggressive stats and taking flat HP Seals and Armor Marks or Magic pen marks is probably optimal along with AP Quints (for harass supports like Vel'Koz, Brand, Annie, Zyra and Sona), HP Regen Quints (For Leona, Thresh etc) or 1 CDR and 2 AP Quints (for the more caster based like soraka).\n\nOther than that, hybrid pen, HP/L Seals, AP/L Glyphs and AP Quints are good on Akali (with Armor seals and AP/L If you are against an AD Bully counter like renekton or Lee Sin) and HP/L Seals and MR Glyphs vs Leblanc, Armor and MR if you dont know if its an AD or AP enemy or they have an AD Jungler (Or AP Jungler and you know you are laning against an AD) or if you are worried about auto-attack harass (Syndra is notorious for this, as is Annie since going near them is usually a bad idea they can sorta get up in your face with auto-attacks and conserve mana just by the threat of you being close range for an easy full combo or w/e) and with Katarina I like to take HP/L Seals almost regardless; because I like to be able to tank a little more around mid game with a dive and the tankier I am, the more chance I'll be able to commit to and land a full combo, or turn around and flash shunpo ulti - armor might help me a bit more earlier in the game but once people have armor pen or some damage behind them, the damage they can do in respect to the amount my armor absorbs is trumped by the fact I gain armor per level anyway.\n\nKeep in mind though, Kat unlike some AP's gets Magic Resist per level. No Ranged Champion gains Magic resist per level.\n\nYasuo, Maokai, Kassadin and Poppy do not gain magic resist per level.\n\nElise, Gnar, Nidalee, Jayce, Gnar and Kayle do not gain Magic resist per level because they are not always in melee form and all Champs that do get MR/L get 1.25 reaching 53.4 base MR at level 18 (that's MR having no masteries or runes on board) which is something good to keep in mind, as if you are a support or AP mid with no magic resist items or runes, or are against an enemy with flat pen itemisation you can quickly find yourself being hurt a lot, where taking MR can do a lot for you [countering this can do you wonders as well].\n\nA lot of what happens in game chains from events before you even click play, I hope what I said here helped.\n\nThis is all subject to change though as meta shifts and new power spikes arise, plus powerful Champions take the spotlight or strategies and synergies - the basics help though and if you run into one of these events; knowing some of this might help you recognize it, be prepared for it better than most would be or even shut it down before it happens\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-14T05:49:56.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can basically take anything in the Jungle though.\n\nLike I run 52% Attack speed Nocturne once in a while for the passive HP Return proc and still manage to powerspike later even though I die in two hits to anything, have to base after Krugs then almost die to Gromp after soloing blue then flash over the wall just in case the Enemy lee sin decides to invade and simply smites me for the kill or in case it was warded and he was rushing to get me. lel. :p sometimes... (Just paranoid - no pun intended). http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/8/8d/Paranoia.png\n\nI don't like making Jungle pages cause you can make do with a few, but when you get into the specifics, the amount of different pages you can run is a lot more than basically any lane pages because you can choose to mix risk reward and strategies and strengths/weaknesses in so many ways and try to go for like lvl 3 power spikes, level 8 power spikes, go for a huge late game power or go for lvl 6 OPness but in the end these strategies are so risky that a lot of the time it's better to stick to basics and focus on your builds as a lot of these strats leave huge vulnerabilities ( A lot of Junglers can avoid punishment for taking such risks tho, much moreso than laners which is why their page options in my opinion are so vast, plus your enemy can be left in the dark (again no pun intended) which can add to the effectiveness of such strategies although it can also be completely shut down if they notice or simply take small risks of their own and such small risks can pay off immensely if you have gone for a strat and now suffered a laner losing their matchup or something almost entirely because of you [there's a reason people always blamce junglers, they are a lot like a wild card in the game and even if they don't try to abuse power opportunities etc can still be the primary cause of a problem, or simply have been unaware and caused problems, or an allies failure can create problems and often you are the only person with the resources to help and if you choose not to, this can cause arguments etc where they want to know why you are making certain decisions etc and you dont have time so people just see \"blame\" comments which are basically questions which is probably the reason \"Jungle blame\" became a sort of meme of LoL) or can fail miserably and also the pages are so vast and so situational that in a lot of matches they aren't viable because of 1 or 2 enemy champs picked, because your team needs something different (like early ganks) or you might not have gank opportunities because of the matchup so your early power spike setup is basically useless or your huge scaling page might be bad because you need mid game strength and taking a basic balanced page keeps you away from capping out on your 20 rune pages for one jungler alone and also give you a more level amount of power and the pages I listed above are mostly balanced and create a level amount of power rather than going for strengths, weaknesses, synergies or counters and and/or going against strengths, weaknesses, synergies and counters (in basically any combination). You might want to go for a lot of specific pages for a certain Champion though and I can say it's fun and I do it occasionally, but for evenly distributed power I prefer having a few rune pages for each role, a few variants and a few specifics and a few fun pages so that I have a pretty balanced level of options and can play a wide role of Champions a variety of different ways and think this is probably better than having 10 pages for Riven alone because if they first pick Renekton, it doesn't matter what Rune page you have when it comes down to it because you never know if he's their Jungler and you've been played before level 1 in preparing that counter to your weakness page and then being \"out-positioned\" - it can open a weakness (You coulda armor stacked and the new top laner that is not the renekton you were expecting who is now their jungler is an Ekko and he will dunk all over your Armor) plus even if you do pick into a bad matchup - having a specialised page can suffer the same fate - whereas a balanced page covers most of your bases and with your team picking with you, countering enemies, picking combos and synergizing with you and mixing things up - being balanced overall will most likely serve to be advantageous, where having a specific strength can leave you wide open to a Champion picked to home in on your specific weakness, or a playstyle, or even something as seemingly inconspicuous as an off-meta summoner (these can completely shut down your power pick quickly) and if your power is even more heavily enhanced upon by runes, that counter could be even more enhanced in effect and shut you down even more promptly and balancing your strategy out in the end is often the most powerful thing you can do before level 1 and even from then on).","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-14T06:10:39.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep in mind things like late gamers: {{champion:34}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:67}} \n\nAnd infinite scalers (Champs with no end game that get stronger infinitely): {{champion:45}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:14}} \n\nChamps that snowball (Require semi-safe play to vs or w/e): {{champion:92}} \n\nOr Champs that are strong early: {{champion:80}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:22}} as this can affect what strats and hence usually what runes you might wanna take.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-11-14T09:18:56.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG...
