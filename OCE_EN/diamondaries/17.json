Why do you need to make the key fragments so rare as well. I&#039;m bad at the game and am sitting on 5 chests atm, and its taken more than 2 weeks to not even obtain 3 frags. bull crap in my opinion.\r\n\r\nPlease buff the drop rate, or make it so you get one with 1st win or something","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-22T12:48:27.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PSA: play arams, even if you don't like them, in about 10 games i got 2 full keys. just screw around with mates, that's what aram is for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-13T15:40:09.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it only drops for wins and drops more often with pre-mades.
