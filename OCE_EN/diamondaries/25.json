Need Help!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, yesterday I purchased and installed a new graphics card; an Asus Geforce GTX 750. Once I had installed it and the driver, I went to play League, only to find that the Login screen wouldn&#039;t load. I have tried everything I could think of, even reverting back to the original built-in one I was using before, but when I do that, the monitor doesn&#039;t even show anything on the screen. If there are any tech wizards out there, I could really use your help.\n\nI know that I have installed the card and the drivers correctly, because I have experimented with games like Spore and Minecraft and their performance has been increased significantly. I would imagine that league would have the same results, but I can't login.","replies":[{"poster":"Rebmucuc","date":"2015-06-24T02:29:08.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try restarting computer.
