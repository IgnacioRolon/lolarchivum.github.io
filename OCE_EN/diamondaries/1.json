I just don't understand how riot can keep such a champ like vayne the way  she is. I'm aware that if she gets fed early its gg, since if she just makes it mid game without dying its gg. If she gets killed early then its gg for her. I get snowbally champs, but that is just ridiculous how much damage she can do when a little ahead, then it gets to a lot ahead then before you know it she has 20k gold when the fed vel on the other team has 13k and died 4 times in the last 10 minutes just because you can tumble auto auto him and he dies","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-03T16:02:22.539+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"47.8% win rate, and 48% plat and above, yep totally a broken champ there.\n\nThe reason it's not being nerfed?\n\nBecause it's a damn shitty build that only works in low elo at best, and at worst just doesn't work at all.\n\nGuinsoo's is bad, because not only do you lose AS from building the item (until you have at least 4 stacks) but you have just spent 3.6k gold on 35 AD and a mediocre passive.\n\nSure it's great if the enemy fights you just after you finish minions off, but assuming the enemy team doesn't let that happen, you have a huge waste of gold until 6 auto's into the fight, that is no small amount of time.\n\nGold Value's (taken from the wiki);\n\n35 attack damage = 1225 Gold\n50 ability power = 1087.5 Gold\n15 on-hit magic damage = 375 Gold\nGold Value = 2687.5 Gold\n\n6 stacks\n48% attack speed = 1200 Gold\n18 attack damage = 630 Gold\n24 ability power = 522 Gold\nGold Value = 2352 Gold\nTotal Gold Value = 5039.5 Gold\n\nBut wait, vayne doesn't use AP so lets go fix all these numbers to not take AP into account.\n\n35 attack damage = 1225 Gold\n15 on-hit magic damage = 375 Gold\nGold Value = 1600 Gold\n\n6 stacks\n48% attack speed = 1200 Gold\n18 attack damage = 630 Gold\nGold Value = 1830 Gold\nTotal Gold Value = 3430 Gold\n\nNow let's take into account that you just paid 3600 Gold for this, and considering the main benefit isn't in effect until 2-4 seconds into a fight (unless again the enemy team engages just after a minion wave.) this is a terribly worthless item, and you gain more by buying something like PD which gives you useful stats, and doesn't require the fight to finish before you are useful.\n\nThe biggest complainers are the people who try to fight a vayne after she clears a minion wave, and they get one shot because they did something that was stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-06-03T16:33:36.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't put a gold value on the passive effect.

It was so bogus like even just thinking about it now makes me angry. I wasn't even mad at the game, and thought every played well, except the vayne because it was bs. Literally, every time she would come up the fun of the game just left because you are left with an unkitable invisible enemy that just two shots you with autos. Can't burst her down because of lifesteal. Can't fight her because she fights better. Literally, a full q w e w ult from me was somewhere between 2-2.5k damage with 1.3 being true damage because of the researched target. And she survived with over 1/2 her hp cause the xin in her face she just lifestealed her health back from.\n\nidk if she was hacking or whatever, but she just wouldn't die.

Her short range and lack of flat dps as well as situational hard CC compared to other ADC's are her shortcoming. \n\nTo put it simply, most adc's do more damage than vayne, amazing isn't it? Some adc's are more mobile and have more range so overall they are much safer. They also have stronger CC, Poking abilities, tankier and more burst. All of these traits inherently make them better team fighters because they are easier to peel for and have tools at their disposal for their own safety. \n\nGuinsoos is actually bad on Vayne despite popular belief. While the on hit passive is decent it you can only really take advantage of phantom hit at 6 stacks of guinsoos and to be actually honest, you are far better off with a crit build simply because you would deal more physical damage than true damage every time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-03T14:24:24.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's always been broken, but Riot refuse to nerf her.\nHell they buffed the thing about her that makes her overpowered.\n\nSilver Bolts used to do 8% Max HP, now it does 12%.\n\nPeople complain about the Tank Meta, yet the existence of Vayne makes the Tank Meta look like Wet Paper Bag Meta.\n\nNo champion should have True Damage as a MAX % HP attack.
