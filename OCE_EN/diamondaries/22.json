He already has tentacle appendages, and his eye could be the \"bell\" of the jellyfish. When he moves and Recalls, he sort of already looks like a jellyfish. He already attacks with bolts of what looks like electricity, so just giving his AA a blue tinge wouldn't be that hard (I imagine. I'm in no way experienced with computer animation or design. This is me just sharing my ideas). His Q - *Plasma Fission* - could be turned into a ball of water, or blue energy. His W - *Void Rift* - could open a trench in the ground, and when the explosion happens, a sort of pulse of water could be sent out of it, much like an underwater volcano or geyser. His E - *Tectonic Disruption* - could look similar to {{champion:267}} **Nami's** *Aqua Prison* with the bubble and everything, except that they don't sit there and float, they just get a normal knock up (and sometimes, back). His Ultimate - *Life Form Disintegration Ray* - could be a forcefully ejected jet of water, like a fire hose.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the jellyfish idea could be an Octopus or Squid Vel'Koz, where the water could be substituted for ink. I guess that already matches more with the style of Vel'Koz; black, ominous, and sinister ink.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just thought I'd share my idea with the community and my fellow summoners.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for your contribution.\" - {{champion:161}}","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-29T12:40:25.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems you really like tentacles buddy,\n\nDon't blame you, I like watching them in action too.\n\nReally though, a lot of void creatures and the afflicted have the Deep Sea skin, Vel, Kha and hopefully Rek should get theirs too.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-01-29T21:22:34.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too sure what you're implying with the \"watching them in action\" part, but I'm going to assume you mean them kicking ass, to which I say, yes I do. I think it's fun to play Vel'Koz and burst people down from full to zero in around 2 seconds.\n\nI wouldn't be too fussed if this didn't actually become an official skin, I'm just trying to share my ideas with the community.
