He is however my favourite champion, and has been for almost 2 years now. \r\n\r\nI think there are two areas I am going wrong with him:\r\n- His build\r\n- His clear\r\n\r\nNow, I know Zac has a pretty easy clear where you don&#039;t even need to pop a refillable pot charge, especially if you take the scuttles. I think the problem lies with where I start and his optimized clear. You see, I have a habit of almost always starting bot side of the jungle, and this holds true for Zac. My reason for this is the fact you get a better leash with botlane, plus due to the shared exp arriving late doesn&#039;t put them at much of a disadvantage unless they&#039;re against a lv2 cheese champ like Leona. After red buff, I go to krugs which is where I think my mistake is. At lv2, krugs take a while to clear, so is this slowing me down and messing up how I level late game? Should I always start Blue instead?\r\n\r\nThe other problem I think I am having is my build. Unless the game demands otherwise, I usually go Cinderhulk &gt; Lucidity &gt; Spirit Visage &gt; Randuin&#039;s &gt; GA &gt; Warmog&#039;s. Full tank items with no damage. Is this bad? I find that while I am usually tanky enough to survive teamfights easily, by myself I deal no damage and rely upon my team, who may or may not be doing well and doing damage. How can I add flexibility to the build to mitigate the problems of a team that&#039;s behind. I know that there is an AP build with Runic Echoes &gt; Liandry&#039;s but usually I am the only tank on the team so it&#039;s not worth it.\r\n\r\nThanks guys for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-01T02:11:10.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally cant screw him up.

During your time in your loading screen, try to identify what lanes you want to gank early on. This is can come down to how much CC your side of the lane has, how many escapes the enemy has, if they are a champion that will push a lot and etc.\n\nOnce you have figured out what lane/s you want to gank, you can start figuring out a plan to gear your clear in a way that lets you gank that lane at a good timing to start the snowball for that lane in your team's favour. \n\n_E.G. If you want to gank top lane, start at the bottom side of the map so that your clear is timed so you will be able to gank top lane at either level 3 or 4 (depending on what type of clear you choose to go for)._\n\nThere are many different ways you can situationally adapt your clear to the current game, so experiment and see what works well for each situation.\n\n---\n\n**Next let me go over what you talked about with your builds.**\n\nI personally don't play Zac too much so I haven't personally experimented with his builds a lot, however I think that the build that you have mentioned works quite well in a large amount of situations. Some items that you might want to consider though are things such as **Sunfire Cape**. This would give you some extra damage in team fights from the AOE burn and still give you the tanky stats that you need to survive team fights.\n\nI would also recommend looking into **Locket of the Iron Salari**. Though this is still a defensive item, the active helps teams a ton in team fights letting them survive longer, and if you pop it before you jump into your team, helps out your backline a lot.\n\n---\n\n**Quick note about team fights.**\n\nNow you mentioned the main reason you want to change your build is because you feel like you need some extra damage in team fights if your team doesn't have it. Sometimes the best thing to do in this sort of situation is instead of building damage yourself, change the way you are playing.\n\nThis can be either through peeling for your backline more through use of your E or ult or coordinating with your mid and top laner to either get onto their backline and kill their squishy targets or set up a combo such as the well know Orianna ball on Zac.\n\n---\n\nHope this information helps! If there is anything I can elaborate on or any other questions I can answer let me know.
