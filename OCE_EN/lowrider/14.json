How do i prepare for climbing mentally? what are some strategies and mindsets I need?","replies":[{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2017-09-27T06:30:06.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute and reports is about all i think you can do game wise.\n\nFor yourself, something i work on here and there. Is to consider how you can fix it in game, experiment try new champs/lanes etc.\nI always am fearful of leaving lane and falling behind to assist another lane if they are getting ganked. Things like this just need to practice, get to know when and when not it would be worth taking the risk.\nThey do not call it elo hell for nothing, it will rip your brain and emotions apart. Just got to know your not the only person it happens to, almost everyone goes through it. \nWith toxic players, generally ill tell them to chill or calm down some. if they dont and keep raging just mute and do the best you can.\n\nIf a game is a total loss, i dont really like to surrender.  I feel you can learn alot when this happens compared to if you win the game, things like what items to buy to help you survive, should you go for objectives or should you farm... better practice for dodging skills also as 1 hit from a winning enemy will surely destroy you.\n\nDon't look at defeat as a loss, try to see what you can gain from it, what can you learn. look at a fed enemy team and how they move about the map, as a team or split pushing or what? do they still take objectives and if yes what is your team doing when they do? things like those examples and much more always give ability to learn for future games, so you know whats a good thing to do and when to do it!\n\nFor me this is how build better mentality when it comes to playing LoL, otherwise id prob lost my shit and murdered people by now hahaha","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-27T06:34:27.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow cheers man, really important points that I'll keep in mind next time :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-09-28T08:40:12.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't beat em, join em worked for me","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-28T10:15:16.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seems impractical, but genius :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-27T22:27:46.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just mute negative players and focus on your own gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-28T02:27:58.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i try to, but sometimes i feel like muting breaks all connections i have to communicate with the players which is somewhat important..","replies":[]}]}]}
