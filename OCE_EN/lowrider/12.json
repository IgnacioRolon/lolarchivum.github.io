Please Help","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, i play Legaue of Legends on a Mac, and since today, my legaue games won&#039;t start.. Champ select works fine as per usual, however once the league of legends &quot;game&quot; tab opens to display the loading screen, my macbook is frozen on a black screen. During this, i&#039;m unable to move my mouse or Command tab, to look at my other applications... Its literally just stuck. I&#039;ve tried waiting over 30 minutes for this black screen to dissapear but it never did. the only way to get rid of it was to manually power off my macbook and restart it. I&#039;ve tried playing on multiple accounts, to see if my account was bugged however it didnt work on either. Also, before you refer me to Riot&#039;s useless &quot;connection guide&quot;, I&#039;ve already tried and there is nothing usefull on there that can help me for my situation.. I also feel like my queue buster was unnecessary  as I didn&#039;t intentionally AFK, and i was really looking forward to playing.
