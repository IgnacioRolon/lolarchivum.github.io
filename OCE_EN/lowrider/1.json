Since then, I&#039;ve made it my goal to become a more chilled, enthusiastic player and strive for honor rewards, however ive only managed to make it to checkpoint 2 out of 3 for escaping. I&#039;ve been playing with a cool head in all situations however i just can&#039;t seem to get my honor 1 back. So i was wondering.. has anyone actually made it back to honor 2 after being demoted to honor 0??","replies":[]}
