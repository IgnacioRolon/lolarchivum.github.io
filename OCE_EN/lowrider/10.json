It would focus on actual individual skill instead of having to rely or carry other team mates, and most importantly, it would give players a more accurate and deserving rank.\r\nI understand how something like this would fail, (League being a team orientated game, or certain players; junglers and supports, may not have much experience/skill in lane) but it would be a pretty cool feature.\r\nFeel free to comment your opinions on this and vote whether or not you want this to happen in the poll below","replies":[]}
