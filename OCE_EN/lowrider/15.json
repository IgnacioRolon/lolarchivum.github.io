Enjoy your wins, learn from your losses. Some games are worth surrendering that arent surrendered,  but plenty of surrendered games are winnable with a little patience.\n\nJust dont be \"that guy\" and you might surprise yourself. I know I surprised myself when I changed my attitude.","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-28T09:15:03.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea I understand that attitude has some sort of impact on my performance, but how do i prepare for climbing..

I mean as in how many hours a day and what champs and positions i should use\n\nBasics would be lane / wave control (pushing waves exposes you to enemy ganks, letting them push exposes them to your ganks), last hit to maximise income, ward often to neuter attempts by enemy jg to gank, and prioritise objectives - ie is it worth more to push turret or go for cheeky dragon? If you wipe team should you smash 2 turrets or attempt baron? Learn your champs combos. And try non main champs out in norms / practice - particularly those you have trouble beating. If you know their kit, you know how to avoid them. oh and position for your role. If you are a tank you need to front line and CC the major threats. If you are a squishy you cant afford to die so where do you position yourself to maximise impact for team but minimise chance of dying?\n\nTo be honest there are a million people better able to explain strategy and tactics than me (am only silver 2). And plenty of resources exist so google is your friend here.\n\nBut I can speak from experience that my own attitude has a remarkable impact on my ability to tilt / climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-28T10:13:26.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i will use these techniques..
