Her kit revolves around teamwork for the most part, unless she becomes a massive fed threat and then can do work on her own. This in itself shows her strengths but not her overpowered amounts of it, only her teamwork aspects. Her damage is lacklustre without items, as a teamfight oriented champion this makes sense because there is little to no teamfighting during laning phase.  Therefore Damage = Balanced.\n\nHer kit is mana hungry, she can't spam you all day without running out of mana, she can't trade with you and shield herself all day without running out of mana, so she has to be careful during laning phase about use of spells. Spell kit = Balanced\n\nShe has no displacement mobility spells so she is reliant on positioning, that is why riot are allowed to give her more damage on her abilities, or her e may not have dealt damage to begin with, this is also why she is easy to kill if someone can get onto her. Mobility = Balanced.\n\nI think Orianna is a strong champion when the ball gets rolling and can only provide utility if it does not, which makes her extremely balanced opposed to an underfed Zed or split push type mage/caster mid lane champion.\n\nI think i covered the basics,\n(i have a tonne of competitive experience as mid and as Orianna in high Elo and in tournaments, this is just a first thought, Feel free to argue any point with me)","replies":[{"poster":"TempName004","date":"2014-11-19T06:52:39.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi friend, thankyou for your input.
