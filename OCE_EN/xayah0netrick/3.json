At Zealot Gaming, a community made for gamers, by gamers, we strive to provide a fun environment where members grow through experience in teamwork, skill, and networking. While many clans are really &quot;looking for group&quot; organizations, we want to stress that we are more than just a group of people who queue up together in games. While we understand that having people to queue with is a benefit, it should not be the only reason someone wants to join our great community. We are looking for dedicated and motivated gamers who want more out of their games than a simple match history. Are you someone that enjoys partaking in the bigger picture? Are you someone who has ideas to share? Do you prefer to know your teammates better, interacting both inside and outside of games? If so, then Zealot Gaming is right for you!\r\n\r\nMISSION STATEMENT\r\nThe mission of Zealot Gaming is to provide and continually develop a fun and friendly gaming atmosphere for its members through creating a strong community setup, engaging members through activities and events, and providing more avenues to game with like-minded gamers. We aim to encourage respectful behavior from all members toward each other and non-members alike, and instill the core values of loyalty, integrity, and zeal in all of our members.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, one of our goals is to create a fun environment for all of our members. Our VOIP server (TeamSpeak 3) coupled with the use of Skype(http://www.skype.com[2][2][2] ) and the message boards (http://www.zealotgaming.com/forum/forum.php[3][3][3] ) makes communication with your fellow members fast and easy. We host custom game nights for all of the games that we support, and also provide contests and tournaments, often with prizes. On top of that we have a simple and efficient leadership system which provides our members with plentiful resources and many opportunities to participate in leading the contributing to the community. But as we mentioned before, you will not really know any of this unless you are involved in the community. Being active on the forums and in the game will ensure that you get the most out of Zealot Gaming.\r\n\r\nGAME SUPPORT\r\nZealot Gaming currently supports the following titles:\r\nLeague of Legends: (NA)\r\nLeague of Legends: (EUW)\r\nLeague of Legends: (EUNE)\r\nLeague of Legends: (OCE)\r\n\r\nWe are also currently expanding into new games and hope to grow as long as our community is interested!\r\n\r\nCOMPETITIVE SUPPORT\r\nZealot Gaming also supports competitive play. Members are encouraged to play with others and discover who they play best with and form their own teams. All teams are considered &quot;official teams&quot; to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to join a team or start their own.\r\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY / JOIN\r\nVisit our website at http://www.zealotgaming.com/index.php/join/[4][4][4] to join!

All of the players in our game told you including the two randoms that someone else out called you.\n\nYou entered the game and asked the enemy team to report all of us for being an abusive premade 4. You thought everyone was against you even though we didn't know each other. You were in the wrong and you acted immaturely during the situation. You trolled in that game asking to report everyone multiple times.\n\nYou keep claiming abuse but you never say what the abuse was.  You trolled and acted like a child, I added you and gave you a chance to explain and when you realised who I was you started saying \"stop abusing me\". When I couldn't have been more open or polite about the situation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Kokichi I","date":"2015-05-14T05:13:44.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate I joined them like a month or so ago and have not had anything like what you just said.
