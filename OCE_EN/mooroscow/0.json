You have to bring it back, I&#039;m legit getting 60 fps in lane phase which drops to about &lt;30 from midgame onwards. I have a gaming pc which can run any game at at least 60 fps. This is bullshit, I&#039;m sure everyone feels this way about the new client, it just makes your frames drop by about half of what they normally run at. So before you make the old client unavailable, fix this bullshit client first so it&#039;s fair. I just played a game where my fps went down to 1. I couldn&#039;t even move. SO FIX YOUR SHIT RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Trickster","date":"2017-04-12T03:36:13.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of those crap work Talon12, it helped very slightly but nothing like the legacy Client. \n\nAre these two client's running on different servers? thus different pings? Not sure why FPS changed even though video settings are set the same. Even putting on low spec mode and \"close client in game\" hasn't brought it back to legacy pace.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-12T06:41:54.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a shitty gaming laptop and yet I've been using the new client since alpha and I get 100+ fps, honestly everyone complaining needs to shut up and fix there own shit this isn't Riots fault the client is completely fine. Here's your options:\n\n1. Have you got low spec mode on? If not put it on and then enable close client during game if that still doesn't help.\n2. Get better hardware because yours is obviously terrible if my shitty gaming laptop can run better\n3. Find a different game because we are NOT getting the old client back under any circumstances","replies":[{"poster":"xXdimicXx","date":"2017-04-13T05:06:21.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK 1st of all the new client is AIDS(looks cool yeah) but its completely shit,\n2nd stop trolling every board about the client and ppls problems with it\nand 3rd & finial they should have kept both there's no reason at all to get rid of it and now everybody's gonna complain non stop til we get it back","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-13T06:38:17.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you actually read what Riot have said then you would know that they can't keep both clients because it's two much to handle and update two clients at the same time.

It helps a bit last time I checked.\n\nThough when I tried the new client the other day with low spec mode on, while in-game it seems imo fine, the load-in and load-out speed were still both abysmal. I had to wait like 20 seconds to get into the lobby, and 40 seconds to load the post-game chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-12T04:17:53.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe enabling low spec mode also enables \"close client while in game\" by default.

Once you turn off the eye-candy, the fps drop doesn't seem to be there anymore, at least no where as noticeable/severe as it used to be in my particular instance.\n\nBut that's just in my case, not sure if it's universal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sovereign Charm","date":"2017-04-12T11:20:31.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no FPS issues in game - My desktop has no graphics card (self built from cheap parts) It could run the legacy client fine, but the new one runs minimally in the client, no issues afterward though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-12T03:21:09.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"set in options for the client to close during games then","replies":[{"poster":"MOOROSCOW","date":"2017-04-12T04:15:37.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, I'll give it a go.","replies":[]}]}]}
