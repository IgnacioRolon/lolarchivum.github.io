I need some tips to know how to rank up because I get on a big winning streak but once I get to high LP I either get really bad teams or I play really bad and stupid. On the weekend I won 7 or 8 ranked games straight but on weekdays I find it difficult to win ranked matches. Does it have something to do with that or is it just coincidence. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-28T22:30:15.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be more focused and less stressed on weekends which allows you to play better and concentrate harder in the game so you're making more of the right decisions and less of the wrong ones. It could also be you just tend to get lucky a lot and then the system alters your teams/opponents to make sure you're at the right level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-28T17:42:45.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you just need to focus on generally getting better at the game not specific in playing your champion.\nBasically, practice a couple of champions to a point where you're that great that you only need to focus on everything else other than playing that champion, like map pings, awareness, ward placement and getting objectives. \nTheoretically, you can win a match by getting no kills. Just aim to crush the Nexus.\n\nEdit: Also Freelo Champs {{champion:55}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:92}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"974 RP","date":"2015-04-28T15:17:20.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Winning more games on weekends as opposed to weekdays is probably because of children having the weekend off school so there's a higher influx of sub-par kiddies that flood ranked.\n\nHowever during weekdays you're playing with people that don;t have a 9 o'clock bedtime.\n\nI dunno, just throwing ideas out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paine","date":"2015-04-28T15:11:22.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happens alot in bronze it happend to me as well won 15 straight then just had the worst luck over the next 4 days and went promos b1 all hte way to 5 0 points","replies":[]}]}
