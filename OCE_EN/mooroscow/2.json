I then get promoted back up to that rank pretty much straight after and then I go up to the next rank after a week or so. So eg (s3&gt;s2&lt;s3&gt;s2&gt;s1). Does this happen to anyone else or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"Twynko","date":"2015-09-05T00:22:47.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i went bronze 3-challenger-diamond 5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Manufa","date":"2015-09-04T23:43:34.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i went from b1 to b2 to b3 to b4 to b5 to b4 to b5 to b4 to b3 to b2 to b3 to b2 to b3 to b2 to b1 to s5 to s4 to s5 to  s4 to s3 to s2 to s1 to s2 to s3 to s4 to s3 to s2 to s1 to s2 to s3 to s4 to b1","replies":[]}]}
