Yes, I get raged at a fair bit, but at least I can understand this, annoyance over someone of your level doing poorly..Now on to my main point. \r\n\r\nI asked a few friends to try the game, some got to level 20 some not even level 5, all of them had one major problem that I saw when I watched them play too. \r\nSmurfs of all skill levels playing in low levels, this is anywhere from 5-20 and raging at their low level team mates for being new. This isn&#039;t telling them what to do, and my friends for the most part had been polite through the game, none of them raged from what I saw, but almost every game they were in, either to them or other people, these self proclaimed smurfs would often get angry at people for the simple fact of them being bad, ie new to the game. \r\n\r\nIt just doesn&#039;t make sense to me. How can you even get mad at people for being bad at something they&#039;ve barely played, if you&#039;re a smurf of any level? It&#039;s a huge problem that I see all the time. I have no problem with smurfing, it&#039;s a good way to play with friends, but the games just seem to be full of smurfs, largely very rude ones. End rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-22T08:13:11.585+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can relate to this.\n\nI've been playing since late last year and what your saying is 100% correct, i started playing with a group of friends and at the start it was quite good, we kept to ourselves and had absolutely no idea how to play the game at all, i mean one of my mates used to buy **TWO PAIRS OF BOOTS** because he genuinely believed it made him move faster!\n\nthen after about lvl10 it started to get worse... and worse... ANNND worse. after that we gave up SR and played ARAM instead which was alot better and more fun.\nthe sad thing is, this doesn't change for most of peoples games, even when you get to lvl30 and start to play ranked it still happens.\n\nbronze/silver is plagued with smurfs who rage and enjoy making the game unpleasant, it seems to be **cool/trendy** to have a low elo smurf and just insult people in the very elo they most likely started in themselves.\n\n\nMost of my mates who i started with in the game have given up, which is sad. :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-23T00:06:48.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLOT TWIST: YOU CAN'T READ ANY OF THEIR TEXT IN SPECTATOR MODE.\nWell there's no reason for smurfs to get mad unless the new players are being fckwits and rejecting any valuable advice.
