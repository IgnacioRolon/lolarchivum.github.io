I&acute;m pretty active.\r\n\r\nRoles: Any... I&acute;ve played pretty much all of the champions and roles. I&acute;ve been around for 5 years. (Prefer mid though)\r\n\r\nPreferred champions: Anything with skillshots. I used to play a lot of Nidalee season 1,2,3 and I also like playing a lot of Lux, Brand, Ahri etc...\r\nHighest rank: Season 3 I got to plat 2 on EUNE before flying to Australia, after which I worked for most of the time and didn&acute;t have time to play much + the Aussie internet is so frustrating. I got a steady wifi now and even if someone is hogging it I&acute;ll just use my data on my phone.\r\n\r\nI play on my 5 year old laptop which keeps the game steady if I keep my laptops ass up so it can breathe.\r\n\r\nIf you&acute;re interested just Add me in game: Kattron","replies":[]}
