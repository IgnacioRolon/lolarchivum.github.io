Might sound a bit rough to start with but we&#039;ll iron out the kinks.\n\n\nA Fallacy.\n>Once I had a Dream, which was not at all like a dream.\nThe bright of the sun was all but extinguished,\nThe light, nebulous and fading.\n\n\n>The stars wandered in the eternity of space\nas the icy Earth trembled.\nBlind in the stagnant air. \n\n\n>The world was a void,\nthe rivers, lakes and oceans stood still.\nEven in their silent depths. Emptiness.\n\n\n>The dawn came and went, but brought no day\nand men forgot their passions in their dread.\nDesolation found a home in their hearts.\n\n>At first, the forests were set alight,\nbut minute by minute, hour by hour,\nthe blaze was drowned. All became black.\n\n\n>The thrones and the palaces of all the kings.\nThe houses, once a shelter for all things which dwelt within,\nFuel to light the darkness.\n\n\n>And as the men gathered around their blazing homes,\nThey gazed upon the faces of their friends in the despairing light.\nNever steady, wavering uncertainly.\n\n\n>The men wore an unearthly silhouette upon their shoulders\nThe darkness fell upon them, some did rest their chins\nupon their hands and smiled. Welcoming it.\n\n\n>Others covered their eyes and wept, but most\ncontinued to feed their funeral pyres \nand looked up at the dull sky filled with dysphoria.\n\n\n>The birds' shrieks echoed a past world;\nand terrified, they did their flight on the ground.\nTheir broken wings quivered.\n\n\n>The wildest brutes of the night,\nWolves, hyenas, cats came tame and trembling.\nAnd in the gloom of the firelight, they were slaughtered without fair fight.\n\n\n>The meagre were devoured by the meagre,\nand the misery of famine fed upon the men.\nEven the loyal hounds had beset their masters.\n\n\n>The crowd met beside the dying embers of the altar-place,\nand with their feeble breath and cold, skeleton hands\nBlew life, and made a flame.\n\n\n>They hoisted their flame over their heads, but this was but a mockery.\nAs their eyes grew paler, and beheld each others' aspects\nThey saw, and shrieked and died.\n\n\n>Their Famine had written the fiend,\nHe hovered, haunting, on the edge of their perception\n\"People are flames to be blotted out\"\n\n>Drip drop, the sound of blood.\nRent in twos and threes the men swam in terror\nIn pain, but never dying.\n\n>The light from the torch fading,\nNocturne chuckled.\n\"Are you afraid of the darkness?\"\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-14T09:27:19.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" but bought no day\" --> but **brought** no day\"\n\"bird's shrieks\" --> **birds'** shrieks (assuming u are talking about multiple birds)\n\nif you plan on submitting this for the competition you will need to link it more strongly to nocturne, as it could be talking about just about anything nightmarish right now. Also it needs to link to a nocturne **skin**\n\n\"I had a Dream, which was not at all like a dream.\" --> This line sounds odd and I just feel like saying 'please get yo story straight is it a dream or aint it?' If this is the intended affect, I apologize.\n\n\"Rayless and Fading.\" \"never steady, flickering uncertainly.\" --> I really like the way you used these lines to end their respective stanzas and I think it would be really cool if all the stanzas had an ending line relating to light.","replies":[{"poster":"Sutorgar","date":"2017-03-15T09:06:02.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zvckk,\nThanks for getting back. I'll be writing some more tonight. I agree with your changes, grammatical errors. Tah :D\n\nYeah I'll be linking it to either the Frozen Terror, haunting nocturne , the void nocturne skin. I'm not too sure, but there's more to be written :).\n\nAs far as the starting line, I was doing some research into conventions used by famous 18th century poets. They seemed to use this effect in quite a few of their lines. If it isn't read literally, i hope for it to read something like  \"It feels like a dreamland, but I'm awake\" or a waking nightmare if you like, trapped with all the other victims of Nocturne. \n\nYeah I have to sort out a few of my stanzas, I will upload some more tonight!\n\nThanks for your time and feedback.","replies":[]}]}]}
