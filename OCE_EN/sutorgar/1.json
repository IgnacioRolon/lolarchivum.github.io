This was inting at its finest.\r\n\r\nHe was very clearly boosting a member of the other team to gold for the end of season rewards. I believe it to be gragas due to the nature of his player movements within the game it was obvious he was playing on two screens simultaneously. \r\n\r\nIs there any way of condoning this behaviour? as it ruins the climb and experience for others. \r\n\r\nCan see the end of the game results here. I understand that without video proof there isn&#039;t much you can do. But blatant cheating is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nStoky.","replies":[]}
