The main LoL reddit clearly says this is not allowed unless the player is a professional and strong evidence is present. While I understand this is a horrible idea, it would create some awareness. If a rioter saw the evidence and concluded the player who escaped the report system was ban worthy, wouldn&#039;t this be a potential solution?\r\n\r\nCould also provide people with well needed satisfaction until tribunal comes out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-07T13:24:55.933+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n\n>Reporting Other Players\n\n>Please don't name names. If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\n>Moderators will be looking for the following:\n\n\n\n>* Posts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\n\n>* Posts accusing others of malicious activity\n\n>* Posts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\n\n>* Posts accusing others of trolling in the boards (there’s a report button for that)\n\nThe primary reason for this rule is to prevent wicth-hunting of players. When it comes to innocent players (who are perceived to be negative or falsely accused for revenge/abuse etc etc.) the logic is rather obvious, however much of the confusion seems to arise when it comes to those posts that prove x player has demonstrated negative behaviour.\n\nIn the case of those players being reported (named and shamed) that HAVE demonstrated a negative behaviour, the reason for the rule changes a bit. As far as the behaviour itself, discussing it is encouraged, as it gives community insight into what or why x isn’t allowed but witch hunting still has no place. In cases like these naming and shaming only serves to create more negative behaviour (and doesn't encourage reform in the negative players), which is hardly a favourable outcome.  It isn’t the place for “but they deserve it”, just as “they started it” is not a valid defense of negative behaviour in game or on boards.\n\n___\nThe other reason is that reporting players on boards has no effect on the player reported, as boards is not a valid report avenue. We do not want to set a precedent for people new to boards, to see people reporting players and assume that those players will face punishments as a result of a post, because it just isn’t so.\n\nThe best report avenue is still the end game reporting feature, and it is the only means of reporting that will leave a mark against a player's account. While you can report through support tickets (if for example someone dodged in champion select), while the behaviour will be manually reviewed, if it is not a case where a player would be immediately punished then it does not serve as report history for that behaviour on that account, and thus should be reserved for severe behaviours that could not be reported in post game for whatever reason. \n\nThat said, if someone is being racist in select, they probably exhibit that behaviour (or similar) in their games as well, so really, avoid reporting through tickets unless you feel it is absolutely necessary.\n\n___\n\n**tl;dr is that reporting on boards accomplishes nothing, and support tickets are only a good idea in rare/extreme circumstances. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement in the feedback/transparency department on Riot's part. **\n\n**Personally I would love to see things like punishment/reward stats (what percentage of accounts make it to perma bans, how many hextech chests were opened this year etc etc), and definitely there needs to be more feedback for those that report and report well. For now though, the best we can do is learn how the systems work and trust Riot to get the job done to the best of their ability.**","replies":[{"poster":"Nathaniel","date":"2017-03-08T02:56:37.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, really appreciated the effort put into the post.
