I am generally a decent Lux and main support and have been climbing to plat by trying other roles and am currently at G2. I was vsing an Azir in mid lane, doing fineand all until my LeeSin jungle came to gank and failed the gank because of a binding I missed. I missed a few more bindings in an important dragon fight until my LeeSin went on tilt. I got flamed for 2 minutes straight (not even an exaggeration) about missing my binds. I tried explaining to him I was having a rough start and he probably assumed somehow that I was acting all high and mighty and that I was making excuses for my terrible game play. I had to mute him as he just kept going on and on about it. After I did that I started turning the game around with the team. I continued on, ignoring the salty Leesin and landed some really nice skillshots  which lead us to taking dragon and two mid towers without lee who was always just doing his own thing now (never in team fights, not ganking, avoiding the team, *split pushing and jungling to keep his KD and CS looking pretty*). This was a big turn around for our team but no, this person continued to flame me even though I had muted them and I knew this because our team mates were trying to convince them the same thing that I did. That no-one can come into ranked and have a PERFECT WIN and that if they pulled themself together we could make that win come to light. \n\n\nStill, as the typical ignorant-flaming-childish--unreasonable-toxic-fuckwit that this person was that you get it ranked sometimes, they did not back down on their word and kept to their ego. The thing that stunned me and left me with an appreciation for the community rather than having that sinking feeling after losing a ranked game because of an immature individual was the maturity of all my team mates AND even the opposing team who all had the same state of mind about this particular individual and scenario. Even the other team mates asked what was going on with LeeSin and why they were never in team fights. Still our team kept on trying to persuade our LeeSin to help us out and we kept on playing the game like we still had a chance. My utmost respect goes to the Tristana on my team who was carrying so hard despite the 4v5 while simultaneously attempting to convince LeeSin to resume normal gameplay in such a trying time.\n\nIt wasn't enough though and in the end we lost the game. Post game-screen every single player on both teams had reported LeeSin while I was STILL getting flamed. This LeeSin even tried to add me TWICE to my friends list in which I had to manually block them. A little upset and frustrated I just stared at my screen for a few minutes contemplating why I had bothered trying to climb to platinum and why I had come back to this rollercoaster of feelings after a long break. \n\nThat was until: [IMG]http://i64.tinypic.com/2a6a45l.png[/IMG] had happened. I had NEVER seen this message come up before in my entire time of playing this game and was so... at ease. Justice had been dealt. I had finally left a toxic game with a sense of justice. I was for once HAPPY walking away from a lost game knowing that the game the future of this game is heading in the right direction. To top it all off the opposing teams adc added me and we had a little celebration chat to each other about how it all worked out because they got the same message.\n\nI would like to mention my fellow team mates in honor of their efforts and sportsmanship:\nUnstoppable False: Our Alistar support\nTheGIGANTICMan: Our top lane singed who did great against an OP Fiora\nand our main man adc sexycutiepie Tristana.\n\nand I&#039;d also like to thank and mention the opposing team for being mature and responding the correct way to such a dilemma.\nTheLegendary\nKENTSOUL\nPoopStains\nHiMyNameIsRyath\nand PD Shawn.\n\nI will however not mention the LeeSins IGN, that&#039;s up to you to find if you&#039;re really into hating haters, hater.\n\nSo what do you think? Is the community behaviour improving by becoming more mature and positively rubbing off on each other? Is it the fact that the reports are being recognised now? Is it a combination of both? Let me know what you think.\n\nP.S. \n\nI gave up on my dash to platinum. lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-09T23:16:17.368+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! I'm a huge believer on the positivity rubbing off on each other. I rarely report people only if absolutely necessary and I got that pop up 3 days ago from a report and it feels so satisfying!

Currently our notifications system only notifies you if your report was the last report before a player is punished. We are continually working on our player behaviour systems and improving them as we go.
