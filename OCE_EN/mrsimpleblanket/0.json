Every FUCKING game I have to restart my LoL because after every fucking game when my scores are being shown there&#039;s a black screen. All my messages take 30 seconds to said most of the time and sometimes every button on the actual client is lagging. Sure, it looks cooler and futuristic and stuff but they even fucking removed item sets! Fucking Item sets, everyone loves them and there was no reason to remove it so why? Call me an idiot but it also frustrates me to not know the leagues of ranked games in order like in the last client. Insult me all you want but I&#039;m not reverting back to my old client to show that Riot just can&#039;t fucking control their people like this. \r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarfGoo","date":"2016-11-13T10:43:08.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's currently in Open beta =D\n\nSo you don't have to be in it. They are currently working on optimization and getting up all features. On most high end computers it should be working fine, and Riot are working on getting optimizations in so it works just as well if not better than old client.\n\nIn the mean time jumping into open beta can help them stress test and you get to enjoy new visuals and replays. If you aren't enjoying it or if your computer isn't able to handle the client in its current state yet, I would recommend going back to the old client for now.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSimpleBlanket","date":"2016-11-14T04:51:50.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your comment but I'm actually running an intel i7 6700k, Geforce GTX 970 with good internet so I don't think it's my pc or anything","replies":[{"poster":"DwarfGoo","date":"2016-11-14T07:25:42.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh interesting. maybe send it in to player support. sounds like an outlier =D.
