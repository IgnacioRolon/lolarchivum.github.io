I main sip actually but can easily play any role. I will take jungle or top probably top. I am keen to join a team as solo queue is irritating when you play well but still lose because of your team. Don't worry I am probably one of the most friendly players you might meet, I'm always encouraging and anti-toxic. I am mainly a team player and I feel I can bring even more team player-ness to the team with my support role attitude.
