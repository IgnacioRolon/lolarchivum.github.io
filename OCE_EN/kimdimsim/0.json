I dunno why they made it so hard to drop tiers. All it does is inflate how many players are in div5 of every tier.","replies":[{"poster":"Metharius","date":"2016-10-10T19:05:00.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and promote Powerleveling ... the number of gold5 who are less skilled than silvers is really impressive","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"lemonlord","date":"2016-10-18T05:23:55.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG I JUST WENT FROM GOLD 5 TO SILVER 1  10 MINUTES AGO NOW IM FREAKING THE FUUU OUT BECOS SEASON IS ENDING SOON NOOOO MY GOLD REWARDS WILL BE GONE :( SCREW MY 15 GAME LOSS STREAK IM SO SCARED RIGHT NOW{{item:3632}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ferociter","date":"2016-10-22T20:41:07.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not just go for normal since the season almost end......also I thought there'll be a warning, did u just ignore it:S?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-06-23T14:22:12.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 1 > silver 5\nSilver 1 > gold 5\nEct ect.\n\nIt's funny actually.  I find it very easy to climb after mid teir. And it gets super hard again after you get to the bottom of the next teir.\n\nOn the flip side it can be very demoralising jumping up to silver 5 and being matched with newbies and people who have not managed to drop after lucky placements.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-18T06:49:51.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> On the flip side it can be very demoralising jumping up to silver 5 and being matched with newbies and people who have not managed to drop after lucky placements.\n\nReally?

However if you have high silvers and golds then you probably dont need to worry that much.","replies":[]}]}
