Like seriously. A decent team can manage a 3/0 Riven. Even if she has her core Hydra and Brut already. It's not like she's broken unless your team, you included keep making mistakes. That said.

These champs had really good battles in the top lane, they didn't just bring TP and farm for 20 minutes, before you got Darius and Jayce fighting each other in top lane just brawling it out, now you get Lissandra and Gnar who sit in lane and do nothing for the first half of the game but farm and then when they roam they just press R, the game is so stale now.\n\nI miss the good old days.","replies":[]}]}
