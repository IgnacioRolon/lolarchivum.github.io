Nothing related to runes can be seen and the only action that can be taken is clicking the close button.  In the last 4 days this has happened ~8 times and reinstalling/repairing does not fix the issue (I have repaired 3 times already). When in champion selection other players have also posted in the chat that their rune pages also won't show up - I don't think this is an isolated issues. This has only ever occurred in ARAM.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the summary of the rune pages shown when hovering each individual page, does not show what the rune page actually contains (e.g. summary says Aftershock but when I get in game I have Grasp of the Undying).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-03T05:05:06.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a known issue with the pre-season client. There is a reason they do all the big changes in pre-season, and this is one of the unfortunate side-effects.\n\nSome people have reported that a client repair and/or re-install has resolved this particular issue, so that's what I would recommend in your case.
