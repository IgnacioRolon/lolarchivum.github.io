Who has 2 hard cc, poke/heal, shield for self and shield for ally + a really good escape. Unfortunately, this meant rakan would do absolutely no damage with his abilities, otherwise, xayah rakan combo would be played every game or banned. However, he can build ad and do ok by far, but it's like building adc with a mage. You don't scale. So, unless they are giving him some scaling buff to make him more mage like, similar to sona, he won't be viable in any other position than supp. But I think that rakan could have another skill instead of his current q and make his passive current mini q's similar to how xayah shoots penetrating feathers after casting abilities. But that's just my idea. The combo is fine for now and i'm happy with how strong he is as support.","replies":[{"poster":"Joshification","date":"2017-05-26T05:53:09.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe look at this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhAu1uRpIV8&t=49s\nthis worked rlly well!!!! +his abilities arent thhaaaaaaat bad xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-25T17:11:26.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen him played top with success, but obviously he is still reliant on ganks for pretty much any and all kill potential. He's not a champ I'd recommend playing anywhere but supp without a duo. As for mid, I'd say sure try it, but don't expect much. Tanks can still thrive in top lane but mid is a different story, and Rakan is a CC/mobility tank rather than flat resistances, not to mention a lot of his mobility requires a friend. \n\nPersonally, I think he'd be punished way too hard in mid to really do anything, but I'm also a big believer in play what you want as long as you aren't trolling (though I do think Ranked is much stricter in what should be considered trolling, i.e playing a champion for the first time or playing something you know is dumb just because you can and forcing it on your team). But in norms, all's fair, love me some Veigar support.","replies":[]}]}
