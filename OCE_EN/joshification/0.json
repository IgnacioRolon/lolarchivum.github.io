If you want to help your team out as a solo laner this is the best thing that you can do. In top lane you can take teleport and wait for a good time to TP down to bot lane for a gank to pick off some kills and start a snowball in your teams direction. In mid lane you can push out the wave and walk either top or mid lane to try and do the same thing by either getting a Summoner advantage by forcing the enemy laner to flash or best case, killing them.\n\nAnother fun thing that you can do while on the subject of roaming is that you can roam with your jungler. This can be coordinating an invade to possibly try to pick off the enemy jungler or place some wards down, or maybe a 4 man gank on bot or top lane\n---\n# Communication\n\nCommunication is a huge thing that you can do to help out your team and is quite effective if you do it correctly. There a lot of things that you can communicate including but not limited too:\n\n* Locations of wards\n* Summoner Spell Cooldowns of the enemy team\n* What objective you want your team to go for next\n* In champion select ask for preferred bans\n* Communicating to focus on MR or Armour in item builds depending on who is fed/enemy team comp\n* And much more.\n\nAlong with these points communication is a great way to keep the environment that you are in positive and friendly. Start a conversation in champion select for example by asking people how their day has been and get people talking so that they are more likely to communicate in game.\n---\n# Warding\n\nWarding is a massive thing in league of legends and it can be something that will help out your team a ton. Learning proper positioning of where to place your wards and buying control wards will help your team know where the enemy is and set yourself up for getting picks on the enemy team. However its not just your warding that can help with this.\n\nTry to communicate with your team where to focus your wards around depending on what objective you are going for next. Your team going to focus on getting Baron next for example? lets focus wards around that area in the jungle and in lane bushes nearby it. With this kind of set up and asking if your team can buy control wards to help you get objectives this will help out a ton.\n---\n# Offer to help other players\n\nThis might seem a bit odd given the high stress game mode that is ranked, however sometimes there will be players that get auto filled into roles they are not used to, learning new champions and other things that put them in situations where they aren't really sure what to do. In this kind of situation, if you have advice that you think will help them, offer to give them some advice. This will not only help them play better but will help the team as a whole, giving people the opportunity to chime in with advice and help a player get better.\n\nThe big thing to stress though is don't go around offering advice to everyone, try to look for tells that a player is not used a role such as them saying so in champion select and then ask if it is ok for you to offer advice. If you offer advice straight off the bat, a lot of players can take offence to it which can sometimes make the situation worse, so its better to stay on the safe side and ask. Plus it'll help them be more engaged in your answer that you give.\n---\n# Build and play around your team comp\n\nThis may seem a bit weird but for this piece of advice try to always think about your items in a situational way. Sometimes there might be a case that vs a certain team there might be an item that would be better to build rather than what you usually default to. An example would be if there is a lot AP on the enemy team or you are vs an AP champion, consider picking up a Hexdrinker early on to help you survive longer if you are a champion that benefits from it. Other things that count can be building a Locket on certain tanks to give your team as shield, or building Randuins to slow the enemy also helping out your team.\n\nAs for playing around your team comp, always consider what sort of team comp that you have and play to its strengths. For example you have a comp with a lot of AOE and CC? You will destroy team fights so you should try and force fights a lot. Your team more focused on poke? Try to wait a bit before you engage a fight to poke the enemy team down so that you have a HP advantage going into the fight. Try to communicate these advantages to your team early in the game and into the mid game so that you are playing your team comp the best that you can. \n---\n# Final Notes\n\nAll up I hope this helps and answers your question! If you have any other questions or there is any other way I can help let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Joshification","date":"2017-01-11T22:23:02.369+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow thank you for the such detailed reply!!! much appreciated Elam!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-13T09:08:10.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FARM FARM FARM FARM FARM.

That is, try to help safely, but if they're dead, get out. The enemy getting one kill is better than them getting two.\n- Use trinkets often, all of them are useful.\n- VISION! Support can place only 3 normal and one pink ward at a time, they need help to keep effective cover on the map. {{item:2055}} \n- Speaking of maps, buy it, learn it, know it, watch it, BE the map. No seriously, use that minimap, it's there for a reason, and if everyone is looking at the map, even tho you look at different times, you'll likely miss very little.\n- Help your teammates. Don't be afraid to blow extra cool downs (with a bit of quick but careful thought obviously) to help them get out - they have cool downs that can help you too. Even damage is helping, just don't get yourself caught in the process.\n- Just don't argue. You're going to be in bad moods, that's fine, it happens to everyone, but you're on the same team for just that one game, even if your teammates don't have half a brain hemisphere between them, if you burn them, you're burning yourself too. Just try to diffuse the argument, or mute people. Remind other people that they lose too if the person they're mad at on their team does. However you approach conflict, TRY to keep focused on the game as much as you can, just don't argue back, it never helps.\n- Some things are recommended for a reason. Don't try new builds and champions for funsies in ranked (test it in norms and ARAMS). That WILL piss people off, because you WILL throw games.\n**- PRACTICE @_@**\n\nSo much of this game really comes down to teamwork. If you're good, you're still going to struggle to carry the team alone. If you're not GREAT, working with your team can very much make up for not doing as well as the rest of them in other ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-12T06:11:32.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play Yas","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T05:54:26.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Joshification, my dear friend. \n\nIn order to climb the summit of one's ambitions, one must undergo an often painful but beautiful transformation.\n\nYou just need to become the most ruthless **** that has ever walked the rift.\n\nPick champs and items that allow you to butcher as many **** minions and noobs as possible, and use the blood money to buy even more toys of domination.\n\nBecause ultimately, you have to kill them about 30-40x to win.\n\nNOW GO!\n\nGive the weak reason to fear your name!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChriseyG","date":"2017-01-11T19:07:45.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are playing mechanicly hard champions that with your ranked stats are bad for you elo>fun","replies":[]}]}
