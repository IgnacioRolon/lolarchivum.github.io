This way, you can learn each others play styles, build long lasting friendships, have A+ communication and less toxicity. You even get bonus IP and mastery points.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-04T02:32:54.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"significant portion\" {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}]}]}
