The red indicator line kept following her even though she was stealthed so the enemy team could see where she was going. It was pretty hilarious. But it stopped when the minion wave started attacking it as normal. \r\nHas this ever happen to you?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-08T11:36:12.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw a game where an azir would spawn a turret whenever he clicked on the map\n\nhe had 26 kills and the game ended in 7 minutes","replies":[{"poster":"GalaKnight","date":"2015-07-08T22:49:24.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow must be hacking","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-07-08T12:17:40.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GalaKnight","date":"2015-07-08T22:52:26.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow nice to know not only me experiencing this bug","replies":[]}]}]}
