But in terms of \"meta\" junglers, ones built for jungling,\nYes, Reksai is a very strong jungler right now and is a good choice if you want to learn a jungler.\n\nIt also depends on the play style you like. Right now, most people are playing tanks so junglers like {{champion:113}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:111}}{{champion:106}}  are popular.\n\nYou want a strong fighter and ganker. Yes, Reksai is great. {{champion:5}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:254}} are also pretty good choices.\n\nPersonally I'd suggest trying to wait for champions to go on Free To Play so you can give them a try before you buy them","replies":[]},{"poster":"GalaKnight","date":"2015-05-22T11:18:52.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I left out a few such as fiddlesticks, nocturne, shyvana and like way more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrewd","date":"2015-05-23T08:06:41.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Xin Zhao, win now.
