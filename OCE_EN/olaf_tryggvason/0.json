The only one he didn&#039;t own was Shen ({{champion:98}}) . I of course asked why he didn&#039;t own him and he replied &quot;because he is shit&quot;, but naturally being stubborn i wanted to play that champion. Luckily he was on special and i had the free 400 RP. I went into a game with him and loved him. My friend was also amazed at how good i was at him.\r\n\r\nI went on to play him basically every single game top and jungle, loving every second of it. \r\n\r\nThen something horrible happened. A Shen rework? perish the thought. Before this rework i was having fun, it made me resort to playing my other main Taric which eventually got reworked as well. This has made my league experience much less enjoyable than it could have exponentially been. \r\n\r\nThis is going to sound abrupt and even absurd, but i just wish that Riot would deconstruct Shen and realise how much more fun he was at his old state.\r\n\r\nLeave your thoughts of my opinion, please.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-22T04:37:16.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen was indeed a fun champ, but he had this problem where his Q and W have almost nothing to do with E and R. W at least had interaction with his old passive, but Q was really kinda just... there, on their own, doing their own things. \n\nSo the entire point of his rework really was just to somehow integrate his Q with the rest of his kit, as well as being an attempt to fix his almost infinite splitpushing+dueling-power that upseted the solo queue quite a bit without harming his actual presence in terms of team-play. This was their goal for the rework as far as I know.\n\nThe result however, isn't exactly ideal, not really, not with the spirit blade thingy that feels more like an anchor than a ethereal ninja-tool/companion of some sort, as it drags itself across the map behind Shen, slowly and annoyingly, and like 5km behind the champion. It's just both physically awkward to watch and very un-intuitive to use practically.\n\nIMHO, it would have be hella better that the spirit blade mechanics is like this:\n\nEDITED VERSION: _Leave the current kit un-touched, but add another mechanic (essentially, make Q a double-cast ability) to Shen where he places down the spirit blade for a certain period of time after pressing Q, and it could be re-activated again to retrieve it and do the exact same effects as his current Q for the second cast. The spirit blade's existence would be on a different timer system than the CD of Shen's Q and it would be displayed visibly on top of the blade once it's summoned, during its existence, the blade could be retrieved indefinitely and combo with W as intended like current Shen until it expires when the timer runs out, which in that case it would need to be re-summoned again. The spirit blade itself has no cooldown timer after its timer runs out hence could be re-summoned as soon as it expires. When Shen is too far away from the spirit blade, it automatically depletes the timer and vanish, making Shen able to summon it again. Ultimate would bring along the spirit blade next to Shen's teleported location without it vanishing and the timer intact._\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2016-12-22T04:39:53.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like that would suit his kit better than just going back to the old Shen.

But considering the vast majority of people who didn't know the secret to obliterating with shen they found him boring and old, so riot updated him, personally I think they stuffed up on that front, he literally has lowest average kills in game, lowest average damage, lowest average gold (like seriously, what are supports) and an absolutely abysmal sustain rate compared to many champs considering it all, he also had the lowest tank stats out of most champs, you had assassins with higher armor, magic resist, health(1700... seriously what the hell) and base damages, which just should be the case, his recent buffs only just fixed a small portion of these issues. His damage is still abysmal though, takes about 2-4 actual fights with spells off cd to kill even a sona who stands there with their s key pressed, and everyone knows sona is super squishy. His waveclear is still crap without a tiamat or hydra, and still even then its kinda crappy unless he has a titanic with 3.5k hp+ and uses 3 hits + its active. \n\nThe old shen could turn fights with his damage reduction on his e and his great sustain, the new shen cant do jack shit unless he has every spell up and hits empowered q, which required him to land his e, so he went from sustained poke and sustain to an all in fighter who can't even fight, aka he cant survive a gank if his life (which it does) depended on it if he tries to trade with an enemy. He also needs his w full stop to fight ad carries, without it they burst him like they burst a sona, old shen had a 75% larger e hitbox 2, which reduced damage by 50% which allowed him to trade successfully with an adc instead of being melted on the spot if your team doesnt follow up. New shen also feels extremely sluggish if you miss your empowered q.\n\nTDLR; old shen could turn fights in his favour (even with only a single spell) due to his sustained kit, new shen can't do shit all if he misses even 1 spell cast.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-22T06:13:34.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Olaf Tryggvason,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=BgvUZlbo,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-22T04:17:48.375+0000)\n>\n> What about Kogmaw though?
