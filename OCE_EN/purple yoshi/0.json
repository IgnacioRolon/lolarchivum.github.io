How about rewarding most valuable players (MVP) per game on the losing team so they either:\n\n1. Able to get the same equivalent points as the winning team players do.\n2. Don't lose any points so they don't give up playing or feel sad for trying their best but not being able to pull through.\n\nNow, you may say but how do we accomplish this? How are we able to reward players without personally seeing their efforts or what system do we implement that is of value.\n\nHere's an idea, you could allow the winning team to vote (1) player on the losing team as (MVP) and that player is able to be rewarded for their efforts. I know you have tried by implementing the ribbon system, which to an extent has made players more excited for their contribution to the league but over a period of time this fades, being a ribbon it only distinguishes players apart from others and sometimes labeled the \"sheep of riot\".\n\nWarmly, Malia\n\nDiscuss?\n\n\n\n\nEdit (1): \n\nI agree with; that there should be a reward, although the possibility on the draw of the voting. Thank you for bringing this up!!\n\nCould we say, if people were to abuse the system and 1 vote was on each player example:\n\nLosing team:\n\nPlayer 1: 1 Votes\nPlayer 2: 1 Votes\nPlayer 3: 1 Votes\nPlayer 4 : 1 Votes\nPlayer 5: 1 Votes\n\nIn this case, no body is rewarded if players were to do this they would have to rethink the morality as the same would happen to them if they were caught on the losing team.\n\nCould we say, if 2 players each received 2 votes each player example:\n\nLosing team:\nPlayer 1: 0 Votes\nPlayer 2: 2 Votes\nPlayer 3: 1 Votes\nPlayer 4: 2 Votes\nPlayer 5: 0 Votes\n\nIn this case, the vote is re-drawn and the winning team has to then pick between players 2 and 4. Now with the ratio being 5 votes and every player has to vote once the odd number variable would conclude a player receiving a reward. (no LP loss) or (LP gain equivalent to winning team's per player LP gain. \n\nCould we share this, i think we're on to something guys,","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-18T08:24:27.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Love you Malia,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2aAWWZqO,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-16T14:03:27.848+0000)Don't you think the** #1 problem in the ranked system today is players  complaining about not being rewarded for trying very hard **throughout games?

This would be to prevent abuse of the system). The MVP player could receive 50 currency points. Upon reaching a particular number of currency points (maybe a converter in the store or something) the player is then able to convert x currency to x RP (at an exchange rate the Riot could control, probably something like 2 points=1 RP). This way, it would take consistent good behaviour from a player to actually reap rewards. Instead of being a toxic wasteland, ranked might become a nice-fest.\n\nOf course, this system would only be available in ranked because ranked seems to be more toxic than normals as well as being more competitive. \n\nPlayers in normals could just have a small ip incentive that works off the same 'end of game loser MVP voting' premise.","replies":[]}]}
