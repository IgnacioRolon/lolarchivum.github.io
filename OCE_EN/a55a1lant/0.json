Seeking talented players","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"PC419 are looking to expand our Gaming Division we are starting up, and plan on creating 8 eSports teams to represent PC419 and Australia. We are looking for passionate, driven players who love to play League of Legends and are looking to play as a competitive team. This only applies to players in Australia (OCE).\n\nPC419 will have various Sponsors backing the teams, and are attempting to enter the eSports scene on a major scale. We will be running custom games; testing skill and assessing how well you work as a team/solo, this will be done over the next couple of weeks. Feel free to join in on a bit of fun as well, as we will be hosting Custom Games for all groups!\n\nThe custom games will start as a ffa (free for all) meaning you can come in as a Solo/Team queue, or come in Solo and get Paired/Teamed with various other members. Based on where you rank or finish up on the night, there will be a tree system which will dictate where you finish up from there on. Points will be rewarded and the players with the highest point percentage at the end of the custom games over the weeks will be offered a position as a representative and competitive player for PC419 Gaming&#039;s eSports division.\n\nIf you feel that you could benefit from this, would like to make a potential career or are wanting to make an impact on the eSports scene, feel free to show your interest and shoot us an email with these details:\n\nName, Alias (Gamer tag) and a bit about your LoL Background\n\nWe will then be sending out an email or message to the players with the schedule and times for the Custom Games, and will keep in touch with you via your method of choice.\n\nPlease send all applications to info@pc419gaming.com\n\nIn the meantime, if you don&#039;t know who we are you can head to these pages and see exactly what PC419 do for the Australian Community. We hope to hear form you soon!\n\nYouTube:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/PC419TechTips\nFacebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/PC419TechTips/\nTwitch:\nhttps://go.twitch.tv/pc419\nPC419 Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/tYWrrfH","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-28T02:39:55.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> This only applies to players in Australia.\n\nWhy?
