Either way, I don&#039;t understand why I was banned for 2 weeks right before the season end (currently G2 21LP plat 5 MMR with 83 games played) for this one instance of negative behavior. I feel as though there is a lot worse that doesn&#039;t result in punishment. Is there a way for me to appeal this? I really wanted to get a plat border for next season. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nzipora","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-07T12:54:28.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The automated system doesn't punish gameplay offences without being very sure that an offence has actually been committed, that is why it can take intentional feeders and the like far longer to be punished than they should in some cases, so I suspect there is more to this story.\n\nIt is possible that the reform card wasn't generated properly, be this a result of it pulling the wrong game, or only one in series of games that it should have, or just failing to provide context on a more niche brand of gameplay offence, regardless, player support can offer you more context on why you were punished. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nFalse positives are *extremely* rare, but in the event that this is what has happened, support can help you with that too. A punishment will be removed if it was made in error (or reduced if it was escalated in error). Support is your best course of action here.","replies":[]}]}
