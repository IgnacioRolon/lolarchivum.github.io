If anything I feel like they bots are just getting their AI worked on. What would be a GREAT help is if the bots, ALL OF THEM, were removed entirely. I don&#039;t even want to play ARAM anymore due to the bots being an issue. I&#039;ve even noticed some bots are getting through classic matches as well. I understand we want to get into a match as fast as possible BUT filling it with bots is NOT the way to go.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \r\nI really hope this issue gets resolved... I used to have fun playing ARAM not its just annoying...\r\nRiot I hope you are doing what the community wants. Some people are starting to think you guys created those bots just to try and satisfy those who hate waiting to get into a match{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-10T01:14:51.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No at all. We do not create bots to fill the ARAM queue and permanently ban every single one immediately when we find them.\n\nI generally check for and ban bots every day (In OCE. There are NA Rioters working on bot detection in your region too), and we are constantly working to improve how effective we are at doing this. The situation is though, that bots generally have to play a few games before we can determine if they are indeed bots. So there is some impact regardless.\n\nI'm sorry that you've been having a crap time in ARAM recently and hope we can continue to do better by you.","replies":[{"poster":"xRageamok","date":"2015-11-10T01:57:12.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is there anything we can do while reporting to make it more clear that we saw them as a bot?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-10T02:11:40.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"In most cases our investigations are independent of the information given to us, so stuff like \"they all dive turrets all the time\" while obvious traits of bots when in game, are less useful for us when identifying large groups of bots as we aren't in the game watching them.\n\nI'd say you should use observations like that to be more confident yourself in your report to us, but don't worry about providing all the details as we will generally use a range of criteria to confirm the botting when seeing a report.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSparkle91","date":"2015-12-27T02:58:12.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a solution, either temporary or permanent.\nI've been dealing with these things for roughly a year now, and lets say every time I play an ARAM game I have to submit a ticket. I would be spending more time describing tickets that I would playing the freaking game!\nThe solution, to me, is simple: Change the reporting system in ARAM to reflect the system used in SR. All this means is that _when you report a player on SR they seem to be removed from your matchmaking pool._ This is not the case in ARAM and we are forced to either play a losing game or cop a leaverbuster punishment. I obviously don't know how script writing works, or if you can even combat an issue like this on such a level, but for the love of all that is holy - when I report the_ same account three times in three days,_ **TAKE THEM OUT OF MY MATCH MAKING POOL!** Reporting these accounts seems to count for nothing, so why the hell would I waste even more time submitting a ticket?\n\nI hope this get copy-pasted and plastered EVERYWHERE!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EPiKDJ","date":"2015-11-10T01:16:22.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Easiest way to tell is if they travel to the same destination and glitch out abit","replies":[]}]}]}
