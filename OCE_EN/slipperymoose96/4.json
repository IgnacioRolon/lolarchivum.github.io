If this is something that would interest you then pls let me know. I run on New Zealand hours and am online most evenings to play games and most of weekends. I will also consider adding some filler people for when others are offline. (please for the love of god no toxic people who get angry with losing. I want a safe environment) I will be back today to play at about 1:30pm NZ time (like 2 hours from this post) so add me and request to join","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-08-27T01:11:51.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Moose!!
