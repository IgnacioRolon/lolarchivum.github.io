When Riot is trying to encourage good sportsmanlike behavior and teamwork but they penalize losses with greater force than rewarding wins then its just creating more tension than is needed. Due to my own Stupidity I played my 10 promo games pretty much straight after I reached lv30 and I still managed to win 3 and place in Bronze III where I thought I would only rise in ranks as soon as my game experience grew, boy was I wrong and I quickly found myself in Bronze VI never to see Bronze III again. I have now won a considerable amount of Ranked games for only playing for like 3-4 months but yet I still find myself stuck in bronze VI (why?) well I personally believe its due to a few reasons. 1 is due to wins and losses being left up to way more than just personal skill as Riot seems to want to push Teamwork in our faces more and more (which I have no problem with btw) so even if you are a good player on ur own you dont always get consistent wins due to having 4 other team members who must also work together to insure victory. the second I think is due to losses being far too harsh, especially when I finally reached Bronze IV and was losing 22LP when I lost but only gaining like 17LP when I won so in the end I dropped back down and this has happened more than once. I pride myself as trying to be one of the least salty players in the Bronze Division and always make sure to congratulate the victory of the other team and wish them good luck when the game starts. I propose that Riot Rewards Teamwork and Victory more than they Discipline Defeat especially in Bronze and maybe even Silver. I know this might seem like it would make it ways easier to climb the ranks and that may be so but only for some people you would still need to win the promos but it would just make it easier to get to that point without having to have like a 5-6 win streak whenever you wanted to attempt to climb a rank. keep the ratio for the Higher ranks but at least allow those stuck at the bottom a chance to improve their situation by rewarding teamwork and victory. I think this would help improve the Bronze community just a little bit more by making losses seem less harsh but not getting rid of the desire to win completely. Take this as you will people because this does just come from a person who finds himself wondering if he deserves a better rank, and maybe that&#039;s not the case but it is harder to climb when you win 3 in a row only to lose 1 game and find yourself having to win another 2 or three just to get back to a similar position especially when some matches win/loss factor is entirely out of your control due to being on a team of 5 people that all need to work together to win","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-24T03:48:12.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have lost more games then you have won so  your mmr is probably really low right now but dont be disheartened your not alone in your struggle, it happened to me last season except i got placed in silver 4 when i was easily a bronze 4/5 skill level/mmr. at one point i was losing like 25 lp and gaining about 10.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2016-06-24T00:44:47.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you lose against people that are of bronze rank consistently then you deserve to be at the bottom simple, ill guarantee that any mid/high silver player would be likely to stom 60% of those games. Look at yr own play and try and improve. \n\nAdd me in game and i can help :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-06-23T22:55:57.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not all about winning 3 in a row and losing 1, it's over the entire season of ranked where your win loss becomes a factor in deciding your LP gains and losses. You're not a salty player and you have a great attitude so that's a good mindframe for ranked. \n\nI know what it's like to be in bronze and have low gains feel like just keep going backwards further with each loss. You just need to try and avoid that mentality as it will tilt you and effect how you play if you beleive it or not. All you can do is focus on your own gameplay and your decisions you make during the game and that will help you get the wins coming. Sure there are going to be games that you can't win and there will even be some games where it's outside your control but they will be minimal. \n\nIt's possible to climb out of bronze  and if you keep trying to improve your own gameplay you will slowly see the rewards for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2016-06-23T22:27:25.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't just automatically lose more than you gain, the amount you gain and lose is based on the other team as well as your mmr. If you think you should be a higher rank, play a pre-made with someone in silver, if you win you will gain more lp and lose less if you lose. I am silver 2 and vs'd a full team of bronze, 1 was bronze 4, I won and I earned 11lp but if I had lost I would have lost something around 25lp, they wouldn't have lost much cause they were vsing a team of 4 silvers. Not sure if this will help but it might help to play against higher elo","replies":[]}]}
