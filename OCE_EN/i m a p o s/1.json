More often than not, other players TURN on the player who refuses to give up their role, as they don&#039;t want a troll on their team nor do they want to lose the game. This is understandable, however (obviously) the problem isn&#039;t the player who didn&#039;t give up the role they were awarded, it was the player who threatened the team with a loss.\n\nAlong the same train of thought as my first question; why don&#039;t we have the means to bail from a game earlier than 15 mins with a minimal LP loss when it was clearly identified in champion select that at least one the players on your team were going to do everything in their power to lose?\n\nA possible solution I think would be to implement an &quot;initial impressions&quot; tool in champion select, where if for example, a player in champion select gave threats similar to the aforementioned, the rest of the team would tick a box next to their name. There could be a few boxes, such as &quot;Appears to be a troll/griefer/intentional feeder&quot; as well as more positive impressions such as &quot;is a team player/gave me the role I wanted&quot; etc. Then, in the troll instance, it would immediately give an alert to the player in game that they are on notice. Due to this notice, all other players will have the ability to vote a remake at any time before the 15 min mark, and the player who was on notice will be issued an instant ban and LP loss. To avoid possible abuse of this system (deciding to pick a player to be a &quot;troll&quot; so if they&#039;re losing they can get out without LP loss); the player issued the penalty can appeal and if they do, the game details both in champ select and during including chat etc. will be brought up and if it was found that the other players were lying, all involved would be issued a harsher penalty.\n\nOn the flipside, if players were marked as &quot;good sports/friendly etc&quot; on the initial impression in champ select and they won the game, they would gain slightly more LP than usual.\n\nI think this system in itself would encourage people to be nicer and friendlier players, and discourage toxic players as since people will have the direct power to do something about them.\n\nAlso, just as an example, here&#039;s a screenshot of a game I just dodged because of one of these toxic players.\n\nRito please ban.\n\nAfter the screenshot they continued to say &quot;it doesn&#039;t matter because I have 5 other accounts&quot;.\n\n//EDIT// the screenshot isn't working and I can't seem to find the option to paste it directly in... please help someone :)","replies":[]}
