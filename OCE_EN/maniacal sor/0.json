Been away from the game since roughly Gnar&#039;s release and I was wondering are there many tips to help get me up to speed for playing again. I played Top, Mid and Support and am keen to get back into the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-02-27T06:39:19.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow mate, thats been quite a long time.\n\nWell I don't know exactly what were the updates (by order) that occurred but I will do mah best\n\nChange in Jungle:\n - No sentinels that sits by blue/red buff, just only the buff itself.\n- Living plants grow over-time and activated by attacking: Blast-Cone- A small red plant that knocks you/enemy back. \n                                                                                         HoneyFruit: Grows around the river that gives hp/mana but slows you down if picked up\n                                                                                         Scryer’s Bloom: Gives vision and detects wards.\n- Extra bird in the raptor camp.\n\n\nChange in rune item:\n- Armour penetration has been replaced with lethality.\n\nYour usual nerf and buff champs- there has been so many. Sorry I can't give all.\n\nNew ultimate skin for lux.\n\nRank team has been removed and has been replaced by flex; flex is just your usual rank but can no longer play in 4man team. It has to be either solo, duo, three or five. Also soloq is now solo/quo if it has change or not.\n\nNew skins for: Blood moon Talon, Jhin, Twisted fate and diana. \nFestival Anivia. (recent)\n\nURF is happening right now 27/02/17.\n\nSupport item: Knights Vow: same thing as bond of stone by taking some damage given to your adc directed to you.\nRedemption: Heals your ally only/or damages a flat amount on enemy. (CAN BE USED EVEN IF YOUR/THEY'RE DEAD)just this tho.\n\nMastery:\nCourage of the Colossus- When attacked an enemy you gain bonus shield (that gives a scaling amount 3-54 depending on the amount of enemy you hit for 3seconds) (the CD will also depend on your level). Also it had been nerfed about 2 updates ago.\n\nChampion rework:\n\nWarwick has been reworked. You should check it on youtube.\n\nTaric got reworked (if you hadn't known about it)\n\nPool party skins for Fiora, taric and Miss Fortune.\n\nNerf:\n\nKog'Maw attack speed had been nerved quite a long time ago.\n\nNew items:\n\nVision ward now deny vision.\nMana pot has been removed\nEdge of Knight has been added once activated it works like banshee and gives AD/lethality.\nBlack Cleaver now has lethality (I think I have terrible memory)\nPoacher's dirk (kill the enemy buffs 3 times any of which can be blue/red to upgrade it automatically)\n\nTheres been more but I think this has been it.","replies":[{"poster":"Maniacal SoR","date":"2017-02-27T12:49:28.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow mate. Thanks for all that. Looks like I'll be sticking to ARAMs and basic summoners rift for a bit i think, just to get used to the game again. Hows the meta these days? Has it changed much from the old, adc/sup bot, jungler, tank top and caster mid?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-27T13:04:45.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The meta (in that sense) hasn't changed much, though you'll see AD mid laners like Talon/Yas/Zed a lot more, and top has shifted a lot more to bruisers than full tanks.\n\nIn general the meta tends to favour assassins right now, but there isn't any particular class of champ that outshines the others. Full tanks aren't seeing much play at the moment, and only a few of the tank supports are seen often. \n\nWith the lethality changes things seem to be favouring a counter play/pick kinda meta rather than a meat shield + damage type of meta, hence the drop in tanks (though that said, this is speaking purely from a low gold perspective, and it's still important to have a tank, it's just much more likely to see a damage-y tank like Gnar or Renekton than hyper tanks like Rammus, Shen or Mundo)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-02-27T06:49:50.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top = Tank Maokai or stupid lethality AD champions with the stupid new AD banshee's veil.\nMid = Ryze.\nSupport = Brand/Zyra.\n\nIt's stupidly boring right now. The things above are just too strong compared to everything else.\n\nI suggest you watch all of the assassin reworks as they work differently now. Important ones being Talon, Ryze, Leblanc and Katarina.","replies":[]}]}
