I really enjoy his new kit, which riot stated was aimed at reducing the impact of luck. One game changing luck based problem I have encountered a lot recently involves his ult bounces. If you ult bounces from one target to the next, and on its way the next target dies, the ultimate will dissappear. This can be game changing in team fights and 1v1s. It can render the power house team fighter that is brand very mediocre. It would be great if his ultimate would retarget or still bounce even if it&#039;s target dies, much like how it now works with zhonyas. \r\n\r\nWritten from phone.","replies":[]}
