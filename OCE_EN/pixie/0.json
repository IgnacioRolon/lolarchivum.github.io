I know that none of the wildcard regions are listed on the LoL eSports site, but why exactly is that?\n\nI only have limited experience to draw from here, but from my interactions with other community members it seems that most people who follow the OPL also follow one or more of the LCS, LPL and LCK. It would be awesome if we could stay up-to-date on all the leagues we follow without having to open multiple tabs.\n\nWould it even be possible to have a link somewhere on the LoL eSports site that redirects you to the OCE one?","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-01-10T23:52:34.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Pixie!\n\nGiven I'm an Oceanic Rioter I can only give you context on why we've decided to create our own site. I don't have a solid understanding of the central teams vision for their website :-) I agree with you though, it would be cool to have schedules from all leagues listed on lolesports.\n\nWe wanted to create our own website so that we can cater to the Oceanic region and build a website that it complements the league structure we've created. As esports evolves we'll likely see increasing differences in league structure (take BO2 vs BO3 as an example) and it's important the website is optimised to the league structure.\n\nI do agree though, there should be a link so it's easier to find oce.lolesports.com. I've thought about it in the past but you've put it in my brain again so I'm going to give it some thought. Thanks for bringing this up :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Timstan","date":"2016-01-16T09:19:40.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pixie","date":"2016-01-10T23:59:04.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries man, and thanks for the response!\n\nI figured it would have something to do with autonomy, and I think we as a region like that we're being catered to (since we're used to having little to no recognition of our identity in international spaces) so it's cool to hear that you guys very much had that in mind.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-11T07:24:13.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it'd be great if it there was a link on the main website. The reason I haven't been watching OPL much is because until now I didn't know there was a separate website for it and relied on the main LoL eSports site for information :')","replies":[]}]}
