It sounds like a placeholder that wasn't properly removed/replaced, rather than one for some upcoming icon.~~\n\n~~If Caitlyn has one of those chibi icons that were in the BE store it seems likely that's the icon it's *meant* to be. I don't think they're meant to be available though mystery icons (only through the BE store) so I'd say that's likely the cause of the issue.~~\n\nEDIT: Looks like you ended up with one of the as of yet unreleased \"Mystery Mini\" icons, so you may well be able to receive that icon from support once they're active. You may also just receive it automatically, I was under the impression it was one of the old ones :P. Pretty sure you're not meant to be able to get the new ones through regular random icons so good on ya :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
