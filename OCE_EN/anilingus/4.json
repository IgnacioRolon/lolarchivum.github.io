(this does not change when I toggle the option)\r\n-My FPS cap does not work at all. My frame rate remains uncapped no matter what I set my frame-rate cap to.\r\n-People can't use my account as a referee when I invite them to play, I've had a bunch of people try, and I've tried it myself, unless they click the link from an invitation, your system won't be able to find my account. I've tried my current account name and my original one. Neither work. It just says \"the account cannot be found\" or something to that meaning.

I know where they are stored. On a default OCE account they are in these locations:\n\n>Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.129\\deploy\\preferences\n\nNote that the folder \\0.0.1.129\\ changes every patch. The latest one has the highest number, usually. In this folder there is a text file named \"shared_[summoner name].properties\", where [summoner name] is your summoner name. Go into that, and there should be a line saying \"EnableChatFilter=\". 0 puts the filter off, 1 puts it on.\n\n>Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\game.cfg\n\nThis is a text document holding all your local preferences in (almost) readable format. If you are asked what application you should use to open it, use Notepad. Under the \"Performance\" section there is an option labelled \"FrameCapType\". 1 has the most frames, and 5 has the lowest (I think that 5 is 30fps, just to give an idea. The option should reflect in game.)\n\nGo into these things and see what settings they are currently on, and if they reflect the settings you've made in the client. If they are, then that means they are saving but not applying, which means you should repair your client. If they aren't, then try setting them correctly and see if that works.\n\nOf course, manually editing these pref files can become bothersome when you have to do it for things like item sets and whatnot, so get back to me if you aren't able to do things like that.\n\nAs for the whole referee business, it's still a bit glitchy here on OCE, as it's pretty new (introduced last patch I believe?) A support ticket should be able to clear that up nicely.\n\nHope this helps out!","replies":[]}]}
