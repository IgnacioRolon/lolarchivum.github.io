I was just thinking.. How about some more summoner icons for in-game achievements?\r\nMost icons we have now are obtained through buying them with RP or unlocking them in during holiday events.\r\nIt would be cool if a player could get a new icon for, say, getting a penta-kill in PvP, or soloing Bazza...

I'm just spit-balling here. I just feel like there's very little reward for people who don't have the real life money to spend on RP.

Like playing a champ X times to earn the champ or his/her spell icons or something.\n\nSo you can proudly show off \"Hey I'm XXX maine!!\" to your peers, and solve the issue of customisation. Sorta.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
