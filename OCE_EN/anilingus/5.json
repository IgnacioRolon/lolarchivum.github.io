I&#039;m just putting a thread here to express how annoying it is that there is no function in the shop or summoner profile that counts your skins and tells you how many you have and/or how much RP you&#039;ve spent for them over the years. There is only one program I know about that will count the skins, and it doesn&#039;t work for OCE server. I know there is a demand for this, it&#039;s been mentioned in loads of forums dating from years back.\r\n\r\nSo uh, Rito; plz giv us teh skin counter?\r\n_*insert puss-in-boots face*_","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-12-12T21:21:27.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it would be good. I'm interested in some sort of skin trading / swapping too. I reckon if you charge like 50 RP per transaction riot would still get a cut but it would allow a whole new dimension to the already booming skin trade.\n\nI would not necessarily create an auction house where RP can be traded, but rather where skins can be swapped and riot can charge a small amount for the transaction.\n\n50rp ~50 aussie cents - assume similar value globally. 27 million players, assume 20m active accounts, then assume 10m interested in skin trading (assumptions are fairly loose but its before 9am on a Sunday and I still feel delicate from our christmas party on friday). If every one of those people makes one trade, riot just got revenue of $5m. Guessing it would probably cost ~1m to develop the IT capability, regionalise it, and roll it out to all regions so thats a $4m gain.\n\nhttp://jonathanbyrne.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Easy-Money.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-12T20:35:15.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really want this to happen.\n\nbut i doubt it will ever happen because it has the potential to make people spend less money on skins,\n\nfor example you can say to yourself: \"Just 1 coffee a day is fine, its not too expensive\"\nbut then when someone tells you that you spend over $2000 a year on coffee you suddenly think \"oh shit, maybe ill only have 2 a week instead\"\n\nPart of what makes riot their money is the fact that you aren't actually sure just how much you are spending, which is why riot points aren't simply 10 for $10, its 1250 or something for $10, which helps hide the fact that it basically costs $10 for one 975 skin, and when you buy a $10 card one day, and a $50 later on, you look at your profile and you have 6369 (or something) RP which means nothing. But if it said $60 you would think, shit i just spent $60 on a game.\n\nand they fear that people will look at their skins list function and see that they have spend $300+ that year and they will think, 'shit I'm spending a lot more than i thought, i better cut back'","replies":[]}]}
