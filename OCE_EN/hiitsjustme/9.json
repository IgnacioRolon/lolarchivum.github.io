I'm sure you have someone to celebrate it with! If not there's always us here on the boards :)\n\nAnyway my preference for names is short and sweet, and similar to your name in real life but if you were in an anime. Thats sounds really confusing, doesn't it? xD. \n\nMy ign is Miicka, and my name irl is Michael, and they both kinda sound the same, but Miicka sounds like it was from some Japanese anime xD.\n\nAnyway, that's just my weird method of how I created my username, hope it helps and best of luck with renaming!","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-03T15:44:30.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer short names of things.\n\nHence Star. :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-08-03T10:58:16.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah hb man, but all the good names i thought of (minus this one) were taken, best of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-03T10:44:33.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing first.
