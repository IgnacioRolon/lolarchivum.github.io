Im interested in joining a ranked 5&#039;s team, i will play support if you need one but thats my least preferred role. Currently very active except when working, having the disconnect from pvp.net client issue at the moment but hopefully once that is resolved will be able to play efficiently. Just add me or comment on here if you want me in your team :)","replies":[{"poster":"Skyla","date":"2015-09-13T04:44:50.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support main here willing to join :D","replies":[]}]}
