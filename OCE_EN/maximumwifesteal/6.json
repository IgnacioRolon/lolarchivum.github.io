Some are quite possibly legit new players with no game sense rather than bots. As someone who has hit level 78, you obviously play a lot so a brand new player would likely seem very bot like to you since htey basically have no idea what's going on.\n\nNot that I'm doubting some of those players are bots, they clearly are, which brings us to the why. You were playing at 6 am, when the population is low, which means MMR is all over the place (ass evidenced by being matched with level 10~ accounts). Levelling bots are prevalent in the low MMR brackets and low population times of ARAM because it's the quickest way to get experience.\n\nBots are something that Riot (and Riot Gehirn in particular) are working actively on reducing, but it's one of those easier said than done type deals. It's super easy to create a new account, and real fast to level which means bots are a problem you can never completely eliminate, but certainly things could be better,\n\nObviously it's a higher priority issue if bots start reaching level 30, but that doesn't mean the ARAM and coop vs AI bots are being ignored, it's just where they collect so it will always be a bigger issue there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-12T21:02:54.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Bots are used to quickly level. People buy level 30 accounts, then spend RP to get a name change or skins or whatever. Buying RP gives Riot money.\n\nAll the bots are doing is making Riot a lot of money. Why should they care about the playerbase when they're rolling in a mountain of money?","replies":[]}]}
