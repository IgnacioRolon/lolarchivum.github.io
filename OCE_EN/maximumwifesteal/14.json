I think it would be nice to see these people punished, but not only punished, if banned, it should be on some kind of announcement in the client for everyone to see, so we knew tribunal (if it even exists) is actually doing something to try and fix the regular trolls and feeders.","replies":[{"poster":"BlasingNemo","date":"2016-06-28T12:13:54.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got an epic troll in RANKED that went for broke they got an s+ for trolling Lots of deaths lots of verbal abuse they were bragging to the other team free win while griefing our team pretending to go in and help then flashing out, legit bro was so confident that nothing will happen from this that after the game he told my team to suck a dick and brag lol doesn't do shit. Is he right do trolls get away with murder or are they banned he made it clear this was his smurf account so he did t give a toss If it gets a temporary ban but he was so confident in bragging absolutely nothing will happen and I for one would like to know what will happen would love a response this game was utterly ridiculous. Also not the only troll to brag that nothing happens to them some announcement about this type of epic behaviour would be great. ","replies":[]}]}
