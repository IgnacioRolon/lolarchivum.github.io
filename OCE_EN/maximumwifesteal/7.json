Upon attempting to restart my client started scanning files and is at 33% and up to 2000 files after about 10 minutes. I&#039;m most likely going to get stuck in low priority queues or possibly banned all because your client screwed up. This needs to be repaired.","replies":[{"poster":"ebbygoo","date":"2015-09-04T08:29:50.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having this exact same issue right now on my account too. Ebbygoo is my username.\nMy game was at 100% and everyone else was also on 100%, and it wouldn't go beyond that screen, so I quit and reopened league, and now its stuck at 33% with 483 files (at this moment) scanned.\n\nMy game would now have been over 5 min in, and Im likely to get reported for this from the other players.\nWhat is going on? Actually am pretty mad right now, what a waste of time. \nI came on here to see if I was the only one with this issue, but now that I know its not just me I better not get a ban/low priority from this lol.","replies":[{"poster":"ebbygoo","date":"2015-09-04T08:32:27.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game is now patching? WTF?\nIts actually patching? My patch was up to date, and its now patching? What is going on?\nI was supposed to be in game.. so how could I now be out of date on my patch?
