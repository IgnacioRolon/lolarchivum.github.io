However, all Legacy Skins above 520RP are available through Mystery Gifting, and they also have a chance of appearing through Hextech Crafting. These skins only appear in the champion's information tab if you own them.\n\n**Limited Edition skins** are skins that were temporarily available in the store during seasonal or special events then removed once the event was over. These skins cannot be mystery gifted and only appear in the champion's information tab if you own them. \n\nUnfortunately for you, the pax skins fall under the limited category. You can read more about which skins are in which category **[here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752944-Guide-to-Legacy-and-Limited-Skins#h2q1)**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-11T11:53:00.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not unobtainable :D \n\nAs far as I know, there is a chance to get skins that are not in the shop anymore (including PAX Sivir) through either mystery gifting from others, buying yourself a mystery skin or hextech crafting. The skin you get is completely random though, so the chances of getting a specific skin are very low.","replies":[]}]}
