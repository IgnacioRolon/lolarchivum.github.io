I play against golds and plats in norms and ranked. I was wondering, because I have a high MMR will the league placement scale better for me? For example, if I win 6 and lose 4 against plats, will I be placed into gold 4 rather than silver 4? This account has never ranked before. So first time.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-15T11:25:02.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals don't count for dogsht. Don't look at your normal opponents to guess your MMR.\n\nYes imo, its better to lose against higher ranked people then win against lower ranked people. Means you are getting put into higher level games. HOWEVER don't lose too many. I know new account that go 6-4 and get Bronze 2 and others that go 7-3 and get Silver 1. Really depends on who you play.\n\nYou can probably guess where you will placed in your 8th or 9th game. Whatever rank your teammates are, will be your division give or take 2 divisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-15T10:19:54.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will end up where ever it puts you man no one really know how the system really works but riot.
