I claimed he was probably just good at dodging. But until I saw him dodge my Q (was playing lee sin jungle) completely from fog of war is when I realised he WAS scripting. His moves were inhuman and could only be done using a script. I&#039;m not naming anyone here on boards but I&#039;d like to know where I should report him to. People like him deserves a permanent ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-12-18T04:32:08.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye lmao.A jinx today accused me of scripting as well.I dodged every single skillshot she and her support(morgana) threw at me.Oh well.","replies":[]}]}
