I main ADC and I DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS OUT. I&#039;ve been trying to climb desperately but I keep getting matched up with feeders, especially in my promotional series. I just had one yesterday and it annoyed the hell out of me. I&#039;m silver 3 right now (promos for silver 2)  and i swear I keep getting unranked players on my team. I had a riven on 80cs in 25 minute. What&#039;s even worse is that I get unranked players and I go up against gold 5s and 4s that destroy my other lanes. Silver 3 is the real elo hell.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-09T23:37:34.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo you're in the wrong mindset. Laugh at your mistakes and other peoples. Just laugh.. You can't win them all and you can't lose them all. Just learn bro. I started silver 3 like a month or 2 ago and I'm at silver 1... You can climb. Just change your mind set. Learn.. Get some coaching if you think you're ready to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"Happiest","date":"2015-10-10T00:57:15.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that I get unranked players on.my team and I vs all the gold players is unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-10T02:35:52.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really not.

Stop worrying about the games where your teammates are so heavily outclassed there is no way to carry. There will be just as many games where your teammates are so much better and you can't lose. The games you need to worry about carrying are the close ones, where YOU are what makes the difference between winning and losing. Even if these are only one in 5 or 10 games, you can easily get a 55-60% winrate if you carry all the close ones and you will climb pretty damn fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Happiest","date":"2015-10-10T00:32:50.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do u carry a mid later that doesn't even contribute into fights.
