I&#039;m gaining 16LP per win and losing around 18-20. I&#039;ve decided to duo queue with a friend which is in the same division as me. We perform  very good together and still on a 6 win hot streak. But after 6 wins, I don&#039;t see my MMR raise, I still get the same amount of LP it&#039;s annoying because I used to get around 24 per win. I&#039;m asking does duo winning streaks increase your MMR? Or do I have to go solo. Thanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-28T13:37:16.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo Queueing raises your team's MMR which means you get matched against people who have a higher MMR than you. As for how that affects your LP per win, I feel like that's only for Solo Queue MMR, but don't quote me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-28T13:18:59.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think solo is the best way but duo takes  longer","replies":[]}]}
