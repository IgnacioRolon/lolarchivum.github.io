If let&#039;s say season 5 resets at November 1st, I would not have much time to climb, so let&#039;s say I make it to silver 3 following the reset. Will I be placed back in bronze if I get a 5-5 provisionals in Season 6? If so which division of bronze?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-27T09:18:06.148+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly don't be worried about falling into bronze, if you earned silver you can do it again.\n\nAs for the reset, last years was really rather harsh, it's likely the same will happen this year but this isn't as bad a thing as you think, it's more determined by your first few provisionals.\n\nNot to mention the Pre season can also effect your ranking for next season.

That in combination that they want you to start lower so you have a reason to play, working all over again to get back were you left off. Also I hate Riots new leadership.

Like I said, it still depends on how you do in your provisionals.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"adair119","date":"2016-01-26T05:44:42.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze 1 last season and went 10-0 on placements and ended up at bronze 3 this season. i stayed away from ranked last season so i didnt really climb, but come on. 10-0 and still bronze 3? that's kinda crazy in my opinion","replies":[]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-01-22T21:24:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do remember that promo series are much more easier to win the second time round as well.
