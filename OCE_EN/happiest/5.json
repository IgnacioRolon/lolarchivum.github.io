Like I can&#039;t even get 70! I can get around 85cs in 10 minutes playing ADC but when it comes to mid lane ap champions like Leblanc I fail miserably. She has a very low base attack damage, 50+ I believe, which is why it&#039;s a lot harder. It&#039;s impossible for me to farm with this champion. Should I run a few AD runes? How do I make this easier. \r\n\r\nShe&#039;s pretty mana costly early game too. I usually rush morellos. So it&#039;s hard using abilities on cs and poking enemies at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-09T07:55:20.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond+ get roughly 100 cs in 10 minutes because 110 minions spawn within the first 10 minutes(this also includes the 6/7 minions spawning at the 10 minute mark.) and Master+ have been practicing farming for the last couple of years so the training has helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-08T23:34:00.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just continue to play her.

Rush a Morellonomicon and then you should be good to W > R the large saves and use your Q to last hit.\nAlso Q the siege minion, not worth losing due to her crap AA. You shouldn't be all inning until 6 anyway, Season 6 will ruin LB as she needs mana pots, lmfao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-08T12:06:49.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early on, you're going to want to use your mana to clear waves, as farm is more important unless you can get a good gank or your laner takes a derpy hit from a tower.\n\nYour W is the best at doing this, simply auto attack the minions until they're at about half health, then W to them. Last hit with your auto attacks, it's not hard. If I can get 60 cs with nothing but autos while being harassed by Zed at 7-8 minutes with Azir, you can get 100 in 10 minutes easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bombolz","date":"2015-11-08T11:06:19.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I grab the masteries which grant +2 damage against minions and +5% of AP as magic damage on basic attacks. Gives around bonus 3 damage to minions at level 1, it's not that hard, le blanc is one of the easier ones to last hit on, there are even harder champs to farm on basic attacks. Use your q to farm under the tower, and sometimes W which can be used to clear ranged minions. Hit each range minion once then use W on them (ofc this only works after your first back or at lvl 6 as long as you didn't back without additional AP).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vafrous","date":"2015-11-08T10:57:01.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Farm champs not creeps.
