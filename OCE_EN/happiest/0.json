I decided to try out jungle in a normal game and failed miserably. I don&#039;t know the techniques used in jungle like when to push for objectives (dragon), when to gank, what level to gank and how to gank. I&#039;m really not used to it. I usually go with Rengar jungle as he can burst champions when he&#039;s fed and most likely to carry games. I have to admit I do suck at jungling. I more than often fail a lot of my ganks and end up feeding 0/4. I&#039;m here to seek advice on how to carry the team as a jungler. Which champions best fits someone who&#039;s trying to reach Gold V? Sorry this is my first year of LoL .","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-10-18T21:11:49.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're new to jungling, I'd suggest staying away from champs like rengar. It might be tempting to play stuff that can kill half their team when fed but if you don't really know what you're doing in the early game you'll rarely get fed and you're going to end up losing your team more games than you carry. Try out champs that dont require snowballing as much to be useful until you're more confident in your jungling.\n\nAs for actual tips, the biggest thing I would say is try not to waste time. Don't try to force ganks that have hardly any chance of getting a kill and try to plan out where you're going in advance so you don't end up on one side of the map with nothing to farm and no gank opportunities. And try to gank for lanes that you think will win you the game, don't spend heaps of time trying to help someone thats feeding if they're probably still going to be feeding after you've ganked for them 3 times. You have a better chance of winning by getting one of your other teammates really fed instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-19T03:26:44.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"In my personal opinion\" it kinda depends on your team i guess if your team's lanes are struggling then ganking them often or even assisting them push might help, if your team is feeding then well theres not much you can do about that except get fed yourself. If your new to jg and don't know much about it try champions such as warwick or yi (although you may be hated for it) these 2 champs along with udyr were the 3 champions i played heaps when learning to jg, now i experiment with champs like Garen, Vayne, Gnar and Fiddlesticks. when your going for objectives like baron or dragon try and get your team to help you unless you're confident you can solo it without any problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-19T02:49:06.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Practice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-10-19T02:47:44.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play Vi.

Your early clear path is important as are your following paths - for example, start the bottom monsters later in the game so as you clear you are headed for top - if it is your intention to gank top.\n\nBuy sweeping lense on your first recall so you can clear brush of wards or lanes of wards to make ganking easier. (Its hard to go replace a ward when the jungler just cleared it as it could get you killed).\n\nTake a pink ward if you plan on doing dragon and often you can sneak over the back of the Dragon pit as blue side and take it without them knowing.\n\nTry to gank against their hyper carries (Veigar, Nasus, Vayne etc) more than other Champs or gank for them to get them snowballing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-10-18T23:15:16.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pray ad soraka juggle","replies":[]},{"poster":"JVlelodic","date":"2015-10-18T22:53:38.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uninstall the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-18T22:05:35.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bro, Pick the champs that are really good at jungling.

Listen up here's some advice.\n\nWatch timers. When your whole team is healthy and has some free time because they just pushed the enemy adc and supp under tower and you think you can get dragon before the enemy jungler can respond.. Do it.\n\nBasically practice man. I started out on classic champs like Vi, J4 and Xin. 3 pretty strong bruisers that I think are strong in the jungle because of their gapcloser which means a great tool to jump on the adc late game. \n\nThe best thing you can do is watch the pros. Watch a pro play vi jungle and note the jungle routes.. Learn the classic most stable build.. You will learn how versatile their kits are. Go full tank/fulldmg/halftank? You will learn when. Just start with the basics. Watch a vid, copy what they do. \n\nWatch the map. Where's their jungler? Is their lanes overextended? Is your team too weak to fight? Are you top and you just saw their lee sin gank bot? Go take his jungle because you know he won't be back for a while. Punish their decisions. Is their midlaner always trying to poke your midlaner? Set up a bait and go force a flash to give your midlaner some room.\n\nAnother thing. Take risks! Ifd you're playing a champ like vi: you're going to want to do a lot of dueling and ganking rather than farming like a yi. You will want to try counterjungle when you can etc. Nunu is better at countrer jungling so raid your enemies jungle constantly. Take risks man and you will learn the tricks. Just get a solid base of knowledge in norms before you go ranked. I'd recommend at least 50 games. \n\nI believe jungle is the best role to carry from in low elo. You control most shotcalls. The map is up to you. When you lose jungle it is almost a gg (incredibly variable ofc)","replies":[]}]}
