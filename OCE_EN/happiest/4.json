I played League with a few friends on occasion and was pretty much ignoring any strategy relating to League itself, I recently set myself a goal of hitting gold for this year.\n\nMy placement matches put me in silver 4 and i climbed from there, The win loss streak you are having a i had as well. Though it happened during my promos from silver 1 to gold 5. I went through this 4 times before i finally broke through.\n\nI found that it was a mixture of myself just having a sub par match and getting outplayed (it happens, don't let it get you down try to learn from it instead) and a few matches where the trolls came out to play.\n\nRegardless, the skill difference between these tiers pretty much doesn't exist. if you're on a losing streak, play an easier champ your comfortable. also don't re queue straight away, give it 10 minutes or so before you play the next match.\n\nOtherwise if you are really struggling it could be your game play has some flaws that are hurting your games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-09-29T06:35:03.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break. Just play normals, ARAM etc for a while.
