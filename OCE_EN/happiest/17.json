How does it work?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I&#039;m in my provisional for ranked 5s winning 2-2. We&#039;re up to our last game and I&#039;d like to know what&#039;s like after the provisional for ranked 5s. We&#039;re most likely going to end up in bronze and we&#039;re expecting to climb our way out. Is the ranking system in ranked 5s the same as solo queue? As in do we get around the same amount of LP per win (20-25)? Do you have to win 2 out of 3 games to rise a division and 3 out of 5 games to rise a league?\r\n\r\nThis is my first time being in a ranked team and I&#039;d like to know how it works thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-05T09:55:29.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The LP gain's/losses are higher overall because unlike solo queue you have to get everyone together at the same time, other then that it's exactly the same.","replies":[]}]}
