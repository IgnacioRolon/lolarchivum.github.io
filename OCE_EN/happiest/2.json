Season&#039;s ending soon, I&#039;m looking forward to be victorious but dumb players keep coming into my game and feeding lanes. It&#039;s so BS. I&#039;m on 1-2 right now so I HAVE to win my next 2. Please how do I do this. How many tries did it take u to reach gold V?","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-20T09:31:26.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"atleast you're able to get that far i practically gave up halfway on the promotional to Bronze V (Begin all the #noob or #gitgud comments now) only because my teams are utter garbage in they have no clue how the enemies champion is played and just assume almost all champions are squishy as hell like most adc's only to then complain and accuse the opponent of hacking when all the opponent did was build tank. I admit i may not be the best player in the world but i atleast know how to lane and survive (if my teammates don't screw me over by feeding my opponent) out of the 7 ranked games i've played i've won 1 which is kinda sad i know but its because people are being childish and feeding if so much as take 1 cs from their lane (its happened - mid was dead top was afk so i went to hold mid, my mid complains and whines that i killed a single minion and almost killed the enemy midlaner that he went and purposely died to the enemy top laner so much that we eventually ended up losing because the enemy team had a fed Pantheon running around Shreking everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-21T06:06:20.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn the game.

It doesn't mean going 20/0 at 20 minutes though it could be. But even landing let say an Ahri charm on their enemy carry and deleting him/her before the team fight can also be carrying. You may not be 17/0 but believe me little plays like that can more than often win you the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-20T12:09:20.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man I feel you.\nI recent;y did my gold games and man were they fucked.\n\nthe first two games were so much harder then what it needed to be.\nThe third we got fuckgin stomped and 20 min win for the last one.\n\nI believe in you, just be calm as you can be XD\nIf you fail, you can do it again.\n\nWhen you have time, dont do it now.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCEt27AsZusDqA5hp8hnF480-30FXRAi\n\nBut those were my god forsaken games.\n\nYou can do it!\nFOR SHURIMA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-10-20T23:31:56.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"last promotional series to trash 5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-20T20:24:00.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually takes me about 3 attempts from silver 1 to gold V =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sikuq","date":"2015-10-20T19:47:52.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It took me around 10 promo series to get to gold last season. during the first attempt I only played jungle, but by the time I got to gold I had gotten competent at 3 other roles. \n\nJust stay positive and don't waste energy worrying about the rest of your team, you can /mute all if you know you are prone to destractions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-20T13:07:34.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hi plz downvote my post lel\n\nCat picture attached\nhttp://imgur.com/r/cats/3DijqCW","replies":[]}]}
