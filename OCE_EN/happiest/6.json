The usual 1st item you want to build right now as an adc is something which gives you crit because the warlord's bloodlust is op right now. For {{champion:22}} i build infinity edge 1st item because im pretty sure her passive have synergy with the 50% extra crit damage. {{champion:42}} is still the triforce rush. {{champion:67}} {{champion:429}} is kinda weird right now because building an attack speed item like Shiv or Runaan's hurricane is probably better than going blade of ruined king because blade of ruined king is nerfed and again the op keystone mastery.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2015-11-17T23:46:50.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3087}} is really good on Vayne as a first buy now.

That said, if there are items that look like they match your masteries well those are good, for example Death's Dance is a cool new 65 AD item (same as IE) that gives you percentage heals so it or IE (depending on what else you build) would match well with the mastery that heals you on crits (though the mastery is being changed to only work on champs which I believe was always how it was intended, just be aware).\n\nOther things to look for would be items you enjoy playing with/feel effective with (you gotta experiment here) and items that match well with certain champs. For example the new Phantom Dancer goes really well with Vayne because PDs passive and Vayne's passive are basically the same, so you're capitalising on an inherent mechanic and making it stronger. OR you might think that because Vayne has that passive your gold is better spent elsewhere, say on Rapid Firecannon to give you those extra range autos while you are chasing.\n\nIf they have a tanky team you can stack Lord Dominiks and BotRK for the tank shred. \nIf you need AoE you can get Shiv or Runaan's.\nMercurial is also a good replacement for another life steal/heal-y item now if you need the active.\nIf they have a lot of heals/regen/life steal you can go with Mortal Reminder, especially strong because you get the Grievous Wounds on Executioner's so you don't have to finish Mortal Reminder to get the passive which gives you the chance to build something with a bit more damage or another passive/active you need first.\n\nADCs are much more about building against the enemy team now rather than just saying ok I need IE, then Shiv or PD etc etc. So look at what they've got, understand the uses of the new items, the limitations of your champ and build from there. \n\nTypically you'll want at least one big damage item (Death's Dance, IE, BT or BotRK) and at least one att speed item (unless you have BotRK, but soemtiems still) but there are exceptions. MF for example with her new passive, doesn't need to buy any att speed apart from boots, you could probably even do without those. When you utilise her new passive it extends the duration of her att speed buff, so if you play it right, you get all the att speed you need from your abilities.","replies":[]}]}
