I went in-game with Udyr and because nidalee needed help mid lane against mordekaiser I ganked her lane a few times so she could get back on her feet. I ganked other lanes too! But I did not expect everyone to start reporting me especially on the other team for me 'smurfing'. Nidalee was being mad because I was carrying and she wanted to. I didn't know what to do, I haven't said anything bad to my teams or the other in fact, I don't think I said anything in the game apart from pinging. But at the end of the game I got this message saying 'I know everyone has bad times in a while but try to be responsible...' something like that I was stunned.. totally \r\n. its why im writing this article did I really do something wrong or are they just mad? (I also didn't give nidalee blue cuz 1. she already have it 2. I am udyr and need it to change stances) Thanks :) tell me if I did something wrong\r\n\r\nI really wanna know.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T17:13:06.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same happened to me, lol.Is there a rule that every jungler must sacrifice his/her blue to their APC's or fighters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T11:17:15.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, firstly smurfing isn't exactly what a saint does. It undermines the perception of new players and always makes the new player experience worse for everyone involved. It's not reportable, though.\n\nSecondly, if someone was mad at you for carrying, they are insane and you should just ignore them.\n\nIt's unfortunate that you got reported for something like that. You've just got to try and not egg them on or anything.","replies":[]}]}
