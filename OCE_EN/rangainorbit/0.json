either.....no riot i don&#039;t think so . I also lied about being permi banned 3 times to get the WW to listen and he did he ended up doing pretty good for a first timer \r\n\r\n\r\ni wanted to get other peoples thoughts on this because riot seem to throw around bans alot this year some for no reason at all \r\nand you can expect my response in my support ticket to be utter babble that they copy and paste to everyone els not expecting anything less.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-10-25T19:49:44.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No sympathy from me, you aren't the kind of person I'd like to play with.

But we are talking about YOU here, not Darius, and what you did to ban Lux support was despicable. It's not your decision to tell other players what is good/bad, or deny them their picks. If they want to play Lux support, it's their choice. As you stated above, you've already had bans before, so it's time to learn from mistakes while you enjoy this ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-25T23:23:33.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On an initial look, I can't see anything that I would define as \"extremely inflammatory and offensive\". That said, I am still seeing some toxic behaviour. In game 1, that behaviour revolves around directed abuse and passive-aggressive chat use, neither are acceptable. Comments like (just a few examples):\n> rangaInOrbit: hva ea cry\nrangaInOrbit: nice little sooky darius\n...\nrangaInOrbit: just letting thr other team know how pathetic he is\n...\nrangaInOrbit: sorry tris that you support is having a good ole sook\n\nGame 2 shows some negative attitude (and yes, actively complaining about a \"lost game\", regardless of how true it is, *is* negative attitude). I'd also say it shows a bit of passive-aggressive chat use.\n\nI have seen a case where someone was given the reason of \"extremely inflammatory and offensive\" for a ban, when the actual reason was some mroe along the lines of \"overly annoying use of chat. It's possible this may be a similar case. If you're willing, would you be able to post chat logs from previous punishments (you might be able to retrieve them from emails) to provide some clarity? If you no longer have a record of those chat logs, you could try contacting [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), or we could see if a Rioter is willing/able to dig them up.\n\nThat said, if you think the punishment was made in error you can appeal the ban by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) (keep in mind to create a new ticket for each issue). They will be able to direct the ticket to the Player Behaviour team, who will then review the case and make a decision on whether the ban is \"just\" or not. Keep in mind, once that decision is made, there's practically no chance of changing it.","replies":[{"poster":"rangaInOrbit","date":"2017-10-26T01:52:00.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldn't be able to get them sorry and i did in fact appeal its still needing a reply but so far they basically given me a copy paste message without actually reading my chat log that i posted with the ticket","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-26T01:56:32.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh, you do tend to get a lot of \"copy-pasta\" responses from support, which sucks. Sure, it may help them get through tickets faster, but it's not always constructive to do so. Not much we can do about it, though.
