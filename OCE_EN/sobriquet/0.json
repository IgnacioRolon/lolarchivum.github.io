But the the thought hit me. What would be better than to know someone's first PENTAKILL! So please guys, vote on the poll below :D THANKS! (Oh, and if you don't mind, also tell me which champion it was in the comment section below)\n\nIMPORTANT: Im sorry for forgetting to put Mage in the vote.

Once upon a time:\n\"Be me, soloing Bazza as Aatrox, when suddenly a wild enemy team appears.\nAn all ADC team flies out in all directions, consisting of a Draven, Ashe, Graves, Lucian and Quinn.\nAshe shot me in the face with her ult, causing a good second stun, while tanking Bazza and taking fire from all 5 enemies.\nSo then, the stun wore off. I pounced my Q right on Ashe's head, but she did a (super glitchy) mid-knock-up-flash-tele-super-dive-escape!\nNEXT THING I KNOW! All the enemies have run away, so I returned to killing Bazza solo style.\nAfter slaying the beast, I had run from his pit up towards the (used to be Wraith den) on the (used to be purple) side of the map.\nWHEN SUDDENLY! ALL 5 ENEMIES JUMPED OUT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT TO MAIM AND DISTORT MY FACE!\nSo with one swift motion, I ulted that s**t, with some Q an some E an some bloodprice, suddenly an enemy has been slayne\nTHEN SUDDENLY! DOUBLE KILL! THEN TRIPLE KILL! THEN QUADRA KILL! THEN SUDDENLY GRAVES TRIED TO FLASH-DASH AWAY!\nBUT I Q HIM!\nTHE ALL-CHAT GOES WILD!\nAND\nPENTA-KIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR\n# {{champion:266}} folyfe","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-27T00:50:30.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, NOICE!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-21T20:30:18.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first was with Jungle {{champion:121}}.
