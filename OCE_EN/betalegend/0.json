SO I restarted my computer, double checked my computer security settings, made sure I had removed all previous LoL software, and then, downloaded again...but it didn&rsquo;t work. \r\n\r\nSo just to confirm, I am now unable to install and play League of legends, and I have absolutely no idea why. \r\n\r\nPlayssss halppppppp. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nBETALEGEND {{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T03:19:41.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you sure you're attempting to install the client correctly?\n\nCheck out [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends#section-mac) page for more information.","replies":[{"poster":"BETALEGEND","date":"2016-06-21T05:22:42.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi can you send me a link again that link is not wokring on my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T10:32:19.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That link is still up, what error are you receiving?\n\nCould you try switching to a public DNS for me, let me know if you can view the link then.\n\n**CHANGING TO PUBLIC DNS**\n\n* Open System Preferences\n* Open the Network preference pane\n* Select the active connection on the left, and click the \"Advanced...\" button in the lower right hand corner\n* Click \"DNS\" from the selection bar.\n* Remove any current DNS entries, and input the following public DNS servers:\n\n> 8.8.8.8 \n> 8.8.4.4\n\n* Save your changes by selecting \"OK\"\n* Apply the changes by clicking \"Apply\" in the lower right hand corner","replies":[{"poster":"BETALEGEND","date":"2016-07-03T01:05:55.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT INSTANTLY WORKED!!!
