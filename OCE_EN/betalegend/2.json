So that if a player gets up for like 2 seconds to do something like go to the kitchen or bathroom, they dont come back only to find they missed the countdown timer match accepter thing. So basically a player can accept a match from anywhere in the house, and not miss matches they have every intention of playing. \n\nThanks, \n\nBETA","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-13T08:35:08.283+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The queue pop is designed as an afk check, it would pretty much defeat the purpose if you could accept it while you were afk.","replies":[{"poster":"BETALEGEND","date":"2016-03-13T09:53:12.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has it been tried before?

And let's be honest, it's usually only a few minutes tops waiting for queue pop in norms, and if it's ranked ideally you'd have cleared some time for the game and can find youtube or something to watch while you wait. Is it really such an inconvenience to confirm the afk check?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-13T11:53:03.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has never been tried, but if you really want to, install TeamViewer and just remote in when you are away so you can see your screen at all times.\n\nBut in reality, giving someone yet another way of accepting the game and going AFK is a bad idea.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
