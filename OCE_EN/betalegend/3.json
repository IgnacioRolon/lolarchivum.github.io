Playing ranked. Bronze 5. (Represent) \r\n\r\nThe problem is, the wait times are painfully long. \r\n\r\nOn average, I have been waiting over 40 minutes in matchmaking que.. Then, if I am lucky enough to make it to matchmaking lobby, about half of my match making lobbies are getting cancelled because 1 person will forget to lock in their champ or their ban in time, or someone will dodge. The worst part is, when this happens, I have to wait on average 40 minutes all over again in que! it is crazy!!! \r\n\r\nTo put this problem in perspective, I literally watched the whole avengers return of ultron movie yesterday while i was waiting in que\r\n \r\nIs anyone else experiencing this problem??? If you are can we please let Riot know so they can fix it","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-20T23:43:46.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m94m1b3Blj1r2c83ao1_500.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"jaggapuss","date":"2016-02-21T02:15:44.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just wrote the same comment not even seeing this yea im in b2 and i hav the same problem b 2 currently been waiting an hour and a half, ive even resorted into not piking a carry role im going just fill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-21T00:04:07.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Riot know about the issue,** trust me, it comes up on the boards almost as much as the qq threads about bots in low level games. \n\nThe thing is, when you que up for dynamic que, first of all it wants to match you up with one of your preferred roles. Since pretty much everyone wants to carry, picking mid/top is going to take 5ever to get into a game. Secondly, it has to slot you in around dynamic groups, and if there are more people playing in teams of 5 (which many are because the wait times are shorter and its a less toxic thing to play with your friends), the wait for that is also going to be long.\n\nconsidering there is only x amount of players in an mmr bracket queing up at any given time, then you have to half that number to take into account premade dynamic groups. Then maybe take 3/4 of that away again for people in low bronze all trying to que for mid/top, you can see how the wait times are taking a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-20T23:44:19.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/tRW47GF.gif","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-02-21T10:42:07.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot is making too much maths!
