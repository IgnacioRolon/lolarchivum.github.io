For example, players caught trolling multiple seasons, should have their accounts deleted forever. The consequences of the reporting system needs to be stronger. I dont mind losing when everyone is trying their best, but, when a player is intentionally feeding, or intentionally playing badly the entire match, I think this player does not deserve to play in ranked, and potentially does not deserve to play league of legend period. A team orientated game. What does everyone think?","replies":[{"poster":"Goliath","date":"2016-05-25T01:46:01.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All Riot can be bothered to do is read the chat and ban players for using one verbally inappropriate word rather than looking at overall circumstances.

I was banned on a different account for scripting earlier this year. I then played without scripts and deliberatly lost a lot of games but never said anything mean and I haven't been banned for that yet.","replies":[]}]}]}
