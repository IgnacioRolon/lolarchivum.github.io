It has been like this fore more than a week, when i first countered the bug I thought it was something wrong with the Client so i tried closing the League and open it again hoping it will fix it, But nothing changed. I mean everything in the Store client was working fine except for the &quot;**Featured**&quot; section where the slide for 50% off champion and skins. \r\n\r\nI contacted Riot few days ago and they found out that it&#039;s a bug that they will fix but there is no guarantee of the date that it will be fixed.\r\n\r\n_Is anyone else getting this bug?_\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in order to purchase the champions that are on sale right now, please follow the steps below:\r\n\r\nOpen the Store client\r\nClick Champions on the left side of the Store client.\r\nUnder Filters section, please uncheck &quot;**Not Owned**&quot; by clicking the square beside it.\r\nClick On Sale.\r\nAfter you follow these steps, you&#039;ll see the champions that are currently on sale.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-08T12:19:13.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWhile I can't test this at the moment as im away from my computer I figured I'd still chime in.\n\nIf Riot support has confirmed and acknowledged that this is a bug that will be fixed, its pretty safe to assume a majority, if not all players are affected by it.\n\nThanks for posting a temporary \"fix\" for others to utilise :)","replies":[]}]}
