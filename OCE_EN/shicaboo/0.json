I think you should had a reward system of either a small amount of lp or a piority queue just as a sorry for the time that was wasted. Im messaging because ive gotten first blood about 5 time now before hte 3 minute mark and the game has been remade and ive gotten nothing for it. Please do somehting about this because it making me lose interest in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-07-29T12:04:32.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is really irritating that people do a remake and waste the certain amount of time you've waited but given that the reward system of giving a small amount of LP is somewhat a bad idea because people can earn a bit more Lp and possibly play less rank games to achieve their goal. But the remake feature was employed to simply give the team (the ones who have a dc) a chance to remake and have a proper full team because no-one wants to lose Lp because of a dc player but in norms it is really a waste of time. Something like reseting the IP bonus win would be kinda reasonable as part of the reward system.

I understand the need for the remake system and i think its a great feature, but it is still annoying when it happens nonetheless especially when you get a great jump start due to great plays (or in my case, generally luck).\n\nWhile internet issues cant always be helped and should not be punished (blame the government for their dodgy NBN implementation (or lack thereof)), i think an IP compensation would be great, even if it is only an extra 100 or so, its better than nothing, and also costs Riot nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-29T11:56:18.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still think it shoudl be a win for the opposing team, i mean if someone doesnt have a full team and have to forfeit before the game really starts then thats their own problem, it's in the EULA that internet issues arent riots problem, and really, even if the team that remaked didnt lose anythign, the other team should gain for it at the very least.","replies":[]}]}]}
