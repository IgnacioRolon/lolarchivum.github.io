Lucian was sitting in his black leather office chair like he always does at this time of the day. He was filling out some paperwork next to the faint light of an oil lamp when all of a sudden, he noticed the gentle breeze that had been coming through the window was now a raging wind, violently slamming the window shut. He then heard a loud bang and screams coming from the direction of the town bar. Lucian swiftly stood up and grabbed his gun from the first drawer of the table, which he spun on his finger before sliding it in his holster. He also hastily put on his sheriff badge as he rushed out the entrance, running across the street straight towards the bar.\r\n\r\n     A wave of people hurried out of the bar in a mad panic for their lives. Lucian glimpsed to the right of the bar where he spotted three flaming demonic horses. Their eyes were completely black as if their soul has been taken from them. Then he looked at his own reflection in the windows of the houses. The deep, ugly scars that marred half of his face began to glow brighter and brighter with each step he made towards the bar. A strange, but familiar feeling ran through Lucian&rsquo;s body and an old, distant memory came flooding back to him.\r\n \r\n***\r\n\r\nLike most kids, Lucian was playing outside with his friends on a bright sunny day in Redrise when a sandstorm ran through the town out of nowhere, turning the sky blood red. Lucian knew danger was close by. He tried to run away but felt that something was holding back his arm. He swiftly turned around and saw a red-yellow glowing lasso around his arm, but he could not see where it lead as the sandstorm was limiting his vision. Lucian tried to get out of the tight lasso knot, struggling desperately, but he became weaker by each second. He felt like his energy was being sucked out of him and fell to the ground. With his half open eyes, he saw bright pulses going through the lasso from his body towards a shape that he could hardly make out in the sandstorm. Lucian didn&rsquo;t know exactly what was happening, but he knew it wasn&rsquo;t good.\r\n\r\n     &ldquo;Lucian! Lucian, where are you!?&rdquo; Yasuo shouted before spotting Lucian lying on the ground. When he saw what has happened, he screamed of top of his lungs towards the evil looking shape in the distance. &ldquo;Leave my friend alone!&rdquo; He then proceeded to cut the glowing lasso with his sword, picked up Lucian as if he was made out of feathers and carried him to safety.\r\n\r\n     &ldquo;Remember kid, Thresh will come back for you one day and your soul shall be mine!&rdquo; the evil shape&rsquo;s deep voice echoed through the whole town, chilling all who heard it to the bone.\r\n\r\n***\r\n \r\n     &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s here. I can feel it.&rdquo; Lucian thought out loud as he stepped into the bar. Then he realised who is sitting at the bar counter. &ldquo;What in the blue hell are you doing here, Thresh? You angling for the rest of my soul?&rdquo;\r\nThresh just laughed off the cowboy&rsquo;s threat.\r\n\r\n     &ldquo;I knew this day would come, so I got a bullet with your name on it, Thresh. I&rsquo;ve been saving this bullet for you for a very long time, devil. Tell me why shouldn&rsquo;t I shoot it right now?&rdquo; Lucian continued.\r\n\r\n     Thresh threw his lasso at Lucian&rsquo;s gun without even looking, before Lucian could react and grabbed it out of his hand. &ldquo;I think that would be a mistake. I say we should have a fair duel. Your gun against my lasso outside.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThey walked out of the bar and stood 20 metres from each other on the dark street. People started peeking through the windows to see what&rsquo;s happening outside.\r\n\r\n     &ldquo;When the bell is struck at 9 o&rsquo;clock, that&rsquo;s when we begin.&rdquo; said Thresh.\r\n\r\nThey stood silently, death staring each other for a minute.\r\n\r\n     &ldquo;This one is for Senna, you two-faced son of a coyote!&rdquo; Lucian whispered while putting his hand close to his gun.\r\n\r\nThe bell was struck and it kept ringing for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n     Lucian chuckled. &ldquo;Well, Senna. That&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Gorlanduese","date":"2018-09-26T09:21:57.527+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the story!
