I find they can be extremely moody and cry babies :P which makes it off putting to play this game. Idk i just find that attitude and speech is just so vulgar and immature. Like all the games i&#039;ve been playing tonight there&#039;s always one jerk in the game lol. And i try and be nice and tell people their doing a good job and to be honest couldn&#039;t care less if people still my kills. \r\n\r\nOpinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-19T06:29:41.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not PLAYERS, it's PEOPLE.\n\nPeople in an anonymous environment.\n\nThere have been many psychological studies over the years that prove that people act according to their true nature in an anonymous environment such as the internet.\nIf you talk to a person face to face they will act based on how they want to be perceived.\nIf you talk to the same person online they don't care about how others see them, and thus they don't try to hide anything because it can't effect them as it would if they acted like a prick to you face to face.\n\nThis is especially true for children online.\nThey want to know they have an impact, and they will poke and poke as hard as they can to get a reaction in order to feel accomplished.\nUpon getting a reaction they realise they have an in and tear at the opening as hard as they can.\n\nIt's not the game.\nAt all.\nIt's the environment.\nIt is 100% because they know you don't know who they are, nor can you influence anything in their life.\n\nAgain.

Everyone wants to win and rank up. Toxicity is a problem in any multiplayer game really, especially a team based one where its very hard to solo carry. Because of the fact that, after the game, you'll likely never see anybody you played with every again, people don't really care about what they say to others. People also don't like to accept their own mistakes. They always find a reason to blame someone other than themselves so they don't have to accept the fact that they screwed up.","replies":[{"poster":"Pixiedrop","date":"2016-06-18T21:36:24.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see it as a stressful game, like I'm talking about unranked mode not ranked.
