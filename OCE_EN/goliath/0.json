I have thoroughly read the chat myself, only one or two verbally inappropriate word was used because the player either verbally abused me first, or they were just trolling around and feeding. I had refrained myself from using any inappropriate words after the first ban, yet after using one verbally inappropriate word I got banned again.\r\n\r\nI know this does not justify anything but don&#039;t you think this is a bit harsh especially considering all the context? It seems my reports never even get processed when others verbally abuse me so what do I do? Just sit there and take all the crap like I&#039;m a punchbag? I even had Jax adc the other day 0-13-2 by end of the game, which we still won but I have reported him but he seems to be playing ranked games fine.","replies":[]}
