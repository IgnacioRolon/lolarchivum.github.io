The reason i did not involve myself in the game as 2 of the players pinged non stop, not just here and there literally non stop just to annoy the crap out of everyone they might not have young children or other reasons that this might cause an issue. After trying oce for the first time over 3 0r 4 days i also will stay with a 200 ping to NA where the children seem to be a lot less.\n\nThoughts why not punish those that abuse the ping system surely it cannot be hard but apparently trolls and annoying people ruining others experience is more important i guess GG","replies":[{"poster":"RagingHomosexual","date":"2015-07-13T14:42:12.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just report for negative attitude and state your case in the comments section that's what i would do","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GnarGada","date":"2015-07-12T05:19:38.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feels","replies":[]}]}
