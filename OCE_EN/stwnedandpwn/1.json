How can you have too much unlocked content? Why would you even want to do that?\n\nYou can always use your refund tokens to remove champions and skins from your account, but you only have three of them and they don't refresh.\n\nYou can always just try to reach the rune cap by buying them all with your excessive amounts of IP. :P","replies":[]}]}
