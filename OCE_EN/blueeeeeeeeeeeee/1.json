Looking for a support main to duo the bot lane who knows what they&#039;re doing and hopefully we can climb while having fun as well.  looking for an aggressive support who will make plays and knows when to go in and back off/trades etc.  Looking for someone that tries to carry from a support role. :) {{champion:32}} \n\nBlue :)","replies":[{"poster":"SupportWisp","date":"2017-02-15T05:51:36.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a supp main in S4 as well trying to get through my promos for a second time, add me","replies":[]}]}
