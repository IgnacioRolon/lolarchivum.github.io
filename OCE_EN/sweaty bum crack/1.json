Just after the LCS World Finals. Everybody is quivering in anticipation, waiting for the new map. New map comes out, everybody is happy. At this stage jungling is still very much the same, it just looks different. Then comes the preseason, and soon afterwards season 5. The jungle got harder all of a sudden. Some champions that had been dominating took a while to find their feet but are doing fine now, like Jarvan IV and Lee Sin. However there was one jungler that just got left to rot. Champions like Hecarim, Evelynn (who nobody plays) and skarner all got buffs. What about Kha\"Zix? Once feared and banned he is now rarely picked because while it is possible to play him in the jungle, and he can still do jungler things, he is just so bad at it when compared to others. Some may say Kha'Zix delivers a lot of physical burst damage to a single target. Take a look at Rengar. At his core he does very much the same thing as Kha'Zix. This was intentional as they were so closely intertwined (read their lore if you have no idea what I'm talking about). The problem is Rengar does it all so much better and is a much stronger champion currently.\r\n\r\nNow I know, Kha'Zix was over powered, he was \"a tough bug to balance,\" but he needs a buff desperately. The biggest problem i see is his identity - riot wants him to be an assassin, not a bruiser. So what can they buff? Increasing the damage on his w would give him significantly increased clear speed but too much poke damage. Buffing the healing on the w would change him into more of a fighter than an assassin, better at sustained fights than quick skirmishes. Buffing the damage on his q is a bad idea. There is a reason it was nerfed.\r\n\r\nHowever what if they simply focused on his identity as a jungler? Don't buff the ability's overall damage, buff it's damage to monsters. Kha'Zix was always intended to be a jungling assassin, rather than a top lane bruiser. Why don't they buff the damage against monsters on his q and w? This doesn't make him broken in skirmishes as his damage to champions remains unchanged, but gives him an easier time in the jungle and still focuses on his identity as an assassin. I think a buff to his damage against monsters, similar to that of Shyvana's w, would be highly beneficial and get the bug back on his feet.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? Is there something else that could be buffed while keeping his identity, but not making him broken? I really want riot to buff Kha'Zix, as he just isn't viable in the current jungle as he gets destroyed by the camps and there are so many other junglers that are better choices.","replies":[]}
