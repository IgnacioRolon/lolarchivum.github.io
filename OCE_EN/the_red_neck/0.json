Looking at your account, it looks like you've only played three games since the start of the new season. \n\nRanked in League of Legends works around roughly yearly time periods called seasons - when one season completes and another starts, you are then unranked until you play another provisional series. \n\nThe 2015 Season started on Jan 21st - so you'll need to complete another 7 games to get your new starting rank for 2015.
