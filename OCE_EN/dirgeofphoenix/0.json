Could it be stuck because the NA server is on patch day even though they&#039;ve finished patching?

So long as you have the RP on your account and transfers aren't down for some reason they should be able to either work out why it's not working and make it not do that, or transfer you manually.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"DirgeOfPhoenix","date":"2018-06-27T20:37:33.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turns out the problem was the two regions were on different patches. I just had to wait before they were in sync before I could transfer. I was wrong, NA in fact did not finish patching. They did not even start the patch yet but after they finished I was able to transfer.

Usually a region wouldn't be available in the transfer list if they aren't on the same patch so it's still a bit strange, but at least it worked out.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
