Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.&quot; So i checked if my internet was working properly, and it is. Everything works smoothly except for league of legends. So i went on Riot&#039;s support page and went through all possible fixes to the problems, but nothing as been successful. It seems as though my router doesn&#039;t connect to the server properly, so while the technicians were at my house, i got them to look at the issue to see if they could find a way around it. They couldn&#039;t find the issue, and tried opening a number of ports required to connect to League of Legends, but with no success. I have since contacted riot and asked for some help, however none of the solutions they offered seemed to work either. I&#039;m really stuck at the moment, i have trawled through numbers of google pages trying to see if anyone else has had a similar issue, but i haven&#039;t found anything. I might add that i am a Mac user, using the latest version of OS X. I have uninstalled, repaired the client, tried setting a static ip, tried changing the DNS settings, basically anything i found on the internet thus far. Please, let me know if anyone else is having a similar for Mac, I&#039;m getting pretty impatient.\n\nTL;DR  error message, tried everything, need solution, any help out there?\n\nHere's the error: https://gyazo.com/851a1e08b50613e194f50fe3cba17dd5\n\n{{champion:150}}  Sincerely, Gnar Mate {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"Huebae","date":"2015-09-19T11:10:39.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol mac","replies":[{"poster":"BL Funk","date":"2015-09-19T11:45:41.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same error for windows computers on the same network...","replies":[]}]}]}
