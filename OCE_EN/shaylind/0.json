Its annoying that you guys decide that because 3s isnt getting the popularity as you would like that you decide to disable it... How about you enable it for a day or two each week and see how many people play. I dont like playing it on normals but like ranked and I am sure there are others out there that are the same. Its been over 2 years now that we havent had ranked 3s up now. Just give us the option PLEASE! {{item:3070}}\r\nWe will let the community vote aswell","replies":[]}
