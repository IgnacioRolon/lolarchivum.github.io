(enemy is going poke comp, we might want hard engage etc)\r\n\r\nOur lack of Draft mode means the only way to practice this and often results in people trying new match ups in ranked ques jeopardizing their rank and in turn stats related to ranked play.\r\n\r\nBlind pick which is our only other option (this includes team builder as it is still blind) often results in hard counters (kit wise) in lanes.\r\n\r\n> My question is this:  Are we getting Draft mode anytime soon or should i just make another account and use that accounts ranked as my draft mode?","replies":[{"poster":"BrbDoingWraiths","date":"2014-11-24T06:14:40.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this game mode is re-introduced Riot needs to really tell the community. Many people I know were not even aware there was one till they got to level 25+. This with more people using the queue it would be great. Ranked but you can also have some more fun.\nI would have loved to use this mode before I began ranked to understand the drafting process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-23T19:38:31.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its called ranked lol\n\nI see no point in having it for normals","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2014-11-23T02:30:29.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hardly anyone plays it","replies":[]}]}
