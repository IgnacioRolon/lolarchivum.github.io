Very valuable prizes which include a training session with THE CHIEFS. I am very serious about this but i am unable to make a team as my players live else where. If you are willing to train as much before hand then send me a message. If your not willing to give it your all then dont bother messaging me. \r\n\r\nGood luck.","replies":[]}
