I do like the set up of the queue dont get me wrong, but where it starts to flail off is the clicking of the buttons (i.e the lock in and banning). It has a bit of delayed timing to it and another thing is that it doesnt show how long you have to lock in? which i liked. But many tiems where i have looked back onto league only to hear the DUN DUN DUN as i had not realised it was my chance to ban/pick a champion as i hate waiting and i find something interesting to do, 4chan, facebook stuff like that to miss my turn. Window no longer pops up for me anymore when its my turn and then im banned for 5 then 30. Justt something to think about.","replies":[]}
