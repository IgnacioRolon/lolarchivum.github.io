Fishing for a riot post to see if this can get fix by simply increasing animation speed.","replies":[{"poster":"x Dragon x","date":"2015-07-13T12:35:20.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your not looking at this logically.

This reminds me a lot of the quinn vault e where you could vault out of range and not auto attack. I think thats a bug because its not how the champion was design to play thus it got changed similar to what is happening to Elise imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-13T06:53:12.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty clear that what you're talking about with Elise wasn't a bug, it was **intended** to be a 1 second stun at rank 1. That's what it says in the description, that's the way it's coded. The difference between Elise's Cocoon and Quinn's Vault is that Quinn's Vault wasn't intended to act that way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"x Dragon x","date":"2015-07-12T13:24:05.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome i knew it was an issue that needed to be fixed. Secondly to heartvine  I dont think that how she is suppose to work thats why it is getting changed and because it feels awfully clunky and stupid when you point blank stun someone and you cant even q them in spider form","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-12T21:15:38.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I dont think that how she is suppose to work\n\nIt's how she was designed. If something isn't designed the way it's supposed to work, then what's the point?
