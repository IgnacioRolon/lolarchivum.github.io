My biggest issue are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Lack of impact. Players currently dont know if the reporting does anything\r\n2. It feels inadequate at some times. Reporting a team mate for refusing to cooperate is fine but when you have a team mate or opposition that is scripting , simply feeding  20 kills or win trading the assisting enemy team option kinda feels inadequate. \r\n3. Moving on from the second point, riot needs to put a weighting on each type of ban and add more options. An individual reported for scripting or feeding 20 kills shouldnt go through the same process as a person who tilted that day and was raging. A more stream lined process needs to be implemented for those people who are genuinely ruining the game and not just having a bad day.\r\n\r\nLast note, how do you think the reporting system can be improved or whats good about it?","replies":[]}
