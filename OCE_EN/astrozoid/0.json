Was wondering if Rito was ever thinking about it? I heard of a Manga out, but maybe an anime showing the lore of the Institute of War and the Ionia v Noxus war (stuff like that) and it could give hints on new champs or things happening to and on the rift. \r\nJust a thought, im not sure if its already getting talked about or something, But it would be a cool thing. Might get new players into playing League too ya know? ;) \r\n\r\nPlease take this into consideration :)","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-02T00:13:58.487+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"weebs. every last one of you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CometSewerSide","date":"2015-06-01T09:21:19.447+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed and Shen before Zed was evil would be pre sick, and maybe the tales of Avarosa :) and Shurima when it wasn't ruins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skronix Legend","date":"2015-06-01T09:18:08.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yerrr this sounds awesome!!!!!!!!!! {{champion:35}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:62}} < would love to see these guys in a anime :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-11-14T09:25:12.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what the fuck","replies":[]},{"poster":"Character King","date":"2016-11-14T02:52:10.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ezreal as the main character because the fact that he's an explorer can justify any location and he can add and lose members and create enemies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-06-02T02:44:31.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a good idea :)\nZed and Shen...\nGangplank and Miss Fortune...\nAkali + Kennen...\nAkali and Master Yi...\nAnnie and Amumu...\nRenekton and Nasus...\nAzir + Sivir...","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-02T04:32:54.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly why did you list mostly Rule 34 matchings?","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-06-02T23:40:58.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk, stories for anime?????\nXD\nI hav no idea, i was probably tired when i posted this comment","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-06-02T08:04:05.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get off 9gag","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-06-02T11:14:41.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon a continuous anime would suck, but instead have maybe each episode it's separate story, sort of like in Halo: Legends.\n\nSo one episode it's shen and zed, another it's exploring ekkos lore, and another maybe vi + cait vs jinx, but just have a series of short stories to expand upon the lore of league, instead of a chronological story.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-02T05:24:31.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell yeah I would love to watch League of Legends Anime!","replies":[{"poster":"Astrozoid","date":"2015-06-02T09:31:01.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hell yeah I would love to watch League of Legends Anime!\n\nA rioter actually looked at the thread :D thanks man honestly means so much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-02T05:39:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cartoons are for kids.

Dragonball Z routine - introduce characters and world through power creeping.\n2. One Piece routine - introduce characters and world through initial small cast of characters that gradually reveal the giant web of connections and relationships between nearly all elements of the story.\n3. Hunter x Hunter routine - The entire world is big, alive and thriving but through the main casts' eyes you only get to see a part of the whole story.\n\nWhat we currently have for LoL's lore isn't enough to reach option 2 and 3, and really option 1 is just outdated, cliche and overused by now.\n\nI really don't think LoL's anime series would work.","replies":[{"poster":"DeVineMonster","date":"2015-06-01T13:48:01.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're acting as if the game content is the whole story, you could easily expand and introduce new storys and aspects to the lore using an anime.
