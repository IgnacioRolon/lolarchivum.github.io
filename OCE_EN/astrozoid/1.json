I won 8/10 of my Placement Promos because of the new season, I had a positive KDA in majority of my matches or equal, and boom got thrown into Bronze5!! I climbed last season out of Bronze5 to Bronze3 xD I just think it sucks players that put a lot of effort into doing well in these matches get hard done by. \r\nI&#039;m literally ready to stop playing League of Legends. \r\nTY Astrozoid.","replies":[{"poster":"Finnster","date":"2016-01-20T10:40:27.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Be happy u got that, i  won 10 games and got b5","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-20T10:08:47.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Astrozoid,\n\nThis board is mainly focused on Help & Support regarding technical issues with the game, your post would be better suited for the [Gameplay & Strategy Board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) or the [General Discussion Board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion), however i'll answer here to give you an idea as to what occurred.\n\nThe placement seems accurate to me, if you were bronze 3 last season playing your 10 placement matches this season will most likely result in you being matched up against bronze 4-5 players. Your current estimated MMR is 778, this is around bronze 4-5.\n\nThe best thing you can do if you feel you deserve a higher rank is to work your way up.","replies":[]}]}
