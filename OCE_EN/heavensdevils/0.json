Permanently ban my in-game chat so I cant speak to anyone but not my account. Especially since I have put a lot of hours and money into this game. Everyone is different and many people can&#039;t keep their cool but unfortunately Riot doesn&#039;t understand that.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-09T12:50:38.609+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well maybe you need to understand that a community of complete strangers who don't even fucking know you, don't like your attitude enough to take time out of their day to report you for being an ass (when a decent chunk of the community actually think reports do nothing), these are people who don't need to hear you, and yet you are being toxic again and again, and after several bans, you have been told that enough people are sick of your shit, that Riot themselves don't want you on their game.\n\nA tip for if you ever make a new account, unbind your chat key, cause if you don't you will get banned again, because no one want's to hear you, play the game, and don't be a toxic turd, and you can actually stay playing the game.\n\nAs for your account, your not entitled to it anymore, because you are that 2 year old that gets their toys taken off them because they are being a little shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Malcolm Trumble","date":"2016-05-09T13:11:46.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you. i like you. {{item:3110}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-10T21:56:49.933+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I have put a lot of hours and money into this game\n\ndo you have absolutely any idea how many permabanned people say this exact line in every one of their pleas for their account back? its interesting really isnt it. are they all trying to be submissive and manipulative even after all their warnings only just when they realise its too late. what would happen if you got your account back instantly the day after it said you were permabanned, after just pleading with them with these same submissive/manipulative tactics of persuasion, i wonder how many people would truly be \"reformed\" forever. judging by this thread and countless other previous ones, looks like riot made the right decision though :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"HeavensDevils","date":"2016-05-10T09:55:05.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just want everyone to know that I take full responsibility for my stupid actions. I take everything back. If I could speak to those I have hurt, I would tell them that I love them and that I'm sorry for the trouble I have cost. I would even mystery gift them to emphasize on my apology. I also completely understand the reasoning for my ban but, rather than leaving this community as a toxic idiot I am, I would like to stay apart of this amazing community and spread positivity. The thing is since I have gone through all those chat restrictions that were suppose to make me less toxic, I never really read it and just clicked 'I Understand'. I treated it just like accepting terms and conditions. No one reads those but we still click I accept. But now that I'm banned, I am able to read all those nasty things I said and really understand the damage I caused. All I ask is forgiveness.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-10T14:47:23.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are free to create a new account, but long story short you won't be unbanned. Bans will only be lifted if they have been made in error. 14 day was your final warning and you chose to ignore it.\n\nIf you want to be better and continue to be a part of the community then create a new account, and prove it to the people who's days you ruined. Prove that you can be better, if only for yourself.\n\nForgiveness tends to require a desire for reformation/reparation, so demonstrate that. You won't get your account back, but if you become a positive player not only will you get rewards you were previously unable to, you also won't have to worry about facing bans again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-09T12:52:29.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't even bother anymore the amount of people who post this shit daily get 0 attention Riot doesn't care about you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shaboigan8","date":"2016-05-09T12:09:37.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A","replies":[{"poster":"QueenSlothh","date":"2016-05-09T12:11:21.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Saiyan Goku","date":"2018-07-24T09:38:06.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same on me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-05-10T00:43:20.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you willingly broke the rules consistently enough to get hit with a perma-ban and think you have *any* right to the account?\n\nThat's a bigger joke than colonel j thinking they're a sheriff...\n\nI would like to take his opportunity to point out that the account was never yours, it was *always* Riot's. You agreed that you have no interest in taking ownership of the account (or the \"assets\" of the account) and that all of the \"assets\" (skins, champs etc.) have no monetary value. You also agreed to uphold a certain standard of behaviour in-game. Fact is, you don't have a leg to stand on here.\n\nYou broke the rules you agreed to repeatedly and consistently, therefore Riot did their job and removed you from the game.

Of course I could make another account and be an ass which I won't but I'd like to keep this account and I'll be willing to pay/receive some sort of restriction whether that be skins being lost or champs or in game chat being blocked which would remove toxicity. If a person can never talk in game they cannot flame. So instead of banning accounts, ban the in game chat. I'd like to speak to someone who works at riot in a peaceful manner about this. Of course I'm at fault but I will swear an oath that this will never happen again and am willing to pay the price!","replies":[]}]}
