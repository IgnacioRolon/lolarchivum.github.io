Only two of these roles will be filled as we have someone on our team who is willing to roster swap but can do all three and would rather let you have your pick :)\n\nThis organisation is run quite strictly, if you&#039;re unable to cope with that then I suggest not applying :/ \nWhen I say &quot;strict&quot; I don&#039;t mean you will be harassed, however we take the team seriously and have high ambitions, our team leader is quite a strong personality and runs the team like reginald from TSM. It&#039;s basically if you&#039;re asked to do something, just do it. You need to be willing to take criticism and you need a positive outlook and attitude :) \n\nIndividual needs for individual roles:\n\nTOP: You need to be able to go at least even in lane(most times unless losing match up), be able to communicate and tp without being asked(sometimes, as in to turn a gank etc) we&#039;d pref a tanky pool.\n\nJG: Need to be able to shotcall early game and gank really well, wanting great communication and warding and a positive attitude :) \n\nSupport: You need to be able to adapt and suit our current ADC which is highly aggressive with a diverse champion pool, but very mechanical.  Warding needs to be top-notch and also communication and synergy off the bat with our ADC is highly wanted.\n\n\nIf you&#039;d like to apply for a position and get a trial, please add &quot;Vicenza&quot; \n\n- Thanks, Equanimity Gaming.","replies":[{"poster":"HackerPro","date":"2015-11-30T07:17:09.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can support but im only in silver 5 my main champs for support is {{champion:12}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:117}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:3}} so yeah :D","replies":[]}]}
