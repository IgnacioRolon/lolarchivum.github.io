I quit the game awhile back and now i&#039;m looking to get into a team again. I decayed into plat last season and finished there on p4 I believe. My peak solo Q rank is high d2 and my team&#039;s rank was Challenger. I understand how to play against challenger and I expect myself to climb there this season, currently in plat 4, placed g1 and im climbing fast. I expect to end the season at least high diamond but i&#039;m aiming challenger.\n\nADCs I love:\n\nDraven\nVayne\nEzreal\nCait\nLucian(rip)\nKalista(rip)\nbasically all of them except the super shit ones that I don&#039;t consider adc.\n\nI don&#039;t care what elo the team is as when I was in it&#039;s all ogre noww we all started around gold/plat and climbed to dia and then next season chall so I don&#039;t care about the elo, just want dedicated players who want to improve and know what it takes.\n\nCan also mid lane, have a pretty wide champion pool.\n\nFav mids:\nZed\nYas\nLeblanc\nAhri\nOri\nKat\nVik\n\n\n-Vicenza","replies":[]}
