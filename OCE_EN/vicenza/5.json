Also our players are acting as managers too which \r\nstrains us all and a manager could help relieve some of those duties.\r\n\r\nThanks guys, please shoot me or POLO an add on league or discord!\r\n:)\r\n\r\nLeague: Vicenza\r\nDiscord: Vicenza#2714\r\n\r\nLeague: Ninja POLO Shirt\r\nDiscord: Ninja POLO#5795","replies":[]}
