I guess b5 looking for a tad of help?","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made this request earlier on the NA server boards accidentally, I won&#039;t write what I wrote there. Hello, I&#039;m a b5 Morgana support main, and I&#039;ve lately been having a tonne of trouble in ranked. Now, when I say I main support, it&#039;s because I won my first 13 ranked games with her, but that quickly went downhill. Anyway enough about that, I hit bronze 2 earlier in the year, and from then on my winning turned to losing. I&#039;m not sure what happened, whether it was me or my teams (My lolsumo says it&#039;s not me, but I&#039;m not a pessimist and understand that I make mistakes). My MMR is bronze 3, and I&#039;d like someone to help me in ranked. If not, I&#039;m sorry for wasting your time and hope you have a good day and a slumber filled night.\r\n\r\nSummary - I&#039;m b5, looking for assistance in achieving a higher rank with a duo partner. I&#039;ve been playing since 2012-2013 (I forgot which)\r\n\r\nAlright... that&#039;s all!

Sighstone gives you health so you get pretty much more health when bought separately.\n\nAlso some advice for Bronze, try another role apart from sup, I played ADC last season from bronze 5 to Silver II playing Vayne\n\nSupport is good and all and requires alot of thinking despite what people say, From what i can tell dude it may not be role that suits you unless you keep practising, youll be fine if you keep it up with morgana build tanky AP , Braum just build full tank your passive pretty much peels enough for the ADC.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-07T01:47:52.918+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Gordon. Play a different role if you want to climb. Supporting bronze is so frustrating, especially when you can't get messages through to them. Like what objectives to prioritise at certain times. Usually the team that gets ahead (takes first few towers) wins because the game snowballs out of control (bronze have no idea how to turtle).","replies":[{"poster":"DV Arjay","date":"2016-11-07T10:55:53.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree\nI managed to play braum and karma supp on my smurf \nGetting me from b4 to s5\nU can hyper carry with janna. braum and karma if u know how to poke, ward and shot call with the adc and learning their play style \nWhilst being diverse in your build and actions","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-09T02:21:05.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps if you are duo yes.
