I&#039;ve run a repair and re installed my game yet this still persists.\r\n\r\nOn Vi {{champion:254}} , sometimes my Flash  just refuses to work.. until like the 8th click of the button. Same with my Smite.\r\nAlso, Vi&#039;s Q does the same, I have to press it various times before it works, It just shows the charge up arrow at the lowest length.\r\n\r\nI know this isn&#039;t a keyboard issue because the ability makes a click sound and stuff, though doesn&#039;t go off. I also know it isn&#039;t a lag or latency issue, players still move normally and so can I.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed this happening with Smite on Xin Zhao {{champion:5}}  sometimes, but less often.\r\n\r\nHas anybody come across this before? Will this be patched?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T09:21:47.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">**DO NOT** post bug reports here.
