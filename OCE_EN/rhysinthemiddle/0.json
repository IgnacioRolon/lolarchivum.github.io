We need a tribunal again, we need people monitoring the game, because this is becoming stupid. I can&#039;t queue up for a game without getting someone intentionally feed because they didn&#039;t get the role they want, or just because they&#039;re in the mood, or people just sitting at the fountain because something in game doesn&#039;t go right. reporting people does nothing and it&#039;s fucking stupid. it&#039;s hard to stay positive and enjoy a game when you get matched with 3 other people who haven&#039;t just dropped dead due to lack of brain function.\r\n\r\nCan we please get a tribunal for OCE and do something about everyone&#039;s attitude, I shouldn&#039;t have to dodge every queue because people want to AFK or feed right off the bat. I know the odds of it happening on the opponents team are just as high, but it shoulndn&#039;t be okay just because it&#039;s not on your team, it shouldn&#039;t happen at all and people should be banned for it, because this Server and community is getting more and more toxic the longer nothing is done about it, I&#039;m considering quitting because it&#039;s not fun to dodge and lose LP to roll the dice and see if my next lobby has people just as toxic in it and when everyone who tries to be positive quits it&#039;s going to end up being a cesspit of negativity, if it isn&#039;t already.\r\n\r\nPlease, I&#039;ll volunteer 2-3 days a week to be a one man tribunal for the server just so someone can do something about the toxicity, because it&#039;s unacceptable for a game to be like this and have nothing done about it. I don&#039;t want new skins, or new champions or reworks, I want a tribunal because muting 4 members of your own team at the beginning of a game shouldn&#039;t happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-06T05:19:39.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWe definitely do read the boards.

Plus it obviously isn't doing enough since you have 3 board posts all talking about how toxic the LoL community is and how in a majority of games a person plays they are encountering toxic players. Name and shame people who have gotten bans and stuff before, really reward positive playing not just with unique icons but maybe unique skins or hell RP and IP, make it so it's really worth not being a toxic player, also to prevent them from being toxic after they get the positive rewards, have it so they get taken away if they get banned and in regards to the ip or rp take that back as well even if it puts them in the negative. ave harsher penalties for new players who troll and be toxic to help keep out the throwaway accounts people make just so they can troll and be toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-08T00:36:46.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nNegative players are are definitely being punished AND have ranked rewards removed. Below is a handy link to everything we have done in patch 5.18 - http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/132567836098\n\n> 1) In 5.18, Chat and Ranked Restrictions are now powered by machine learning, and capable of handing out restrictions within 15 minutes of matches. We're also introducing a new escalation system for penalties, so players will now get 10 chat restrictions, 25 chat restrictions, a 14-day game ban then a permanent ban for repeated offenses. You can read more about this upgrade in a design blog by Neurocat here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions\n\n> 2) In 5.18, we've also launched the new Intentional Feeder Detection system. This system can ban intentional feeders within 15 minutes of matches, but we've tuned it relatively conservative to start to make sure that we do not punish players for just having a bad game.\n> ---\n> Because we've launched Instant Feedback, Upgraded Chat and Ranked Restrictions and Intentional Feeder Detection during the 2015 Ranked Season, we've decided to make some changes to the 2015 Ranked Rewards policy. Our design philosophy focuses on player reform wherever possible; however, a second goal was to make it super obvious whether players would receive rewards or not by End of Season, and to reinforce that sportsmanship is a fundamental aspect of competitive play. By announcing the changes at this time (especially after the restriction reset), the vast majority of punished players should have enough time to reform by the End of Season.\n\n> Here's this year's Ranked Rewards policy:\n> 1) Players with ACTIVE Chat and Ranked Restrictions by End of Season will not receive ranked rewards.\n> 2) Players that have received game bans for cheating (hacking, scripting, Elo Boosting, etc) will not receive ranked rewards.\n> 3) Players that have received game bans for player behavior (verbal or gameplay toxicity) will not receive ranked rewards UNLESS they have had no punishments for AT LEAST 3 MONTHS up to the End of Season.\n> 4) Players that have received Low Priority Queues (from LeaverBuster) will not be affected in 2015 because we don't want to punish players for the random DC or hardware/ISP failure.\n> 5) Ranked Reward eligibility is reset every season. So, if players are excluded from rewards in 2015, they are eligible for rewards in future seasons as long as they are neutral or positive.\n> 6) Players that are intentionally toxic on purpose for the rest of the season because they are ineligible for rewards will be given penalties up to a permanent ban.\n> Hopefully that clears up any questions about Ranked Rewards in 2015. For next season, we'll be posting this info earlier in the season; in addition, player behavior systems will inform you in-game when you are approaching ranked reward ineligibility.\n\nBut in saying that here is no silver bullet that solves negative behavior in online games. Players are a diverse bunch, and each player has different motivations and responds differently to different consequences. We design diverse systems using three core philosophies based on reform, punishment, and reward.\nread more about out Player Behaviour Design Values here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nAnd if you're really interested I highly suggest watching these great GDC talks by our Player Behaviour lead Riot Lyte\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player \nhttp://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"mosse is ali","date":"2015-10-05T06:12:39.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RhysInTheMiddle","date":"2015-10-05T06:43:12.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"shining example :')","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RitoSquad Singed","date":"2015-10-06T05:04:23.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 Please make us a tribunal. I used to love this game and would play it frequently and would buy many skins but then the oce server was brought out and then there was no mode of punishment and people realised they could be as toxic as they liked without any repercussions. I then quit as every game having someone afk, troll or just flame and abuse someone wasn't a fun experience and very derailing to the fun of the community who just want to play a few games after work/school. I then came back after 1-2 seasons and the problem has only gotten worse, much worse. Please give us a tribunal I would volunteer to just run it by myself if that would help clean up the community. If money is an issue please bring out a skin like \"ban hammer taric\" and all proceeds can go into bringing us a tribunal as the way it is going right now you will be left with a toxic cesspit that all the nice players have quit to go play elsewhere. After this happens only then will I again continue to spend money on this game.","replies":[]}]}
