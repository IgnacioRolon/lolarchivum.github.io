But because there is only me and 3 or 4 of them i get my acccount chat banned and now suspended. This so called tribunal is a joke sort it the fuck out riot. The fact that you are promoting cyber bullying is ridiculous, telling me to simply mute them is not good enough then only taking into account my words and leaving them unpunished is stupid.\n\nHas anyone else ever had this happen to them?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-05T01:24:53.297+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I would point out that the \"tribunal\" isn't active. Not considering the fact that OCE never had the tribunal to begin with, it was removed months/years ago so Riot could (apparently) improve it (there's been no updates on this as far as I know, we've all just assumed it's not happening).\n\nSecondly, even if 3-4 (or even 9) people reported you it wouldn't result in a punishment if you didn't break the rules (even if it did it would be a rare case and you would still have the option to dispute it with support). \"Defending myself against flamers/trolls\" is usually a persons way of saying \"I broke the rules but they started it so I shouldn't be punished\". Meeting toxicity with toxicity is *NOT* acceptable. Feel free to post the chat logs and some of the board goers will help you identify what would have resulted in the punishments you received.\n\nThirdly, you have no way of knowing if they have been punished, short of the \"notice\" that *only* comes up if you were the *most recent* person to report them before they got punished (assuming you even reported them).\n\nLastly, the mute button is an effective way to \"eliminate\" the possibility of these kinds of players from further impacting you in-game, allowing you to play out the rest of the match without having to constantly deal with whatever they're saying. If you *choose* not to do so, that's nothing to do with Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-05T01:37:31.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it better myself.

Mute them and continue doing your thing dude. Mute them as soon as you think you're becoming salty  because of them. A lot of the time people don't have anything smart to say. They're only talking sh-t because they're tilted themselves. \n\nOnly thing is, being able to mute pings should be a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-06-06T04:05:03.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Promoting Cyber bullying\" get your head out of your ass lmao.\nif you don't want to get cyber bullied by Riot's regime hit the mute button.","replies":[]}]}
