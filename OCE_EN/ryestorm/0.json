I believe (but don't quote me on this) that the idea is to make sure there aren't any gamebreaking bugs with the basic patch before activating extra cosmetics that could also have problems once shipped to live. Basically it's to ensure that if there's a leak in the boat, it's only one or two that can be fixed up, instead of the whole boat bottom just going bye bye.","replies":[]}]}
