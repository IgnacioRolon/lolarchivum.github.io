Only to overcome them in the face of adversity, and destroy them in the name of his homeland. His name whispered with fear from most, admiration from others. The man who put country before all else, killing hundreds in the name of bettering it. Darius, the hand of Noxus.\r\n\r\nHatred flowed from his body, infecting the air around him, his allies preparing for the coming fight, countless hours of training, all for this, the battle that would decide the out come of both nations. As both sides donned the uniforms of there respected nations. Blue and Gold for Demacia, and red for Noxus. Both colours were worn with pride. \r\n\r\nAs the opponents squared off, checking the enemy, for weaknesses, openings and a way to win. Darius however never turned his gaze, he was confident in his skill, it did not matter how strong his enemy was, he could never lose. \r\n\r\nThe time was approaching fast, sweat, was starting to appear on everyone in anticipation. The time to battle was at hand, as the opponents faced each other, all their training, effort and skill was going to be tested. Both sides issuing final orders, for the conflict in the chance of getting a smaller advantage, each side becoming restless. Everyman becoming nervous, except Darius, he still stood there, unmoving, but ready to strike with hate filled rage. \r\n\r\nAs they both moved to the positions, it was time. But something was amiss.\r\n\r\nThe buzzer went off, and the ball was tossed into the air. A quick jump for the Demacian side, and the ball was in their possession, running with full might down the figurative battlefield of the court, blood pumping, the Demacian crowd cheering in the result of the toss up. As the Demacian team approached the ring for the Noxian side, hoping to get the first points of the game. The man with the ball, Thompson, confident in his ability, a rising star in the competition, one of the highest scorers in the team, sauntered closer to the opponents ring, thinking that the rumours weren&rsquo;t true, that no one like him could exist, that it must have been a story built over time, it was just simply not possible.\r\n\r\n As Thompson prepared for the shot, he froze, his breath caught in his throat. It felt like hatred had surrounded him, the man was walking towards him, his presence sparking an unknown fear into the young man. It was as if death itself had strolled into the room, looking for a target, and Thompson was the target. \r\n\r\nThe giant of a man loomed over young Thompson, &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;what are you&rdquo; he whimpered in fear before this symbol of destruction. There was no response, neither could there have been, he moved with unhuman like speed, and flew passed Thompson before he could move. \r\n\r\nlooking down at his hands, he realised he no longer had the ball, it was as if it never had been there. He turned to see the him, sprinting down the court, in a speed that was unnatural. Then he jumped, from the free throw line, from such a distance, where they trying to? No it was not possible. The crowd erupted as the ball demolished the net and everything else in front of it. The outcome of this game was inevitable. Thompson fell to his knees once the giant of a man loomed over him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;what am I? you know what I am, I am the Dunkmaster&rdquo;\r\n{{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-18T05:36:16.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the switch from battle to basketball","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-03-22T10:14:04.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
