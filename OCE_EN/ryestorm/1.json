The character design and personality seem to not fit into the whole league genre and feel. This just seems like a very strange addition to the game.\r\n\r\nThe whole visual and personality design is,just in my humble opinion. childish, stupid and sad. I am going to end up banning this champion every game, just to avoid looking at the design, I despise it that much.

Zac, Jinx. These characters however can be seen as a Biological weapon and a anarchist mass murder.\n\n Zoe for me is just a kid, the whole childish acting and design (I cannot stress how much I hate the champions design and aesthetics) just makes me cringe. I may not be of a large number of people that think this. But I know I am going to be tilted when this person is in the game, regardless of which team they are on.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-06T02:32:37.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League does have some very serious backstory and characters. But it also has champs like Lulu which have been around almost since the beginning.\n\nNot to mention the Star Guardian skin line is one of the most popular and they are not too far off the mark that Zoe is heading for visually.\n\nThere is plenty of straight up silliness too, Definitely not Blitzcrank, Corporate Mundo, etc,\neven Ivern is a thing, _(he's a giant talking silly tree made of cupcakes? Even if Zoe was dressed as a clown and only spoke in made up languages she woudn't be able to match his wackiness)_.\n\nEven Veigar is more comedic relief than actual dangerous wizard, despite being the strongest mage on Runeterra _(he's supposedly stronger than Syndra and Xerath, yet he's a little fluffy thing whose main concern in this world is his height.)_\n\nZoe might quite possibly have a tragic as fuck backstory _(all the Targonians thus far have dark pasts or sad stories)_, or she might have a sadistic twist in her kit _(Annie is just a bratty little kid... until she throws a giant blood-hungry demon bear at you)_\n\nI think partially what will make her interesting; is that she is just a kid! And thats the point, she's a kid who has stumbled onto the immense celestial power of an aspect of Targon, so she wields power almost on par with the god that created the stars, but shes a kid and has no use for it, so she uses it for pranks and fun. She's _supposed_ to be frustrating in that respect.  Champions like Syndra or Karthus who sacrificed everything and spent their lives accumulating power, will be getting blitzed by this little kid who doesn't even have to try.  Its part of her character to be frustrating, and thats what makes her interesting.\n\n_________\n\nBut of course it is an entirely personal thing, _(thats why they make champions so different, so theres something for everyone. So if sex offends you, you don't have to play Evelynn, or if you love cute cuddly things you can play Gnar etc.)_\n\nFor me, personally I couldn't stand to play a game where every single champion just says:\n\n_\"Kill them!\"_\n_\"Feel the darkness!\"_\n_\"Your soul belongs to me!\"_\n_\"I feed on death!\"_\n\nthats so overused it just become a cliche, and soooo many champs just say nothing but this stuff. Id much rather have the intelligent sass of Sol:\n\n_\"[Sigh] I Tried to like you...\"_\n_\"Of course I love Runeterra.. you have... buildings! and... more buildings?\"_\n_\"A Sun is unimaginable celestial power, and thrilled mortals use theirs to coordinate this.. 'lunch time'.\"_\n\nOr the soft-but-scary internal discussions of Kindred, to show not all 'reapers' need to be blood and darkness themed:\n\n_\"Shine once more, before the end.\"_\n_\"We know your name child, woven across countless almost-lives.\"_\n_\"**How old are we Lamb?** Older than those whose footsteps are long vanished. **Many years.** I remember them all.\"_\n\nand there are so many more interesting and unique personalities like Jhin or Rakan that just make playing more interesting _(for me at least)_.\nSo that why I'm a fan of new and fresh ideas like Zoe. \n\nHowever we know so little about her, its hard to make too many judgements this yearly.\nI hope you don't find her as annoying as you think you will.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-11-06T02:51:44.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand the whole lore side of league, I have read 98% of all champions law and know a fair amount of what is going on. From what I have seen in the teaser, they seem like a 5 year old that just runs around screaming for attention. The whole silliness of it really does frustrate me in the fact of when I am trying to concentrate that there is going to be a pest always there, Much like a Annie that spams taunt or a riven spamming laugh.\n\nAs you said there can be more language then just \n\"Die\"\nis completely understandable and I am behind you 100% in this aspect. \n\nThe champions design though bugs me immensely. It does not fit in with any of the other character designs at all, I assume that she is meant to be human, but ingame she looks closer to an anime character (and no I don't have anything against anime) than a person. You could argue the fact that she is not entirely, but I believe it is what the champion is meant to be close to human if not a human body. proportions are wrong, and just looks like a lizard person trying to blend into society.\n\nSpamming mastery after a kill is tilting, recently we have been able to mute this. But the thought of a little kid spamming these obnoxious things just makes my blood boil, (The whole little kid thing is referring to the champion and player btw) no one likes to die, but this is going to take it to another level of tilt. \n\nThe aesthetics are going to give me a headache every time. Thus the banning in every game. I believe there are some champion designs which are not amazing to look at, old Yorick, Dread Nova Darius (This skin was a huge disappointment) and old Galio. I just feel this is a step in the wrong direction in the case of designs for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-06T07:18:24.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her proportions look so weird because champions are designed to be looked at from a far-away, almost birdseye view. \n\nIf her tongue was proportionally correct, then when the player uses her taunt, they wouldn't see anything. \n\nThis goes for other champions as well :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-11-06T07:20:09.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides the proportions (which I can understand where you are coming from)\nI still find this champion strange and to flashy for a basic skin","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2017-11-08T10:50:01.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure you wouldnt be saying that after she drops rift herald from her w passive \n\nyes she can pick up rift herald from minion drops","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-06T01:08:26.486+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not \"Zoe......\"; you're saying it wrong.\n\nIt's \"Zoe ❤ ❤ ❤\" :D\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-11-06T01:52:35.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me try again\n\n\"Ahh my eyes are bleeding!\"\n\nDid I get it?","replies":[{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-06T05:10:15.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That made me laugh out loud for a solid minute","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-11-06T07:15:14.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha.\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2017-11-06T02:00:33.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you saying its a bit \"league of Disney legend\" or that if you want to play kingdom hearts 3, you would buy kingdom hearts 3 ?\nDon't fret when the hipster #Zoe skin drops we may open a fresh bag of Himalayan pink salt rocks.\n\nAlso crushing noobs on a rookie rift champ should be a bit of compo.\nWho will get the 1st live kill?","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-11-06T02:27:06.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-06T03:37:58.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can easily agree with the Design issue, because she really does look like she shouldn't be on the Rift, but the personality i can actually see being on the Rift, simply because a champion like Jinx already exists.\n\nThat being said, if this was the old lore, this champion wouldn't really ever fit.
