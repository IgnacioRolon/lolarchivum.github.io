Rocka a friend of mine on league told me to have he mentality of improving and not winning, I will take his word for it. So I&#039;m thinking of improving my csing skills.

Try aim for 80-90! Everyone says 100cs per 10 minutes but I find that to be incredibly difficult. Even LCS Pros dont get that much.
