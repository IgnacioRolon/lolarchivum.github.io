I&#039;ve been trying Mid and I think i did good but my friends always say I&#039;m bad even though i always stomp mid. Sometimes it makes me go on tilt but what if they&#039;re right?? If anyone is a Mid main please give me tips. I need to know the difference of Mechanics between Top and Mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-11-20T01:07:15.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tended to find that that best way to move into a new role is to use a champion that you're using to playing with or against in your current role as you're starting point. That way you're only focusing on changing the tactics of the lane, and not the champion mechanics at the same time.\n\nGood examples for this in Top/Mid that are currently decently popular in both roles might be Lulu, Yasuo, Vladimir and Ryze. There's plenty more options though, depending on your style. \n\nOn the actual tactic side of thing - in my experience the way you use a lead in Mid tends to be different to having a lead in Top. In general, a midlaner with a lead in lane is going to want to Roam more often, because they are able to impact the whole map much more effectively than in Top. \n\nIt could be possible that you aren't having as much impact on the game as you could if you're beating your lane, but not applying that lead around the map - which might be what your friends/teammmates mean.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaiyuso","date":"2015-11-20T01:24:46.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I recommend a player named \"Ajkla\", Diamond 3 Mid main, 100% winrate on all his games.

This can create an advantage for your team and yourself, racking up kills here and there. This tactic however, is primarily good only on assassins, since they have stuff like gap-closers. Mages like xerath and malzahar COULD do it, but the enemy would see them coming and just run away.","replies":[]}]}
