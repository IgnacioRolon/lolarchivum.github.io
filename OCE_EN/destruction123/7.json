Get used to the new items, masteries and objective priorities. Lanes snowball much harder now, with jungle having a greater impact on the game - a fed top lane can single-handedly take the top inhib. in the first 15 minutes (towers are paper, xp advantages are greater due to fewer TP summoners and new game coding.)\n\nYou can carry bronze games by yourself. Focus on your own mechanics and gameplay. Beat your counterpart and use the lead to snowball from there. Use your team's CC, high damage champions when you roam to heighten your chances of kills.\n\nBronze is pure solo q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2015-11-15T10:57:54.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.lol-coaching.com/\nIt's a website with coaches that will help you, most of them are free but there are a few that charge. It gives you their main role and champions, it has a built in messenger to talk to your coach before your session.

It's really good to analyse everything you do, because at our level there's so many things going wrong, which means we can often learn a lot. Use sites like:\n\nhttp://www.replay.gg/\nhttp://oce.op.gg/\nhttp://www.lolking.net/champions\n\nUse replay.gg to review your losses and see what went wrong. op.gg is great for seeing who's going to be a threat on the enemy team before the match starts, and lolking will help you see what champions are most effective ATM.\n\nAnalysis is the most important one so don't slack on it if you can. Also analysing pro-games can also be really good.\n\nLastly find some educational League youtubers and watch their streams/videos. Make sure it's actually educational, dunkey, keyori and uberdanger are not educational. You should be following people like gbay99, foxdrop, Redmercy and bjergsen.","replies":[{"poster":"DESTRUCTION123","date":"2015-11-15T07:36:26.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, i will certainly be sure to check those sites out.
