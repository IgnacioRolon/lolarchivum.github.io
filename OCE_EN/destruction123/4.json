What I found were some of the best ways to deal with this and to get better and back to winning are as follows:\n\nEvaluate. Evaluate your recent games and see what went wrong. Was it your teams fault? Or was it really faults in your own play that contributed to your loss. If you can look back at your games (even if you don't record them but can recall what happened in your head) and think of situations that could have gone better e.g. positioning in a team fight then you're on your way to getting better. Look at where you made mistakes and work on minimising the chances of making the same mistakes in the future.\n\nTake time out of ranked. What comes hand in hand with a  severe loss streak is a loss of enjoyment of the game. Take time out from solo queue and play normals with friends or other game modes that you might find enjoyable e.g. ARAM, Hide n Seek etc. Get that excitement back into the game. You will play better if you have a positive mindset for the game rather than a negative mindset a loss streak might give you. You don't want to queue up for solo queue thinking \"here comes another loss\". You want to go in thinking \"alright, let's break this loss streak and win\".\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGood luck,\nGunGale [@DW_GunGale](http://www.twitter.com/dw_gungale)","replies":[{"poster":"Rcade Circles","date":"2016-01-09T18:52:24.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cebs reading","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-31T00:56:14.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"** Evaluate your recent games and see what went wrong**\n\ni got in the rank que.\n\n**\"alright, let's break this loss streak and win\".**\n\ntheres some games (most of my recents) were im like this at the start but by 15 minutes im like yeah i should just give up.what usually happens is i sustain top , get some kills and a tower, abandon top to go help not realising how farmed/fed the mid/jungler/adc is and get rekt.theres some games were this train of thought just cant help.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-05T13:47:06.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have the choice to either, snowball a fed lane and offer a little help to losing lanes, and have atleast 1 fed person, or help the losing lane and risk every lane losing and then losing the game because everyone on your team is behind like hell.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-05T14:39:23.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"choose\"\n\ntis like gambling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-05T13:45:42.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my problem? when i try to take time off ranked after a bad game in norms, i like to do a \"what the hell, yolo it\" game, then they get all pissy because it isnt a meta build.
