Narrow down your champ pool and have that one champ you know like the back of your hand and their limits. Zed is quite frequently banned so I'd almost forge about him for ranked and keep him for normals.\n\nThis season for ranked you only really need to know 2 roles so pick the 2 you're most comfortable with and forget the rest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-06T08:58:59.050+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you have two champions at least for each role, that's great don't pay attention to the other guy.\nYour champion pool is fine.\n\nTry watching these, It could help.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n\nPeople are in a similar position as you.","replies":[{"poster":"DESTRUCTION123","date":"2016-07-06T09:15:37.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yasei Doubutsu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tkXYYRVI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-07-06T08:58:59.050+0000)\n>\n> you have two champions at least for each role, that&#x27;s great don&#x27;t pay attention to the other guy.\n> Your champion pool is fine.\n> \n> Try watching these, It could help.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&amp;list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n> \n> People are in a similar position as you.\n\nThanks man, i really appreciate it.. btw I've known ur youtube channel for over 3 months now.

First you should learn the game properly rather than trying to play champions that require knowledge and mechanics because if u had either of them you wouldn't be bronze. I suggest Annie for mid considering she is simple, easy to cs with and has good damage, playing her will allow you to learn the game rather than needing good mechanics aswell. \n\nIf you want to clarify anything or ask for more specific help feel free to add me\nIGN: CushCush","replies":[]}]}
