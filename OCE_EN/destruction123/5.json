This person has started LoL this season and he managed to finish his provisionals just a week before preseason. He was placed in Bronze 2 but then when i checked his account about 5-7 days later he was Silver 5!! Now he is Silver 3!! I cant believe a person with that much inexperience ( and no he isn&#039;t a smurf, i know him in person). Can someone explain to me why some people which such inexperience can climb the ladder with ease. and to be honest I&#039;m not a good climber","replies":[{"poster":"ScrubCloud","date":"2015-11-24T22:25:07.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's probably a fast learner who can take on the game easily or has experience from other mobas,  e.g Me, I've played dota ands smite for years and i switched to league, I'm gold 5 now and my friend who's played for 3 years is still bronze","replies":[{"poster":"DESTRUCTION123","date":"2015-11-25T22:10:00.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ScrubCloud,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=FwNtALP5,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-24T22:25:07.649+0000)\n>\n> He's probably a fast learner who can take on the game easily or has experience from other mobas,  e.g Me, I've played dota ands smite for years and i switched to league, I'm gold 5 now and my friend who's played for 3 years is still bronze\n\nYeah hes probably just good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-11-25T00:05:48.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He might just be better than you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-11-24T17:34:14.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe he got lucky in ranked, maybe he played passive in all those games and didnt feed, chance of winning is higher if you dont feed ^.>{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nSome games you don't have to make any fancy plays all you have to do is farm and do your role in a teamfight/split","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-24T11:21:59.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know this is gonna seem completely crazy and absolutely absurd.
