That was the catalyst to a series of &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot; and the game lagging like crazy for the remainder of the games duration. I&#039;ve seen a few people who have also posted a thread with this issue and was wondering what to do / will anything be done because it was just a waste of a game and lp down the drain. Anyone else experienced this last night? (27th of Feb)","replies":[{"poster":"Voltan","date":"2016-02-29T00:47:16.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I appreciate it!
