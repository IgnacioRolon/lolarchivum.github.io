However he has a massive tendency to be kited and cced, which means he can't jump on his target to deal  any damage. You can also itemize against him depending on his build, mortal reminder can shut him down if he is going lifesteal, or a giant slayer if he has too much health. He also has a weak early game and can't gank as much especially when going devourer. I hope this helped and you have less trouble with Xin Zhao.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-11T03:34:37.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin is not op in higher lv of play high gold up {{champion:5}}  gets destroyed by teams with lots of cc, Like jg {{champion:32}} sup {{champion:53}} and that is only 2 champs wen they chane cc him he gets rekt, The biggest problem is that lower elo players don't chane cc but instead just blow it on the adc even if adc is 0/20/0 they still see them as a big threat, Wen they should be giving great protection for the adc and mid making sure that you the cc is in-between there damage and yours, If you wont a good champ that is op go vs a plat {{champion:76}}","replies":[]}]}
