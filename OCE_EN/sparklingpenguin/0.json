REALLY? HUMAN BOTS?\r\n It ruins every single game in ARAM now, \r\nWe cannot leave the game because there will be punishments,\r\nstaying in the game is either killing bots for 30 mins with a meaningless win getting 46 IP,\r\nor,\r\nGetting killed in many many 2v5, 3v5, 1v3, etc. situations, spend another 30 mins for a guarantee lost and end up only getting 56 IP.\r\n\r\nThis is ef&#039;ed up and PLEASE ROIT.\r\nDO SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI AM, AND I BELIEVE MANY OF OTHERS HAVE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION ARE,  DISAPPOINTED.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-21T21:45:34.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SparklingPenguin,\n\n\nAs this is a discussion pertaining to one of the Player Behavior & Reform systems [3rd Party Applications; Botting] in League of Legends, the best place for this discussion would be the [**Player Behavior & Moderation**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) sub-boards.
