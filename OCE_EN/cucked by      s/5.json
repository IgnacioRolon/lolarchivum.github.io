Like seriously, he builds a protobelt and a triforce and with the help of his overloaded kit he can just carry? Sure, Lucian was fed. He was 4/3 earlier but because of Ekko&#039;s less than difficult to setup W, he managed to regain a lead. Please tell me what counterplay there is to a champion who can zip in and out of the backline, with a passive that increases his movement speed whilst slowing the movement speed of others. We had a good chance of winning but not when he can just jump on me in the backline to beat me to death and then just ult out and be A-OK.\r\n\r\nSo yes, I will repeat myself. a). What counterplay is there to this stupid champ? b). When will Riot nerf him to the ground? His base stats are still way too high even after previous nerfs.","replies":[]}
