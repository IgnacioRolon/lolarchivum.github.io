Ive recently received a chat restriction within the past week for something that I dont necessarily agree on. Regardless, Im not here to despute it. What I am here to ask is whether Im eligible for seasonal platinum rewards. The FAQ claims that Im only inelligible if I have an ongoing chat restriction during the end of season. Its going to be very sad if I cant get them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-10-05T21:15:06.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as you haven't had any type of ban since August the 7th and your chat restriction is not active when the season ends (november 7th), you will be eligible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-10-05T12:41:31.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be as long as you have no ongoing restrictions, but it could always change. My thought would be that if you cannot receive hextech loot you might not be able to get season rewards.","replies":[]}]}
