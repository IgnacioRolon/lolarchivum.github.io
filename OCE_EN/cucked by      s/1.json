I queue for ranked, and I get two people who d/c at 10minutes in and we lose the match within 15 minutes. I lose LP for my team being foolish. Riot, can you not fix this? I can think of a simple solution, if you have an afk on your team, don't lose any LP. Let the enemy team get LP but not let us lose some. Why should we have to suffer when our team leave? I mean, it's bad enough here in the OCE server we don't even have a tribunal, but this is a problem with a simple fix. I've been demoted due to things like this before and it's really dumb. \r\n\r\nYour thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-16T11:07:34.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then people will leave instantly the moment they have a snippet of them thinking they're going to lose, and that would result in a very unfun game to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SenpaiDragonDave","date":"2015-03-15T07:59:34.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree 100%.","replies":[]}]}
