You saw the backlash, the rage, spam, fights, hate that you got for boards and closing GD.\r\n\r\nYou saw your company split its *own community* into three pieces, one part straight up leaving, one part using Boards (aka GDdit) and the last choosing to literally make their own new, reddit-cancer and \"nazi murderation\" free GD environment, which I might add *a Rioter has actually chosen to join over GDdit now*.\r\n\r\nNAGD was old. Older not in time but in spirit, if that makes sense. It had history, over 70,000 pages of threads on GD alone, the history shaped and molded it into what it was, and with it created its own unique community.\r\n\r\nLook at OCE, we don't even have 1300 pages of threads yet. Sure we've had some memorable moments and posters, some examples being \"#JSME left\", Molendo never reaching Gold, and the Jaguar situation, though that was mostly confined to a few Skype calls. But we're still so young, and so small.\r\n\r\nOur own few Rioters are well known and well liked by most, popping into every other thread asking for help and chipping in. We like you. I assume you guys like us. We even met a few of you at PAX, or the KBBQ beforehand. You're more than just \"the staff\" to us, you're our mates. \r\n\r\nIf we're forced to move to Boards, a lot of this will probably vanish. It's up to you, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-11-19T12:18:43.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate the colours but honestly, everyone's going to get used to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-11-19T06:14:14.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they won't listen to us\n\nwatch, in a few days/weeks\n\n\n\n\nits done","replies":[]}]}
