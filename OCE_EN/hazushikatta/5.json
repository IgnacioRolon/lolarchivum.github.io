Twice in a row just now I got kicked out of Ranked champion select (dodge timers included.), once because I made the horrible mistake of trying to change my ward skin (how very dare I!) which caused the client to, well, just see for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRFMSJlv7Qk\n\nAnd again straight after that champ select it happened again, this time I didn&#039;t even ----ing click anything\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo0fg8DsCY4\n\nI&#039;m going to go out on a limb and say this is because for some ridiculously stupid reason the client still uses Adobe Air in 2015 when making a new client would not be any semblance of difficult, in fact I remember a guy making a working prototype of a new client a few years ago, who got asked by Riot to stop. His name was blue something I think? Edit: Snowl, it was Snowl. I don't know where I got blue from.","replies":[]}
