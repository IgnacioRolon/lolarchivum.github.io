The very beginning of his game was his second favourite part of it - the first of course being the thundering cheers that always followed the end. Today&#039;s plaything was already in the center of the arena, secured for the moment by thick ropes connecting his wrists and ankles a large iron ring set into the ground. He couldn&#039;t have been more than fifteen, as Draven approached he cowered as much as he possibly could, tugging at the bindings around his limbs in vain. &quot;Please sir, &#039;minnocent! I&#039;ll be damned if that ain&#039;t the truest thing I ever did say!&quot;\r\n&quot;Truest, huh? Well kid, since you&#039;re here, you must not be innocent,&quot; Draven raised his axe and started spinning it, slowly at first but quickly picking up speed, much to the exuberance of the crowd, &quot;So it looks like you&#039;re damned!&quot; the prisoner recoiled and clenched his eyes shut in a vain, instinctual hope that his captor might simply disappear, but though he heard the wind rush around him as Draven threw his axe, he felt nothing but a release in tension in his limbs. He opened his eyes to see Draven jump up and catch his weapon, having bounced it off of the ring as he cut the boy loose, and felt the ground beneath his feet trembling from the excitement of the spectators. \r\n&quot;Opponent&quot;, the officials liked to call Draven&#039;s prisoners. Of course, none of them had ever survived, or even really fought back. The boy shakily stood up, and Draven stopped spinning the axe, leaning on it. He nodded towards the prisoner, and a grin full of bloodlust crept along his face. &quot;Run, boy.&quot; He didn&#039;t need much more encouragement, the prisoner spotted an exit along the walls and started sprinting towards it as fast as he could - though he failed to take into account his surroundings, and immediately tripped on the iron ring he had just been released from, landing face down in the dirt.\r\n&quot;Lies around like a dead man already, it&#039;s like he doesn&#039;t want you to have a show!&quot; Draven roared as the crowd picked up in volume. He threw his axe directly at the prisoner, aiming at the left shoulderblade. As he released it though, he felt something - as if he&#039;d slipped, and the axe landed harmlessly on the ground and started to dissolve.\r\nWithin himself, Draven felt something he hadn&#039;t felt in a long time. He looked around, the crowd had vanished. He was on his knees, the stadium decrepit and abandoned, dust swirling past him in the afternoon sun. He looked up, the prisoner was on his feet. Had he looked like this before? He was wearing fine dark blue robes, his face hidden by a heavy hood, his posture haughty and proud. The figure was staring down at Draven, who for the first time in many, many years, was filled with fear.\r\n\r\n&quot;How does it feel, exposing your mind?&quot;","replies":[]}
