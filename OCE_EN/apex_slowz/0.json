The reason free to play exists is to let players try out new champions before buying them. There is no rule stating that players cannot perform bad at a certain champion. This is just the way free to play was intended to be used. To let players experience champions they don't own. And normals is a very different experience than ranked in terms of gameplay. \n\nThen if the player likes the champion, they will play it until it goes off free to play, so effectively Riot forces them to buy the champion even though they are technically giving away free stuff. It's a pretty smart system, so bringing it to the larger percentage of the community that only plays ranked is simply how it should've been in the first place.\n\nObviously, since I don't work for Riot I can't answer this perfectly, but it's pretty simple and I imagine they would tell you something along the lines of this.","replies":[]}]}
