I don't know but like something like kick this player or something ( I don't know what to say)\nThen after the game finishes it will not count as a loss but it also won't give you any rewards but the other team still gets the rewards you think this is good.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \nSoz  I just realised this post made no sense","replies":[]}]}
