Warwick is good because he's got 2 forms of in built sustain for jungle routes. Elise can use her spiderlings to tank out the increased damage the camps put out. Nautilus is an okay pick, naturally tanky and reasonable clear times.\n\nIt's just a matter of learning and adapting. My tip to you, *make use of the smite bonuses from camps*. If you start at blue camp, take Gromp first, but lead with your smite so you get the poison armour. This helps take down Gromp quicker and assists in taking down your blue, plus your smite is up a little sooner seeing as you started the camp with it. I know it's harder with limited runes and masteries, but it can be done.\n\nYou gotta remember, the enemy jungler will most likely be having a similarly hard time. If you have to recall after 2-3 camps, do it. The enemy jungler is likely doing the same thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-27T05:45:34.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungling isn't supposed to be easy. thats the point. You don't have a lane opponent to deal with other then sometimes people counter-jungling, so it was basically free gold and xp. making it harder is making you earn what laners have to fight for all the time.\n\nSome champs can jungle without runes or masteries. Warwick, Xin Zhao, Nunu, Elise and Zac can all jungle pretty well without much help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-27T06:26:32.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because its better for lower level players to learn how to play the game first.
