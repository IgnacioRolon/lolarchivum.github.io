For future reference, it only takes 1 report to trigger a review of one's chat. I'll come back to this point.\n\nThe rest of the chat is mostly involved with arguing and insulting Draven, calling him noob, delusional, toxic, flaming, and pointing to his score. There were many points where you could have just muted Draven and moved on, but it frankly did not appear that you tried to defuse the situation at all.\n\nIf you had a prior 2-week ban, then the permanent ban was the next step. \n\n>Draven's duo partner, Kai' Sa, and himself, along with the Amumu, proceed to report me after the game, although I had done completely nothing wrong. \n\nThere's no way of knowing who reported you in this game. And again, it only takes 1 report.\n\nFeel free to submit a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you disagree with me, as Rioters will be able to look at this punishment, as well as your history of punishments to determine whether or not you should remain permabanned.","replies":[{"poster":"In Your Mom","date":"2018-04-01T07:00:46.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I called for reports on Draven was because he was intentionally feeding.\n\nI didn't swear a single time during this game.

In this game, I did nothing like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-01T18:03:34.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The reason I called for reports on Draven was because he was intentionally feeding.\n\nIt only takes 1 report to flag a player's actions/chat for review, so calling for reports is meaningless, and it can be considered harassment.\n\nIt's good that you've improved your behavior. It is a bit strange to have still not reformed your account over 6 months. However, your account only improves with playing good clean games, and is not solely based on how much time has gone by since your last punishment. Looking at your match history, you've played sparingly between now and October.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-04-01T07:28:17.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, change your name, so you can be taken seriously...
