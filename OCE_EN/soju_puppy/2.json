It seems to be affecting quite a few things online for the affected people, and we've raised a ticket with them.  In the meantime the Riot team are doing what we can to route around the issue (aka - using other ISPs).  Unfortunately not all Australian ISPs have multiple routes available, meaning that for some players we have to wait for the backbone ISP to fix their path.\n\nI'll update here when we know more.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twop","date":"2018-10-10T03:20:16.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried to do a trace route but don't have admin privileges in the gaming cafe to run it.
