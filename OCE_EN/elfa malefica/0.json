The seeding will be based on your current MMR in relation to the MMR of everyone on that server, so you could end up in a different Tier or Division compared to the League you were in on your original server.\n\nHonor Rank should be reassigned based on the amount of honor you received compared to the local community.\nRiot FAQs don&#039;t say much about it.\nLosing honor completely and starting from 0 when you are almost level 4, with the way it&#039;s designed now, means that summoners transfering won&#039;t make it to the top even if they had a good behaviour throughout the season, just cause they had to restart from scratch.\n\nDoes anybody know what happens exactly? Do you get reset to 0 or maybe just 1 level behind like for the start of the season?\n\n***EDIT:\ni just thought of something else. i recently got a pbe account so i can play from euw with my oce friends with less lag.\none of the requirements to have it is to be at least lvl 3 honor. once i transfer and my honor gets reset to 2, will i still be able to access pbe? if not that would be unfair as well...","replies":[{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2018-05-31T21:42:02.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump cause of edit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-29T09:39:03.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, you haven't transferred you are just speculating what happens to your honour when you do?

Honour 0 is only achievable if you are punished.

Ranks between regions differ wildly, and so do cultures and attitudes. There are more than a few things that will see you punished on NA but have little or no consequence on OCE. Simply put, the culture, attitudes, and things we deem honourable (or dishonourable) vary significantly between region, same as the rank distribution does.\n\nWhile I don't see any particular harm in transferring honour level (though I wouldn't be surprised if there is also a technical element to it not transferring) I also understand why it's a thing. Honour is ultimately a community driven affair, so Honour that applies to one community may only apply in part or not at all to another. A full reset does seem a little harsh I'll admit, but there might also be more to it that we're missing.","replies":[{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2018-05-29T13:00:06.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was my point exactly... i understand you are moving to a different community, but resetting it completely seems too much, should be \"rebalanced\" to the new environment like the league rank","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elfa Malefica","date":"2018-05-29T09:43:56.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't transferred yet just cause transfers were disabled the day before I moved, I have been waiting to do it, I even sent a ticket but I have to wait the 2nd of June (hopefully they'll restore them on time, knowing the whole team is busy fixing Clash...)","replies":[]}]}]}
