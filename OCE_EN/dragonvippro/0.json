I was loading in the match and i got discconnect. When i rejoin it is 13 min already and my team is losing. I try to farm in JG as {{champion:59}} . The game passed 30 min and i finally catchup the other team. When the match finish ( my team lost :p ) i was been ban for 5 match and each are 20 min. I think Riot should rework the bann system cause some people got dissconnect or the game got error ( BUT RELISTIC THEY NOT LEAVING THE GODDAM GAME). When they rejoin they can still help the teammates by farmming. I hope Riot can re-do the system ban like when people join back and play for more than 10 min, they wont have ban. If not then what&#039;s the point of staying in that game anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-09T09:32:48.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've been hit with a 20 minute LeaverBuster, this isn't your first rodeo. \n\nI think everyone can agree that occasional disconnects or afks shouldn't be punished beyond the penalties of losing the game. Shit happens, life throws you a curveball, your ISP picks now to mess with you, your computer has an emotional breakdown and just won't let you in game. We all get it, but that's *occasional* leaves.\n\nThere are valid reasons to leave games, but when those reasons become so prevalent they're practically predictable, you have to consider the effect your actions are having on other players. If you are struggling to commit to full games consistently enough to be hit by LeaverBuster, you need to be considering how to mitigate whatever the cause is.\n\nAt a point, Riot have to consider the effect your leaves have on other players, and can no longer offer you the \"sometimes leaves just happen\" protection.","replies":[]}]}
