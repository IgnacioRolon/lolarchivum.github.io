Specifically, there's an opinion of \"lootboxes that impede gameplay and/or game progress are wrong\".\n\nSo we have the Belgian Gaming Commission (which I'll just call the BGC) who want to ban *all* lootboxes in games, whether they impede game progress (for example, LoL) , create a pay-to-win environment (for example, Battlefront 2) or are based around purely aesthetic virtual items (for example, Overwatch). On the other hand, the Victorian Gambling Authority (VGA) are focused only on those systems that impede game progress (LoL) or create a pay-to-win environment (Battlefront 2).\n\nPersonally, I think the VGA has the better idea here. There are a lot of games that rely on aesthetic-based lootbox systems to make their profits, and it works well as a way to create an enjoyable free-to-play/win platform for a game. That said, I do think the BGC has a point, in the sense that such lootbox systems should have some kind of clarity surrounding them, such as making it clear to the players what chance they have of getting a specific item from a specific kind of lootbox.\n\nHonestly, I'm kind of hoping that Riot will come out with some kind of statement soon on how they plan to move forward now that the whole \"lootboxes are gambling\" issues has come, well, \"out of the box\", and give the players an idea of what they can expect to change in order for Riot to conform with not only the Gamer's opinions on the whole \"lootbox\" issue, but now also how various governing bodies are looking upon the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-23T20:32:37.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but its still predatory to link cosmetics to rng boxes. the whole premise behind it is
