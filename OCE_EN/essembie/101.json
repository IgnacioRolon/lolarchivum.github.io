I know it's meant to punish people but it seems little to no effort was put into the actual buster itself. it's kinda like Riot is just saying you get a buster here are your choices: A) wait half an hour before you play every single one of your matches for eternity, or B) Leave league of legends and never return.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-22T22:57:38.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think leaverbuster is an important system, dont get me wrong.\n\nBut I also feel like these DC issues make me the dolphin in the tuna net.
