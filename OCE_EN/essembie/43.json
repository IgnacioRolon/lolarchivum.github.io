She can be zoned easily but remember that her W gives two shields, once on cast and once again when all three balls explode which stacks with the original shield and refreshes duration, this can make her extremely difficult to kill early game, considering you can usually detonate all balls if you E and opponent on to you. Having your W up for an unexpected gank/fight is crucial to her survivability, you should only W for wave clear if you absolutely have to, you know where the enemy jungle is and your Lane opponent's gap closers are either down, or they are out of lane.\n\nHer post 6 kill combo is like this (usually have to poke down to about 75% HP and have atleast a blasting wand, i usually build abyssal scepter vs AP mids first) auto attack minion twice to proc passive, throw out Q (if you dont land do not carry on with combo just start again) R on to them, Auto attack with passive proc, W to mitigate any initial damage, as your opponent runs use E and pop the rest of your balls, Ignite, then at this point you can either R on to them or wait for Q to come back up and Q R R. this whole process should take about 2.5 secconds so you need to practice and have fast fingers.\n\nAdd me in game if you want to practice diana together.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-26T03:17:31.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that.

Diana excels into squishy comps without hard CC and loves melee matchups the most.\n I usually take MPen reds, mana regen yellows, scaling AP blues and flat AP quints. With DRing start this gives you a lot of mana regen to farm with Q, and enough damage for it to hurt the enemy mid laner while the scaling blues add a lot to her late game but flat AP blues do give her better damage early if you think you can get a kill pre 6. If I know im going to take a lot of poke then I swap yellows and blues for flat resistances as combined with w she has a lot of staying power. \nQ or W first depending matchup then the other, E lvl 3 or 5 depending if you want to go for en early kill or if vs a Yas as u can interrupt his dash with it, max Q first, always take R when u can. \nIdeal combo is to Q them and stack passive then R just before the mark expires, E W aa Q R R.\nIf you can get the enemy to take agro a lot, Annie aa you within agro range etc, and poke effectively with q then you might be able to go for a lvl 3 or 4 surprise kill with flash ignite E W aa Q IF you have stacked your passive on minions. This is one of my fave ways to get ahead with Akali and Diana and works well if they have pushed the wave and you have just seen the enemy jungler elsewhere. So learning to manage the creep wave just outside your turret range will pay off big time.\nYou need to know when you can burst more effectively or when you have to duel. Her passive is where she gets a huge amount of damage so Nashors is almost always a good item for the CDR, AP, Att speed and its passive, but its not always good to rush and sometimes a lichbane is better like vs {{champion:7}}  as you often wont get to hit her very much before she dashes away and {{champion:105}} with her cheesy combo. Abyssal scepter is fantastic as most of your damage will be done within its passive range and if you have an AP top, jungle or support it will help lots in team fights, I almost always rush this item first unless im vs an AD mid. Rylais is a decent item for a bit of tank and the slow, usually better then ROA as building ROA early slows you power spike too much for mid, it works for top OK but only really if you need the sustain and your team doesn't need help early. Raba is a fantastic item for Diana as she scales so freaking well with AP, if snowballing and roaming this will usually be my 4th item. Abyss/Zon, Nashors/Lich, sorc boots, Raba/Void, Void/Raba. then any of GA/Banshees/Ludens/Rylais, before swapping sorc boots for mercs or CDR. Ludens is decent for the AP and move speed and the proc, can help dodge skill shots, catch enemies and clear waves if you need to split push which Diana can do very well with her passive, then use QR to escape over walls, also good to escape to wraiths when ganked. I find its often better to ward the dot bush to protect against ganks as a lot of junglers will aim to get behind you and this will protect you from most lapping ganks as well as side ganks if you watch your map and if you have a good sup who watches and pings like they should, beware Lee and Reksai wallhops. \nLooking at your record I see a lot of games vs AD without building a seekers or finishing zon which I would say is a big mistake and I dont think I saw Abyssal which I believe is core vs AP mids. Sorc boots early are stronger than CDR imo. Feel free to hit me up for a chat about items, build order and matchups if you want.\nThe moon will rise, the night will last forever!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-28T12:30:36.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the tips dude!","replies":[]}]}]}
