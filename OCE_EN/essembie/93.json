Are more smurfs hitting ranked to make a start on end of season rewards? Am I in the goldilocks MMR zone where players new to ranked get put?

I think it's just cause more of the experienced and dedicated player base has focused on increasing rank recently leading to a surge of more serious players and also I feel I've been tilted for some reason too so that might be part of it for you too.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-22T05:46:15.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so I just entered ranked did my promos and got into silver 3 and I'm not falling because I keep getting carried even though I'm bronze, only been playing for 7 months garbage and yeah I feel it's because of people like me that it's harder to climb because of all these new players like me feeding and not being useful in the slightest. I went 0/6/13 in one of my worst games as a janna ever fml I'm garbage. Silver is definitely the goldilocks zone of new only been playing for a few months and barely hit lvl30 garbage in ranked atm.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hide On Earth","date":"2016-09-22T04:47:48.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is cuz of new year ranked rewards or something, but the amount of smurfs right now has lowered and can again smash others in game~ so gotta start climbing again back to where i belong to high bronze from bronze 5 lelel. tbh right now im a little scared to play although most games im having right now are very easy to win maybe cuz it is b5. i get titled so easily now~ scared to play more than 2 or 3 games per day~ before i could easily play 5-6 games and win at least 4 of it, but now i play like 2 games a day and think what if next game i face smurf and fk me up so lets not test my luck and have a rest from it now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-09-20T22:52:26.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and i had a first time veigar mid on my team in my promos last night.
