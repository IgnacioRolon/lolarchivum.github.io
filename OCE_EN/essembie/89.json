But you can still embed images directly through links (i.e. imgur)\n\n> Hey guys\n> \n> From the day we launched the new boards to where we are now, we’ve put a tremendous effort into the stability and safety of the forums. Mostly, improvements in this area go unnoticed (like…the forums not crashing), but every now and then we have to make changes that are a bit more visible. While having many positive applications, uploading files to the boards is sadly also one of our biggest security vulnerabilities, which is why we’re going to remove that option. We’ve tried alternate solutions like limiting attachments to some forums, restricting file types etc but the net result is still the same; it puts our platform at risk.\n> \n> Obviously, you’ll still be able to post images, link to files which are hosted elsewhere etc, all we’re disabling is uploading files to the platform. Nothing apart from uploading a specific file is affected.\n> \n> Thanks for your understanding!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-11-15T03:37:55.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the reply.
