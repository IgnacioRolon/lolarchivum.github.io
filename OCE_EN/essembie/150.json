What about builds - will you change? I&#039;ve been looking at throwing liandry&#039;s into the mix which I never used to do.\r\n\r\n{{champion:101}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:101}}","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-05-11T11:30:07.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No doubt about it - there is a much longer lag between Rs now.
