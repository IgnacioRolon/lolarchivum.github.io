Wolfe replied with a detailed email ... stating;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Your research and suppositions on the matter are correct; what occurs with &ldquo;loot boxes&rdquo; does constitute gambling by the definition of the Victorian Legislation. Unfortunately where the complexity arises is in jurisdiction and our powers to investigate. Legislation has not moved as quick as the technology; at both State and Federal level we are not necessarily equipped to determine the legality of these practices in lieu of the fact the entities responsible are overseas.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-22T21:16:16.676+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is its worse than just \"gambling\". generally when gambling you are given odds on your money and generally you can do some maths to know percentages even in sports. so unless there is some kind of match fixing taking place or a machine is tampered with, it is \"fair\". it is \"real\".\n\nwith riot and most other gaming companies, absolutely no odds or percentages are given, there is no real math behind it either. riot can literally rig the boxes and chop and change the numbers whenever they want. no doubt your spending habits are being taken into account (don't you think its 'strange\" that early on people get \"good\" skins). they could even make some accounts be \"luckier\" than others (cough pearl abyss' black desert online cough). . and it is perfectly legal for them to do so at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-22T21:20:32.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">or a machine is tampered with\n\nWhich their are laws against if you get caught doing shit like this, and a lot of machines that are possible to tamper with are checked daily.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-22T22:11:04.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and when they ban Loot boxes from OCE and not the rest of the world instead of saying \"ha got you Riot\" people will simply be whinging they can get get loot boxes...","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-22T22:21:53.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6YEQshwP,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-22T22:11:04.716+0000)\n>\n> and when they ban Loot boxes from OCE and not the rest of the world instead of saying &quot;ha got you Riot&quot;
