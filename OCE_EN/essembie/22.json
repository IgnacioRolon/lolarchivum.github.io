If your top half, ward raptors. If you are bot side ward raptors. Place the ward as close to the wall as possible. Then green/trinket ward the river bush.\n\nHug that side of the map, you will see shaco coming through the river even if he is invis as the pink ward invis radius is longer than it's vision radius. If he comes up the path you see him anyway.\n\nStops pretty much any invis hero. Same trick works on any walls. Pink on one side of the wall, green on the other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-04T02:11:39.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pink Pink MORE PINKS!

If you're playing a champion with decent burst, theres a good chance you can just kill him if he tries to gank you, especially if hes on less than full hp, so try to be on the lookout for that.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-03T22:22:02.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"q,pop ult, auto, you burst the wrong shaco, dead.","replies":[]}]}]}
