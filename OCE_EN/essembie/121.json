And people going 5 morellonomicon 1 deathcap Karthus with 100% cdr, hitting you with a 1128 magic damage requiem every 1s. Also people with 6 zhonias or 6 guardian angel being near impossible to kill. Or maybe going 6 cinderhulk jungle items on alistair and being a literal supernova doing 258 magic damage per second to every enemy near them, but also having over 9200hp and so take ghost and flash and just literally run at people and there is literally nothing you can do to kill him outside of the karthus thing I mentioned. Or 6 thornmail rammus killing anyone the moment they try to touch him. Or the cancer of an 100% cdr zilean who can ult anyone and literally everyone in a teamfight and throw out so many bombs he doesn't even need rewind. Or an eveylnn who has been proven to be broken in urf, hitting you with her 100% cdr combo and procing lichbane like 4 times whilst you can't kill her because she fired her ult of 14 times and so she has near perfect damage reduction.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-17T05:30:32.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be awesome eh!","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-17T22:25:35.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would truly be amazing","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-14T03:46:21.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh god 6 seraphs ryze.\n\nOH God 6 muramana lucian.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-14T04:20:19.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6 ie tryn","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-16T21:54:25.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6 Guinsoo's shyvana\n\nAuto 6 times to get stacks up and every q will instantly reset the entire cooldown of itself while applying on hit effects 8 times.\n\nitd be like urf guinsoos shyvana (where you have infinite attack speed because your q resets instantly so your auto attack speed = how 1/fast you press the button+ping*2 so in my case last urf with 30ms ping and a macro to spam q my attack speed was 66.7, i soloed baron at 20 minutes with just a hextech gunblade and guinsoo's)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
