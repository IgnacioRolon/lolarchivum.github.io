The fttn \"solution\" which Tony said would save us all from drunken sailor Labor spending has turned out to be on par in terms of cost to fttp.  Tony told us a lie because he needed an attack strategy to gain powerand he also needed to shore up the foxtel monopoly for Rupert and this \"infrastructure prime minister\" crippled probably the most important piece of infrastructure this century.\n\nAll industry commentators and experts in the field all warned that fttn was a Trojan horse - a \"gift\" to win a war . All modelling to sell fttn - a decade old technology which other countries are turning their back on - ignored the most basic aspects of copper remediation on a 100 year old dilapidated network.  And bugger me now that nbn has gone to fttn the costs have blown out, just like experts warned.\n\nTo be a contender in the information race, Labor wanted to spend $40k on a 2015 impreza with a top speed of 250k/h and Tony sold us a 1993 civic for $20k with a top speed of 60k/h because they said no car needs to do more than 60 in a residential area (ignoring motorways and autobahns), but forgot to mention it needed a new gearbox, a new engine, and new exhaust which would add up to $15k. \n\nWe've been given 25%of the speed of fttp for only 90% of the price. \n\nAnd no we don't live in a communist country. We live in an oligarchy disguised as a democracy.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-17T06:08:36.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i am not disagreeing with you in the slightest, we all know democracy doesn't work. Yeah i am one of the lucky buggers who has FTTH installed and i have the fastest artificially shaped speed available, 100Mbps/40Mbps, My ping is usually 27-29 without an issue at all. However, before this i was just like you, Shocking ping, lag, dropping connection etc. Get a tech out, still no help as the cables connected to my home were about 70 years old. that will not deliver a good speed and regardless of your ISP the potential service will be poor because of our out dated internet services. Also, FTTN, complete waste of time and money. Why bother with all that beautiful fibre when you will just install copper connecting to the home. Again, A complete waste of time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-17T04:38:41.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and ironically it wasn't tpgs issue.
