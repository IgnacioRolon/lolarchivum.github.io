Today we've got a third body to add to the list: the Australian Communications Media Authority (ACMA). ACMA is the independent federal body that regulates and oversees advertising on the internet, radio, and broadcast TV in Australia.","url":"https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/11/australias-telco-regulator-is-keeping-an-eye-on-loot-boxes-too/","image":"https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2017/11/shadow-of-war-loot-boxes-410x231.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The ACMA have joined the loot box scrutiny party too.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-05T00:36:05.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-esa-is-fighting-against-loot-box-labelling-and-gaming-addiction-risks.13961/\n\n> The World Health Organization announced it would add gaming addition to a list of other things that can become addictive, under the generalized category of \"disorders due to addictive behaviors or substance useâ€™ and is placed alongside gambling disorder and varying degrees of alcohol and drug addiction.\" Considering stories I've read of people dying in gaming cafes, living in gaming cafes, spending life savings on MTX, this seems like it should be of little debate that it can be an addictive behavior. Many games are literally designed around the philosophy of maintaining as much on-screen attention as possible throughout the day, and shape the game mechanics around it. The ESA has pushed back against this international body of experts.","replies":[]}]}
