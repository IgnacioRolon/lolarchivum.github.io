Its literally just teen angst personified its rly cringy. Only worse champion VO/personality wise is Zoe for being \"HELLO IM KATIE TEH PENGUIN OF DOOM AS YOU CAN SEE IM SO RANDUM!!!\" tier design.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-21T02:51:14.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny how you use the term \"angst\" without considering it's meaning. Xayah is not \"angsty\", and there is definitely no way one should be able to confuse Rakan's personality for \"angst\", considering he basically embodies the opposite (kind of).\n\nJust so we're on the same page, here's a dictionary definition, courtesy of [Oxford](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/angst):\n> Angst, *noun*\n> 1- A feeling of deep anxiety or dread, typically an unfocused one about the human condition or state of the world in general.\n> 1.1- A feeling of persistent worry about something trivial\n\nDefinitely not an accurate description of either.\n\nRather than \"angst\", one could describe Xayah as having [sass](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sass) (defined as \"Impudence, cheek\"), which can often be expressed with a sarcastic overtone, and that she possesses an intense hatred for foreign invaders (for example, Zed). As for Rakan, one might say that he's generally [distractable](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/distractible) (defined as \"Easily distracted\" [*duh*]), [vain](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/vain) (defined as \"Having or showing an excessively high opinion of one's appearance, abilities or worth\") and, dare I say, [lustful](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/lustful) (defined as \"Having or showing strong feelings of sexual desire\").","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-20T22:37:09.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Jeez I'm sorry everyone can't be Zed/Darius/Rengar...\n\n**_\"KILL, KILL, KILL\" \n\"DEATH, DEATH, DEATH\" \n\"BLOOD, BLOOD, BLOOD\"\n\"12 year old, 12 year old, 12 year old.\"_**\n\nThe more out-there personalities like Rakan/Zoe are way cooler in my books, it actually gives a champion personality and makes them more of a character, rather than just a game avatar. You may not _like_ the character, but thats the whole point of having different characters, so there are characters that appeal to different audiences.\n\nBut imo none top Jhin and Aurelion Sol, for cool personalities:\n\n_\"[Sigh]..
