Lost one game after being asked not to take yas against hard ranged poke bot comp. in same lobby next game. yas again, picked into our braum support. Lost hard. Again.\r\nI call him a couple of things venting my frustration at having the same game wrecker in my ranked games this close to end of season then get reported by this game wrecking moron and I&#039;m on a 10 game chat restriction (with only this game&#039;s chat provided as evidence), he gets off scott free. Said fuck a few times, called him a troll / moron. No racism, no &quot;KYS&quot; or anything else unsavoury like that. Couple of bad words for a game wrecking moron who is fucking ranked games through shitty picks 3 weeks out from end of season, and I get punished.\r\nThis is why reporting is broken. Game wrecking trolls are free to do whatever they want but if I call that troll a moron I get a chat restriction and my honour / access to rewards is revoked.\r\nAbsolute fucking bullshit and I am sick of this stupid shitty system which rewards trolls and punishes those who are vocal about their want to have a decent game.","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-10-26T06:22:46.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who has posted about how the report system is busted:\n\ni disagree with you, almost entirely.\n\nWhat you're referring to, is how you were restricted over 1 game, and how your actions were validated.\n\nhowever while bans are coming out, nothing is present except for your own actions.\n\nLets take the real world, if someone kills your mother, it does not give you a just reason to kill theirs.\n\nIf someone flames/trolls, being toxic/flaming back, will get you banned, and i don't personally see anything wrong with this. \n\nlets discuss?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-10-26T06:46:32.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you see flaming as worse than the trolling, even though there is a mute button? You see the immunity of trolls as fine whereas the frustration of players wanting a good game spilling into chat a bannable offence?","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-10-26T07:14:01.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I think you've misunderstood my post entirely. \n\ni agree with the riot-side of things. In terms of:\nYour own actions are what are important, regardless of what brought them about.\nBeing toxic, flaming, aggressive, over chat, is worth a ban. Simply put, it goes against the rules, no ifs or buts.\n\nAnother real-world example:\n\n1. You buy something from a store, and the clerk sells you a faulty product willingly.\n- This is a crime according to Fair Use.\n2. You decide to punch him in the face.\n-This is assault according to Common Law.\n\nyour reaction to the original crime, is what is being prosecuted. To riot, the original crime barely/doesn't matter.\n\nIf this post was:\nTrolls are getting away with ruining games, they need to be punished.\n\ninstead of:\nI was wrongly chat-banned, because my actions didn't matter, he was trolling why wasn't he banned?\n\nSimply Put:\n1. Chat is easy to regulate, very.... easy...\n2. Trolling is probably the hardest.\n3. Intentionally feeding fits somewhere in the middle\n4. Griefing is also difficult. (My distinction between griefing and trolling, is that griefing is to intentionally lose you a match, while trolling may not be.)","replies":[{"poster":"Nikki","date":"2018-11-06T04:52:25.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this isnt theft, this isnt assault(not physical) this is one person Gaslighting their teammate(comrade) Into making an emotionally unstable action.

I dont know why you're using physical assault as an analogy for an emotionally manipulative crime. it's comparing apples and oranges.\n\nif you're logging into a video game and queuing for a match for any reason other than to play a video game, enjoy yourself and aim to win the game. then why do you need to be there? letting Sociopaths go around abusing people emotionally is NOT part of the game, and never will be.

Riot's support system is to inconsistent to allow such strict verbal abuse punishments. but it is what it is. \n\nRiot do not care enough about the in game behaviour, and if anyone disagrees with that, send me proof. I am actually de ranking because people resort to in game trolling if ONE thing does not play out the way they want it. I would confidently say that 2 out of 10 games I play is playable, the other 8 games is lost before 5 minutes of gameplay, I am only referring to my solo/dup queue experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-10-25T08:02:54.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but call a troll a troll (or a dog or a prick or whatever) and YOU get punished.","replies":[]}]}]}
