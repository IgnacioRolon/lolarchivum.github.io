GG.WP.\nYour bullshit system is busted. ALL season I have had a clean record and have been steadily accumulating honour. But a troll ruins two of my games and I call them out of it becuase of sheer frustration at their intentional trolling and game throwing at a critical time of the season, all they have to do is report and BAM whole year&#039;s efforts down the fucking toilet.\nSuch a crock of shit.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-26T00:40:00.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You keep honour for DCing/AFKing rather than being pulled down to their troll level.\nBetter to get a time penalty on queue times than lose all that hard earned honour.\n\nBTW, which honour level were you before this?

Me and a friend who plays triple~ the games that I do hit Honour 5 about a couple weeks apart with similar behaviour. It's more about consistency.

I know first hand of someone whose account was perma banned in similar circumstances - verbally abusing people who either intentionally ruined games or were just so selfish and childish that they did it unintentionally. That account had somewhere between NZD$500 - $1000 worth of RP invested in it. \nTheres not much you can do except hold your tongue no matter how obnoxious someone elses behaviour is. If they aren't literally inting down mid or AFK theres little chance they will be punished even if they are singlehandedly ruining games.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-10-29T08:22:24.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is just so ballachingly frustrating.
