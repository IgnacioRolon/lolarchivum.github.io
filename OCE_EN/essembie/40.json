It literally just waters down all of your money to nothing. Blue essence is a joke currency, hence the numbers are so high, you forget what it's actually worth (nothing.) I've spent $1500 on skins and lootboxes, about $400 on lootboxes. I got really nothing from the lootboxes but tonnes of blue essence from getting rid of all the champs.. Now i have 150k blue essence with nothing to spend it on because riot still want rp for their skins.
