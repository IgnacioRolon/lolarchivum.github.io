Developers wont build, tradesmen will go out of work, and banks will shed thousands of staff.\r\n\r\nThe party cant last forever, and the barman is calling last drinks.\r\n\r\nHold on kids - the next 10 years are gonna be interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-07T16:54:37.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate.. look at Auckalnd :/","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-08T22:37:47.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue there?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-08T03:43:23.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its because offshore investors buy 2-4 propertys adjacent to each other, rip down the houses and put flats up, there making a ton of money so they dont mind paying the inflated prices.\n\nRip owning my own house.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-03-08T17:59:23.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our generation has to remember this struggle we are going through and try to bring in universal land taxes. Say you had a ULT set at 1% which is very fair to someone who only owns the home they live in. If their property is worth $100,000 they'd pay $1000 per year and on the other end someone with $10,000,000 worth of property would pay $100,000 per year. This would put most people off investing in property freeing up affordable housing for future generations. Also it would mean the government wouldn't need to tax you as much for income and gst. So saving money to buy your home would become easier. People who own a home would have more money to spend. The economy would grow due to increased spending. Right now there is a small percentage that benefits form the current system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-07T12:11:38.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"And this has what to do with LoL and thus having a reason to be on the boards?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-07T20:25:42.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"miscellaneous\n[mis-uh-ley-nee-uh s] \n\nadjective\n1.\nconsisting of members or elements of different kinds; of mixed character:\n_a book of miscellaneous essays on American history._\n2.\nhaving various qualities, aspects, or subjects:\n_**a miscellaneous discussion.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-03-07T22:12:08.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Should actually be posted in GD.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-08T03:24:21.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-08T00:50:54.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Pretty sure off topic things still need to be related to the game or community in some form.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-08T03:23:16.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2016-03-07T12:03:18.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why I'm going to try invest in a cheap location when I'm 18-20 and sell it when prices go jacking up or end up living in it.
