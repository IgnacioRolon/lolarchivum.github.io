I play a bit of xin and because his kit takes him balls deep with no real escape, if the team does not back him up in team fights it can be very frustrating to play.  Contrast with other champs like riven or tryn who have escapes and are not as reliant on their team to survive an engage.\r\n\r\nDo certain champs increase the chance of toxicity ? And are all talon players massive ball bags?","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-26T23:13:23.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all. I for one, believe myself not to be toxic to my teammates when playing Talon. What's the point anyway? I know that if I went in and no one backed me up, it was probably my fault for going in at the wrong time.
