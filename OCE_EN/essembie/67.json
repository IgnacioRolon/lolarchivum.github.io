We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witch-hunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. If you want to post something like this, make sure to blur the names out of the image or some other editing technique. Naming and shaming again will land you a temporary ban on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-23T21:26:55.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But in this case he didn't \"name and shame\" anyone.

In this case here, he screen shotted and posted the photo on boards with the name of the person still on the photo. \n\nSo it would be classified as something similar to or exactly like \"naming and shaming\" because the person who uploaded the photo didn't blur out the name of the person being extremely toxic, which then gives that person a bad name.\n\nYou might not call it \"naming and shaming\" either, you might just call it \"reporting someone on the forums\" or something.
