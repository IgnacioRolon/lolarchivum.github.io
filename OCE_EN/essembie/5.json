In the same way a double ADC can work bot lane - it happens and it works from time to time. But more often than not the early lane advantage that 2 damage dealers brings is far outweighed by the mid-late game utility that a tank with CC brings such that dual ADC is &quot;not meta&quot;. Or any other &quot;off-meta&quot; pick. It can work, but is it reliable? This is how I feel about Teemo top. Sure, you might be amazing and you might win lane 9 times out of 10. But what is your late game utility in tank meta? What do you actually bring to a team fight that the mid and the adc aren&#039;t already bringing? More damage, and a temporary blind. thats it.\n\nTeemo top is completely unreliable and a selfish choice - it is saying &quot;I&#039;m here to win my lane but fuck the rest of the team when it comes to team fights - when we lose the team fights it is because you&#039;re bad not because we lack critical utility in our team composition&quot;.\n\nTeemo top? Just say no.","replies":[{"poster":"SlyTactician ","date":"2016-08-04T21:05:21.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo's kit has been very much the same since the start of League and is pretty much outdated by this point.\n\nIronically, he's labelled as the Swift Scout for his title; yet, he's very immobile. I love Teemo a lot by his design and lore, but I do wish I could play the champ more - though I often do not as he's terrible for teamfights sadly with little utility and short range. He  just needs a proper update really.\n\nI hope he gets reworked into a jungler personally. His theme just seems perfect for the map control and ambush method.

You get slowed for ages so even theoretically if you were some how tanky enough to survive the poison you're not going anywhere fast anyway. \nIt's fun for the person who plays it if you get fed because no one can touch you.

However if you are playing him correctly or building him correctly and pretty much doing as nightjar said then you won't be useless late game. \n\n- What I do when I play Teemo is focus on winning lane then split pushing and creating alot of map pressure (Usually they have to send 2 or 3 people to deal with me split pushing) or securing objectives with the team (Baron/Drag/Towers). \n\n- I also think if you are going to play Teemo top you need to have some kind of tank on your team, support or jungle usually has to fill that role.\n\n- AP Teemo is pretty busted at higher elo, in low elo its fine to play. I find at higher elo you are going to run into enemy teams that just build 3 - 5 upgraded orcacles if you are an AP fed Teemo. A better way to build Teemo in my opinion is the is AD mallet build.\n\n[{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Fghy8VQK,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-04T23:42:10.478+0000)>\n> I feel if a teemo doesn&#x27;t push towers and focuses on objective control he&#x27;s not doing it right.
