Thats my only issue with her.\n\nAnd yes, I have come very close to leaving something in my pants when I assumed I was in the clear from a mid lane fight,  and suddenly a vicious void woman leaps across the lane from the fog of war and leaves me with a grey screen.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, I think her invisibility is great, it is a nice balance between a neat piece of utility for a marksman _(something that marksmen due to class requirements, often lack)_, thus offering a fresh playstyle with new toys for ADC players, but lacks the frustrating _\"Where is she?.. Oh! over there!... Where is she... Oh! over.. oh wait I'm dead.\"_ gameplay that Vayne is known for.\n\nShe gets to be mobile without being too frustrating to fight, and she gets access to high damage, without 1-hitting everything that comes too close.\n\nWell done Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ã•rnn Bot","date":"2018-03-13T01:45:00.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shes better jg imo","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-13T07:54:49.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend often takes her jungle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
