There is no casual purchase of loot boxes, if you want anything halfway decent you will spend a lot before you get it. Eg it is more profitable to hide hextech annie behind lootboxes than it would be to sell it as a legendary, even though you'd spend more to get it.

They treat consumers as a cash source to be milked thought rights to AAA games rather than a market to be served by games with game play. And if they cant buy the rights to pump out an average but popular title, they'll just acquire the studio of a popular game to load it up with micros and destroy everything good about it. \n\nThis is the main reason I am pissed that tencent have gone down this path with their aquisition of riot. It stinks of a profitable but incredibly unpopular strategy by EA which damages the games industry overall.\n\nSo many good games and studios killed because EA took a ROI mentality rather than a good game mentality. Dungeon keeper, sim city, BF2, etc etc. And it saddens me to see riot, which has always been about people delivering a great game, is now about maximising profits for quarterly targets.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sZJ9oMo.jpg\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-25T10:55:16.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhh, rip westwood, red alert 2 was the shits.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T09:02:20.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8BhL0J2V,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-11-25T10:55:16.355+0000)\n>\n> ahhh, rip westwood, red alert 2 was the shits.\n\nso many great studios bled to death for EA's margins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-26T01:20:13.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as EA fuck over everything they touch (RIP Bullfrog, Maxis, Westwood) at least they also managed to fuck up enough to get the  government to fuck over Lootboxes.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-26T01:27:36.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8BhL0J2V,comment-id=000200000001,timestamp=2017-11-26T01:20:13.113+0000)\n>\n> As much as EA fuck over everything they touch (RIP Bullfrog, Maxis, Westwood) at least they also managed to fuck up enough to get the  government to fuck over Lootboxes.\n\nyep - a huge positive to come out of their relentless greed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-11-24T00:05:16.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"What changes might you see coming from this sort of thing?

I actively bought them because i was happy to support the game. But the lootbox model is one that preys on a thirst for content, and rather than a clear cut transaction where i buy a for b, i have to buy c for b to get a chance at a.\n\nHonestly purchasing skins was ftp done right - whenever I hear people say \"be nice to riot it's a free game\" i laugh because over the years i have spent more on this game (somewhere between $600-$900, depending on whether my wife is in earshot) than any other because i agreed with the business model and enjoyed the game and was more than happy to support it.\n\nBut the lootbox model is abhorrent - it is a virtual lottery which muddies the transaction and preys on compulsive behaviours to extract more cash for the same product.  I bought a couple when they first came out and quickly realised that getting hextech annie would likely cost me more than buying 3 or 4 legendarys outright. It is a system designed to harvest money and nothing else.\n\nJust to be perfectly clear, Spending cash on lol has never ever been an issue for me. Its been about $75-$150 per year for me since about season 2 because i agreed with the model, enjoyed the game, and was more than happy to support it. but predatory pricing in games is what is killing modern gaming. Ea are americas most hated for a reason and i am sad to see riot go down the same path and angry that such a profitable company is moving towards exploitative pricing when all around the world the practice is under significant scrutiny because it exploits the vulnerable,  and in this case vulnerable teenagers.\n\nApologies for my colourful language - i am pretty passionate about this. By moving in this direction riot have gone from being the undefeated heroes of modern ftp done absolutely right to the villains ripping money out of the pockets of teenagers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-24T00:15:12.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's amazing, but this game was Free To Play before they added lootboxes.","replies":[]}]}]}
