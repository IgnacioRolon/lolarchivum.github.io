Just a consistent fall off since 7.23 to sub 50 win rates in 8.3. Her play rate has seen a corresponding drop off too.\n\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/Vi/Jungle\n\nguess it is time to say goodbye to Vi.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-19T11:06:02.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she always tends to have slightly inflated stats because a lot of people play her around the Plat-Diamond mark, when she isn't really good anywhere else, because she suffers in both Extremely high ELO (Challenger/Pro scene) and extremely low ELO.\n\nLike i love Vi as a champion, but i couldn't really justify picking her over Skarner EVER (and this is why high elo don't use her).\n\nAnd in Extremely lower elo's, she has the issues of her clear being ok, but not great, which is a sticking issue for a lot of Bronze-Gold players.\n\nWhereas your Plat's to low Diamond's, don't necessarily have to worry about picking the best champion, or worry about having issues clearing (because they are at the point that they know how to clear not stupidly)\n\nThe other factor is shown by her stats on champion.gg, which is, if your playing her, it's likely because you just got filled, and she is kinda a bridging champion for those sorts of players, where she is simple enough for people who don't overly jungle, but impactful enough with ease.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-18T22:54:24.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vi has been pretty strong for a while, especially last season.\nI haven't seen much of her this season, so I can't comment on her current position.\n\nShe is like Shyv, she has enough engage and burst damage to assassinate the damage dealers, and is tanky enough that the damage dealers don't have a hope of killing her in the small time it takes for her to kill them.\nBut she also has enough sustained damage to take down full tanks as well.\n\nSo maybe its time for her to take a back seat (it gets annoying when the same champs are always in the limelight, _Cough Zed Cough_.) \n\n\nBut just because she is mildly less good than she was before doesn't mean you have to say goodbye...

Hell, my main jungler is Kindred of all people, possibly the single most useless jungler of all.\n\nI never used to be the team deadweight with vi - used to carry more than I lost too. But now I just feel like I am a burden on the rest of the team when I am playing at a lower rank than I did last season. Just cant get the wins on the board with her. Can do much better with Zac. Probably should have said I'd retire her from ranked until she gets a buff or there is better item synergy to make her a bigger threat (cough cough SATED).\n\nI know I cant carry all games - not by a long shot. But I do like to think I am a team player who, if I cant win the lane, wont lose the lane (if you get my drift).\n\nWith Vi I need to be carried and it makes me feel dirty.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-18T23:20:28.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with vi atm you need to remember not to fight duelist junglers like warwick head on, and focus hard on early rotations (hell do a full clear if you have to) and kiting for clearspeed and health, then go warrior enchant with preferably blue smite into lethality and then tanky. As VI you're uniquely mobile whilst having cc and burst.\n\nVi has amazing CC and ganks, but she doesn't get alot of her raw damage until she gets one or two items. Vi isn't bad, her strength is still above the average for junglers atm, she's just less dominant. She's also less tanky with this season's runes, and the increased damage of this meta, so she's more like a fighter such as Camille, than a bruiser like Darius, and durability for her is more dependant on being ahead of the curve than actual tank stats.\n\nAlso a mistake I've only recently realised that's been holding me back this season, and may be holding many others back as well is, 'listening to the calls of teammates', you might have gold elo shotcalling, and when you look at toplane, you see a darius 60xp off lvl6, your garen has 250hp and is calling for a gank, you think 'if I go top, he's going to hit lvl6, ult garen, max his stacks and then kill me', my coach noticed that I said to myself 'this is stupid, if I go top he'll kill us both, this isn't going to work' in my voice comms, but my garen spam pinged, and I headed top, and as expected, darius killed us both. I should have just recalled and told garen to recall and tp back to lane.\n\nIf your greatest strength is gold shotcalling, if you listen to your silver teammates and stop thinking for yourself, you have silver shotcalling, and have lost one of your strengths.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-02-18T23:24:51.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=dAKffPQy,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-02-18T23:20:28.891+0000)\n>\n> Vi has amazing CC and ganks, but she doesn&#x27;t get alot of her raw damage until she gets one or two items.

His gameplay is a little different, but in terms of range of what he can do, his tempo is very similar to Vi from past seasons, and he gets alot of choice in the new runes, alot of tankshred, squishy murder, and healing, strong cc, engage (though as Vi you probably shouldn't be engaging for a 5v5, wait till a real tank like Alistair, Rammus, malphite does that, similar to how an irelia is not an engager), and alot of early damage, and a very fast and healthy jungle clear (though I still suggest learning correct kiting of the camps because this makes a big difference to Vi's and many other junglers early performance, few champions have enough sustain to just sit still autoing and facetanking the jungle camps).","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-02-18T23:48:44.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=dAKffPQy,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-02-18T23:39:02.490+0000)\n>\n> well then all I can really suggest is warwick.

I am going to try a resolve setup to see if it makes a difference but if that is bad too I'm just gonna stick with zac. Might give WW another look but I have previously gone too ham with him and I get my timing all wrong.\n\nMaybe give xin another look too - I played him quite well a few seasons ago but got bored of his style.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2018-02-19T08:27:45.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok. Having read all the previous comments, I can see that you don't particularly like assassin Vi. However, having played the past 6 months with a Vi main, I can safely say that assassin Vi carries games when ahead, and with the right game knowledge, turns games from guaranteed losses to probable wins in at most 3 teamfights. As assassin Vi, having to \"go balls deep\" doesn't matter because in the late game, you will have the survivability of both GA and Death's Dance (bought to replace jungle item in the late game when smite is better used on objectives than champions), and so you can afford the risk of the engage - particularly when you know it will earn at least one kill. That is the whole point of assassins: remove a threat from the fight quickly.\nBasically all I'm saying is that Vi overall hasn't been made weaker, just that the tank Vi playstyle has.","replies":[]}]}
