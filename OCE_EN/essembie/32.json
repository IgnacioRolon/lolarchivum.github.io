So it did look weird with MF's icon shown next to \"Support\" for example. Nevertheless we won that game so all good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-31T12:41:46.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it too!

Previously if I were first pick I could go jg/supp, now im forced into only 2 roles ( usually top/mid or top/adc ). Don't say try trading roles, generally people don't want to trade. DQ only really shines for extreme high elo players who can play all roles to a great level, but play their main roles @ a godtier level or full premade 5 which already worked with the previous version of ranked 5s.\n\nThe only good things I've seen so far is more people involved in ban phase, indicating what champ you would like to play and actual pick order.\n\nNothing makes me cringe more than when first pick indicates *insert champion that can be counter team comped here ( cough zed cough )* then instantly locks after the ban phase.\n\nAlso why does fill mean supp, fill should have the same % chance to get any role. I stopped doing fill after like 10 games off supp in a row.\n\nedit: Also can't play ranked with friends outside my elo ( previous 5s allowed that ) , so we're stuck playing blinds or aram.","replies":[]}]}
