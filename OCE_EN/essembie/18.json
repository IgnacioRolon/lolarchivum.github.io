Was it late game when the death timers are really long, and you've had the gold and item edge for your team?

I've found myself running cleanse more often than not in mid now.

Nothing feels worse than going 10/0 and having no idea where to apply your power.\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to try and master people with reasonable mobility that can dish out either some aoe, some cc, or both. That way even if you're behind, if your mechanical skills are good enough, you can avoid them and shut them down.\n\nExamples would be ap Ezreal with a Rylais or Ahri, Nautilus is also always a good option, and if you're aiming for the mid-late game \"I don't care about you mortals\" Rammus or tank Warwick. Tank Warwick is slow to start, but if you get him rolling you can chase that adc to the nexus and be totally fine, not even kidding.","replies":[]}]}
