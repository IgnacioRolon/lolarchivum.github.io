This is such a common mistake people seem to make on Xin. Each extra point in Q gives you 45 more damage(if you land all 3 hits) and E gives an extra 40 so is basically equivalent damage-wise. Reducing the cooldown on your gap closing ability is significantly more useful though(plus the slow gets slightly better), especially when your early game is so strong. Having Q come off cd a couple seconds earlier will usually be irrelevant since the guy will already be out of aa range by then and you can't use it a second time anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-15T11:21:57.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McRuthless,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=IvkKae4J,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-09-15T11:12:03.352+0000)\n>\n> Maxing E first is almost always better than Q.

If they have dashes/escapes they sometimes panic and use them (or flash if you're lucky) and THEN you can just E in to catch. Also because your engage tool is on such a low cooldown Xin seems great for going into a lane blowing some of their abilities/items, wander out like you're going back to jungle then just come straight back in if they push back up.\n\nEDIT: but like I said, not a greatly experienced jungler so someone correct me if I'm off on anything please!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-17T07:27:11.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah mate seems a good suggestion.
