Now I'm not saying that is right or wrong, that is just one way of answering the question. However; if context is disregarded, then there should be clear boundaries about what can and cant be said. Therefore if Riot want to treat all abusive words/actions as equal, then they need to release a definite list of instaban words and actions, so the community have clear tenants to follow.\n\nThink of the Law in real life, you don't get arrested and sentenced based on a rulebook that is hidden to everyone except the Policemen and Judge, do you?\nThe law and justice system is an open book, that way, if you commit a crime, you can be held accountable because you were informed prior, that said action was wrong. If the system doesn't tell you the specifics of what is and isn't wrong, then you can hardly be blamed for overstepping the bounds.\n\n_E.g. If you see someones old sandwich wrapper fall out of their pocket, and you pick it up and put it in the bin, does that count as stealing? What if it was their wallet instead? Its the same action. If you don't have access to the rulebook against which you will be judged, how are you supposed to distinguish one from the other?_\n\n\n__________________\n\nHowever if you think that not all abuse is equal, and that context plays a big part. Then you should be able to argue your case.\nAnd as it stands, arguing your case to Riot support has the same impact as blowing bubbles at nuclear bunker.\n\nSo Riot need to choose. Do they allow case-by-case punishment, or do they release the 10 commandments saying _\"Thou shalt not say C*nt\"_\n\nI can understand them not wanting to release details of how their punishment system works because people will find ways around it. \nAnd yes I'm sure that some people will find cracks in the system _(people find cracks in every system)_, maybe calling someone a John Tomas instead of a Cock will save them a chat ban. But at least people know where they stand, and to me, thats more important.","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-03-17T14:35:14.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the law dose not see ignorance as a defence nor do i believe that the law is an open book, so ?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-18T00:24:19.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All laws are made pubic, thats the point. \n_(whats the purpose of a law no one knows to follow?)_\nEvery person has unrestricted access to read and study the law to its fullest extent.\nIf you don't want to research it yourself, you can hire someone to tell you about your specific situation _(a lawyer)_.\nThere is no part of the law that is hidden from the public.\n\nHence **there is no ignorance**, because the law is public knowledge.\nThats why ignorance of the law is not a valid defence, because it is made public, so If you 'didn't know', its because YOU didn't read it.

I came to the same conclusion that most people here did - the guy who banned their team mate's champ would likely get off scott-free and the person who responded was at risk of a ban.\n\nThat stinks quite frankly - in this community toxic behaviour (as opposed to toxic chat, which can be muted at any time) goes unpunished but 4 bad words in 4 games could actually get you perma'd, irrespective of whether you played properly or not.\n\nWas enjoying playing up to a point and was getting some good wins with Veigar and having some fun with Kai'sa too. but in the situation where my own team mate would screw me like that and with the revelation that in responding to that behaviour, I would likely be the one punished I have uninstalled again to take another extended break. losing my border last year over such a trivial issue and the priorities of player behaviour and the mechanisms available to disproportionately punish swearing over toxic in-game behaviour (griefing, inting \"we all have bad games\" etc etc) has really given me pause to step back and reassess what it is I like about the game.
