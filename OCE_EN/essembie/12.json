Overwatch, Halo etc give you the average starting MMR and let your play decide if it falls or rises.\n\nThe games where you start from the bottom and move up are usually single player games. Hearthstone, FIFA etc where you can't complain about \"stuck in elo hell\" because if you can't beat shitters, since the game is 100% on you, then you are a shitter.","replies":[{"poster":"jACKAL69","date":"2018-03-16T18:35:00.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At the moment it feels like that you guys don't care about the Bronze and Silver plebs.\n\nDO YOU GUYS REALLY THINK THIS SHIT IS FAIR TOWARDS A VETERAN PLAYER LIKE ME?????

If you don't belong in Bronze, you will have no problem climbing. Similarly, the lack of decay in Gold/Silver is an incentive for \"dead weight\" to not play.  The people who complain about ranked tend to want immediate results, and the system doesn't work like that. The more you play, the more accurate your ranking is. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-10-10T01:27:34.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends how you go in placements though.
