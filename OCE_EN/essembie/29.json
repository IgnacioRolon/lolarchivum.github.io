Even though her Q, W and E all count as AOE damage. This means that {{champion:163}}  had no way to proc the single target 40% slow.\n\nNow that it only offers a 20% slow, for all types of spells, mages that have a lot of AOE can get the same results out of the item as mages who're more focused on single targets.\n\nAnother thing, was that back on the old {{item:3116}} , {{champion:63}}  could proc each type of slow, so you'd constantly be shifting through different movement speeds AND durations. \n\nYou'll be seeing it on a lot more supports now, but the item is still strongest on mages that have high damage combos that are hard to land on fleeing targets.\n\n{{champion:163}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:143}} \n\nHowever, since the changes I have noticed a few champions making use of the item that I wasn't expecting.\n\n{{champion:90}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:37}} \n\n\nHope that helps at all :)","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-20T07:15:42.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool man thanks .
