For solo Q a couple are happy and the rest are bored.\r\n\r\nTahm Kench - my team mates were wetting themselves with delight at this pick but I was super bored for 40 mins. Will probably avoid this game mode for the time being I think","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-10-16T00:14:29.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is tahm kench boring?
