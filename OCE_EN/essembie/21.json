I feel like vlad mid is entering the same kindof area as zed these days too. very easy for him to dodge all abilities making it hard to land any combos.

So {{champion:74}} (for example) just throws a grenade at his feet and his turrets do the rest. There's not much a Zed can do against it. Unless Zed is experienced enough against Heimerdinger. But then again, who is?\n\nI'm a Heimerdinger main, and Zed is a relatively easy matchup. The main problem is the rest of your team (particularly bot lane) not backing off when you ping MIA.\n\nHowever, I do agree that his kit is quite overloaded and his numbers could use some tweaking until Riot finds a suitable way to deal with him. The main issue with Zed is that he is very complicated. People learning to play him will most likely do terribly (unless they have a few good games or he just suits their playstyle) compared to high-level, experienced Zed players. I, for one, can't play Zed at all. I'm a terrible Zed player. I've seen many amazing Zed players that kick my ass, but I've also annihilated my fair share of Zeds.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is that Zed takes a lot of time and effort in order to get right consistently. Riot wants to reward players that are willing to put in that time and effort by letting them get away with stuff that most other champs couldn't. While his ultimate certainly is strong, there is still counterplay (especially as any champ with cc that can just bait out his ult and use the cc when he becomes targetable again ({{champion:74}}, {{champion:1}}, {{champion:90}}, {{champion:92}}, {{champion:61}}, just to name a few).\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said about Fizz...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-05T00:15:00.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How to play zed\n\nHit lvl 6\nRoam botlane\nRoam botlane again \n1 more time\n\nNow enjoy your free win","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-08-05T02:03:58.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xgz9jova,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-05T00:15:00.469+0000)\n>\n> How to play zed\n> \n> Hit lvl 6\n> Roam botlane\n> Roam botlane again \n> 1 more time\n> \n> Now enjoy your free win\n\nGlad I'm not the only one who feels this way.\n\nI think I should start playing zed.","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-08-08T08:56:07.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://db3.memegenerator.net/cache/instances/folder664/500x/80124664/newspaper-cat-realization-i-should-start-playing-zed.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-08-06T00:18:00.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Certainly has a lot of strengths - energy, damage/lethality, mobility, duels, splitting, outplay potential.
