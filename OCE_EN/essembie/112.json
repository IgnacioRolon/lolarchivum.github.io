Zed, Talon, Ekko, Yasou, Akali, Fizz, Xerath, Velkoz, Ziggs, shaco, khazix, rengar, hecarim, volibear, xinzhao, warwick, vi, evelynn, master yi, ect... He's strong and he roams extremely well and his teamfight is good, but he loses bad to alot of poke mages and melee assassins which is kinda almost everything in the meta right now. Might as well just pick anivia for the teamfight and damage. I know aurelion sol roams extremely well but the issue is that he has alot of bad matchups that are currently meta and he's awkward to use for alot of people. He's also very vunerable to anyone that can get inside his star circle and the meta still favours melee ad assassins with strong early game due to the changes to tower first bloods even though we were moving into a tank jungle and poke midlane meta.\nOverall the issue is mostly that despite the fact that he's strong, too many bad matchups are very meta right now and he's very weak pre-6 due to the type of junglers we have at the moment since if he tries to play aggressive, the jungler can just get alot of early gold out of him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-04T11:41:40.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and lets keep it low!!\n\nHe is my fave champ, and i don't want him to become the next Yasuo and have every man and his dog play him...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-04T11:41:25.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urgot 0.57%\n\nfeelsbadman","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-04T11:36:54.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's quite good in ARAM.\nNot too hard to get top _damage dealt to champs_ with him.","replies":[]}]}
