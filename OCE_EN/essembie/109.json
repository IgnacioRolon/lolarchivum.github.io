Somewhere in the equation **you** must fit in. And being only silver/bronze, I'm guessing you play a significant role in this equation that is causing you to demote. \n\nI'm not trying to be nasty or call you a bad player or anything, there are games that are purely unwinnable of course, but I'm sure there are areas of your gameplay specifically that could do with improvement to give you a better chance of carrying/winning games, and therefore promoting back to your previous rating, if not higher. Yes, feeding team mates and smurfing enemies do make it very hard to win. In these circumstances, if the condition of a victory is bleak or non existent, just ignore whatever else is going on, and solely focus on self improvement. Try and take something away from each ranked game you play, and don't take them simply for win or lose; don't think of every game as either LP gain or LP loss. \n\nIve had plenty of those games buddy you can trust me to know what I'm rambling on about. I've had games with Challenger/pro players smurfing on the enemy team, and games with people inting cause they didn't get X role that they wanted. There is nothing you individually can do to stop that happening, but there are things you can do individually to improve your own gameplay. Try focusing on doing that, rather than getting a party of 4 other players to just carry you. You don't learn anything or really improve at all that way bro.\n\nUltimately the decision is up to you, this is just purely my advice and opinion. However, I do hope you take the opportunity to heed my words tho. \nRegardless, good luck on the rift, and have a wonderful Sunday :)","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-09-24T23:28:07.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah i hear what you are saying and ordinarily i would agree with you but statistically speaking i am playing reasonable lol right now and i haven't suddenly dropped 4 divisions because I started sucking all balls after 8 months sitting pretty in high Silver.\n\nThe fact is that team composition is vastly different in the lead up to end of season and i need a reliable duo to be able to compete with all the reliable duos.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterOfClickinQ","date":"2016-09-24T23:32:33.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essembie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ksPAW6Ns,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-09-24T23:28:07.193+0000)\n>\n> Nah i hear what you are saying and ordinarily i would agree with you but statistically speaking i am playing reasonable lol right now and i haven&#x27;t suddenly dropped 4 divisions because I started sucking all balls after 8 months sitting pretty in high.

I was in a similar situation to you and I was stuck in b2 and I kept telling myself that my team was bad, that was why I was losing. The fact of the matter is that especially in lower elos such as silver and bronze you always can greatly improve in every area of your gameplay but the first step to improving is admitting that you need to improve. Again not calling you bad as I am roughly in the same elo as you but after actively noticing your mistakes and not blaming others you can really start to improve and climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-09-25T00:09:59.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the fact is that game and team composition has changed a lot in the lead up to end of season.
