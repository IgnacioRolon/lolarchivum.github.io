I like this idea a lot, as there are plenty of games where I don't honour anyone (or would honour opponents if I could). But I also get games where the are friendly, tactical, smart, skilled etc. teammates that I want to give multiple people credit. I honestly don't see how giving summoners the option to bank honour from mediocre games and distribute it to multiple people in future games would harm or devalue the honour system.\n\nIf you accumulate 1 honour per game then just let it cap out at 10 over 10 games if you don't honour anyone for the previous 9. Or if you like more logic but less nice round numbers, just make it cap out at 9, since you could only ever potentially honour 9 players in the one game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
