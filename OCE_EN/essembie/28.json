Yes they took his damage down but that&#x27;s not the main reason why he was/is strong. There was no sense in making a champ do damage, build full tank and provide cc.\n\nthe early game dominance has been nerfed. As the game progresses it doesnt make much difference to his kit because tank is the aim, but losing 20 off e and 10 off w (15% and 12% off level 3 e and w damage respectively) means that in a gank where you land an e and 2 w's you've lost 40 damage from the mix, putting the burden on the adc to land an additional AA (or giving the opportunity for the opponent to slip away before your adc can land the last hit). If you gank when the ADC is at ~250 health (just under half health @ 3ish), then ~20% of the damage required to secure the kill has gone. Its a fair old whack to lose and certainly impacts the outcome of successfully landing an E. Pre-nerf, landing an E pretty much guaranteed the kill. Post nerf, it provides less damage and it means that the aDC is a much bigger part of closing out the gank.\n\nRiot's intent was to lose some of the damage (quote from patch) so the changes are definitely what riot ordered.\n\n> Zac’s damage is on the high side for a tank, so we’re dialing that back. We’re sure he’ll bounce back from these changes.\n\nDont get me wrong, he's still awesome at hard tanky CC but its just that his level 3 dominance has been hit very hard. Formerly guaranteed level 3 first bloods are a lot rarer these days and in fact exposes him to risk as his base damage is down and it is too early to have built any real tank so he is susceptiple to being rekt in the gank himself.\n\nbut I guess my OP was worded a bit strong - have revised it a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-18T12:43:53.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essembie,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cAAoMcsE,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-06-18T06:49:17.067+0000)\n> \n> his level 3 dominance has really been hit quite hard.

To any great extent but getting first and 2nd blood at l3 is no longer guaranteed.","replies":[]}]}]}
