Even if you do badly I doubt you will get worse than low silver, and if you do well you could easily end up higher than silver 2. Last season i finished preseason in gold 4 and ended up getting placed in gold 3 after going 7-3 so I'd say its more likely you end up in s1 or gold than in bronze, maybe you should put them on the poll. The people who end up losing heaps of ranks after doing well in placements are mainly the ones in s5, g5 etc with mmr that is way below their actual rating.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-21T05:01:24.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hitting s5 before end of season may be my only saving grace.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-21T04:12:25.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to bet on Bronze 2.

I got bronze 2. Be lying if I said I wasnt disappointed after getting to S2 preseason and S5 at end of last season, but confident I can climb out. Just a massive pain in the arse.**\n\nAnyone who voted B2, mad props to you.\n\n\n\n\nGame 3 was a win but it was hard fought. Fast paced game. Felt like I was playing above my mmr.\n\nGame 4 I felt I did very well in ADC (7/4/14) but the JG went afk for 5 or so minutes and our top didnt play super well so the extra jg pressure killed us. Mid and supp were pretty good but not enough to carry.\n\nGame 5 there was no team synergy. Again, feel I played well in support (2/6/13) but I did feel let down by my team mates. ADC raged at me for not placing wards (even though I put down 19, 2nd only to the Lee) which kinda pissed me off. Losing faith of landing in silver this season.\n\nGame 6 was a win - but not fun. Two whiney crybabies on the team.\n\n7 just sucked. Bad plays by me, bad plays by rest of team.\n\n8 bad team comp. Won mid and roamed top and bot to secure kills (was 7/3/5 at one stage), helped other lanes but the vayne had a nasty habit of face checking their jg and the support was an ez buffet. Yi was ok, irel promised to carry but did little more than suck balls.  To be fair their lee was pretty good. the dream is dead. Bronze here we come.\n\n9 I got ruined.\n\n10 I ruined them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-21T02:12:01.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.
