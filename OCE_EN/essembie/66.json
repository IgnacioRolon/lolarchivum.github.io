Im sure they aren't solely responsible.\n\nHowever, from whatever angle I look, I just can't justify the need for loot boxes in the first place. It's not like games don't make enough money from micro-transactions already.\n\nThe only reason that loot boxes exist, is because companies know they can exploit the psychology of their audience. And that to me is a far greater problem than the boxes themselves.\n\nThe boxes may well promote gambling in younger demographics.  But we all _(well, most of us I assume)_ went to fairs and carnivals as kids, we all bought raffle tickets and lucky dip tries. Tried our hand at arcade games etc.  So the exposure was there already _(although maybe not as readily accessible)_, its not like gambling is this brand new concept that kids have never encountered before.\n\nThe real problem is the deliberate **intent** to get minors hooked.\nThat is nothing short of criminal!\n\n\n____________\n\n#Where is the line?\n\nWhen loot boxes exist as a side feature where it's just an alternative lucky-dip way to obtain the same products available from micro transactions.  Then I think they are relatively benign.  It's just kind of a buyer beware situation.\n\nBut when loot is actively putting pressure on you, and tons of temporary loot exclusive items are hung in front of your nose, (much like how league goes about it).  Then I think it is actually malignant, and can definitely see it causing problems in younger players _(hell, even in older players)_. \n\nI truly think businesses should be held accountable for that sort of behaviour, \nit is purposefully callous and malicious.\n\n\n#IMO: \n**It's fine to have gambling in a game _(to a responsible extent)_. \nIt's not fine to pressure the player to use it.**\n\nWhen hextech crafting first was introduced into league, it was basically perfect.  \nA neat reward system to give players who don't want to spend money, a chance to own a few skins in the game they love.  Everything in the loot was permanently available  _(i.e. no risk of logging in next week and the sick af Rumble skin you always wanted has disappeared)_.  And there was only one loot exclusive item, and that was Hextech Annie, as a nice bonus to hope for every time you opened a chest.\nIf you wanted a specific skin for a specific champ, you would just go to the store and buy it.  But If you wanted a few cheap skins/champs you could spend a few dollars on chests.\n\nNow. Hextech crafting is one of _(if not THE)_ worst aspect of the game. Anything worth anything only comes up through the loot system, and for exuberant prices. It's greedy and heartless, and I can easily see how it would cause problems.  It's a blatant betrayal of the player base's trust.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-11-23T06:36:12.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"solid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-26T08:45:16.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2E0boPIl,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-11-22T09:57:04.163+0000)\n>\n> When hextech crafting first was introduced into league, it was basically perfect.  \n> A neat reward system to give players who don&#x27;t want to spend money, a chance to own a few skins in the game they love.

I have NEVER had a single gemstone or whatever from boxes.\n\nI've gained 12 free (permanent) skins (not shards) this year without paying a cent (I used to buy RP, but made a protest ages ago, and haven't bought RP since, because my concerns were never remedied). I have never, EVER gained **any** hextech exlcusive loot, the only gemstone I ever got was from an 'essence emporium'  purchase when IP became BE. Then after I was like \"I need 10, oh fuck off\", so I spent 50000 IP on a fucking chest. What a joke.\n\nIf anything, the gambling element introduced into LoL in recent times has prevented me from buying RP, not encouraged it, but hey, I'm a math nerd type guy, gambling is for morons IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-26T11:03:13.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since i had no hope of remembering the specifics, I'll let the Crafting Guide do the talking.\n\n>**Bad Luck Protection:** You can't open three chests in a row without dropping at least one skin shard. This raises the effective drop rate of skin shards to roughly 57 percent.\n\n>**Bonus Gemstones:** Gemstones have a chance of dropping as a bonus alongside normal chest content. Gemstones have light \"bad luck protection,\" so you can't go more than 50 boxes without getting a gemstone. This results in a 3.6% chance of getting a gemstone. Gemstones can also drop from bonus chests, bringing the overall drop rate up to 4%.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-22T01:50:34.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not gonna say it's the parents fault, because it isn't always and/or entirely, but frankly it's alarming just how many parents will buy RP or Blizzard credit or VBUCKS just because their kid said so. Like don't you want to know what your kid is spending $50 a month on???? How can you walk into a store, ask for $80 worth of some in game credit and say to the cashier \"well I don't really know what it is but he told me to come get it\"??\n\nI get that parents aren't going to (or at least shouldn't) be monitoring every little detail of their kids lives, but when they're literally haemorrhaging your money on something you don't even know what it is and you're letting them isn't that a red flag? I dunno about you guys but if I asked my parents for $5 for RP they'd wanna know what I was spending it on and if it was worth it. \n\nAs an adult, I can make my own decisions, and so long as players are made fully aware of the odds (so they can be informed decisions) I have no particular problem with loot boxes since people can make their own decisions about worth. As a kid, the same should obviously apply, but it's also not that hard to keep your kids from your money. Parents need to make an effort to actually understand what engages their kids rather than just dismissing it as \"ha! video games am I right?\" and ignoring it. Even if you don't like or ever want to play it, at least know what you're spending your money on...","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-11-22T07:15:34.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2E0boPIl,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-22T01:50:34.281+0000)\n\n> I dunno about you guys but if I asked my parents for $5 for RP they&#x27;d wanna know what I was spending it on and if it was worth it. \n\nIf i asked my parents for money, they'd beat my ass, for wasting money on a video game, now a fully grown adult, and they'd still beat my ass for wasting money\n\nPersonally i believe the parents should be paying attention to where their money is going, or what they're kids are spending it on, i also believe the only money kids should be getting is their $5 a week for chores (or whatever they get paid) and whatever money they make on the side (lemonade stand, girl scout cookies and the like)\n\nHonestly, Gambling's never been my thing, but i do enjoy a good roll of the dice now and then (Slot machines are rigged, fuck those things)\n\nI don't really understand the concept behind the ban on loot crates, or if its just another Baby Boomers vs Gen Y/Millennials things.

I saw people lose their families, their houses and their dignity, as they tried to chase the prize that in their rational minds they knew was a 1 in 526 000 chance. There are so many barriers you can put in place, but for those with addiction issues the urge to get that rush from a win (even a small one) is too much.
