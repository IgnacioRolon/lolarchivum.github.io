I always get a respectable score, but i always seem to lose. \r\n\r\nLooking for tips if you can share.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-10-25T05:06:11.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm no expert on Diana but here are some ideas you can potentially work with.\n\nFirst off, I'm under the impression you can play her similarly to Zed by avoiding team fights altogether. Pick a side lane and split push hard. Her Q and W give her really strong wave clear and her passive allows her to knock down towers. You should be able to 1v1 whoever shows up (unless it's a really beefy tank or something) and if you kill them the opposing team will need to send more over to stop you. \n\nSimilarly, Diana's ability to get picks (on squishies) is insane. You can camp a brush in the enemy jungle when a blue or red buff is about to spawn, or maybe catch someone in a rotation. Of course, you'll need wards as there's always a chance you might end up the one caught but knowing Diana's burst can often allow her to 2v1. Heck, if you take TP you can make all sorts of plays and picks around the map and start objectives soon after.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-11-04T23:30:54.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This strategy change looks to be a good one. Took TP instead and concentrated on looking for opportunities to telegank and split - my K / A weren't much higher but my deaths have lowered a little. Hard to judge from the last game because there were some solid carries who carried me to be fair but I didnt struggle in lane and was able to TP in to a few good fights.

You should be in the jungle.\nYes, if the enemy team has a Katarina or something and you want to hardcounter her then sure Diana's the way to go in lane but generally for overall games you want to be the jungler.\n\nYour clear speed is great with your passive and technically your 'jungling abilities' are all AoE (with the exception of R of course). Also, your CC is valuable in ganks and arguably useful in laning as well, but as an AoE it'd be best against more than one target (e.g. jungler ganking bottom lane). The only downside is, is that your pre-6 ganks are pretty meh, so I often ask my teammates to hold out early game till I get Lvl6 then I gank 24/7. You have too much kill potential as jungle Diana post-6 once you have your ultimate.\n\nAnother thing is, is that Diana is probably the most under-appreciated snowballing assassin/fighter/hard carry. Thus you really don't want to bother trying to get fed off a solo lane opponent (unless you play her bot?? if MF supp is a thing lets make Diana supp a thing lmao), you really want to be roaming as much as possible. Yes, as a mid laner you can also roam, but as a jungler you're essentially permaroaming. For kills. To get you fed.\n\nHer 1v1 isn't bad considering she's an AP jungler and coupled with just a few items, your early game burst (early but still post-6) is tremendous and not only catches people off guard, but your chasing power (as long as you land the R reset with your Q mark) can straight up tilt enemies (especially the ADC).\n\nNow you say your problem is teamfights, well of course it still depends on the teamfights but with the right items and ability usage, once a teamfight occurs, you can serve as either/both CC provider with your E (honestly do NOT underestimate your E) or just jump in and burst down the enemy ADC. Remember, your burst is tremendous and unseen.\n\nDue to her mobility and reasonable AoE disruption & damage she's actually a really good early game skirmisher, especially since she has both great burst and great sustained damage (and great chasing power). Honestly at this stage I don't want to reveal how I'm currently abusing Diana cuz I really don't want Riot to nerf her but she's definitely either just nerf-worthy or on the edge of being nerf-worthy.","replies":[]}]}
