As far as I'm concerned if it's cosmetic only then there's no coercion there because it's basically the same principle as buying a mystery gift. \n\nThat said, I'm not a x age kid with little to no real life experience or concept of monetary value and for that demographic I agree that it can be very harmful. Which is precisely why gambling has an 18+ age gate (and frankly I think it should be more or a 18+ and have had to manage paying rent or some other consistent bill for at least 6 months gate). Kids, especially those paying for this stuff with their parents money and not their own have no concept of worth and shouldn't have access to this sorta chance stuff until they do.\n\nI have no problem with a free to play game making money off cosmetics, but holy shit EA have been shooting at the ground long enough I'm glad they finally shot themselves in the foot because really, they've been taking the piss for far too long.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2017-11-29T19:05:18.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I mean, I don't have nearly as big of a problem with loot boxes as a lot of people personally as long as they are only for cosmetics.

You need more Blue Essence to unlock it and that's done by even more RNG. Oh, You didn't get a champion you needed to get enough Blue Essence? Just play another 7 games and have another shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-30T04:47:12.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean we're more talking about the paid aspect of loot boxes more than the champion capsules.
