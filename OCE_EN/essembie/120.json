Satan. Ole Scratch. I'm happy to announce that I'm writing today's guest post. Jamie doesn't normally do guest posts, but I snuck up behind him with a big bottle of chloroform and bashed him over the head. It was hilarious.","url":"http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2018/01/using-psychology-and-loot-boxes-too-destroy-video-games-a-fun-and-practical-guide/","image":"http://www.psychologyofgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CODWW2.jpg"},"up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"&gt; So, gaming industry, if your aim is to bring down the jackboot of government regulation on loot mechanics and destroy what was once a source of joy to millions of gamers, you&rsquo;re doing a bangup job.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-05T01:50:23.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm yeah. I have always said I doubt the government will have an easy job classifying lootboxes as gambling because there are some arguments against it going by regular definitions of gambling (you always get something etc).\n\nBest way to solve it imo is to have any game with lootboxes or money related rng mechanics rated/labelled as such. Any game with that rating/label would then have to be for mature audiences only due to being exploitative of young people. Look at the games with these mechanics, League, Overwatch, CS:GO, Call of Duty and so on. All these games have massive portions of the player base being under 18. It wouldn't be worth any games revenue to lose out on these players for the whales above the age of 18.
