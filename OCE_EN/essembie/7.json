You're not gonna turn your back on a character into which you have invested 7 years worth of subscription fees and 7 years worth of time without some internal reflection. I dont know the stats so I am only making an educated guess, but I'd wager that subscriptions in WoW are not coming from new players but from people who already have sunk a great deal of time and money into the game.\n\nNot a whale in a compulsive spending sense which makes them a higher potential net worth than their non-whale peers (ie someone buying all skins in LoL vs someone who only does FTP), but a whale in the sense that they have sunk a great deal of cash into the game to the point where they would rather keep sinking cash into it rather than go cold turkey and walk away from a toon they spent years building. Once the hooks are in to this type of person, they are a reliable source of income for Blizzard.\n\nI was genuinely surprised to hear how big the population still was.
