I can agree with you, having quite a liking for Zed, that I can feel the difference of the shurikens, but the new items are exactly what a Zed would want. The new Phantom Dancer is the ultimate 1v1 item, and Zed excels at 1v1ing, this is just a buff for him. Not to mention items like Death's Dance and the new Yoummu's are excellent on him (first-hand experience). They may have nerfed his kit, but made up for it with his build.","replies":[]}]}]}
