The Australian Senate Environment and Communications References Committee has delivered its final report examining loot boxes in video games. The 'Gaming micro-transactions for chance-based items' report culminates in a single recommendation: that the Australian Government \"undertake a comprehensive review of loot boxes in video games.\"","url":"https://au.ign.com/articles/2018/11/27/australian-senate-report-recommends-comprehensive-review-of-loot-boxes","image":"https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/02/14/overwatch-loot-box---bing-images---2018-02-14-173924-1518651648280_1280w.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Local interest now.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-11-29T23:55:41.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What a load of shit. You buy 3 orbs for 750 RP (250 RP each) and get a skin. If ~60% of the skins are at least 975 RP or higher (it's closer to 70% if you include the 750 RP) you at least break even 60-70% of the time. You make a ~143% profit if you get a Legendary, ~50% profit if you get an Epic, ~320% profit if you get an Ultimate. Then you have Mythic skins that are invaluable (it usually takes about ~$100-worth of Orbs to get them through Gemstones).\n\nIn effect, you can get every skin in the game via the loot system at ~30% off.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2019-08-28T00:51:35.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"profit\"","replies":[]}]}]}
