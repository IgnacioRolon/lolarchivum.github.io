Has made a big difference. \n\nWon 7 out of my last 10 games and carried a lot of them. the losses were when I was negative or the team was flaming me (had two bad lanes each go 0/3 before 8 mins and they blamed jg (me) and that tilted me hard. But then I recognised the issue (my reaction to their stupidity) and am doing my best to be more positive.

Just cant seem to get a win at all.... Tilting so hard. Have pretty much given up on gold after coming so close most of the season.

If you really want to get silver you just have to NOT GIVE A F*CK ABOUT YOUR TEAM!  Focus on your lane, by beating your lane opponent on kills, assist and cs by any means (That means don't play support).  Also not giving a f*ck about your teammates mean if they flame you, don't respond back or if they feed don't respond or care about them. Of course i don't recommend doing this, but this is the easiest mindset if you really want to climb back to silver fast.\nBut hey if you can't do it then maybe you deserved bronze :P {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-12T02:56:37.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"never rely on your teammates in bronze elo\" - high level LoL players\neither you become a hero or zero","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-10-12T11:29:57.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen Kappa","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-10-01T12:31:40.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well im a top main, ive been sitting in low bronze all season and now im s4 im happy to bring someone along the trip if your happy playing with a tank top players. xD mundo is pretty much free LP but u know all the vayne mains make it difficult to continue im happy to duo. im a pretty dedicated player aswell just losing my mojo every now and then when i soloq and dont get top :/","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-02T00:15:26.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy to duo man. but I'm like the opposite of king midas at the moment.
