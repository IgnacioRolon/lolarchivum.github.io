Anyway i was winning games against plats and golds and matched againt diamonds and i still got 5 out of 10 and i get placed in b3? \r\nSo what that tells me is i start at 1200mmr so the first 5 games effect your mmr most right? Idk im probs wrong but i won 4 out of 5 for my first 5 so how did i place lower than 1200mmr? Like wtf how does there mmr calculator work? I loose more mmr than i gain even though i started fresh? Doesnt make sense i played against and with people who are much better and still held my own and even carried a few and my reward is being thrown back into bronze? Pretty annoying i wont lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-18T23:06:19.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, we don't actually know any MMR numbers, or the MMR algorithm, Anything you see on 3rd party website is not accurate because Riot hasn't released it to ANYONE. \n\nBeginning of season there is a thing we call \"soft reset\", and it basically boops your MMR down a couple of tiers (everybody gets this) and when you play your placement, your rank goes of this. You don't start fresh. It's pretty normal for someone in silver 5 to be placed in bronze 3, I was plat 4 into gold 5. \n\nLastly, the people that you VSed in flex queue doesn't actually mean much because if you did your placements during the \"oh no everything is broken\" phase, matchmaking was just a cluster ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥. If you did it recently and were still getting matched with gold-diamond players, its likely its because their flex queue rank is close to your predicted one (ended bronze 3). You have to look at flex ranks, not solo ranks as the MMR is separate.","replies":[{"poster":"XxEvo8xX","date":"2016-11-19T03:11:52.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay then well that makes me a little more hopeful, but i meant start fresh for the new flex que not solo que, thank you for the feedback and reply its much appreciated, also is the 'one more placement game' the final fix to solve that issue or will there be a final one released next patch?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-19T07:45:16.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Initial flex queue placements (what we are seeing now) were based of our solo q MMR. This will likely be the last time they interact with each other. On the 7th of December, season 7 will officially begin and both flex and solo q will be soft reset yet again, requiring another 10 game placement series.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
