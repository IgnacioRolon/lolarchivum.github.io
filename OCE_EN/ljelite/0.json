Basically what that means is that whatever your mmr is at the end of last season, it will be a little lower at the start of the next (preseason counts but not as much as your end of season rank). Assuming your mmr was B4 at the end of last season, even if you won all 10 you'd at best end up in the low end of B4 mmr wise.\n\nThe system exists to account for those who do not play ranked frequently. If your mmr still matched your skill at season end then theoretically you will have little trouble climbing back to where you were. If your mmr was higher than your skill then the reset drops you back to about where you should be (basically it tries to account for skill degradation).\n\nUnfortunately for someone like you that puts you back in B5 which is notoriously difficult to leave. All I can say is I wish you the best of luck in escaping B5.","replies":[{"poster":"Ljelite","date":"2016-02-05T04:25:08.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well fair enough :/ thanks for the explenation","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T05:26:31.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it sucks for you :( But if you did it once you can do it again!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
