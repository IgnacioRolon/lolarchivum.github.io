If not get onto the home page and check it out!\r\nNow we all know that over the years Riot has become better and better and fleshing out Runterra and giving life to the place we all call home. From small things like the dragon flying into the map from the topside at the start of the game, to interactive comics, trailers, music videos and awesome lore!\r\n\r\nIn my most recent game of League I was waiting in the river at the start of the game in an attempt to ward off an invade when I heard someone, or something, laughing at me! I ignored it for a while but it plagued me for the rest of the game and it wasn&#039;t until the game was over that I realized I had heard that booming laugh once before! Now again I would like to say watch the River King video if you haven&#039;t because otherwise this wont make much sense, but it seems that Riot has left us a nice little spoiler on the river! I only recall hearing it before 2 minutes in games I have played, but if you are around the river and hear that booming laugh, it might be safest to find a jungle buddy closer to dry land ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-20T06:37:50.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were on the boards for at least a week you would have been told what you are telling us, everyone knows","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-20T03:00:46.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, the laugh at river has been there for like 2 patches now. everyone knows about it.","replies":[{"poster":"TheNutriBullet","date":"2015-06-20T03:54:46.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol well noone told me!
