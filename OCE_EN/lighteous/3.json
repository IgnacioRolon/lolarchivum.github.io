To do that I&#039;m required to sign in, which I can&#039;t.\n\nPlease send help. Thank you. I&#039;m getting tired of creating threads to ask for help. I even had to post in the announcement board.\n\nEDIT: POSSIBLE SOLUTION (FOUND IT MYSELF BECAUSE RIOT IS TOO BUSY TO DEAL WITH THEIR ONE CUSTOMER).\n\nCan you sign in to Riot Support Page? Why I ask this is because the issue with the shop is connected with this, at least that's the case for me.\n\nIf you can, that means your problem is not the same with mine (or rather the cause of the issue).\n\nIf you can't access the sign in page or bump into \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\", you can look up on that errors and try the popular solutions. Also that means you are probably having the same issue as mine.\n\nThe fix I've found (after trying many popular solutions) is to disable your TCP/IPv6. That fixed it for me. I can sign in the support site and the Lunar Revel Shop button appeared for me.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-30T08:14:38.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please try resetting your Internet Explorer settings.
