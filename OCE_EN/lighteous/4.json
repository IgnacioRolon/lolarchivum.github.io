Posted in the support section to ask for help. Was told to launch a support ticket.\n\nThen Riot says the shop issue is fixed. But it wasn&#039;t for mine.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/vEKNtFN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vEKNtFN.jpg)\n\nSo I went to the support page. Needs me to sign in to send a ticket. Couldn&#039;t sign in.\n\n[http://i.imgur.com/AnAD0Fj.png](http://i.imgur.com/AnAD0Fj.png)\n\nSo now I&#039;m stuck here until any Red replies to my comments (Reported my issues in &quot;Help &amp; Support&quot; and even the announcement board).\n\nI&#039;m starting to get frustrated with the continuous issues (Just only the recent days I have the &quot;Couldn&#039;t enlist in Ocean Week&quot; issue.) I just want to participate in your events Riot, why is it so hard? I had 2 friends who started on this server fresh alongside me, and they have zero problem.\n\nI&#039;ve tried repairing my client, re-logged several times, before and after Riot said it&#039;s fixed. Doesn&#039;t work.\n\nI don&#039;t understand why is it so hard to make my client work the same way as everyone else&#039;s.\n\n/Rant end\n\n**EDIT: POSSIBLE SOLUTION (FOUND IT MYSELF BECAUSE RIOT IS TOO BUSY TO DEAL WITH THEIR ONE CUSTOMER).**\n\n* Can you sign in to Riot Support Page? Why I ask this is because the issue with the shop is connected with this, at least that's the case for me.\n \n* If you can, that means your problem is not the same with mine (or rather the cause of the issue).\n \n* If you can't access the sign in page or bump into \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\", you can look up on that errors and try the popular solutions. Also that means you are probably having the same issue as mine.\n \n* The fix I've found (after trying many popular solutions) is to disable your TCP/IPv6. That fixed it for me. I can sign in the support site and the Lunar Revel Shop button appeared for me.\n\nAlso, it feels weird when as someone who isn't as tech savvy can find the solution, while a corporate giant with huge human resources and tech knowledge can't help me. (Or can't help me in time before I solved it myself anyway. Since this is obviously not high in their priority list, because you know, I'm just 1 potential customer while they have more than thousands RP spenders.)","replies":[]}
