Anyone else has this problem?\n\n**EDIT: POSSIBLE SOLUTION (FOUND IT MYSELF BECAUSE RIOT IS TOO BUSY TO DEAL WITH THEIR ONE CUSTOMER).**\n\n**Can you sign in to Riot Support Page? Why I ask this is because the issue with the shop is connected with this, at least that's the case for me.**\n\n**If you can, that means your problem is not the same with mine (or rather the cause of the issue).**\n\n**If you can't access the sign in page or bump into \"ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED\", you can look up on that errors and try the popular solutions. Also that means you are probably having the same issue as mine.**\n\n**The fix I've found (after trying many popular solutions) is to disable your TCP/IPv6. That fixed it for me. I can sign in the support site and the Lunar Revel Shop button appeared for me.**\n\nAlso, it feels weird when as someone who isn't as tech savvy can find the solution, while a corporate giant with huge human resources and tech knowledge can't help me. (Or can't help me in time before I solved it myself anyway. Since this is obviously not high in their priority list, because you know, I'm just 1 potential customer while they have more than thousands RP spenders.)","replies":[{"poster":"INox SekethThoth","date":"2016-01-29T23:22:12.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see the shop either and it's like this since yesterday, all my friends are buying skins and I can't since it hasn't appeared not even once {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lighteous","date":"2016-01-31T10:48:18.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you sign in to Riot Support Page?
