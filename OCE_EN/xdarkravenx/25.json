The only problem i have with vayne is when my team have no clue how to counter her, or they try 1v1 one her when she is behind because they think she is weak due to being behind then give her an easy kill as she is one of the BEST 1v1 champions in the game, certainly second only to Quinn as an ADC that can 1v1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-11T07:28:33.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pink ward + oracle lens = counter vayne ult  and exhaust to reduce 40% attack speed \n\nAs for yorick I have no idea really but play safe since its a cancerous lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-09-08T12:53:14.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ganks? i dont play much no more but both champs still seem like immobile sacks of shit.
