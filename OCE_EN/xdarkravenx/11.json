The only reason your stuck is because your too lazy to figure out how to climb. \nHere's a video for you to improve and take it to heart. This guy explains how to get better and banishes every excuse a low elo player gives, giving you the strong mindset needed to deal with rank. If you can't take the insults and listen openly to his advice then you don't have the mental strength to even touch rank. \nHope it helps :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2wCGpugcRw","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-25T03:28:32.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel the statement that everyone has the potential to reach higher elo is bullcrap because I've managed to miss a warwick ult before and I mean if you can't even land a warwick ult, you should probably uninstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-25T09:19:22.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh I've been there :P Maybe not with a WW ult but certainly with other \"this is not a skill shot how the hell can you miss you potato\" kinda deals (Lulu E is a big offender being both ally and enemy castable).","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-10-25T09:22:49.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk man, the lowest elo i was in was bronze 1 where everyone said i would keep dropping.
