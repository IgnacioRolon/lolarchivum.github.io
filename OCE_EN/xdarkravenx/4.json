Also if you master a champion, you know their damage so you don't commit and the enemy survives meaning your death. \n\nI don't really ward myself because I always forget to place them but they're really good to avoid ganks and death. Also don't main top lane because it has lowest carry potential, mid has the best carry potential due to roaming everywhere and not relying on their team like a jungler does after ganking.\n\nTL;DR\n- learn to CS (read the instructions in my post)\n- learn how much damage you can do so you don't overcommit and don't kill them\n- main mid or jungle for highest carry potential\n- roam roam roam, if you're top use TP, mid just run bot/top","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-15T23:56:07.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Introducing, the Rhyming Rule:\n\n[**_LIVE AND DIE BY CONDON'S GUIDE._**](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=71443)\nclick to improve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-15T23:38:07.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Learn to farm well. You could try making a full AD rune page, practicing in custom games, or playing champs that can instantly kill a wave with abitilies to help improve this. Also, don't try to go for kills in lane, just focus on farming until you can last hit most or all of the minions consistently. This will give you a LOT more money and items, and make you significantly more effective later in the game.\n\n- Die less. Every time you die try to think what you could have done to prevent it. Did you pick a fight you couldn't win? Were you playing to aggresively without vision when the jungler could be near? Did you not look at the minimap to see someone coming for you? Did you stay around on low hp when you should've backed? Stuff like that. The more time you spend dead, the less farm and exp you get and the less useful you will be later in the game.\n\n- Play easy champions. You're better off playing a mediocre champion well than playing a good champion poorly. The more effort you have to put into playing your champ effectively the less you have for focusing on your general gameplay, map awareness etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-15T19:32:53.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on what you play normally (what role you prefer) i can maybe give you some tips, however my knowledge kinda drops off somewhat at ADC's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-15T15:58:38.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously? you are very lucky.. it has gotten worse tbh.. but some tips are Mute button and dont feed.. literally only go off there mistakes dont make them.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2015-05-15T16:36:04.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GptKM9KP,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-15T15:58:38.962+0000)\n>\n> Seriously? you are very lucky.. it has gotten worse tbh.. but some tips are Mute button and dont feed.. literally only go off there mistakes dont make them.\n\nAlright, Mute Button sounds really fun to use, and for the feeding part...
