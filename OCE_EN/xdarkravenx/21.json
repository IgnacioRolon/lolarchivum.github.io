Both can lock down a TON of people with a TON of CC and both have pretty good sustained and burst damage.\n\nThe only difference is, is that Gnar is somewhat less reliable in the sense that his major teamfighting ability, his ultimate is only situationally ready. Not only is it only able to be casted as Mega Gnar but also runs on a cooldown. Lissandra on the other side, her CC is more than reliable and sometimes downright unfair. Gnar has slows, stuns and an airborne+stun, Lissandra has slows, snares (I'm pretty sure her W is only a snare) and stuns. The main difference is, is that since Gnar's ultimate is rare, a good Gnar ultimate and your team will praise you like a god. On the other hand, land good CC as Lissandra and that somewhat unfair ultimate on the enemy ADC and you'll be able to tilt the enemy hard. Works both ways in my opinion.\n\nThat said, Lissandra can be built as a 'tanky' mage with items like RoA or Abyssals and due to the sheer amount of utility she has, even if she gets behind or doesn't buy enough damage, she'll still be relevant on all stages of the game. If you die just to land a crucial stun on their ADC since you're so unfed, your team should still be able to win the fight even after your death.\nGnar on the other hand does have a somewhat vulnerable laning phase until he gets a few levels and items, his first few levels he can be very squishy. After that, transitioning into mid and late game shouldn't be a problem. If you do get behind, your damage won't be too relevant but the passive pressure you give the enemies when you're hanging around them as Mega Gnar will scare them away.\n\nSo overall, Lissandra would still be more reliable than Gnar, especially in terms of being a team player. Plus, Lissandra is usually played mid so she can roam and offer utility for all lanes, on the other hand Gnar at top lane is somewhat isolated. \n\nThe choice is yours, but since I have both, all I can say is that if I were to play for a victory, it'd be Lissandra anyday.\n\n{{champion:127}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:127}} {{champion:150}}","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-08-28T12:13:38.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=REAKTOR 6,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8Ul8KwZH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-08-28T11:55:33.767+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;re two champions who have just as many similarities as differences.\n> \n> The biggest difference of course is that one&#x27;s a tanky AD fighter and the other&#x27;s a utility AP mage, but overall their jobs can be quite similar.
