Its great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. \n\n1) Your game play and how to improve\n2) Your attitude towards the game and your ranking.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-08-29T03:31:58.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Marauder plz :(","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-29T03:48:03.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats wrong?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-08-29T03:59:22.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think linking Gbay's dying/Objective vids will also help.\n\nAnd there really needs to be boards dedicated to this stuff, hang on brb got ideas now.\nSomething maybe the whole boards can work on.\n\nAlso I help these guys too, just everyone got here first XD","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-29T06:04:16.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gameplay and Strat is the right place for this! =D\n\nKeep up the good work.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-08-29T06:25:43.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, being silly XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-08-29T08:49:00.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are full of shit, but than again I have always thought that about anyone who works for Riot.
