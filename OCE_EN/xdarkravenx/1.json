I bought Kindred today and I could only play her ONCE because people called their role before me all the time.\n\nWhere's our Normals Draft mode?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-09-19T10:06:00.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"As riot has said we don't have the population to support both blind and draft pick its either one or the other and I honestly prefer blind pick to draft.

Most or all of these can be solved if Draft pick for normals was on the OCE server think about it. You pick 2 roles. 50/50 you get either role. No arguments, no instalocker, no fucking of anyones mother, father, sister ect.\nJust like the guy above said, he wanted to play kindred and didn't get the chance cause roles are called. BOOM, Draft pick, he picks ADC or JG and either role he gets to play kindred. It's a Win Win. And idk who the \"Majority\" of people is that likes blind pick, but it sure seems none existent. Also that whole \"Too small of a population\" That's an excuse we all know that","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-09-19T14:48:07.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 if he wants to play kindred then he can he doesn't need to be jg or adc iv played her both mid and top with no problems. Fuck before they nerfed kindred into the ground I would use her for any role but support, also I honestly hate the whole pick your lane before the game. It's so easy for the enemy to counter pick if you are first pick.\nAs for the majority thing I said I was using that as an example fuck if I know if the majority want blind or draft idk. \nAs for the population thing when u consider Lol has about 100 million players a Month and when u consider that of those 100 million only 1.67% is made up of the oce sever we really are a tiny sever.

That's enough for something like 7000 games to be held at once if everyone was online all day every day. Which they aren't. Then also don't forget a good portion on those are probably smurf accounts. And don't forget we had team build a few years back and we all know how well that work, u ended up waiting 30 minutes for a game. So unless u want to force people into support cos let's face it, in normals 90% of people don't want to play support so if riot makes them play support they will be on the Boards bitching about how they never get their role and they get shafted with support so no we can't support another permanent queue","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-09-20T00:17:24.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is mixing dynamic queue with draft.
