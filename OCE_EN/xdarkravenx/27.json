That said, players who are new to ranked start with an MMR equivalent to Silver 5 and the 10 placement games they play have a much higher impact on MMR than any games they would play after being placed. Any player who's new to ranked who starts with several consecutive wins would end up being matched in mid silver during their placements.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-22T01:30:56.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So that's why I get people who play their first ranked game in my games at the moment?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-22T02:17:49.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's their first ranked game of the season, then it's likely they finished in high Silver - low Gold last season.
