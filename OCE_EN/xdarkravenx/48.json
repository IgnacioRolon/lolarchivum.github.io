There is no reason to die with your team, if they do something dumb, you have the option of just walking away and honestly by following that teemo, instead of having 1 feeder on the team, your team now had to deal with 2. \n\nAlso you can get reported for all sorts of things, especially in low elo. Things such as picking a champion for your lane that you got assigned but someone else on your team decided they didn't want to support and wanted to steal mid or top or whatever (I'm a support main so I always get my lane). Picking an ap support champion like sona, morgana, zyra, ect...  and not picking a tank even though you have an irelia top, because your adc wanted alistair or something and yet you know that a magic damage carry champion would be better because everyone else on your team is ad (Zed mid, Irelia top,  jungle pantheon and Ashe adc) and will be shut down the moment the enemy toplane malphite decides that he should buy an armour item or the jungle rammus decides to just get 2 thornmails (even though passive doesn't stack) because yolo. I even once got reported because my adc was feeding and this was because I wasn't peeling enough and following him (to be fair I was alistair) whilst he decided that at 1-3-0 it would be a good idea to proxy behind tower against a 4-0 jihn.\n\nTry not to get too angry about being reported because no matter how nice, skilled and chipper you are, eventually some knobhead is going to report you, but these odd reports aren't going to be remotely enough to ban you, so don't get stressed about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-27T23:43:52.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I get a troll/silly support I just stand at the turret and wave clear under it.
