Especially this season in OCE, from what I've seen silver 5 players are the worst. Worse than Bronze 1 and 2 by a long way. If you are in the bot lane god help you.\nThe only thing you can do is stay calm, and try to focus on cs. Use pings to let your support know what to do. That includes backing off if they are doing stupid plays. Think before you follow them on those stupid plays. If they die after a stupid play, but you stay alive, that's good. Mute those idiots that say the ADC should dive in to the middle of the teamfight. Don't even bother talking to noobs, they won't take your advice for one thing, and secondly it affects your own game. MUTE MUTE MUTE. It's not worth talking to shitters. Find a reliable support to duo with next season. Practice your farming and kiting in bot games. Don't cheese the bots, take them head on for real practice, push the limits of your champion pool. If games are unwinnable, still keep focusing objectives. Throws happen all of the time in ~~low elo~~ oce games. Pick early game laning champions, e.g. for ADC: Caitlyn, Jhin... or you could pick a safe self peeling ADC champion such as Ezreal. Don't pick champions that are mechanically intensive if you can't play them (e.g. Vayne, Ashe, Draven, Tristana). Your team will be useless, expect it when you start the game. As an ADC, be ruthless and selfish. Take ALL of the farm that you can. Rob jungle camps and Red Buffs when its safe to do so. Do what you must to get the objectives, but don't listen to shitters if you **_understand_** what they are telling you is wrong. Make sure that you realise what I'm saying here. Knowing is not the same as understanding. Be constantly doing something positive on the map, never fuck around wasting time (e.g. killing a scuttle crab as adc when there is a wave coming to your bot tower, just an example, even if stupid one). Buy a pink ward to help with vision control. Upgrade to blue trinket at level 9 to avoid facechecking. If it's a very long game, convince your team to pressure the map for objectives, not go into the jungle and farm (especially if you mostly are full build). Find a coach on lol-coaching.com to help you improve. Get op.gg to record your games, and let a coach vod review them for you (if you want me to do this I can help for a small fee for my time spent). Watch youtube videos on how to escape low elo or just improve at the game (PantsAreDragon and Phylol are good users to watch).\n\ni could offer 1000000 pieces of advice, it's up to you really. Good luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-10-30T10:13:57.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often I experience similar feelings of being out of touch like I am not performing as well as I should be. The thing that I first try to do is identify the main part of my gameplay that I feel I have been falling behind on. Sometimes it can be I have fallen out of touch with CS or trading in lane. After playing a few games with looking out for what in your gameplay needs to be improved or fixed you can switch your focus in coming games to improve on that area of your mechanics or knowledge.\n\nOther times it can be a mental thing. Often you can feel like you haven't played as well as you should be when you simply have raised your standards above how well you play. This can be a good thing though as it is something to strive to improve from and a goal to work towards with how good you are at league. These mental issues often happen around worlds time of year though.\n\nQuite a lot of people if not majority are watching games that are being played during worlds are seeing the amazing gameplay that is on display from the best players in the world. This can often effect our mentality and make us feel like we could be performing better off of what we have seen others do.\n\nWith these things in mind what I would recommend you do is over the next few games take note of the main things in your gameplay that you feel like you could have done better at. Try to stick to champions and roles that you know so it feels familiar and it is easier to focus on your mechanics themselves. After doing this for a while you will notice patterns popping up in the areas that you can improve on.\n\nOnce these patterns arrive and show themselves you will know what to improve off of and where to go next as to what to improve.\n\nAll up hope my advice helped mate and good luck on improving your gameplay. If you have any questions about what I said or in general let me know. Good luck out there!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-10-29T14:51:25.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver is cancer, im stuck in atm and i like to consider myself a reasonably good support but you always get people who feed on your team. Although what I have noticed in many games in silver is that it is completely small fights orientated with almost no team fights,  your laning will ultimately determine the game. Most people in silver do not build defence or health (in terms of mid, adc, sup and jng, dependent on the champion). Try and use this to your advantage, also always try to pick counters, as not many people in silver do this either (e.g pick morg if against thresh, not sona). ALSO (sorry for the probs 10th also) DO BUILD DEFENSIVE! I've played as a sona little to no ap items (like dead man's plate) and managed to carry my team, armour or magic pen is not a thing tbh in lower elo.
