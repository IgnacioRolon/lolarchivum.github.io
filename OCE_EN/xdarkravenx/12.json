You had a volibear with really high MMR (possibly duoing with you or another person on your team). \n\nThe amount of times i've verused diamonds when i was climbing it plat was ridiculous. Its how you prove you belong in that elo. If you can't beat silvers, you probably don't belong in silver (match making logic). \n\nAlso people in division 5 (silver 5/gold 5) can have an MMR thats lower, but they dont drop straight away.
