While Jinx gains Raw AOE strength poor trist really one gets the ability to shoot 2 other people. So you're probably thinking why not just not build PD well in terms of Single target DPS Jhin Lucian and Vayne are pretty (Y) right now. Where as last year alot of carries didn't have juicy new kits with new items to play with. So tristana's Single target was pretty reliable then, but from what i remember Jinx was the star of the show 2015. AN popping off","replies":[]}]}
