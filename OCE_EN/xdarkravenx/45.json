Kat is unlikely to take you from 100-0 in laning phase but will look to make favourable trades until you're low enough to finish off. If you try your best to stay healthy and/or be the one making the favourable trades you will usually have enough time to react to her all in, unless it's a well timed gank that catches you off guard. Of course, it depends on the matchup as well. A Lissandra who can just ult Kat or herself is going to survive more often than a Lux potentially would. Finally, pushing her wave into tower and warding the river will hopefully stop her from roaming and give you the knowledge if she does so that your team can attempt to deny Kat from snowballing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-27T23:53:47.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The absolute fastest reaction time recorded is 0.101 seconds.

The death recap will indeed state the damage took and time taken to deliver said damage.\nBut that's damage taken after getting close and activating her ability(s). It does sound absurd to be able to react to her Shunpo, but I have seen people with some amazing flash/zhonyas reaction times against kat.\n\nI have fluked a reaction on zhonyas to her Shunpo, where I was waiting for her to basically dissapear and my zhonyas activated in the time she dissapears to the time she reappeared (seen this on replay slowed). The down side, she Shunpo'd to the guy next to me so it was kind of a waste lol. Saved me from her ultimate but.\n\nSo it's possible, albeit difficult","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-28T00:50:04.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to admit though, having a champion that is \"possible to escape from, if you fluke it\" isn't exactly healthy for the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-28T00:58:21.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha true.

Sure it does alot of damage but unless you forgot to ward or you're really clumped up and low hp you can generally stop her; also at low elo you'll a number of katarina's who don't understand the point of chain casting your ult and so there will be that extra 0.1s delay.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-28T01:47:12.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need to predict her shunpo location and when it happens set up the cc right behind her target and you'll put her at your mercy, cc'd and without her ult or shunpo.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-28T01:45:37.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build mr, don't let her wear you down from afar with her Q, don't pick a champ she can out-stat/out-maneuver :l???? http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/y3y9Hcgn-aram-team-serious-aram-players-only?comment=0009 (???exampleszzz???) Oh yeah turn on smart-cast if you want fast casting too, but personally I don't like using it because of aiming in tight fights (everybody's like in a mosh pit\n), people misleading skill shots into missing or enemies running almost into range then backing out to lead you towards them. Preferably if you know ability ranges by heart. I even use dorans on ranged champions sometimes (e.g Teemo vs Ryze top).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-27T20:52:25.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Kat is a bit like Leblanc. It can be hard to react in time, but you can try to think from the Kat's perspective to _predict_ what they will do next. For LB it's always pretty obvious when she's going to dash in, so you can prepare your cc accordingly. Similarly with Kat, she's always going to be looking for a chance to jump in and get some damage off. Play proactively instead of reactively against her :)","replies":[]}]}
