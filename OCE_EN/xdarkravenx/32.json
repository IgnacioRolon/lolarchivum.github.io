Fuck this community honestly. Just had a game with an Illaoi afk because Jhin accidentally stole blue with his 4th shot doing 1500 damage to it and he went fucking ape shit mad, afk&#039;ed and walked around the base and spammed abilities so he doesn&#039;t get the afk warning. At the end of the game, we told the enemies to report Illaoi, and they said no because Illaoi took their towers and give Kha&#039;Zix &quot;me&quot; gold when I ganked.\n\nI&#039;m honestly so fucking pissed right now, I hate being racist and I don&#039;t wanna sound like a racist but these fucking asians are obnoxious (coming from an asian, me.) They always fucking do shit when something doesn&#039;t go their way. Literal fucking cancer this community, can&#039;t even have one game without one obnoxious %%%% just being a piece of shit after something doesn&#039;t go their way.","replies":[{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-11-05T12:57:45.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BRO BRO CALM THE FUCK DOWN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-04T23:43:48.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter if the enemy team reported them or not, even just 1 report is enough to trigger the system. \n\nAs long as you are reporting accurately (for an actual reason, e.g, not reporting players for feeding when they have a bad game), the weight your reports will be quite high and will be looked into more seriously. Feedback in cases like these may not be instant, as it isn't as easy to detect as toxic chat and int feeding. Rest assured, if this is common behaviour for the players they will get punished for it. \n\nEven if you are frustrated af, its not a good idea to turn to being a racist/ general ♥ ♥ ♥. Verbalise your frustration IRL or do something to productively work it out, before you get in trouble for typing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-05T01:07:10.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It doesn&#x27;t matter if the enemy team reported them or not, even just 1 report is enough to trigger the system. \n\nWell from my experience I'm going to have to say that's false, I have reported players countless times for obvious ban worthy actions and only very rarely do I actually get the notification that the player was actually banned. And I'll tell you 100% of these reports I know the player should be getting some sought of ban I don't just report because I'm mad/toxic these players are always sneaking through the system because its rubbish and barely works","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-05T05:38:22.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> very rarely do I actually get the notification that the player was actually banned.\n\nTo clarify, the system currently only notifies the *most recent* player to submit a report (apparently Riot is looking to change this but, let's be honest, they've not given an update yet). So if you were to report someone, they went on to play another match and got reported in that game you wouldn't receive a notification when they got punished. Even if you reported them, and then someone else from the same match reported them you wouldn't receive a notification.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-11-05T03:32:04.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-05T05:35:04.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> walked around the base and spammed abilities so he doesn't get the afk warning.\n\nI'm pretty sure this actually does nothing to stop people being picked up by Leavebuster. If I'm not mistaken, the system is set up to identify whether or not someone is \"actively contributing\" by looking at factors such as: damage dealt to and received from enemy champions (and probably even minions/monsters/turrets), whether the person actually leaves the base area, whether the person buys items (and if they sell all their items), experience and gold gains etc.\n\nSo basically, it really shouldn't matter that they did that because they *should* still get picked up by the system, especially if they got reported (even if it was just one report).","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-11-05T04:24:17.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's gone 11 losses, 7 wins in his ranked games.
