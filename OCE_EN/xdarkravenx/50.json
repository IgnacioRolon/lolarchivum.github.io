That is 1000+ arseholes I want nothing to do with and, ... everytime I go to block someone or find someone I wish to 'unblock' because sometimes they will reform (not often enough tho) I have to see disgusting names like \"JewBBQ\" - which just happens to top the list.

It can be toxic at times but amazing at other times. I've had some real rotters in normals and sometimes in the rotating gamemode too but overall it's still fun. I find ranked is overall the least toxic environment despite what people say but that's just me and maybe being midsilver (though I'm definitely bronze level) just has the most chill and friendly players.","replies":[]}]}
