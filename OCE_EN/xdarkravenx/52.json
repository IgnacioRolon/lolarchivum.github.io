There&#039;s nothing I can do in lane, he literally does 90% of the damage then the ADC just picks me off without even trying. I can&#039;t even farm because if I go close he&#039;ll just W me doing 1/3 of my health in one hit at level 2.\r\n\r\nHow the fuck do I play against this? It&#039;s honestly hell it makes me wanna not play a role that I enjoy playing to a role I&#039;m not good at so I don&#039;t have to lane with that piece of shit Brand support.","replies":[{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-03T02:59:06.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play in behind minion waves, and you sidestep the w.

The biggest problem I faced during that time was that getting cc'ed or hit by a well timed gank (or both) meant I was usually dead, especially when I had just used/missed my abilities.  \n\nConsidering that Brand's playstyle is so aggressive, that period of vulnerability is quite often. Similarly, there is a decent chance that Brand will continue to play aggressively in an attempt to get back into the game despite being in a losing lane or having used summoner spells, a point at which your lead can be furthered.\n\nAdmittedly, the solution I'm suggesting is to work together. I realise that isn't always going to be easy when many Brand supports are able to outplay multiple opponents at the same time. On the flipside, I find that very same confidence usually puts them in a position where a bit of synergy can wipe the grin off their face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-03T03:35:33.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should change it so if he does ew his secondary effect is consumed, so he cant stun then still do the 150% or whatever w damage","replies":[]}]}
