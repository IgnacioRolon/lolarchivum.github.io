Ekko fed, died 7 times in a row while trying to fight Teemo. Our MF took smite and didn&#039;t know how to lane... tilting our Lux supp beyond horizontal and having a toxic flame war. Tryn is just minding his own business, farming the enemy jungle and repeatedly dying missing his ult many times.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m here trying to help Lux, she told me I should go supp Miss Fortune, but I told her that if I did I was gonna lose mid tower. She somewhat stayed in lane with me, winning a few fights against Zed who I barriered whenever he ulted me. Got Lux going APC which actually help us A LOT in the match, MF just doing her own thing farming minions without even trying to last hit and stealing our junglers buffs and killing out all the monsters. Ekko is still doing his thing, trying to fight Teemo, at around this time, Teemo was really fed&mdash;literally destroying us.\r\n\r\nLux wanted to surrender so bad, but I kept telling her &quot;I&#039;m not gonna lose this game,&quot; so she just went along with it.\r\n\r\nKha&#039;Zix was a huge problem, he was rather very predictable but completely irrelevant the whole game. And their Thresh... god who knows what the enemy Thresh is doing... trying to 1v1 Tryn, then trying to 1v1 me... then at this point of the game, Lux started working with me, I stayed with her while MF still running around doing whatever the hell she wants, lmao. Tryn is pushing top lane while it&#039;s literally 3v5 for the rest of the game because MF was just running around solo killing the enemy at random times, and ulting at the PERFECT, literally the PERFECT moments when she DOES JOIN the teamfights&mdash;just killing them without mercy.\r\n\r\nI literally had the impression that MF was a smurf pretending to be bad at the game... but I kept it too myself. Lux and I actually destroyed the enemies one by one because their coordination was subpar, we pushed all the way to their Nexus towers in ONE go after acing them, destroying one Nexus tower.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, MF is still farming jungle and Tryn just trying to solo the last Nexus tower, dying to a really fed Teemo. After that, Thresh tried to 1v1 me again... not so sure why but whatever we killed him, then pushed and when we got in a teamfight... this MF had the best game changing ult I&#039;ve ever seen, obliterating the enemy team in one go.\r\n\r\nThen we end lol, surprisingly, Lux thanked me for untilting her and laughing at my comment on how MF could be a smurf pretending to be bad at the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-06T02:34:23.136+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love pulling together with the team and coming through with a comeback victory! it's one of the best experiences in League. Awesome work man!","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-09-08T11:11:15.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually hate it most times. I love a close game, where skill level is more even and great team plays are done by both sides. \n\nThe problem with these comeback games is the fact you feel so stressed out still at the end, the weird mess up plays people make just aggravate and you end up doing all the heavy lifting. He is just lucky only one person was toxic in chat, 2 or 3 of them all bad mouthing each other then going silent to win the game is one of the worst things ever as you still remain tilted even though you win.\n\nThis game he explained seemed like just a bad start game, i doubt it was some Cinderella story as he would probably rip his hair out at the end of the game still.\n\nFunny thing is he probably only won the game after one fight because the enemy team was more toxic than his own team, people who are ahead or get a lot of kills then lose a fight are more likely to rage at their team over people who are losing then lose a fight. So that one ace probably pissed off the enemy team so much that one or two gave up giving his team the edge to win. I mean i wish i could see the chat log so i could confirm but i think the come back was more due to toxicity rather than his own team waking up. Or maybe the story about his team was embellished a little. I mean look at the kill order. Ekko only died 3 times before the 25 minute mark. Not 7 times in a row. And Trynd was ganking a lot but was dying to teemo probably because he thought he needed to gank more. Ekko died 5 times after 25 minutes so he wasn't doing that bad. He was going tank ekko after all, so dying for his team is kind of his job at that point as long as his doing damage on them, so he was doing his job and helping from the start. Trynd was kinda dropping the ball, but he is a weaker jungle at OP's MMR so you can't expect a guy of his level to pull insane mad plays. And MF was doing amazingly from the start. Sure MF died as FB but her early game is pretty weak so its to be expected when against a thresh who has insane CC and if played aggressively it is easy to land a first blood on a champ with no mobility, and the kill if you look at the kill map, was early game (level 1 or 2) so MF wouldn't even have any mobility, and his death print is under the tower.\n\nThe lux later died at which it seems he GAVE UP on his lane after ONE death which means MF wasn't doing anything wrong other than not playing how lux wanted too, which kind of agree's with what OP said, yet also doesn't because at this point in the game (8 minutes in) you can't really tell if the MF is doing anything absurd or silly, sure he took smite but everyone makes a mistake. Also the game ended very shortly after the nexus tower kill they got, which kind of tells me the enemy just gave up and didn't come back to fight after it went down. Because there was a solid 2 minutes after the team fight where another kill was made. \n\nSo this wasn't as much a come back other than a embellished story of a game they would of won in the first place as long as they didn't /ff. \n\nThe MF being bad at first is the thing that showed this was really a made up story sadly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-06T12:04:07.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish more of my games are like this.\n\nBut I'm surprised that you can still win with a very toxic team that does their own stuff and nobody likes each other.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-07T15:34:06.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing to be surprised about:\n\nApply some common sense, realize that amount of toxicity does not affect amount of skill in any shape or form.\n\nBronze I toxic player will always be bronze I toxic player and diamond I toxic player will always be diamond I toxic player (until they get banned hehe xd)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-06T06:11:40.402+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love these sorts of games, where you just grind through and finish out on top.\n\nToo many times where the enemy or my team FF @ 20, when all it takes is them or us to throw 1 team fight, and it can change the favor of the game completely!\nAs proven many times in come back games I have been apart of, with or against, where FF was just not an option to be considered.\n\nI think many just get bored or tilted far too easily and decide throwing in the towel first chance is just easier.

When i read your description i thought the game went on for an hour! lol\n\nAnyway i love the feeling when we win because someone on the enemy team feeds when their 30 kills ahead and then you come back. SOOOOOO GOOOD.\n\nI had a match where a malphite (my team) fed a quinn top and my jg was shit af. I was tf, and did alright. Eventually late game came around, and they were taking our nexus turrets cause they were so fed. The only members on our team was the Malphite and an almost-full build twitch. What happened next was so amazing. \nMalphite ulted the whole team, and twitch ulted and the piercing autos got him a pentakill. Eventually, I backdoored their nexus and we won.\n\nFeelsGoodMan","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-06T12:01:30.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It felt like an hour!\n\nBut yeah, there comes a time when the winning team starts throwing. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-09-05T12:51:03.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
