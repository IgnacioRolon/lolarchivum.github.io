The more you win, the higher the level of competition you face. That's the whole point.\n\nNow, we all get winning/losing streaks, sometimes you'll win up to 10 in a row, maybe get unlucky and lose 10 in a row, but it evens out over time. That is the point of matchmaking. This is why most players with thousands of wins in a given format, will have close to a similar number of loses.\n\nFor example, I have over 5000 games of ARAM played on this account, and I'm at like 51-52% win rate. I am unranked, but most of my ARAM games include high gold/plat/diamond players, sometimes even master or challenger.\n\nThe whole point of matchmaking, isn't so that you can aspire to 100% win rate, it's to match you with people of your own level, which will usually eventuate in around 50% wins.\n\nThat's the whole point, wtf are you on about?","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-09-07T08:44:10.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless he's a good player in Bronze.
