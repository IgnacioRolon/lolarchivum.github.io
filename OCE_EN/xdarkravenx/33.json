If not, you might simply be unlucky. Reduce the chances of yourself dying by doing simple things like taking awareness of the mini-map every couple of seconds and making sure you're not overextended in unwarded territory. You can also do things like valuing your life a lot more by making sure you don't trade 1 for 1 kills if you're ahead, doing whatever it takes to survive (such as flashing to dodge spells). I'd say the most important factor is improving map awareness and maintaining a good level of concentration when playing at all times.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-14T07:54:56.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is I'm also very wary of my teammates, I try to go in when they go in a fight they're gonna lose because I think I could at least do something without getting shit on by my team.\n\nHow do I combat that?","replies":[{"poster":"Imperiusˆ","date":"2016-09-14T09:07:05.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should probably leave them if the fight will end up being evidently unfavourable, and address to your team your concern by saying they shouldn't be picking fights if they're outnumbered. After all, it's better to have at least one alive member to defend rather than a whole dead team as they can simply take objectives without any risk. You need to communicate to them that you need to fight as 5 (or take it slow and play it out if your team is significantly behind in kills and objectives). In most cases they will acknowledge this and you will be able to engage in fair team fights, which is a lot better than not saying anything at all and being worried about your teammates losing. Confidence is also key, without it you can lose games that you actually could have won as long as you displayed confidence and competitive integrity. Also, keep in mind that some games simply can't be won, if they're too ahead or their team is simply outclassing yours in both attitude and skill.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-16T01:54:20.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, what i do when i get on a massive losing streak is i take a massive break. Sometimes ill stop playing league for a good few days and i find that when i come back i have a fresh mind and it really helps me avoid tilting during game.

The next morning I looked to continue this trend and got a 7 loss streak instead. Playing the game day in and day out means it's easy to get complacent and fatigued. Even when we improve we need to realise it requires continuous effort on our part to maintain play at that level (whatever rank it is). Sometimes we have bad days too. Whatever it is, it's most important to not take it to heart. Live to fight another day and all that.","replies":[]}]}
