With Yi, you need to time your mediate to reduce damage taken and time your alpha strike to dodge enemy spells like Malphite's unstoppable force. You also need to know how a teamfight works inside and out because so many Yi players go in and die straight up because they don't know when to go in.\n\nIf you want a real low skill based champ, pick Garen. There's not many mechanics to him except for timing the W and knowing if your ult can kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-22T19:33:51.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi seems pretty simplistic but I would say every hero requires skill to 'master'.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zastarx","date":"2014-11-20T18:30:48.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2014-11-19T00:53:58.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would agree on Taric.
