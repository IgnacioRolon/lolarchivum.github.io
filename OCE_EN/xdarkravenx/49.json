Everyone makes it seem that if you play in a premade you are the literal scum of the earth. When it comes down to it, league of legends is a team game and you aren't going anywhere if you can't play in a team. Being able to control the variables of your team (namely the players) is one of the good things about soloq, as you can work together on strategies and learn to synergise with each others play. If you and your team still aren't doing very well, its because you have a lot to learn about the game before you can start climbing. \n\n**Option 2:** You learn as much as you can about shot calling and learn effective ways of encouraging and rallying your team. Confidence is key, as well as a healthy (not too much or too little) amount of pings/chat. You learn as much as you can about synergies and match-ups so that you can get your random af team on the same page game after game and lead them to victory. A team of randoms can easily go up against a premade and win, its all about being able to shot call efficiently and learning to adapt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-04T01:25:51.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps it's not so much a case of you're oponents being so coordinated, but perhaps you are terrible at coordinating with your team?
