Like literally.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR at least nerf Death's Dance.\n\nJust had a game where Riven could easily 1v5 the whole team because of Death&#039;s Dance. I&#039;m not even exaggerating, once she got full build, she LITERALLY 1v5 our whole team. Even though she got CC&#039;d so much, her mercury treads made her unstoppable.\n\nI hope she gets a nerf because what I&#039;ve just seen was absolutely disgusting, then she was taunting and saying we&#039;re all pussies and weak even though she was getting literally gaining 500 health per ability and aa she hit on us.\n\nShe almost won a 1v1 against a Lux under our fountain turret but it was Lux&#039;s bind that kept her away and died under turret then called Lux a pussy.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/148671028/201128314?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-09-29T10:50:49.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do hate the whole DMG reduction meta we have going on right now in toplaners. {{champion:92}}  is really strong with this item, however the reason you weren't able to stop her was because you didn't have a good Duelist in your lineup and 1 Main dmg type ({{champion:99}}  {{champion:103}}  {{champion:50}}  - {{champion:81}} l partly) meaning that between {{item:3156}}  2 life steal items her shield CD and {{item:3111}} . You didn't have a single decent Dps to blow her away. The poor team comp you put together just simply got outscaled. {{champion:81}}  going blue build with such low Physical dmg on your team didn't help.
