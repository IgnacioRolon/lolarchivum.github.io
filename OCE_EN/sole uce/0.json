As Azir you must wait for your passive to be up.\n\n2. Activate it on the fountain turret.\n\n3. The fountain will heal the turret stopping the turrets health decay.\n\nThis happened in Nemesis draft but I don't think it matters which game mode your playing.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T06:16:57.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omfg that's cool, hope they don't fix it\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nIt's a useless useful passive!","replies":[]}]}
