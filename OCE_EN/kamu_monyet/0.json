NO YOU DONT\nKamu Monyet: nah they all wont stop typing\nKamu Monyet: the 3 of them literally afk typing all game\nKamu Monyet: dudes playing rengar top complain about amad mathcup YIKES\nKamu Monyet: ?????????\nKamu Monyet: ?????????????\nKamu Monyet: chance for what?\nKamu Monyet: you ignored bot all game and inted\nKamu Monyet: how if taking scuttle helping botlane\nKamu Monyet: honestly gl with your next game\nKamu Monyet: i cannot talk to you, this is pathetic\nKamu Monyet: so toxic\nKamu Monyet: thse 3 saying they gonna keep me hostige then saying let them end so they afk at base\nKamu Monyet: pls report mid top jg for greifing\nKamu Monyet: ????????????????????\n\nI was only given one example of poor communication and this is it. I don't see how defending myself passively is a fair reason to be muted. Three of my team typed all game which is why i said \"wtf are you all doing though honestly\" this message was around mid game (15 minutes when ff vote failed because of me) and by this point they had all fed all game and they got offended then grouped up and flamed me because one:i asked if they could stop talking and play and two: because i didn't ff at 15.what's the point of the option to vote no if you use it then get flamed and muted/punished.\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"TNT Mikatis","date":"2019-12-31T06:28:26.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh, it sucks but it happens.
