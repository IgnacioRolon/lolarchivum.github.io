After the game, add the player and **kindly** suggest they try a bot game or something with targons thresh so they can get better at predicting. \n\nLike others have said, Thresh doesn't get the relic execute passive as he is technically considered a \"ranged\" champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-07T11:43:33.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could ask them kindly to buy an ancient coin instead.
