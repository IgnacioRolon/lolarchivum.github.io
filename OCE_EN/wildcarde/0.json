I have had countless times where I thought I was going to get at least an S- after the game, but this, this takes the cake. I got disconnected because of my garbage wifi near end of game, I was carry and we lost. I was sad but I was happy on getting an S. Nope. Riot games literally cucked me so hard here it&#039;s not funny. I got an A. An A! I have been dreaming of an S on my main for countless days. Riot fix your game wtf.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-26T05:13:21.227+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"One trick = One champ, if you main two, you are not a one trick\n\nAs for the actual post, heres why you got no S\n1. 200cs in 40 mins is atrocious, i've put this on anothers post about a similar scenario, As a farming champ it is expected that you get 100 cs per 10 mins (roughly)\n2. 34/10/6 - Your kda means less than your cs, CS is priority if you want an S. Now without knowing the full extent of the kills in that game, assuming there were 60+ (which is average) you would be in about 65-70%, thats not great especially as an ADC, although yes high kills is expected (especially on that cancerous champ) assists count too, all this shot shows me is the likeliness that you last hit everyone's kills\n3. Defeat - when you lose, your ranking is reduced substantially, i've had mass kdas and great cs on Mage mids, and with a loss only got an A+, if you want an S, in the wise words of Freljords most wholesome man {{champion:201}}  \"Don't Lose\"","replies":[{"poster":"wildcarde","date":"2018-08-27T00:19:01.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that. Appreciate the response. I guess what I was supposed to say was that I one trick Draven, but if Draven gets banned I always go for Ekko. I understand all of this, I am new to this game so thanks for the information. And by the way, if you look at my build I was very fed early game and I did not kill steal or last hit anyone. My items mid-game were my late game items, I was one hitting with my axes, so I guess you can say I was last hitting lol. I didn't know cs mattered too much and winning or losing matters either, I thought it was just your performance of in-game. Draven is just stereotyped cancerous because of T1. Alpha forever OMEGALOL.

Frankly, I'm surprised you still managed an A with that.\n\nOn top of that, your warding and vision sucks. You only placed 3 wards all game, and didn't buy a single control ward.\n\nNot only that, but you died a lot, which, since you were fed, gave LOTS of shutdown gold.","replies":[{"poster":"wildcarde","date":"2018-08-27T00:20:40.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for response man.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anime is Gay","date":"2018-08-26T04:49:46.360+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have under 200 cs, and 10 deaths but yeah most importantly you have under 200 cs at almost 40mins which is poor farming. and you lost.{{item:3172}}","replies":[{"poster":"wildcarde","date":"2018-08-27T00:21:02.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1v1 me Simon {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MIGHTYRUSSIAN","date":"2018-08-27T04:36:15.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"u didn't get S because u got A","replies":[]}]}
