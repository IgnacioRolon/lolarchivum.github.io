The abilities would go as so.\r\n\r\nQ (Volcanic Rupture):\r\nThe rock would be some sort of cloud thing and there would be a rainbow above and around it. The animation for it travelling underground could also be a rainbow line travelling underground.\r\n\r\nW (Bellows Breath):\r\nThis one&#039;s pretty obvious, spewing rainbows and the brittle indicator would be a Halo above the enemies head.\r\n\r\nE (Searing Charge):\r\nNot sure about this one, it&#039;d be pretty generic.

There's a reason why we got *Pentakill Kayle* and not *Pentakayle*, although that was also due it being a skin named after a band.\n\nThe biggest reason is translation. Something like *Unicornn* may work in English, but then not translate well into other languages. There's no point having a unicorn pun if players in Korea miss out on the pun, either because they may not speak English or because the pun doesn't translate.\n\nThat said, it is a cool idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"QuantumPowerHD","date":"2018-11-05T11:52:35.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually a very good point that I have no counter to, but the question then is what happens to skins like Emumu?

It's not *impossible* to do, but they tend to avoid it, and can't do it very often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-11-17T12:09:51.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im an Ornn main i like simple things like an ice/snow themed freljord Ornn skin or a Elder wood Ornn skin but i do like this also","replies":[]}]}
