I've recently gotten better internet and have managed to download the PBE but I've forgotten my username and with the 'Forgot your Username?', I put the email I thought I used but got no email after 10 minutes. I tried to get a new PBE account but it said I already have one so I was wondering is there is a way to check what PBE account my real account is linked to.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-22T14:37:34.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey should be able to help you out.","replies":[{"poster":"QuantumPowerHD","date":"2018-11-25T01:58:49.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All good I managed to guess my username and sending a email to the username's email worked. Not sure why just sending an email didn't work, but at least I have my account back. Thanks for the help anyway","replies":[]}]}]}
