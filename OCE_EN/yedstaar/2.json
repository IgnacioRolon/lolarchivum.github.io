I want Riot to simply remove my penalties and make an exception where people who have troublesome internet connections cannot receive penalties because you can&#039;t put  the blame on them for disconnecting, blame the network that can crash at any time and I keep trying to remove these LeaverBuster matches but I always get em because **RIOT ISN&#039;T LENIENT ENOUGH FOR THE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE** so I pretty much suffer nearly every week to this crap. I just want you to fix this for me and not have to receive any penalties for no real good reason.","replies":[{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2015-09-04T15:13:15.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well when my net isn't doing so well, I simply don't play League, if you are playing with full knowledge that your internet could be bad at any time you should invest in a better connection.\n\n\"not have to receive any penalties for no real good reason\"\nAs implied above, you shouldn't play games if you expect or think you will disconnect.","replies":[]}]}
