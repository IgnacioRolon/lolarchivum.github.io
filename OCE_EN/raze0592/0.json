I also think the decay will likely be game based rather than time based to account for the people that don't play often but are positive when they do.\n\n**As for the answer to your actual question, my guess is yes, but not in a direct manner. They may be used as some sort of base mmr for an honour placement (like previous season rank for current season rank). Though I have no idea how such a thing would be implemented, there'd have to be all sorts of things to account for time/games played to properly compare players, so they may just choose to let everyone start from scratch.**\n\n**That or they will have some sort of legacy honour rank that doesn't play a large or active role but is there to say \"Hey, I was cool back in the day too\".**\n\nWhich really isn't so bad. I mean, even honour rank 1 shows that you are honourable in the context of the system. My biggest question is about how they will handle valid reports. People rarely get banned for first or small and infrequent offenses, so it will be interesting to see if reports against that behaviour (that don't trigger a punishment) have a significant impact on honour. Imo it should, because it serves as a warning and a visible decline in that players behaviour, which is more incentive for them to pick up their game to earn back those honour rewards (which it really seems like there will be).\n\nWhatever happens, I'm hella excited for this. It's hard to be positive all the time in the face of negativity when you get no recognition for it, and having a visible honour rank will massively impact behaviour for the better I think.\n\nOf course, they may not make it easily visible, since that can cause problems, especially for ranked, but they may make it visible in the way mastery is or something similar. Maybe loading screen and post game, or a special border in game as well, rather than just being able to see it on profile, time will tell for that one.","replies":[{"poster":"Raze0592","date":"2017-03-16T04:45:59.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay, thank you very much for the response! :)\nMuch appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FlayBoy","date":"2017-03-12T02:48:20.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It will probably reset them (if they keep them they might not actually influence the change though){{champion:412}}","replies":[]}]}
