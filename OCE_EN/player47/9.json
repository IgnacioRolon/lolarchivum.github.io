G-Sync only works from 30-144 FPS so I intentionally cap it to 141 FPS because sometimes games will go over 144 and G-Sync would not work until it goes back to 144 or under. I use RivaTuner Statistics Server (powered by Guru3D.com) over Nvidia's or league of legends frame limiter because it has the least input-lag out of the options available.\n\nNow even with this setup and system: on a game like league of legends I get times where the frame-rate drops down to 130-75 FPS for a time then back to 141 FPS. I should have a stable 141 FPS with a game like league of legends since it is not a AAA game like Dues Ex: Mankind Divided that is demanding on the system performance.\n\nAfter reading riot's guide for high-end system with low FPS on league of legends I have notice that you guys say to use league of legends frame-limiter in the client to 60 FPS.\n\nSo my question is this: is league of legends only optimize for 60 FPS gaming?\nIs that why riot recommends 60 FPS?\nIs that the problem?\n\nYou guys need to optimize the game for higher FPS since modern monitors are 75Hz up-to 240+Hz.\n\nI am going to try limiting league of legends to 60 FPS to see if it stable however the point of gaming at higher FPS is that: One higher FPS should reduce eye strain; Two fast action game like league of legends you need high FPS for responsiveness of what is happening in the game.\n\n\"If support cannot help or does not handle this( weird that you would have a support section on this but not help) you need to forward this to the right department who can take action to fixing this on-going problem.\" This was also posted to riot support.\n\nI used this guide about the in-put lag: https://www.blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/14/","replies":[]}]}
