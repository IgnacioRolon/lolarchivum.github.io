As I know a majority of our community is about that competitive grind.\r\n\r\n&gt; We&#039;ll need you to forward this fantastic concept to the boards yourself as we&#039;ll have our hands tied assisting other League members in the meantime.\r\n\r\nSuggestion @riot.\r\n\r\nI know you guys can tell what connection summoners are playing by (Be it wireless or ethernet/nbn) due to your spying on summoner&#039;s system.\r\nYou can also see what their ms/ping is as well.\r\nNow my suggestion is that for ranked/solo &amp; flex: you block connections that are 100 ms/ping and over from being able to queue up for ranked.\r\nOn top of that only allow connections that are ethernet/nbn since wireless ruins the gaming experience for others.\r\nSo implement both or one of these suggestions I have made here and the gaming experience will improve substantially in ranked.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting this for OCE Sever. I cannot say what ping is acceptable for other servers.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/yr5dXC1P7Mo?t=2184","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-17T04:34:10.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess the biggest question is, outside of an actual professional setting, should those players be denied a significant part of the League experience because of factors beyond their control?\n\nI'm not talking about frequent dcs or the like, LeaverBuster exists for a reason, but if a player is gated by their ping, will that not simply be reflected in their rank?","replies":[{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-06-17T08:23:57.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lI123f62,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-06-17T04:34:10.883+0000)\n>\n> I guess the biggest question is, outside of an actual professional setting, should those players be denied a significant part of the League experience because of factors beyond their control?\n\nThose factors are in their control. They chose to play via wireless. They know that wireless is unreliable and risky. Many things can make their wireless connection drop-out and interference from their environment can also affect their stability of the connection. Most people in Australia will have under 100ms/ping playing league of legends on oce. The server is located in Sydney. Connecting via Ethernet is easy and inexpensive to do. Most reliable connection you can get. With reliable average pings; no packet-loss; little to no jitter; no ping spikes; no packet-loss spikes and lastly faster down and up stream of their internet connection.\n\nOCE has 62%(Since 2016) of summoners playing via WiFi\nhttps://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2016/august/evw/images/graph-gamesbyconectiontype.jpg\n\nIf you look at this link from 2016: https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/ethernet-vs-wifi-ping-packets-playing-better\n\n>  I&#x27;m not talking about frequent dcs or the like, LeaverBuster exists for a reason, but if a player is gated by their ping, will that not simply be reflected in their rank?\n\nI would say it already is.\n\nPercent of games played by connection type by tier (Since 2016)\nhttps://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=https://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/articles/2016/august/evw/images/graph-gamesbytier.jpg\nYou can see that 42% in Bronze are playing via wireless; 35% in Silver; 30% in Gold; 27% in Platinum; 20% in Diamond and 14% in Master.\n\nSo basically which ever team has more wireless connection will have a disadvantage. \n\nI have no stats for 2018 however 62% since 2016 is still a high amount of people choosing to play with an unreliable connection of wireless with unreliable average pings; packet-loss; jitter; ping spikes;packet-loss spikes.\n\nThat is why I feel that if riot implements my suggestion; it will result in more competitiveness; improve the quality of the game experience; no team is at a disadvantage and substantially improve ranked solo/duo & flex.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-17T12:44:09.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Those factors are in their control. They chose to play via wireless.\n\nDo they? If it's their household, then the answer is likely yes. In a household with more tech comfortable parents the answer is also likely yes. \n\nBut what if the router is in another part of the house inaccessible by cable? What if you're parents won't allow you a cable running from the kitchen to wherever your PC is? What if you are in a uni dorm that doesn't have access points for physical connections? What if you are in any kind of share accommodation with similar limitations?\n\nThere are plenty of circumstances that prevent players from using ethernet, especially the school aged ones. So I ask again, should they be denied a large part of the experience based on factors beyond their control?\n\n>Many things can make their wireless connection drop-out and interference from their environment can also affect their stability of the connection.\n\nSuch is the nature of the connection, but I played on wireless for years before ethernet was an option for me and had maybe one or two connections issues (as a result of the wireless connection) in that time, and my ping was higher by about 3. Wireless is more prone to such issues, but that doesn't inherently mean it is plagued by them.\n\nI also specifically said that frequent dcs or dropouts weren't what I was referring to. If you have those issues you shouldn't be playing ranked, there is no way around it, but should you for example be unable to play ranked just because you live in WA?\n\n>I would say it already is.\n\nBut that was precisely my point. If their skill is gated by their ping, they will appropriately be sorted into a lower bracket than what they might be able to achieve on a 0ms connection. The system already accounts for and addresses that disadvantage, not to mention that even a difference of 100ms isn't going to have all that much impact on your skill so long as it doesn't fluctuate all that much, which is rarely the issue. It might push your skill cap a little lower simply as a result of reaction time, but hardly anything drastic and hardly anything that doesn't have variance for other reasons.\n\n>That is why I feel that if riot implements my suggestion; it will result in more competitiveness; improve the quality of the game experience; no team is at a disadvantage and substantially improve ranked solo/duo & flex.\n\nPlayer experience issues aside, our queues are unstable enough as it is because of the low population, and you want to remove 62% of players from the queues entirely when in plenty of cases those factors have little to no impact on their play??\n\nIf you lived in Uni dorm in WA, with reliable but still wireless connection, would you think it fair that you were unable to play simply because \"ethernet is better\"? \n**Not** \"your connection is dodgy and you know it\" because your connection is stable. \n**Not** \"ping affects your gameplay\" because of course it does but that didn't (and shouldn't have) stopped people from playing ranked back on NA where it was much higher than the norm because it's stable. \n**Not** \"you have been prevented from playing because you dc a crapton\" because you've dced maybe twice in your time playing League as a result of connection.\n**Not** \"wireless is bad and you shouldn't ever do anything on it if ethernet is an option\".\n\n**Just** \"ethernet is _better_\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}
