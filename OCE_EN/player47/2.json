Most of these time, these changes come in the form of small changes; however, we've seen a number of large-scale optimization efforts throughout the past years, most notably in recent years. \n\nTo read more about their optimisation practices at Riot, check out the following article from the Riot Games Engineering blog!\n\nhttps://engineering.riotgames.com/news/random-acts-optimization","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-16T21:58:51.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">RADKUS\nJuly 13th 2018, 8:16:15 pm\nHey man,\n\n>Radkus here from the Tech Team @ Player Support taking over.\n\n>So, I'm going to be honest, you have a really good build and the first glance, this doesn't look like something hardware related. :)\n\n>Now about your questions, the game supports up to 240Hz (capping your framerate is dependent on the frequency of your monitor) but to be honest, it's a bit of an overkill, especially on League. I use the 240 FPS cap only on FPS games or racing games and for League I run it stable with 144 with G-Sync off (to reduce input lag).\n\n>In your case, frame instability might be caused by conflicts between OS apps and our game or some specific settings so I need some info from you to look into this and find just the right settings. ^_^\n\n>For that, please send me the logs my colleague TeliaKalisto asked for and we'll find it together.\n\n>Thanks!\n\n>Radkus\nTech Support Specialist\n\"Who needs a map?\"\n\nWell they say \"the game supports up to 240 FPS\" however from all the guides riot wrote up about this topic, they suggest 60 FPS so I would conclude that riot has only optimized the game for 60 FPS. \n\nSo the game can support 240 FPS but is not optimized for up to 240 FPS.\nSo I still stand by what I have said and that is riot need to optimize their game-client for greater then 60 FPS. Be it from working with Nvidia & AMD/Rad to release drivers out that are optimize for league up to 240 FPS or by riot themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-17T02:48:35.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a reasonably less powerful rig than you and never see any significant (more than 10) framerate instability in League unless I have something else running draining resources. My partner who has a much older and less powerful rig than mine also experiences the same though his frames are capped at 120 for league. League isn't exactly a resource intensive game, so if you're experiencing framerate drops with a rig like that I think the agent is probably spot on with there being some sort of conflict.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-09T18:45:08.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL:DR -- It seems that league of legends.exe is only optimized for 60 FPS.\n\nMy system is: \nOS: Microsoft - Windows 10 Home Full 32/64-bit (Using 64-bit) \nRam: Corsair - Vengeance LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-2666 Memory \nMotherboard: Asus - PRIME X370-PRO ATX AM4 Motherboard \nCPU: AMD - Ryzen 5 1600X 3.6GHz 6-Core Processor OC 4Gighz all cores \nCPU Cooler: Be Quiet! - Silent Loop 240 65.5 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler \nCase: Be Quiet! - Dark Base Pro 900 w/Window (Black) ATX Full Tower Case with 3 extra Be Quiet! - SilentWings 3 pwm 59.5 CFM 140mm Fan \nGPU: EVGA - GeForce GTX 1070 8GB SC GAMING ACX 3.0 Black Edition Video Card \nPower: Be Quiet! ​Straight P​ower 10 60​0W CM Powe​r Supply \nOS Drive: Samsung - 850 Pro Series 2TB 2.5\" Solid State Drive \nMonitor: AOC G2460PG FHD 144Hz G-Sync 24in TN Gaming Monitor (discontinued now)\n\nOkay now that is out of the way: I play league of legends with a G-Sync monitor using RivaTuner Statistics Server (powered by Guru3D.com) to frame-rate limit league of legends.exe to 141 FPS since my monitor is 144 Hz. G-Sync only works from 30-144 FPS so I intentionally cap it to 141 FPS because sometimes games will go over 144 and G-Sync would not work until it goes back to 144 or under. I use RivaTuner Statistics Server (powered by Guru3D.com) over Nvidia's or league of legends frame limiter because it has the least input-lag out of the options available.\n\nNow even with this setup and system: on a game like league of legends I get times where the frame-rate drops down to 130-75 FPS for a time then back to 141 FPS. I should have a stable 141 FPS with a game like league of legends since it is not a AAA game like Dues Ex: Mankind Divided that is demanding on the system performance.\n\nAfter reading riot's guide for high-end system with low FPS on league of legends I have notice that you guys say to use league of legends frame-limiter in the client to 60 FPS.\n\nSo my question is this: is league of legends only optimize for 60 FPS gaming? \nIs that why riot recommends 60 FPS? \nIs that the problem? \n\nYou guys need to optimize the game for higher FPS since modern monitors are 75Hz up-to 240+Hz. \n\nI am going to try limiting league of legends to 60 FPS to see if it stable however the point of gaming at higher FPS is that: One higher FPS should reduce eye strain; Two fast action game like league of legends you need high FPS for responsiveness of what is happening in the game.\n\n\"If support cannot help or does not handle this( weird that you would have a support section on this but not help) you need to forward this to the right department who can take action to fixing this on-going problem.\" This was also posted to riot support.\n\nI used this guide about the in-put lag: https://www.blurbusters.com/gsync/gsync101-input-lag-tests-and-settings/14/","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-03T14:18:56.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still no response from the developers of league of legends about optimizing their client.","replies":[]}]}
