Since then the game has evolved so much and old mechanics eaily become outdated and in most cases non-viable.\n\nGap closing was kept to a minimum within champ kits. Hence why flash was practically picked 100% of the time.  But now champions can have up to 3 gap closing abilities including flash, making mistakes less punishing. This is turn makes a role such as ADC which get minimal escapes harder and harder to play as, granted the may get some utility here and there.\n\nANywayz, i would like ot see ADC role evolve with the times too...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-17T00:04:49.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xayah doesn't have one.\nAnd if you are including reworks _(I'm guessing this was prompted by Akali)_ Swain doesn't either, and arguably the new Aatrox has less dive potential than the previous one. And Akali's kit already revolved around diving anyway, so nothing has changed there.\n\nHowever, to answer your question, the 'assassin' **_in-kill-out_** playstyle has aways been one of if not the most appealing play styles _(and why not, its fun, we all like getting easy kills)_\n\nSo its natural that Riot would create more champs around a play style that most of the community wants.\nHowever, I do agree, we need a larger variety of champ play styles. Diving is fun, but not if its the only playstle.\n\nI personally don't find diving that fun, I prefer more tactical play styles, like Azir/Sol/Taliyah, so I want more champs like that rather than diving.","replies":[]}]}
