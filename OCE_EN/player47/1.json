You seem like an upstanding player that wants to improve the community and for that my friend, I commend you.\r\n\r\n&gt;For these cases, the Instant Feedback System was created to identify players that cause a negative impact inside the game. By using the report function, players who are found to be causing a negative game experience are then punished accordingly.\r\n\r\n&gt;These reports also bring such cases of improper conduct and behavior to our attention for investigation.\r\n\r\n&gt;Nobody enjoys playing with someone that displays a negative and offensive behavior or trolls/ints. Such behavior does not belong inside the Fields of Justice and create an overall negative vibe for the other nine players.\r\n\r\n&gt;I hope you will have better interactions in the future!\r\n\r\n&gt;Have a good one,\r\n\r\n&gt;Snorjax\r\n\r\n&gt;Player Support Specialist\r\n&quot;Surprise! I&#039;m back&quot;\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&gt;ALEERA VR\r\nJuly 16th 2018, 7:28:19 pm\r\nHey Player47,\r\n\r\n&gt;Thank you for reaching out,\r\n\r\n&gt;I can understand your point of view as to how the IFS seams to only be working in cases where the offenses are chat related, however I can assure you that is not the case.\r\n\r\n&gt;I know that the main punishments that are advertised on the website have to do with the chat restricts and the temporary (or - in extreme cases - permanent) suspensions, however I would like to point out of couple of other punishments we give out via our trusted automated system :)\r\n\r\n&gt;Players leaving the game will get a bump in LeaverBuster level and that specific system will become more sensitive for them\r\nPlayers marked as AFK become ineligible for rewards at the end of the game (even if it will end in a victory)\r\nBased on the patterns of death in match history intentional feeders get suspended\r\n\r\n&gt;The main reason as to why players think that these players don&#039;t get punished is because they need to be repeat offenders to get the above specified type of punishments. We don&#039;t want to be witch hunting simply because we need to be sympathetic to emotional factors and we don&#039;t want to be trigger happy because all players can have a bad day :( \r\nIn the cases of toxicity in chats it&#039;s all out in the open and easy to investigate and take action on! With the other types of incidents, it takes a bit more time for the system to kick in because we want to afford players the benefit of the doubt\r\n\r\n&gt;I hope this has helped provide a bit more context, mate! \r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us again should you need any further assistance.\r\n\r\n&gt;Cheers!\r\n\r\n&gt;Aleera VR\r\nPlayer Support Representative\r\n\r\n&gt;The moon will rise.

His final score was 1/21/?. i don't remember his assists but probably 0. The one kill he got was from a person on the enemy team who he fed like 10 kills to already. And all i got from riot support was something along the lines of thank you for reporting him but we can't do anything.

Having recently been banned for 14 days for ‘speculated’ negativity in games I can rest assured that 3 times I was reported wasn’t actually negative behaviour BUT purely because I was reported several times they have just put a ban on my account. \nThey say you need something like 10 points that lead to a ban but after this happening I have to actually wonder how far into these ‘tickets’ do they investigate as for one of the reports that a chat log has come back saying in that game my team reported the person and I feel that person didn’t get banned yet I was because in the same time line, with the new meta I tried Zoe in the not lane and was reported for it - so all in all there’s 2 reports, not for negative behaviour but because I basically defended myself without being rude... so I dunno. \nThere are so many more important issues that need to be investigated such as afk’s or intentional feedings rather than the feelings of people getting hurt - that’s what the mute button is for. Personally I think a person saying ‘gg ez’ is rather offensive if someone had a bad game you don’t wanna read that, but should I report that?? \nHow’s about looking into the real reports of afk and intentional feeding rather than some words people let have power over them. \nHave I been a bad sport in some games, sure, but where’s a three warning notice before a ban?? I never got one, something to consider before banning an account, or perhaps letting a player defend himself before a judicial memeber before the ban. It’s already become an unfair game with the meta now played, do you have to add this on top? \nOk rant done. Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-17T09:39:03.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think you misunderstood my comments on your thread. This isn't that thread so I won't go into it, but you weren't punished for \"speculated\" negativity, **we here on boards** can only speculate on the deeper context of your punishment. If you want more context, take it up with support.\n\nFalse reports mean nothing, and only one report is required to initiate a review. You could have a premade of 100 players report you and it would mean absolutely nothing if you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nReported is also not the same as punished. You could be reported 50 times and never see a punishment, or see a punishment after just one or two reports (typically for things like hate speech). \n\nThe 10 point thing was as I explicitly stated, a *gross oversimplification*. It was a metaphor designed to help put consistent but minor offences and infrequent but severe offences in a context that would hopefully be easier to understand.\n\nYou would not receive a punishment for playing Zoe in bot, no matter how many times you were reported.\n\nAFKs are already consistently punished under the LeaverBuster system. Intent feeding is also punished but it's slower, because saying \"kys\" in chat is pretty unambiguous (and easily identified and overturned in the case of a false positive), but a 0/10 score is not. The system needs more confidence that someone is actually *intentionally* feeding before it issues a punishment, where chat is more often than not pretty cut and dry.\n\nIf people saying 'gg ez' harms your experience, then yes, report it, plenty of people do though it's considered a minor offence. That is the whole point of player reports, to gauge what behaviours harm the player experience (of the majority, they can't cater to individuals) and to punish accordingly.\n\nYes we have some power over how words affect us, but just because I can mute it, or just because my skin isn't dark, doesn't mean we should let people run around with the n word now does it?\n\nAs for your three warning notice, either your chat logs were heavily edited, your punishment was a result of a bizarrely false positive, or you've had at least *one* warning in the form of a chat log. These punishments *are* your warnings. First is 10 game chat restriction, then 25 game, then 14 day ban. Those are your warnings before permanent suspension, though some severe behaviours will escalate you straight to 14 day.\n\nYou've been informed multiple times by multiple people, but if you wish to appeal a punishment, or as you say it \"defend yourself before a judicial member\", submit a ticket to player support.\n\nYour comment is also entirely off topic from the thread, so I would encourage you to continue this discussion in your own thread so we don't derail this one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-17T02:39:54.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">In the cases of toxicity in chats it's all out in the open and easy to investigate and take action on! With the other types of incidents, it takes a bit more time for the system to kick in because we want to afford players the benefit of the doubt.\n\nA screenshot doesn't necessarily mean anything. Even a player threatening to feed won't necessarily, so chat admissions have to be taken with a grain of salt, and just being 0/10 also doesn't automatically equal *intentional* feeding. This is ultimately the point the agent is trying to make.\n\nYou also have to remember that support can't and won't give you any information regarding another player's account, so anything regarding their punishment or any evidence for or against one isn't something available to you. For this reason support can only give you generic answers to these reports, because they aren't even allowed to *imply* that a player was punished or not.\n\nTelling someone \"kys\" is pretty cut and dry, and in the rare case it results in a false positive (repeating something someone else said etc) it is easy to identify and overturn. A 0/10, or even 0/20 score on the other hand isn't. It *could* be intentional feeding, or it could just be a bad day versing a snowball lane with jungler support. Hence the delay in gameplay offences.\n\n>We cannot often take action through the reports that we receive when a player writes a ticket. You seem like an upstanding player that wants to improve the community and for that my friend, I commend you.\n\nNow I don't know all the specifics, but as I understand it, what this agent is saying is probably \"we only action ticket reports if the automated system isn't picking up the behaviour\". Ideally support would only be handling niche cases that the IFS can't identify and it seems they've likely taken that route exactly to prevent support being overwhelmed and to encourage the IFS to learn and get faster/better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-07-17T00:25:16.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The support replies look pretty good to me, what is your problem?","replies":[]}]}
