If she's in range of the minions they'll be drawn onto her. It's intended, but wasn't a change made specifically to Zyra.

Changing this mechanic will make those champions a lot more intuitive to play against, as well as easier to balance.\n\nhttps://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-82-notes#patch-targeted-spells","replies":[{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-20T03:56:06.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The keyword is targeted like point and click like {{champion:1}} Q or {{champion:90}} R.
