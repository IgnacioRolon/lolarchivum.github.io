I know it&#039;s in testing so any sort of thoughts/criticisms towards it helps right?\nProblems\n\nJanna shields.\nYou get so much shield that pretty much you're invincible for a long time.\nSolution\nTone the shield down or remove it. It is frustrating enough trying to fight a tank who then gets the shield and becomes unkillable. Even squishy targets become a tank for a while who is able to just dish out major damage dive under towers kill off somebody get out and the shield is then depleted.\n\n\nKilling streak. \nGet 4 or 5 kills(can&#039;t remember) and you gain massive amounts of damage and cdr. Once somebody gets to this point unless they do a bad play it is a victory for that team. Reason being is once you get the on fire status you can take half hp off somebody with just 1 skill and with high cooldown, those skills come quickly lol\nSolution\nmaybe lower the bonus damage a bit other than that I would guess it is fine\n\nKing of the Hill event. \nSome of them are in places that the other team just cannot reach. Had one today that spawned in enemy base dunno how we could capture that one\nSolution\nThis one I am not sure if it is possible but have maybe 3 locations and it will randomly select a spot from those 3 locations to capture. e.g one in ally area one in enemy area and one in a central area\n\nBattle Royale modes.\nthey are pretty much either telling you go fight in enemy side against their towers and such or fight with your towers. \nJuggernaught is random and usually goes on lowest hp ally who dies instantly. \nSolution\nNo point having multiple and make it just go to the centre of the map rather than into enemy/ally base or towers\n\nWalking Nexus\nWho in their right mind thought this would be a good idea?\nI&#039;ve seen multiple teams stomping enemy team only to then lose because their nexus was on enemy side because of how pushed up they were.\nSolution\nRemove this.  Had one game we were on nexus we got wiped and then our nexus was pretty much at their base meaning they fought ran to fountain healed ran back and continued to fight and we lost because of it. This part has to be the most hated of all parts in this game mode. I am all for a quick game but then to have this happen when you are much further ahead and lose is just frustrating\n\nThink that sums it up for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Sykotek","date":"2018-08-22T08:27:07.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mode in itself is fine. Some of the events and rewards however are not.\nI've played roughly 80 odd games now of nexus blitz and have seen a few bugs. \n\nBlessing of Kha'zix \nif enemy dies with this while in brush the Kha'zix effect constantly goes off untill they respawn. Unsure if this happens for ally team as well as I've never had it\n\nWalking Nexus.\nSometimes your nexus or enemy nexus does not spawn meaning an automatic loss for the team it did not spawn for\n\nBlessing of Zilean\nSome people are gaining multiple Zilean revives instead of just one\n\nThings I think still need balancing is\nBlessing of Janna, \nShield is still quite high maybe half of what is given?\n\nCurse minion timer\n2 minutes is really long. Think of what can happen in the time of morgana landing a Q. Now imagine that for 2 minutes with enemy having such easy wave clear.\n\nMy previous things I've mentioned still need addressing. \n\nKing of the hill, royale modes\nEnemy/ally team can't do much when  teams receive king of the hill placement inside their base or under their tower. Sometimes you're so far ahead you can win regardless of where you are but sometimes the game is so close and this just gives one team so much of an advantage\n\nWalking Nexus.\nJust get rid of this.
