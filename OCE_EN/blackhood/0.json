Press enter twice then type fed.&#039; I am unsure if it is just a troll or if something did happen because it was repetitively spammed and sometimes the entire message didn&#039;t come through. Riot please answer my question as to why this happened.\r\nThanks!\r\nBlackhood","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-30T08:05:32.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As you suspect it is indeed a troll.\n\nIt is a trick with white text where they push what they are typing onto the next line, whichever player was typing on the line above is the one doing it. I personally don't know exactly how it works, but it is 100% reportable (impersonating Riot, especially for trolling purposes is a big no no). \n\nIf you have screenshots or have it recorded or something and can see who it was typing then please do submit a support ticket with the evidence so they can look into it, if not, then just be sure to report it in post game if you ever encounter it again.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5cvcwm7.png\n(I encountered this a while ago myself)\n\n^ The Teemo is the culprit here.","replies":[]}]}
