You can not self-mystery yourself by default. That option is only something they would open during certain events unfortunately. Ocean Week has already concluded I'm afraid.\n\nThough you could have 2 accounts, the other being the proxy, and you use the proxy to gift yourself mystery. This is a way to \"self mystery\" when the option isn't open.\n\nOr you can have someone who you trust and have a few changes to spare, and you 2 mystery trade each other.","replies":[]}]}]}
