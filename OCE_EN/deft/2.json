You want to pick a time when you can ult the backline but not get caught by the tanks or bruisers and killed, since you'll want to preserve your mejais stacks. If Mejais isn't working, a GLP-800 can add some extra AoE burst and utility, and also can help guarantee your escape.\n\nlethality malphite jungle:\n{{item:3147}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3036}} {{item:3812}} {{item:2140}} {{item:3364}} \ntaking sorcery arcanecomet-nimbuscloak-gatheringstorm and domination suddenimpact-ravenoushunter\natkspeed-adaptivedamage-armour  flash-smite\nmax r-e-q-w\nthe harder way to play atomic malphite, but in the right hands, no less potent, and far more unexpected. With the removal of stormrazor staticshiv memes, this build has weakened, but with the correct use of auto resets you will still be able to clap people. Using the high base damage on malphites abilities, and capatilising on his auto resets and the brief moment after an ult where you can auto attack a knocked up enemy, this build sets itself apart as a more versatile atomic malphite, that isn't afraid of dueling when his ults down or picking a fight with a tank or bruiser mano e mano with your innate tankiness and massive lifesteal. Try to make sure you're ulting from out of vision, and you'll be relying on your lifesteal to survive the aftermath as you lay the final slap on your foes. You sell the hunter's machete last.\n\npractical jungle malphite:\n{{item:1402}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3041}} {{item:3916}} -> {{item:3907}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3165}} {{item:2139}} {{item:2057}} \ntaking domination predator-suddenimpact-eyeballcollection-ultimatehunter and precision presenceofmind-coupde'grace\natkspeed-adaptive-armour flash smite\nmax r-q-e-w\nthe more practical way to play atomic malphite, the aim is to stay atomic by snowballing and staying ahead of enemy magic resist, much more macro, but you'll get alot more deletions this way and is a better way to play if you're taking this into ranked.","replies":[]}]}
