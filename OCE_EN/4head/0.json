Unlike dropping regular divisions, dropping tiers requires you to be 5 whole divisions worse then your current rank.\n\nAs your example, to drop from Silver 5 to Bronze 1, you need to have the same MMR as Bronze 5. So its usually safe to say, its really hard to drop tiers if you are below Plat since there is no decay and you have to lose an awful lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-06T09:34:54.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your mmr is lower","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-06T08:02:58.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have lost 3 games in a row in one division and didn't drop so it's safe to say alot","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-07-06T03:44:30.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot, unfortunately.","replies":[]}]}
