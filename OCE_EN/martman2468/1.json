Please send me some solutions. Thanks.{{champion:254}} \r\n\r\n\r\nLast of all please dont give me the solution to use smart cast or use Q to cast my ability quicker. I would want the old way back.","replies":[{"poster":"GhostlyHell","date":"2015-04-16T11:24:59.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did you re-create this? \n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/hAXAapRP-vi-hero-first-abilty-q-bug-or-problem-need-help-to-fix","replies":[{"poster":"martman2468","date":"2015-04-16T13:52:21.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not getting the solution to the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-16T14:12:47.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because there isn't a problem and you need to learn to either smart cast, or learn to get over whatever problem you think exists, cause no one else actually gives a shit.\n\nEDIT: I also just tried it in a custom, if you just hit the Q button it auto cast's it even without quick cast, if your clicking the ability buttons there is something wrong with you","replies":[{"poster":"martman2468","date":"2015-04-17T17:37:45.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why did they have this method of clicking the ability or exist in the first place if there was something wrong with me. \n\nWhy change it now if it worked great before?\n\nI dont get whats wrong with the other method that it has to change.\n\nIf you dont give a shit then why post reply this to me?

Thats why there is a problem so i posted. Why else would i post this if there wasnt.\n\nIn default settings\nOk if i press Q then use the mouse i still have to left click to launch the hit box and click again to make it power up to distance needed and click again to release the charge. Dont you think there clearly is a problem.\n\nWhere as before all i needed to do was click on the ability and click on the floor and release ( 2 clicks ).\n\nThe current one needs like minimum 3 to 4 clicks and takes way too long.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
