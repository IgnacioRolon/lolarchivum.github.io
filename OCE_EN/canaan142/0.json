You're not in a very good or nice community and because of that you can expect a lot of trolling, toxicity and generally bad players. Don't allow this to get you down this can take some time if you're not experienced in higher divisions , know when you need a break and don't be toxic. Being toxic is a good way of losing games so instead take this approach instead of being toxic:\nThink a lot\nSay little\nWrite nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-22T17:33:20.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me if u want","replies":[]}]}
