Having a sufficiently low frequency/consistency to your leaving/disconnecting will mean you *shouldn't* see any punishment, however when it gets to a certain point action will be taken. Generally, Leaverbuster will stick to the standard Low Priority Queue escalation (5 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 20 minutes, in sets of 5 games). So far as bans go, it's my understanding that the Leaverbuster system isn't set up to issue bans, and that they would only be issued in the most extreme of cases for leaving/disconnecting offences.\n\nReally, if the games you do leave/disconnect from are far and few, you should be untouched by the Leaverbuster system. You can find more information on how Leaverbuster works by visiting the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714) on the Support site.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spicy Schnitzel","date":"2019-06-12T05:39:54.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be honest im not entirely sure, however i imagine riot would understand that life happens. whether its an emergency or internet cuts out  or you need to leave for whatever reason i dont think perma bans should occur.\n\nhowever, if there is a consistency of continuous left games i reckon riot might start looking into it (im not sure to what point they will start looking into it though)\n\nI dont know what your situation is for leaving whether its rage quitting or internet cutting out but try to the best of your ability to get it sorted.\n\nkind regards Spicy Schnitzel :)","replies":[]}]}
