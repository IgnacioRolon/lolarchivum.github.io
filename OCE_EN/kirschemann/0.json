She seems to stand almost a head above most champs in the videos that pre-release has shown us so far. But that isn&#039;t even the worse part. She runs awkwardly, it doesn&#039;t look smooth like her current incarnation, and her back, quite frankly, looks like it might have to be broken the way she stands. If the trailer for her is to be believed she is about the same size as swain, from all angles given. Her model just really needs to be slightly shrunk in my opinion, and just some basic changes to her models running stance pattern so she doesn&#039;t look so awkward.\r\n\r\nThe last two mild issues are the fact that her thighs are a little thick, though I can accept that as diversifying the roster. Her cape-like hair also seems a bit.... much and once again, makes her normal running animation awkward especially when compared to the smoothness of her current model.","replies":[{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2018-03-21T16:40:28.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you should apply to be on the design team","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-03-21T22:35:19.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Canley Vale,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Mls4qLaK,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-21T16:40:28.823+0000)\n>\n> maybe you should apply to be on the design team\n\nWhy would you want a job in a dying company?","replies":[{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2018-03-24T19:55:26.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk if you're trolling with that reply, the fact that you put dying company and two paragraphs of opinions is beyond contradictory. of course no one gives a shit, it was  sarcasm the whole time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-21T03:38:16.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks so smooth","replies":[]}]}
