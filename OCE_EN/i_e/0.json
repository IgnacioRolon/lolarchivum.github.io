A loading bar appears every time we delete the \"RADS\\projects\" folder or reinstalling. No matter what we do, the program will crash after it makes the folders in \"RADS\\projects\" and will not start. The update stage does not appear, only the logo. Also, the program is running in Task Manager. \n\nHe is running Windows 7, 64bit\n\nThese folders are all empty:\nRADS\\projects\\downloads \nRADS\\projects\\solutions\nRADS\\projects\\temp\n\n\nMany suggestions we have tried below, all of them did not work:\n\nUninstalled, ran CCleaner, rebooted, downloaded then installed.\nDeleted \"RADS\\projects\", reinstalled.\nReplaced files in the \"RADS\\projects\" with 3rd party ones.
