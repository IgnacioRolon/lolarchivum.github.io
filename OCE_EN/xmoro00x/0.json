Congratulations, you may now begin the climb :D\n\nLooked at your match history and you seem to be doing fine. Some bad games, but everyone has those sometimes. \n\nAt a glance,[ your warding is pretty bad](http://wardscore.loltools.net/?name=xmoro00x&region=oce) and I would suggest working on that. Warding helps everyone on your team out by providing a warning of enemy engages, as well as general enemy movement. If everyone on your team is doing your part, you can usually pull out a win knowing that the enemy team isn't doing so flash with their vision.\n\nNext I would suggest picking your two main roles. [You seem to like playing ADC and are relatively good at it](http://oce.soloq.gg/multi/search/453797/SEASON2016), so maybe pick ADC & TOP so you usually get your main role.\n[ Here are some pretty good ADC tips from a high elo adc main written up a couple of days ago. ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/PBufxsR4-midlate-game-adc-help)\nSpend some time looking at guides, reworking your runes and masteries, and maybe even sorting out some item sets. \n\nWe have quite a few other tips and stories come out of the woodwork over on[ THIS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/iRdbOiRe-how-did-you-all-climb-out-of-b5) thread, take a look as some of it will be really helpful to you.\n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-03T23:55:13.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"play yi in every role to climb \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
