It's so much fun right now.\n\nYasou does outscale Diana, eventually Diana won't be able to 1v1 him unless he's below half hp, but that's not the point. In lane Yasou get's dumpstered.","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2019-07-21T03:50:30.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if we're strictly speaking really early game, yeah, Yasuo has no chance.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-07-21T04:49:35.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yas chances are slim, even in late game. \n\nDiana's rotation of Q proc>W>R>Sheen proc>R>Sheen proc, with enough items in her slots, she can 1 combo rotation the Yas. Yas cant even out play with E, due to Diana's E. \n\nThis is a bad match up for Yasuo when it come to 1v1. \n\nLaning phrase is about equal before lv 6. After that, as yas, you need to play for cs and look for advantages such as, when she waste her Q to farm and you are in a position to all in, your jungler is near by, you have more HP to all in, ETC...\n\nBut overall, Diana DPS output is too much to live through, even when you are building Hex drinker, Diana can easily use Zhonas to dodge your Ult and wait for her cdr. Am using 6items case with both champ, and equal skill level by the way.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-07-20T04:45:56.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hexdrinker, Simple as that\n\nRush it, before you get any crit, and then build normally\n\nOtherwise, Stand in your minions, so she hopefully ults the wrong target, and wait for her First R, before you tornado her, since her R resets on hitting a moonlit target, stay away from her where you can, to avoid being pulled into her shield and then the rest of her combo.
