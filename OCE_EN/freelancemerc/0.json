Sure, singed is barely played at all, however recently I encountered a rare level 7 main and he absolutely destroyed me, I was playing my level 7 darius....\n\nI think it all comes down to what you build on him and the runes/masteries you take. Most singed players usually take grasp, thunderlords or maybe even bond of stone, this guy took deathfire touch. Along with ghost, ignite and a rushed rylais he could constantly circle me while I was hopelessly trying to reach him but couldn't due to the perma slowing effect and his incredibly fast speed. Tried to pull him? He tossed me over his shoulder and zoom off he goes. I guess you just have to experiment on what really works well and what doesn't but he sure as hell can dominate an opponent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-08-27T06:02:08.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he op because he leaves a trail of death.
