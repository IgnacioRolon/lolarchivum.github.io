If someone is like this, scared of playing ranked actually don&#039;t play ranked, but play normal. The different between ranked players and normal players, ranked players are more serious to LOL, they are worrying the up and down of LP and to learn more about the game. But if you&#039;re a normal player don&#039;t worry about if you&#039;re friends are ranking you have to do the same. You have own more important things to do. In normal, if you don&#039;t troll pick and troll in game, you still can learn and improve. Overall of this game is not to raged at anything, get some rests for your eyes. Lastly, Stay focus and get some motivations to turn your life around.","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2015-08-10T11:28:57.089+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was intimated at first when it came to playing ranked, but I love competition and a challenge so I knew I'd always play ranked.

It wasn't that hard either, I slowly got used to different Champions and diversified my play pool a lot (Picking counters to certain Champions often gives you a huge advantage - especially in top lane where you are more or less on your own for the whole game).\n\nHaha.\n\nYeah I've met heaps of nice players along the way and many an honourable opponent :p\n\nSome games are land slides and some games appear to be over at Champ select or within the first 5 minutes but if you lay down a few strategies you can easily turn them around or beat those matches where their whole team has an edge over you. I've got a few ideas I keep fresh in my mind that I've learnt along the way, just general strats I'll call out like when to gank, split push or roam or w/e and have a lot of the same ideas for items for certain matchups along with playstyles or general strates like when to play aggressive, when to farm etc, when to call lane a loss and accept losing a turret and things like that, how to turn games :p)\n\nI learnt a lot from the guides at Lolpro.com (Team Liquid formerly team Curse put up guides on this website) and when I first started out used mobafire to give me some ideas and there are heaps of tips on there too [although I prefer team Curse's quick concise tips etc]. Riot has good tips too like in the Champ spotlights and Dark horses section and now the added patch rundowns etc and my favourite place to visit for strats and mainly ideas and tips is leagueoflegends.wikia.com as it explains some more or less unknown mechanics of skills and kits along with info about how armor pen etc is applied mathematically and it can be valuable to know certain things when picking up or playing certain champs (Like Ahri's firefox applying full single target slow for each of the orbs etc with rylai's [it counts as a single target ability] and the page is full of little quirks and happenings like this.","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2015-08-12T01:09:30.323+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowledge of the champions etc. is definitely holding me back. It's funny because I've purposely done that (to my detriment) because I don't want to know how every champion works. I like the idea that many parts of the game are still new to me. Like I played GP for the first time the other day and was like, \"OMG I love himmmm\". And when I got completely owned by a Morgana in one game, I was like, \"who is this CHAMP?! I must learn her and own like she is\"... and now she's my main :)\n\nYeah I use mobafire.com a lot, but might have to try out Lolpro.com based on your recommendation and what you've been able to achieve in just 2 months! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-12T01:20:43.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha.\n\nYeah a lot of my losses are mainly from playing Champs I'm not in-depth on and taking time to think out builds and stuff rather than concentrate on my play, but a lot of Champions you can carry over the ideas.\n\n:p","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-10T10:41:32.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played long enough to treat ranked like normals.\n\n\nIm basically immune to all ragers/afk/feeders\nLast time i got 2 afks and 1 intent feeder, not even mad, i just laughed at my team\n\nSo yea, if i lose in ranked, its fine, only a game.
