And also minion aggro seems... off. It can be rare but there&#039;s an issue where ranged minions just won&#039;t reset and will constantly harass me until I kill them. Just yesterday I was testing how far the minions would actually chase me and they ended up following me into tower. I don&#039;t really know where I&#039;m going with this but I just wanted to see if anyone else has noticed the aggro problems.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-11-28T07:50:43.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you're saying.
