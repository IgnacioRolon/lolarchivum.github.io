Which in my case is around another 162900 IP which is pretty small compared to the 320550 I&#039;ve earned and spent on champions alone so far. Then there&#039;s still runes which will still cost 5217 IP for the most basic page of 3 Flat AD quints, Flat AD marks Flat Armor seals and Flat MR glyphs. And even if that sounds reasonable to you that&#039;s probably only because I chose the cheapest most common runes you can get and if you wanted to try anything else a little more specialized your&#039;re looking at   two to three times that price for one page of runes and _these things are basically a requirement to even scale against your opponents  and not get completely stomped in the early game or simply be left at a rather significant disadvantage._\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \nSo yeah people before me have pointed out this little schtick and I really doubt that this will change with champs just being another form of income for riot (RP for champs made me kek when I first started playing) but I just felt like posting about it anyway so I hope you enjoyed my wall of text and dissapointed Brand.","replies":[]}
