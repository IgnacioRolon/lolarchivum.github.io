So hopefully I have some credibility xD\n\nI actually met one of my best friends though that. _(I got him into league, naturally)_.\nAnd what seemed to help was to break down the game into its seperate parts, rather than worrying about the whole picture \n\nEg. _**\"are we winning or losing\"**_ is the big picture, and when you look at it like that, unless you're a fed Vayne or Yi, you have very little control over what happens. and then it's easy to get tilted because nothing you do makes much of a difference. \nAnd people with Aspergers tend to feel more comfortable with a bit of control.\n\nSo breaking the game up into its seperate parts and focusing on one or more of them, can be helpful. Rather than looking at: _**\"are we winning or losing\"**_, look at lots of smaller factors like:\n**_\"Who has better objective control.\"_** or\n**_\"Which team has the CS advantage\"_** or \n_**\"Who has greater map pressure\"**_ or\n**_\"Whose warding game is stronger\"_**\n_**\"Who has greater kill participation\"**_ _(remember that kill participation isnt the same as who has the most kills, a team with 20 kills can have less participation than a team with 10 depending on how many people were present for those kills, and so the gold difference isn't always what it looks like.)_\nand there are many other factors too, that you can look at.\n\nWhat this does, is break the game up into more manageable sections, and sections that can be more easily controlled. For example, you have virtually no control over who wins or loses as everyone is trying their best to control this, and your effort is just 1 out of 10.\nBut it is easier to wrestle control over something more tangible like CS numbers. If you are behind, start bringing your team's gold advantage up by doing some jungle farming and lane pushing, take note of how many CS certain members on their team are getting per minute, and try to beat that.\n\nNow, not only are you giving yourself a clear task to complete, _(which takes your mind off tilting)_, but it also gives you control over one section of the game. which in turn increases your chances of winning. And just by completing these tasks like _\"get better CS than their team in the next 5 minutes\"_ your mind sees this as a little victory, and every victory reduces the feeling of being tilted.\n\nAnd you don't have to keep it to yourself either.\nIf you think they'll listen, tell your team: _\"Look guys, we are behind, I want us to average X number of CS in the next X number of minutes, can we focus on closing the gold gap before doing any teamfights.\"_\n\nIt's easier to take control over and win small battles and focus on making those battles bigger and bigger, than it is to just look at the overall war.\n\nso start by looking at your lane opponent:\nIf you are top lane and Rumble has 154 CS, I have 120. Give yourself an achievable amount of time to beat him, and focus on that. Once thats done, move on to a bigger goal, like increasing the whole team's CS. Start warding areas that make it safer for your ADC to farm. Leave CS for your mid laner if they need it, and go take some of the jungle for yourself, as it's easier for top laners to farm the jungle that it is for mid laners. Now your team is ahead in farm and the gold gap is close, you cam move to a new segment of the game. Maybe focus on just taking towers or making sure you and your team are in the right position for the next 2 dragons.\n\nYou don't have to win every battle in every part of the game. Just focus on winning enough to bridge the gap. This gives you more control over a situation, in a time when you can feel behind and helpless. \n\nSo Instead of thinking _\"Shit we are losing.\"_\nYou think _\"Daymn son, we are beating them in CS, or map control\"_\n\nIt may help, it may not, but at least it's a better mindset!\n\nAnyway thats my rambling, I hope that can help at least a little. xD\n_(my friend now always out-farms me in every game!)_\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n________\n\n\n_**TL;DR:**_\nRather than focusing on just _\"Are we wining\"_, which is something we have little control over, break up the game into smaller battles like _\"Who is winning in CS\"_, _\"Who has more objective control\"_, _\"Which side has more map pressure.\"_ and focus on controlling and winning these small battles, that way you get a sense of control _(important for not tilting)_ and you get to see your team winning little things every now and then _(also important for not tilting)_, and if you win enough little battles, the game will look after itself anyway.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-30T12:26:43.877+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This looks like some really solid advice. I'm not going to claim I'm any good in-game, but this certainly seems like something that everyone (not just people with Asperger's Syndrome or Autistic Spectrum \"Disorders\") could learn from.\n\nLooking back at my own thought processes in-game, it seems like I've been doing something similar for a while now. I will rarely think in terms of \"we are winning/losing\", but rather in terms of \"we are winning/losing because [reason]\". This often leads me to try and figure out what needs to be done to improve the outcome for my team, and giving myself workable objectives to achieve that goal (which is, in essence, the \"point\" of everything Lord Sessh has said).\n\nIt might be that I'll work on defending important objectives (like an inhibitor or inhibitor turret), focus on giving my team some vision on important locations (like Dragon/Baron pit), or target an isolated/overextended enemy to put the enemy team at a disadvantage for the next team fight (or even cause them to pull back while waiting for the respawn timer). The point is, it comes down to reasonable \"mini-objectives\" that I, personally, can control, without having to rely on my team too much (or even at all).\n\nHaving read through Lord Sessh's post, it seems like I probably need to focus more on what can turn the game around rather than the most likely outcome. Stop thinking in terms of \"we are winning/losing because [reason]\" altogether, and just focus on \"this is what needs to be done to give our team the advantage\".\n\nThat's my opinion anyway, take it as you will.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wellperegrine02","date":"2017-08-30T11:32:18.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I add you in game please?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-30T23:54:35.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure thing!\nMy summoner name is Itachi Uchiha\n\nBut ill warn you, my theory of the game is stronger than my actual practice of it xD","replies":[{"poster":"Wellperegrine02","date":"2017-09-02T10:16:52.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you mean, I was coaching in CGA for a while, couldn't make CGO for csgo because my mechanics weren't good enough.

Dont try to justify anything you do because chances are youre both wrong. \n\nIf you want to get good at the game watch pro streams and coaching sessions by LS.
