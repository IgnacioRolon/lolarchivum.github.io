Even the new Resistance Illaoi is perfectly fitting in with the theme. However one skin was left out. Since its release, Battlecast Xerath has been a sub-par skin. Players have been asking for a rework since it came out and still to this very day was forgotten by RIOT. I play Xerath a lot and i dont understand why all the other Battlecast skins (Chogath, Kog&#039;maw, Skarner, Urgot) were updated and not Xerath.\r\n\r\nThere is so much you could do with Battlecast Xerath. He could transform into an artillery cannon for his ultimate. Constant electronic effects coming from his body. His plates can shift and move, not locked to one specific area. His W could be an airstrike strike marker. I just think there is a lot you can do with this skin. Also, in the splash art his armor is Bronze with some other small details, whereas when you get in game it is a dull black.\r\n\r\nIf updated, the price could be risen to match the other Battlecast skins around 1820RP. I know that would mean those who own the skin already would be &#039;making money&#039;, but there arent many who own the skin. And i am sure you will make lots of profit since there are still many Xerath players out there who have been waiting for this skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-22T12:09:35.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe the other Battlecast skins were ever updated? \n\nThe Kog and Skarner skins were created after the theme was solidified (with the Vel'Koz skin). \nVel's is the same as release. \nCho's might have had texture updates when the rest of his skins were done but as far as I know that was not the case because it was current Legendary quality.\nUrgot's was updated because he got a visual overhaul.\n\nWhile I agree it's not a fantastic skin and certainly doesn't fit the theme too well anymore, I don't think it's fair to say all the others were updated and his was ignored because that just isn't the case.\n\nIt's not what you want to hear but the skin is unlikely to be updated unless Xerath himself gets some sort of visual update, be it an overhaul or some texture updates, but compared to some of the older champions he still holds up fairly well so I don't imagine anything will be changing anytime soon.","replies":[]}]}
