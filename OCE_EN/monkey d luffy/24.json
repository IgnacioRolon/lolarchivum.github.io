We did this mostly so that we could post on the site using those champions&rsquo; names, but also as a precaution against someone taking the name and pretending to be associated with Riot Games (we don&rsquo;t let people put &lsquo;Riot&rsquo; in their name for this reason). However, there is very little danger in players using champion names, and we no longer make posts under them, so we&rsquo;ve stopped reserving champion names.\n\nWe won&rsquo;t take champion names away from players who currently use them for any reason, although they are still subject to decay. If a player doesn&rsquo;t log into an account for a certain period of time, their summoner name becomes free. We can&rsquo;t share with you when an account will become inactive, but you can read more about it here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914\n\nGunny\nRiot Games Player Support\n\nMay all your hits be crits and all your fails be tales!\n\n-_-\n\n\nWell this is very sad news... at least I have the answer now.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-26T09:36:14.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This seems really counter-intuitive, considering that previous champion names haven't been opened to be used by players. Riot should either reserve ***ALL*** champion names or ***NONE***, there is no reason to have it one way for the older names and another for the newer names, except to be biased.\n\nI'm officially petitioning Riot to open all champion names they're currently holding from the public to be available as summoner names!
