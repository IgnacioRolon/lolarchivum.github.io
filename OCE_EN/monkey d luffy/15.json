It&#039;s funny though, even though our two countries are so close in so many ways there&#039;s not a whole lot we have in common!\"\n\nAnd well I thought of some things that I thought would work great, they&#039;ll most likely be ignored and never ever be realised but hey no harm in putting some ideas I had out here.\n\n\n\n1. Surfer Fizz. Australia And New Zealand And Oceania as a whole has great beaches, and what do you do at beaches? Surf! And for some reason when I wonder who would fit this theme I just think of a fish throwing a great white at me wielded with a surfboard :)\n(Note, sure other places in the world also have beaches but I still think it&#039;d fit. ( If you guys at Riot are wanting skins that are really specific to a certain area then that&#039;s fine)\n\n\n2. This has probably been thought of but Oceania is a VERY multicultural area, trying to make a skin to appeal to everyone in that area is definitely a challenge, maybe this challenge shouldn&#039;t be pursued and you could just hand out RP? (Worst case scenario)\n\n\n3. Okay, so, this skin would make it very easy to appeal to Oceania, maybe, Tourist Ezreal? Let me explain, now with Oceania being the vast region it is, it is definitely a challenge to appeal to it, however, if there was to say... a Tourist Ezreal his splash art could contain different references to different parts of Oceania. Maybe he could have photos in the background of him at certain places or his clothing could be a sort of mix between the cultures, it could really easily capture Oceania  in a skin this way just by adding little things to the given splash art. (Oh and I think it'd suit his champion too since he's an explorer and stuff).\n\n\nWell, they're my ideas, some feedback could be cool :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2015-06-17T15:50:42.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"who carez rito dozent giv a fuck about diz zerver anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-19T03:27:11.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why make it?\n\nMost companies much larger don't even bother","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-06-20T04:35:11.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What game is larger then league lol?","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-06-22T04:29:57.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WoW","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2015-06-22T04:20:50.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well itz all about $ kidz. itz been more than 2 yrz zince diz zerver created and no oceanic zkin yet. wtf do u ezpect. itz GG","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-17T03:13:18.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They won't be giving the skins for free so if they don't make it why would they hand out rp?","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-06-17T05:16:56.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=sparklefart,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EpJJbVoA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-17T03:13:18.372+0000)\n>\n> They won't be giving the skins for free so if they don't make it why would they hand out rp?\n\nActually they would be giving the skin for free, the oceanic skin would be oceanias skin meaning everyone in oceania would get it for free.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-18T04:22:48.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oui Oui","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-17T08:40:18.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"y yu put diz in misklaneoz, it doz not bleogn in diz bard. op plz.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-06-17T08:49:09.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then what board does it belong in?","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-17T08:52:36.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friend Of Golems,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EpJJbVoA,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-06-17T08:49:09.962+0000)\n>\n> Then what board does it belong in?\n\nit blongz in palyre craetinz.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-06-17T09:35:21.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't a creation, I didn't create anything, it is merely a concept and as OCE has no concept boards there's really nowhere else to put it.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-17T10:41:30.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friend Of Golems,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EpJJbVoA,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-17T09:35:21.061+0000)\n>\n> This isn't a creation, I didn't create anything, it is merely a concept and as OCE has no concept boards there's really nowhere else to put it.\n\nmeh just helping, almost got banned for putting things on wrong boards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-06-16T18:29:08.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um...
