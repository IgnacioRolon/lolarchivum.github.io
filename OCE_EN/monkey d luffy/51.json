Some would disagree. 2 Champs with unlimited stack potential. Riven with high damage and decent tankiness. Riven with mostly unavoidable ultimate. ETC. Of course these can be countered in a few random and difficult ways but there are definitely many problems with the balance in this game. Some champs get no loving. Take Yorick for example. He is far too item reliant and by the time he's useful the game is often over. Far too Mana reliant that he has to restrict his item choice early on instead of enjoying variety. Lee Sin being far too damaging for his utility. Syndra doing far too much damage with her utility and having a pretty strong escape with her stun.\n\nWhen you meet a hard counter in lane everyone will call you a noob of you ask for a gank. They tell you to farm under turret, not being able to leave turret and farming with the stupid amount of damage the turret now does to minions is a chore in itself, especially for champs that have high CDs early in game.\n\nChampions with such huge gap closers can often use them to escape with small cooldowns.\n\nChampions like fizz that rarely get punished for their mistakes (Some would say they do get punished but I would disagree that it's easy to mess up as a fizz, you know the damage you do even if you do mess up is enough to at least get a kill or 2)\n\nThere are huge balance issues with this game which is why you can see that some champions are played far more than others.\n\nThe new jungle items aren't as enjoyable as the old ones, even with the new smite on champions. Blasting smite is woeful compared to say chilling smite.\n\nJax counter strike is too strong for its own good, having that and a stun and incredible damage is not balanced, aswell as being naturally tanky.\n\nThis game is a great game but in no way is it balanced. But having as many champions as it does would be a great deal to balance them.\n\nTo increase the fun of this game it has been stated that balancing out the champions too much by lowering everyones overall damage creates slow and tedious fights with too many people escaping and just far too much sustain. The game becomes dull and tiresome... But the problem remains with certain champions HARD countering far too many other champions.\n\nUsing Jax as an example against a caster, the stun + the damage that Jax outputs will in most cases still out play the spells that can bypass counterstrike.\n\nSome champs are just Anti Fun for the opposition and are either not punished enough by mistakes or have too small a window to be punished for them.\n\nGreat game, requires immediate balance for some of the champions that are far too often abused. Fiora, Riven, Jax, Nasus, Veigar, Syndra, Leblanc, Fizz and probably a few others I can't be bothered thinking about. Fizz definitely needs to be punished more for being reckless.\n\nPeople may disagree. To them I say, Good day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-15T14:41:02.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That shows they are monitoring their game and responding too feed back good job riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-01-15T18:06:59.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They wouldn't need to if they had it together in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-15T19:53:44.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta changes, items change and people learn how to manipulate champions to use their full potential. They can't just stick a champ in the pool and be like 'this one is totes balanced and will never need tweaking'. Also, have you thought about all the coding that goes into this game? Of course there are going to be bugs and other glitches. Considering that League is the top played computer game in the world (and they constantly have people like you whining) they are doing really well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
