People complain about balance, but all champions are about the same.\n\n+ The problem is some champions like Lee Sin, Thresh and Zed have very high skill-caps. So to use them to their fullest potentional, you need to be skilled. Garen though, takes almost no skill. \n\n A Silver Garen player, has the same physical mechanics **on Garen** as a Diamond Garen player. What sets them apart is decision making and CS.\n\n So when that Garen runs at you, he's using his champion to it's highest potential, because the skill-cap is so low. That's what makes him effective.\n\n The trade off is that, Garen has very limited options. If running at the enemy isn't working, he's a little screwed, while Zed has almost limitless options.\n\nThis is why League coaches advise low elo players to play low skill-cap champions. All that being said, Garen is a little strong right now, but it's not insanely out of balance. He'll be almost as effective even if he is nerfed a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-01-18T10:59:38.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he is fucked and riot doesn't want to do anything about it.\n\nBuilds Black Cleaver and the rest Tanky Items.
