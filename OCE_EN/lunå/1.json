Fair enough if i was abusing the team and you decide to slap me with the ban, however i was not. Sending a ticket as well didn&#039;t help... thank you riot for letting me down and letting the toxic abusive players continue to play.\n\nit started with the support being toxic as i was a little tunneled trying to stay alive from a gank, i was playing adc which i recently picked up so i wasnt that good at it, this was not a ranked solo game so i saw no issues with learning and trying my best to which i didnt feed, after she started being toxic i did mute her then it continued to the rest of the team, i kept sona muted but the jgler and mid would say things i thought i needed to know so i kept them, they then all started to abuse me, they then decided to continue to harrass me and decide not to peel for me to which i said i wouldnt heal them as whats the point on using my summoners for people harrassing me and not peeling for me? i decided to save it for when i was stuck, even tho i would still go in heal and try to save them when they got caught but they never did for me ^^; when i used caps i didnt mean to i didnt realize i pressed caps and i normally touch type so i didnt see that it was caps, so that may have come across as toxic but was never meant as toxic, anyway thank you riot for letting me down and banning me for toxic and abuse even tho i wasnt abusive and i didnt mean to be or i wasnt toxic, i hope you enjoyed me putting my money into the game ^^\n\n&lt;Chat Logs&gt;\n\nGame 1\nLun&aring;: wd\nLun&aring;: ya know i was about to apologize\nLun&aring;: will be muting you and reporting after the game for it\nLun&aring;: ty fams\nLun&aring;: also couldnt heal

and could be punishable by chat ban at most imo as I didn't say what I fully meant, as I meant be glad im not abusing you as im not about that life anymore and that she wasn't worth losing my acc over when I didn't even feel the need to be abusive and say rude remarks to her all game, that was the only thing said, tho the sad thing in that game for some reason my sight stone wouldn't refill at all, went to the fountain, died and such was hard, but finally worked after I upgraded the ward ;w;\n\nGame 3\n\n\nGame One\n\n[0:57] Lunå (Miss Fortune): chill i can see em\n[1:42] Lunå (Miss Fortune):

Lunå (Miss Fortune): you dont even know what im thinking hun, now i thank you for griefing me and abusin me\n[30:14] [All] Lunå (Miss Fortune): gg\n\nokay so this game, had an ahri support in a ranked game who built as a mage, she would constantly take cs and push my lane when I didn't want to back or push it, I wanted to freeze it, as the adc it is my choice I believe if I choose to do so, it was around 4-5 mins into the game, I was almost full hp she wanted to b I however did not but she decided to push my lane anyway, she was abusive and such after that calling me noob and all sorts so I muted her at around 10 mins at 18 mins I realized that she wasn't going to go support item wise which would benefit the team greatly so I told her if she didn't want to play the role properly I would of happily swapped as we really needed locket and such as well as I was a support main who was auto filled to adc, when she got a sightstone later in the game I thanked her for it and decided to unmute her at the same time thinking she had stopped, I was wrong, she was still abusing me for god knows what I did wrong.\n\n\nin my eyes none of these are per say toxic enough to warrant a ban if I was toxic to which I wasn't the most toxic thing out of all chat logs presented would be game 2 in this edit which in my opinion still would warrant a ban, fair enough chat ban but nothing more than that.. \n\nso support said they will not unban me but I will continue to argue my case as I only see what they are doing as victim blaming, im not being toxic, im communicating with my team mates and trying my absolute best to not play bad, but atlas I was the one banned instead of the toxic people who were abusing myself and sometimes the team... i guess that's how the cookie crumbles.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-12-04T10:20:35.176+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Luna,\n\nI'm making a call here to overturn the ban. Basically, I disagree with the support rep's decision for a couple of reasons.\n\nYou've made an incredible effort to reform this year. I won't go into detail here on what I observed when looking into your account history unless you want me to. But these days you're mostly neutral or even positive in game. Good stuff, keep it up.\n\nThere are still a few instances where, if I may be candid, you can be annoying to some teammates and lecture them a bit. If anything maybe the next thing you could work on would be to just let the little things go when teammates don't play the way you want. There's a difference between communicating your tactics and outright telling others what to do and then getting visibly upset when they don't do what you want. It's sometimes the spark of their negativity towards you.\nI'm not condoning their behaviour, but when I make a friendly request in game and someone reacts negatively to me it's a mute and move on situation.\nYou're sometimes still reported for this sort of thing but Instant Feedback decided not to trigger on any of them until now.\n\nIf you'd had a clean record then that chat log wouldn't have gotten you banned. But considering you were one step away from perma, and you spent the game arguing with your (far less than sportsmanlike) teammates, Instant Feedback decided that you were disruptive to the game enough to apply a punishment, which was the perma at your stage.\nNot perfect, but honestly I would have thought this to be overturned with some coaching from player support on how to keep improving.\n\nThanks for raising visibility to this. I've unbanned your account.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-04T10:39:05.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Instant Feedback decided that you were disruptive to the game enough to apply a punishment, which was the perma at your stage.\n\nI get that generally speaking, you guys don't like giving out the information, but in this case, i feel the need to ask anyway.\n\nWhat caused the Instant Feedback to ping these games?\n\nTo me instant feedback seems like it really shouldn't have picked up on any of this.\n\nAnd it feels like the system determines that \"chatting enough\" is a bannable offence.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-12-04T11:03:49.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instant Feedback is more nuanced than simply picking up on direct verbal abuse. It rates chat based on tone as well for good reason.\n\nEver get those games where one or two players are having a bad game and for the life of them simply cannot stop complaining about each other/the team comp/the scoreline/_insert inane reason_? They aren't using anything strictly classified as verbal abuse or anything like that, but they're definitely more focused on whinging than playing the game. They're disrupting the team and definitely ruining the game for everyone.\nThat type of player gets reported, a lot. Eventually they'll be banned if they keep it up.\n\nThese are the less precise cases that Instant Feedback judges.\n\nIn Luna's case, the first chat log posted was the one that triggered the ban. The follow up chat logs were pulled by player support to show some other, albeit less solid, examples of similar behaviour that Instant Feedback did not trigger against.\n\nIn the first log pretty much everything after:\n\n_\"Lunå: im not going to waste my heal when shes not in range\nLunå: yw\"_\n\n...was unnecessary, could be reasonably considered to set the tone of Luna's chat to negative/disruptive, and likely triggered the ban.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lunå","date":"2017-12-21T06:40:40.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"firstly thank you for unbanning my account, i have tried very hard to reform but after this instance im now a little terrified to play on the account because even if im trying to follow the summoners code im worried ill be perma again for toxicity or such when in my opinion im just trying to communicate, can you give me an idea of how long it takes for me to go back teirs in the punishment ladder and tips of what to say instead, i try my very best to be positive, and encourage my team mates but as i said im now terrified of doing something wrong, so if i unbind chat for a while will help most likely but theres still the case of when does the punishment teirs go back to chat bans etc :) thank you so much for your help and sorry for replying late i didnt realize you posted on my boards post til my friend pointed it out","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T22:11:20.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lunå,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=MfOk0ATW,comment-id=00080001,timestamp=2017-12-21T06:40:40.179+0000)\n>\n> firstly thank you for unbanning my account, i have tried very hard to reform but after this instance im now a little terrified to play on the account because even if im trying to follow the summoners code im worried ill be perma again for toxicity or such when in my opinion im just trying to communicate, can you give me an idea of how long it takes for me to go back teirs in the punishment ladder and tips of what to say instead, i try my very best to be positive, and encourage my team mates but as i said im now terrified of doing something wrong, so if i unbind chat for a while will help most likely but theres still the case of when does the punishment teirs go back to chat bans etc :) thank you so much for your help and sorry for replying late i didnt realize you posted on my boards post til my friend pointed it out\n\nmute all, unbind chat from enter, communicate with pings.

When the game first starts out, balance and preserving the player ecosystem is everything.\n> As the game gets older, people start moving onto the next big thing, but a core sticks around. There's less of them, but they tend to spend more, on average.\n> As the game reaches it's final stage (sometimes called Farm Stage), a very small team is in charge of keeping the game on life support. They may love the game, but their development resources are tiny. The only thing they can do is fiddle with numbers. If you can't get your remaining players excited with new art, levels, or mechanics, what do you turn to?\n\nI think we all know which stage riot is at right now. Might also explain the reliance on bots to moderate behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T23:52:47.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=MfOk0ATW,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2017-11-28T23:39:16.324+0000)\n>\n> The sad thing is, the way to take a stand would to be just to stop paying for anything in league, but the fact of the matter is, that some whales will always be paying for the game no matter how shit it is becoming for the player.\n> \n> Past that best option is to stop playing and hope that the smaller player base ruins the game to the point where Riot admit they fucked up and try and fix the game and the systems in the game.\n\nI honestly think that as long as the roi is positive, tencent just dont care whether they run oce lol into the ground. Globally, if this new strategy ups revenue by 20% (plucked from air) and oce dies and they lose 200k accounts from like 50 million.

A full ban doesn't encourage good communication between Riot and the player at all. \n\nIf I have one piece of advice, is to suggest to people what to do rather than telling people what to do.\nInstead of : \"stop taking cs without relic pls esps since iwas trying to q em\"\nYou could say: \"Annie, could you stop trying to take cs without relic up?\"\nIf they don't follow then there's nothing more you can do, but it also helps with the team communication.
