I thought that if the team was imbalanced there was a system which declared the game as a draw? Or at least the losing team didn&#039;t have to have a loss?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-03T19:28:37.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey **Illidanisdead**,\n\nUnfortunately, loss prevented (or loss forgiven/compensation mode) cannot be retroactively applied to games in order to prevent abuse. As per the Riot Games Player Support article titled \"[Loss Prevented](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014-Loss-Prevented)\", \n\n> This mode only activates when a large number of players are being impacted on a system-wide scale. We hit something we call \"The Button\" to activate it for the platform. Compensation Mode cannot be retroactively enabled or turned on for a player on an individual basis.","replies":[]}]}
