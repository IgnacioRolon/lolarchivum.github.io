I started back to League of Legends since the Words2018 began and I am sincerely want a second chance to play League!  It has been almost 11 months since my account got banned and I really missed it now.  I guarantee that I won&#039;t make same mistakes again and never. I know you guys need time to evaluate my past records in game and I am sorry again for those silly speech came out from my mouth.\r\nPlease give me second chance I will appreciate for the kindness and cherish for the opportunity!!\r\nmaight be on the wrong board because I am basically reporting myself!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-28T15:38:59.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I congratulate your effort to reform, perhaps it is best to start with this:\n\nWhat of your previous chances?\n\nYou don't receive a perma ban from any single offence (barring cheating), so you've had at least a 14 day suspension before permanent, usually 2 chat restrictions as well. What makes this time different?\n\nTo be clear, permanent means permanent, you won't be getting your account back, but *you* aren't banned, the account is. If you truly desire to reform your behaviour and return to the game, you can do so on a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"straight2bronze6","date":"2018-10-28T15:52:37.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it was true that I received those warnings before the permaban and I just ignored them. I really want this account back mainly because  it was the first and the only account I created in OCE server , considering I will back to League and stay for a while I'd like to start from where I fall. Btw I like my summoner name and I'd to keep it! ty for reply","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-29T04:03:59.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Therein lies the issue. If it was only the severity of a permanent suspension that has prompted you to improve your behaviour, then nothing less was going to do that. Giving permabanned accounts back to players entirely undermines the gravity of the punishment and renders it ineffective.\n\nThey did try a system which returned permabanned accounts after a period of good behaviour but it had a almost universal relapse rate. The number of permabanned accounts isn't high to begin with, so allowing those players back to ruin hundreds more games (even if it's only one each before they are banned again) for the one or two players who would actually do something with that extra chance wasn't practical and isn't a good use of resources that could be better spent improving feeder detection.\n\nIf your desire to reform is genuine, then it's unfortunate that you will have to start from scratch, but in this case it's a matter of the majority ruining it for the few. Much as they might like to, Riot can't cater their reform systems for individuals. Ultimately, you earned those punishments, and clearly the threat alone of permaban wasn't enough. The best you can do is consider it a lesson learned with a fresh account.\n\nI don't believe there is any way to retrieve a summoner name from a banned account, but that would be a question for player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-10-28T21:41:44.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's important to note that if you were truly reformed, you likely wouldn't be here \"asking for a chance to reform\", and asking for the account back. Not considering the fact that the rate of reform decreases significantly with each punishment tier, and that the rate of reform is near non-existent for perma-bans, a player who is truly reformed will understand that they did the wrong thing and those actions have consequences, the consequences in this case being a perma-ban. Such a player would understand that they would not receive the account back, and that they in fact do not deserve to receive the account back, as that is the price to pay for the things they have done. The damage has been done and there is nothing they can do to change that, the best they can do is improve their behaviour going forward.\n\nIf you seek your chance to reform, then you need to act upon it. Take time to understand why the things you did were wrong, why you did them and how you can improve your behaviour. Ask for help if you need it (we will be more than happy to discuss the actions that led you here and explain how such behaviour is not acceptable, as well as give some suggestions on how you can manage going forward). Don't just *say* you are reformed, *work* towards it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"straight2bronze6","date":"2018-10-28T15:28:25.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and I like to prove info to riot for proving it was my account ! ty","replies":[]}]}
