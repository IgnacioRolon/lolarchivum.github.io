I currently have sitting in my champions loot 9 champion shards. Now this would be exciting except for the fact that I already own all the champions. Is there some way in which the game could realise that champion shards to someone who already has all the champions is completely useless and entirely redundant. Could you please consider introducing something that would allow you to reroll them into skin shards or perhaps allow us to gift the champion shards to someone else or trade with another player? \r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nPops","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-07T14:55:51.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahah just save them, combine them on next champ release for insta free new champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slendah","date":"2016-04-07T10:03:14.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am only about 7 champs short of owning them all, and all the champs i own, i have 2 or 3 skins for over half of them. shards and keys and boxes are nearly uselss to me. riot i think you need more content mann. new summoners rift, maybe 5 turrets per team per lane instead of 3? so longer lanes, a bigger map. man just put me on the creative improvements team... i have so many ideas for new versions of  2v2 and 6v6 maps.  IDK why there arent more maps already? i mean the game has been out for years now\n{{champion:420}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-07T10:31:21.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They have tried different maps and SR combinations over the years and they simply do not work, people do not take them seriously enough to work.\n\nThe only thing I can see that would work is a 4v4 SR and a 1v1 map of some sort (I have ideas, but CBF explaining).\n\nThe main issue is people not taking the game serious when anything but SR. Look at the old Dominion, TT is going the same way, players use the same dodgy tactics over and over and force others to never play them again.\n\nLet's say you make the SR map bigger, it will only do one thing, longer games. You add another players, longer queues, games that will be over 2 minutes in, more trolls, more players who actually want to take this game as serious as a game can be and will be fucked over faster.\n\nImagine 6 players in team select, 4 calls on the same lane, 3 players refusing to yield, you will get nowhere. They need a new map period. The three lane idea is about 10 years old now, if not more, back from the old DoTA days.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-07T14:36:35.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Three lanes is how mobas work.
