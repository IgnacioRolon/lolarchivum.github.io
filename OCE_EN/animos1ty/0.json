Basically what happened was adding another league below bronze made everyone MMR negative, basically meaning a gold 5 rank possessed the same MMR as a silver player. How that works is they removed division 5 from the boards meaning from bronze-gold there are 3 fewer divisions to climb. And since there are 4 divisions in iron that makes a displacement of 1 division. So essentially everyone's MMR got demoted by 1 division inadvertently.  However the good news is that since theres a lower division, the quality of players in each division has dropped. Meaning if you actually belong in a certain division you can climb there quicker. \n\nI was g5 and got promoted to g4 and my mmr was silver 2 at the time. I was losing 30lp a game and only getting 13lp per win. Today I went on a 9 game winstreak and now im back in g4.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2018-12-10T07:53:17.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i was getting 15LP a win and as much as 24LP a loss.
