Got a quadra before chasing their Rengar down for (what should have been) a penta. I killed him about 5-10s before the first person from the other team respawned, yet I did not get a penta for it? Whats happening here, did the ruling for a pentakill change or was this a problem in game?\r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/112412015/200595032?tab=overview\r\n\r\n&quot;Penta&quot; is right at the end\r\nMatch is here if needed\r\nNot sure how to put video on","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-25T23:31:06.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey JAKO6400,\n\nWhile we do appreciate you taking your time to report a bug, because this is the Help and Support boards, we try to limit posts to technical issues and general questions. As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
