Then he stands still, removing your ability to kite, stops all auto attacks for what feels like a significant period of time, then slashes and thrusts, almost invisible in a 1v1, and most certainly invisible in a full blown teamfight. Like Rengar&#039;s Q, this breaks the chain of gameplay, abruptly stopping the smooth and flowing animations that is the new Xhao.\r\n\r\nWas the mastermind behind for Rengar&#039;s abomination of a Q also responsible for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-10-04T13:19:24.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin's w does a significant amount of damage and resets his passive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-04T12:39:25.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar's Q was designed so there was more outplay and skill involved in using it because his old q was just an auto attack enhancer and you would literally activate it just before jumping in with your ultimate and you got free 300+ dmg on your leap attack. It was much easier and faster to one shot a target, nowadays you need to either be extremely fed or you have to land your full combo and another ferocity q to kill an adc from my experience.","replies":[]}]}
