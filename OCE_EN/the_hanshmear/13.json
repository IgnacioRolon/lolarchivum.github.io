Is the story easy to follow? Are there too many characters? If you have time, let me know how this flows to an outside eye! See below: \n-----------------\n\nFlames.\n\nA world of fire. The heat is overwhelming, suffocating. Screams of terror batter his ears, the smell of burning flesh fills his nostrils. His helmet, a combination of heat and pressure, threatens to boil its contents at any moment. He tries to force his thoughts to his people, scared and overrun, to his duties, to his... \n\nHis eyes see only flames.\n\n----- V ---- \n\n&ldquo;...his sacrifice was for the good of us all.&rdquo; \n\nXin Zhao roused from his revery. Usually the adept eye, he chided himself for drifting off during his new lord&rsquo;s speech. Jarvan III was a good man, an even better warrior, yet he and many like him had fallen to the wrath of the dragon sorceress and her beasts. \n\n&ldquo;There is no threat that we cannot face, none that we cannot overcome....&rdquo;\n\nJarvan IV wasn&rsquo;t the orator his father had been. He was stiff and rigid in his speech, but he had always led his men by example – on and off the battlefield. He was adorned in his red dragon plate, ripped from the hide and horns of the dragon that had started this mess. \n\n*Her* father. \n\nHe stole a glimpse at the half-breed. She seemed different, slightly on edge in the courtyard below the high balcony.  Xin Zhao had his own suspicions regarding the outsider, but he would hold them in... for now.\n\n---- V ----- \n\n&ldquo;...yes, this war has taken a toll on us all, but now is the time to rise up, now is the time to fight!&rdquo;\n\nShauna Vayne moved through the crowd. Usually a lithe shadow, today's bright blue dragon armour was designed with one statement in mind: I can beat you, I've done it before. Her eyes scanned the crowd, the new king&rsquo;s hunters stood solemnly to the side, their eyes grim and dark. Shyvana, the one the commoners called 'drake-kin', stood amongst them, a sign of solidarity from their new leader.\n\nDemacia had been plagued by dragons, their walls were crumbling, their crops in flames, and so it was that the commoners spat the drake-kin's name in dark corners, cursed her heritage, dogged her every move. Yet never to her face. \n\nThe half dragon&rsquo;s eyes turned on Vayne, gripping, isolating. The average person would quake under such a powerful gaze, but Vayne wasn&rsquo;t your average person, and her bolts were screaming for blood. \n\nShe took aim, readied her crossbow, and waited.\n\n----- V ----- \n\nWhere there were people in trouble, there was Braum. Not usually one for such heavy armour, the possibility of dragon-fire on today's forecast called for something more than pants and an exposed chest. He had obtained his new kit from one unlucky dragon that thought he could snack on the local livestock. A standard affair, but instead of tasty goat flesh, its mouth met Braum – more specifically, Braum&rsquo;s hefty magic shield. This, thought Braum, was the last thing the dragon ever had the privilege of meeting. Haha! m-EATing!\n\n&ldquo;What are you laughing about now?&rdquo; Pantheon grumbled, his temper flaring. Braum went to explain the joke, but quickly realised his companion may not be in the mood for such incredible humour. Instead he focused on the task at hand. \n\n&ldquo;So was Braum right? Or was Braum right?&rdquo; the big man said, flashing his best Freljord smile.\n\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Pantheon grumbled. He was used to people being intimidated by his presence, but this giant Freljordian seemed at ease beside the warrior, and it irritated him to no end. What&rsquo;s more, if Braum was right, then the northerner would be dwarfed by what was to come. This time it was Pantheon&rsquo;s turn to let out a short laugh.\n\n&ldquo;Grab your puny shield, it&rsquo;s climbing time!&rdquo; yelled Braum jovially, slinging the door-like shield he carried over his shoulder as he began to climb the stone guardian in front of them. Pantheon smirked, an action hidden by the shadow of his helm. \n\n&ldquo;See you at the top&rdquo; he said, leaping into the air and soaring into the skies.\n\nBut Braum didn&rsquo;t hear him, instead distracted by the sudden roar of a dragon that cut the air like flame through ice. Braum, quickened his ascent. The sound didn&rsquo;t come from the far mountains as expected, it came from inside the city walls. Were they too late?\n\n----- V ----- \n\nJarvan IV&rsquo;s speech was cut short as the roar filled the courtyard. Xin Zhao grabbed his spear and jumped onto the railing of the balcony. It had begun.\n\nHis eyes scanned the courtyard below, taking in the scene. The half-breed had transformed, her red, scaly body thrashing amid a sea of purple drakelings. Fire erupted overhead as people fell over each other, trying to escape the chaos. All through the courtyard, purple, snake-like drakelings screamed into life, their newly formed eyes focusing on the red dragon, burrowing towards her through the hard, stone ground.\n\nXin Zhao collected himself, picked his target, and leapt from the balcony.\n\n----- V ----- \n\nShyvana never failed to impress. Her sudden transformation had caused panic in the courtyard, scattering Demacians left right and centre, all while drawing the ire of the purple demons that filled Vayne&rsquo;s vision. \n\nThe Night Hunter went to work, every one of her bolts meeting their target right between the eyes. It was as her draconic friend had said it would be. With Shyvana as a decoy, Vayne was able to isolate each new threat as it reared its ugly head. Yet, with every drakeling slain, a new one would rear its ugly maw. \n\nShe dodged through the crowd, bolts flying and eyes searching. This was the Sorceress&rsquo; work, which meant she had to be close. \n\nThere. \n\nPurple drakelings twisted from her outstretched arms, her glowing eyes aflame with delight at the havoc she&rsquo;d caused. The Dragon Sorceress had come.\n\nThe beasts were all over Shyvana now, her size proving a hindrance as the smaller snake-like drakes tangled around her like vines reclaiming a forest. Shyvana roared in fury, thrashing about. \n\nAnd then she saw him.\n\n----- V ----- \n\nXin Zhao came crashing down on the Dragon Sorceress. His spear leading the charge towards his target&rsquo;s throat. Yet her drakelings were too quick, coiling around the Sorceress&rsquo; neck to shield the would-be death blow. He pivoted mid-air, leaning in with his shoulder, using his momentum to knock the Sorceress to the ground despite the failed strike. \n\nHe rolled to his feet, and shaking the lifeless drakelings from the end of his spear, he brought the blunt end of his weapon down on her face; his effort rewarded with a nasty cracking sound. This was it, he could end this. In one fluid motion he spun the shaft around, driving the sharp blade towards the source of the draconic terror that plagued his home.\n\nToo slow. \n\nThe floor erupted with slithering purple tendrils. It was as if the ground was alive with drakeling appendages. Tails, claws and maws surged towards him, grabbing his arms, biting his heels, wrapping themselves around his torso. But Xin Zhao was undeterred. The purple terrors had similarly wrapped themselves around their master, shielding her, but there was an opening, and he took it. \n\nHis spear bit deep into her shoulder, causing the Dragon Sorceress to wail with the cry of a hundred drakelings. She spread her wings and took to the skies, screaming in fury as she flew from the scene, drakelings in tow; a sea of purple fleeing from the courtyard like the abating tide.\n\nHe had made her bleed, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. The horizon erupted in flames, and the roar of Demacia&rsquo;s scaled foes could be heard from the distant mountains. They would soon be upon them. The Dragon Sorceress&rsquo; attack had failed, but the battle was far from over.\n\nAnd then something unexpected happened.\n\nA new roar sounded, one to drown out all other voices that filled the red skies. It was a sound Demacia had not heard for aeons; a bellow, a challenge. \n\nXin Zhao turned to his king, still watching from the balcony, and smiled. The old stone guardian, the colossus of Demacia, had awoken. \n\nThere was still hope.","replies":[{"poster":"BanditOfTickles","date":"2017-03-25T00:17:12.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick grammar mistake\nIn the piece in the paragraph, \"Shyvana never failed to impress.
