Listen!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaNJzox-QNA)\n\nAlex &quot;The Hanshmear&quot; Saccardo&#039;s the name, I&#039;ve been with Riot for about half a year, playing with grammar and working on mid lane. My jam is words, so I&#039;m in charge of the content that goes through the client and [oce.leagueoflegends.com](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/), oh, and some of the content you&#039;ll find on [oce.lolesports.com](http://oce.lolesports.com/) too.\n\nI&#039;m a sucker for story—[Ocean Week](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/oceanweek-2017/recap) and [Skins Story Slam](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/GWZ8anEO-skins-story-slam-fanfiction-contest) probably give this away—a love that spans all mediums: novels, comics, films, books, games, music; if there&#039;s a storytelling aspect, [I&#039;M INTO IT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMicOuO_Azw)!\n\nBefore Riot I lived a freelance life: a hectic mix of everything and anything online and print based. The best times were writing think pieces about the state of gaming, the worst times were reviewing mediocre games that just. kept. going. \n\nMy favourite games are legion, but a few notables are Chrono Trigger (I revisit the soundtrack daily \\m/), Last of Us, Dark Souls, Terranigma, Journey, Left 4 Dead 2, FTL, League &amp; Fire Emblem. There are always more, but recently I&#039;ve had a rad time with Horizon Zero Dawn, Hyper Light Drifter and Firewatch. \n\nI also like playing guitar, camping, coffee (I&#039;m from Melbourne, it&#039;s built into MY SOUL!), dogs AND cats, and one time I jumped so high I high-fived the moon*.\n\nI&#039;m rambling.

The very VERY basic idea is that a real player finds himself able to communicate and talk with A.I. ( bots ) and decides to try and make videos for MyView ( noname youtube ). What starts as a pretty slapstick machinima comedy between a player, and some very basic bots, ends up becoming rather complex and sinister.\n\nI also have a movie script that I've rewritten a few times now, and while I don't think I'll ever be in a position where I can pitch a movie idea, I know that it'd be a damn decent movie.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Thunrocker","date":"2017-05-05T05:44:24.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are the main things you change with the OCE page compared to the other regions?","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2017-05-05T06:04:12.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of League-based content that comes from devs and content creators for all regions is quite large at the moment.

Across all media/business there's so much replication. It sucks when someone is doing something unique and another person comes to cash in on it, but at the same time it keeps things competitive and, more importantly, moving forward. If first person shooters stopped at Wolfenstein, then we'd never have Doom. If they then stopped at Doom, we'd never have Half Life, or Halo or Borderlands etc. The theory here is, if you're doing something excellent, then players will keep helping you do that excellent thing. The best thing that you can do is ensure that you're delivering the best product you possibly can for people who actually want it. \n\nWhat I love about League is that it's constantly evolving. The game is insanely different to what it was in 2009, and that's largely due to such a passionate community that's so vocal around what they like, what they don't like and how to improve it. A blatant League copy isn't a reason to get angry/scared, it's a challenge, and a good reason to avoid complacency. \n\nA day may come where a League clone eats us alive and if it does, so be it. If that game is able to give players more than we can, it means we've failed, so all the best to them.

At its core, League is a team game, so it makes sense that the team element plays a large role in the outcome of each game. For context—ranked climbing is definitely not my speciality as I'm livin' in Bonze at the moment—but with that said, here's my two cents. Playing with strangers can be hard sometimes, but it can also be amazingly rewarding too. If you're finding that teammates are dropping the ball on occasion and hindering you from getting you where you need to go, have you tried pulling a posse together of players you trust to head in on ranked? Given the nature of the beast, it's important to recognise that League will always be about 5 members, not 1, and the more you're aware of this, the more you can do to make that work in your favour.
