But with both those prerequisites met then that shouldn't matter and this could in fact be a bug.

TBH it doesn't sound great at all. As this was a test there was a possibility of a few things not quite clicking and unfortunately that happened to you and your crew – which really sucks.

This way we can get to the bottom of this! it's in C: > Riot Games > Logs and then if you could send us the ones around the time you left scouting phase and missed champ select.
