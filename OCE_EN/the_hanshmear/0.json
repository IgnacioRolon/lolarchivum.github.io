It&#039;s time to vote!\n \nAs per the [community goal announcement](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/community-events/ocean-week-community-goal), we have two tasmanian devils that need naming. We&#039;ve put together the top 10 names (a maximum of two per Summoner) suggested and upvoted by you &mdash; now it&rsquo;s time to choose the **one name** that you love the most.\n \nEach name on the list has been given a gender: M for Male, F for Female and N for Neutral. As we&#039;re unsure of the gender of our first two critters at this time, the winning names will be chosen based on the highest votes that correspond to the the actual gender of each tasmanian devil. \n \nThe only exception here are that names labelled with a &ldquo;Neutral&rdquo; class are essentially genderless, which means they can be chosen for either gender.\n \nFor example:\n \n**Two female tasmanian devils:** we will choose the two highest female or gender neutral names.\n**Two male tasmanian devils:** we will choose the two highest male or gender neutral names.\n**One male and one female:** the highest male or gender neutral name will be chose for the male, and the highest female or gender neutral name will be chosen for the female.\n \nVoting is open from now until Monday, July 3, 23:59 AEST.\n \nREMINDER: You can only vote for ONE NAME &mdash; so make it count!","replies":[{"poster":"Sleksin","date":"2017-06-30T15:56:09.371+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see it now, Bazza and Mechwolf the Destroyer.
