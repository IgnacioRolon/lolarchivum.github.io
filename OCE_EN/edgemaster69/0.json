Even at the time of their death? I was unable to tell if Star Guardian Soraka used her Q or E. The night sky outside my window scares me because I am unable to tell the difference between the stars and her Q and E eVEN THE SUN ScARES ME BECAUSE OF HER. If anyone out there can help me and Dalek, still dont know if they died or if they got q or e&#039;d it is a real problem that needs to be fixed honestly, please do so I have brought about 200 bananas because they were cheap and I don&#039;t know if I am going to be auto attacked stop her please ok I dont want to be stunned/slowed or you could tell me what the difference is. Also if any riot staff could tell me that Dalek is okay I am genuinely worried for them right now, soraka is a real devil when it comes to these things","replies":[{"poster":"Kill the adc","date":"2017-11-03T23:03:01.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I perma ban soraka in gold and plat elo due to how much of a struggle my team always has against her.","replies":[{"poster":"EdgeMaster69","date":"2017-11-04T04:01:11.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo thanks man anything to help stop star guardian soraka is much appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-04T04:22:02.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like you need someone who specialises in dealing with such being. Luckily, I am one such person. For a \"modest\" fee, I can handle the situation for you. My only condition is that you not ask what happens to Soraka afterwards, as it would surely be so disgusting to hear that you would surely be driven insane.","replies":[]}]}
