I&#039;d like to start this post off by saying. I&#039;m not an angel. I have my off days while on the rift and sometimes my language gets a bit out of control. But the player I encountered today during a ranked game in my 6th provisional was insane. \r\n\r\nThe story starts in the pregame screen when champions were being banned and roles being called. Being second pick i politely asked be top which by my whole team was met with positivity and well being. Everything was going smoothly and all the rolls were filled while respect was being maintained. \r\n\r\nBut then I noticed something. A summoner going by the name of Frogdor hasn&#039;t said a word and was last pick. When it was his turn to pick a champion he choose Azir support and took ignite. Now at first our team was a bit shocked and taken back so we questioned his motives and where met with the statement:\r\n\r\n&gt; You pick your champions, I pick mine\r\n\r\n**So we got in game**\r\nAfter spawning onto the rift our _whole_ team agreed that support Azir could work and that we wouldn&#039;t let it get us down. \r\n\r\n**3 minutes in and azir decideds to speak his second sentence**\r\n&gt; God this adc cant cs for s**t\r\n&gt; Can you please poke, your&#039;e so bad\r\n\r\nSo I responded\r\n&gt; Dude calm down, first blood hasn&#039;t been drawn and we are doing fine.\r\n\r\nwhich was responded with\r\n&gt; Shut the f**k up kid gnar\r\n\r\nThis general toxicity continued throughout the game. Now i&#039;m not complaining about the general score. our team could have done better to prevent loosing; but the 1/9 azir support who was intentionally feeding and telling us all we were inbreed f**ks didn&#039;t help one little bit.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I&#039;ve logged into the forums to post anything because I&#039;ve never needed to. \r\n**But god please riot do something about this toxic summoner**\r\n\r\nThe only screenshot I got is attached","replies":[{"poster":"GrimNocturne","date":"2015-09-17T06:42:09.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wont do sht mang... make a smurf get lvl 30 and watch yourself troll people to b5 and not get banned mate.. legit. you might get a 24 hour ban or and 5 sentence per game but who really cares... trolls are gunna do it all day long,,, until they start with the perm banning... get fucked","replies":[]}]}
