However, if you place your cursor in a friend&#039;s chat before you start the queue, you can continue to type to them until you click off it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the fact that LPQ punishes you by having to wait 20 minutes and also not being able to reply to people who send you a message while you are in queue is a bit strange. It is also weird that the timer is a pop-up window where if you close it it restarts, this is not continuous with any other queue timer.\r\n\r\nIf the punishment of not being able to type is intentional then being able to if you queue up in a specific way is an error.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWim &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-09T02:51:20.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get the phone app. You can talk to them via the app while you're in LPQ.","replies":[]}]}
