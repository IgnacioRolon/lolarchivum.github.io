Same question, leave buster is doing more than it should have.\n\nThe leave buster was originally designed to act as a penalty to try and improve certain player's actions that will \"negatively influence other players' game experience\", and Im pretty sure somewhere in the leavebuster's FAQ wrote that they \"understand that sometimes emergency and accidents happen\" and that they do \"give us chances before penalising\" but now I have noticed that  the leave buster is stricter than EVER, and IT DOES NOT GIVE ANY CHANCES FOR EMERGENCY/ACCIDENTS, HOW DOES PENALISING PEOPLE FOR EMERGENCY AND/OR ACCIDENTS HELP TO IMPROVE THEIR ACTIONS THAT WILL NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE OTHER PEOPLE?\n\n@riot please notice this and try to make a change \n\n\n\n\n{{item:3070}} I cri everi tim","replies":[]},{"poster":"fiii","date":"2015-07-22T03:39:10.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LIke even now, I try to play a game. 20 mins wait time.\n\n\"Abandoning a match or being AFK\" etc etc etc..
