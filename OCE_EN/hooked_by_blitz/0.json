If you follow the motto \"Don't be a Jerk\", you'll pretty much never have any trouble.\n2. Hate speech or suicide encouragement (e.g racism, sexism, \"kys\" etc) are classed as no tolerance language and are an instant 14-day suspension (skipping chat restriction tiers) or perma if you have already received 14-day.\n3.
