To have summoner spells unlock at different levels depending on what experience setting you pick when creating an account e.g. New Player would have the current unlocking levels whereas picking Veteran would have skills unlocked earlier. \r\n\r\nRational: As a jungle main I don&#039;t like having to wait till level 10 to unlock smite. Whilst I understand that Riot may not want new players to jungle at low levels I believe that first selection you make when making an account in terms of your player experience should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nIn addition I think the match making system at lower levels could be filtered through that initial selection also e.g. Veteran selection matched with Veteran selection and New Players matched with New Players. Thus allowing for some degree of fairness at low levels and lowering the smurf domination that can occur at low levels.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n{{champion:76}} EuVee","replies":[{"poster":"Tekken Lord","date":"2015-09-05T03:15:55.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not too sure about this man, I don't think Riot supports smurfing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"EuVee","date":"2015-09-09T22:47:40.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it was a Rioter who said to post this on the Boards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-04T02:22:20.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they can rationalise not caring about new player stuff by saying experienced players shouldnt have more than one account, or whatever they say","replies":[]}]}
