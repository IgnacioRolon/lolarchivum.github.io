After I press launch it just goes to a black screen and  I can&#039;t even close the window from the screen. I&#039;ve tried reinstalling Adobe Air but that doesn&#039;t seem to do anything. I&#039;ve also looked at [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/F9rYkXET-help-me-fix-this-issue-lol-patcher-client3) and some other threads but I don&#039;t have AVG installed. Every time the issue occurs I usually just repair my client, but how am I going to have to do that for? I don&#039;t know how many other people have this problem, but as you can imagine it can get pretty frustrating when you&#039;re forced to repair your client every couple of days, and lose all your item sets in the process.  I&#039;m wondering whether the problem is on my end or Riot&#039;s end? What are some other things I can try?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-29T04:46:59.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You on Mac, yeah?\n\nRiot have already had a shot at fixing this issue. They believe they fixed it.

I think I might make a support ticket the next time it happens though.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-30T07:42:44.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, lol. It just so happened that a lot of people on Mac were getting this exact same problem so yeah :P\n\nHas it started working properly for you? What did you do to fix it?\n\nIf it happens again, you can try the following:\n1. Go to Internet Options (from your Control Panel, though you can also access it from Internet Explorer itself).\n2. Reset all possible settings to their default.\n3. Go to the \"Security\" tab and put it on \"Medium-Low\" level.\n4.

If it's not above 96db then it won't work.\n\nAlso, try this:\nCreate a new, empty file in the latest version folder (default path: \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.###\" (where ### is the highest number) named \"S_OK\", with no extension.
