Unless you say some really awful stuff you won’t be perma banned straight away you get chat restricted then you get suspended and finally you get perma banned. And that’s only if you keep getting reported consistently so you aren’t learning from your previous warning, so in generally most perma bans are deserved anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-09T01:00:01.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I really don’t get why people complain when they get perma banned.\n\nIt's because a lot of people have a severe inability to take responsibility for their own actions. They use their lack of self control to excuse any negative behaviour, they take the easy road of finding anyone (and anything) other than themselves to place blame on, so they don't have to go to the effort of actually controlling themselves and preventing the issue in the first place.\n\nTypically, they're nothing more than brats.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-04-09T12:06:40.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-09T12:30:52.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Its called cause and effect.\n\nTrue, but the bottom line is that people are (or, rather, should be) in control of their actions (being the \"effect\" in this case). If someone can't do that, it's called a lack of self control, which is an issue *they themselves* need to address.\n\nAny decent, self-respecting parent would be teaching their children self-control, and any decent, self-respecting adult would be teaching themselves self control (if they lack it). I'm not saying it's easy, but that my point. People only try to avert the blame because it's \"easy\", they don't want to do the \"hard-but-right\" thing and actually take their life into their own control. When push comes to shove, they'd all rather just get by on \"but I lost control\".\n\nYou can call me whatever you want, but that wont change the fact that anyone who doesn't even try to do the right thing, even when it's hard, is nothing more than a \"brat\" to me. I don't see any reason to treat them as an adult if they're using childish excuses. Not to mention, using the argument that \"well, most people do it\" just seems to indicate to me that you have no real debatable points and are just grabbing at whatever you can.\n\nAnd just FYI, I've never taken pills to \"adjust\" my behaviour, it all comes down to that concept of \"self control\" I was just talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-04-09T12:54:13.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your so called self-control, is who you are. But most are not you, cant become you if they are not born that way. \n\nIf you know how Neurocognitive work, you will understand that it is impossible to alter personality. People can mask who they are, but can never change it. \n\nYou keep saying everyone can if they try, however its too hard so they dont, but NO. It is an inborn thing. \n\nWhat is the right thing to you when you are being insulted? Ok, you might say it fine and move on. That is YOUR PERSONALITY, you're are an pacifist. Your type are fews, like vegetarian or vegan.\n\nYou're pretty much exactly as i said, you live in an ideal world and you want others to practice your good example. Too bad the world itself is not so simple. Not everyone can smile in the face of insults. They will retort back unkindly one way or another.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-10T02:52:12.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, I used to be a terrible person. I use to react in much the same way as the people you are describing. I used to assault teachers and classmates, throw tables and chairs clear across the classroom.\n\nBut you know what? I ***CHANGED***.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I did it. I changed my attitude and personality. I've seen others go through a similar process. Don't try and tell me it's impossible, because I know *for a fact* that it is.\n\nWhat you are talking about is \"nature vs nurture\", and when it comes down to it, people *do* have the opportunity to change what is affected by nurture. You can't change you're *instinct*, that's not in question, but *personality* is a whole different thing. It's shaped by your experiences and choices, and is changing *all the time* (though usually very little).\n\nJust so we're clear, I don't *expect* people to do the right thing. I know what people are like, and I understand the world will more than likely never be entirely positive. But that doesn't excuse toxic behaviour. It doesn't make any of their excuses valid. There is no reason to act as if it does.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-09T11:43:22.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So true.\n\nThe worst one is: they were toxic and I was toxic, and I got punished.
