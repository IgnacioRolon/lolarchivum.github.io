He's fairly straight forward but can have a weak late game.\n\n+ {{champion:102}} **Shyvanna** is the one I'd recommend. You'll out farm every other jungler except maybe {{champion:77}} **Udyr**. Her ganks mid lane are bad, but top and bot ganks can work with practice. Although she is best at counter ganking other junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-02-12T22:31:13.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is your name green?\nCause red is a rioter unless they changed it from red to green but I don't think they did.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-12T23:34:57.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm part of the new board volunteers program that **Riot Maraudaur** has set up. \n\nEssentially we're just here to answer small questions that **Riot** may not have the time for, but we do have some connections to Riot for advise on tougher queries. \n\nYou can learn more about this [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Edu7E6Bp-introducing-the-emissaries).","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-13T03:58:54.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are errand boys/girls/whatevers who bring maraudaur milk and cookies when he goes to conferences.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-13T04:00:44.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is orange green and purple or something i think, green works for player behaviour boards.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-12T17:26:57.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gragas and Rammus are the main good 3150 IP junglers.\n\nShaco/pantheon are the only ones i would suggest off your list.\n\nNidalee is trash tier, and honestly has been for months.\n\nShyvana is a farm jungler, and really is being a threat too late into the game to mean anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-12T19:17:59.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee trash tier.. hmmm...
