It is damn tough for me to play with these high pings! Can anyone tell me how can I reduce these high pings? Is there a website for this or is it something only Riot can do? Due to this, I usually disconnect from the game automatically without me even hitting the close button! Then, I&#039;m marked** AFK and LeaveBuster**! Can anyone _plz_ answer the questions?","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-12T10:49:34.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just spike 6k :```)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-12T08:16:01.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some programs that say they help reduce ping.
