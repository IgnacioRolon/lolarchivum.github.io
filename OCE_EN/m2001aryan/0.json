He is great for shutting down a fed adc, and he delivers a suprising amount of damage. During a team fight, a good tactic is to roll towards the enemy adc and taunt them, if you have an assasin mid lane they can then jump on the adc and blow them up. Just a quick tip, you can activate Rammus w, mid q. This isn't helpful much, but can come in handy occasionally. If you are having a hard time clearing with him, try kiting the jungle monsters and stock up on pots. I'd be happy to teach you how to kite in a custom game sometime.

One final thing, can you show me your runes and masteries while playing as Rammus... I can clear easily without losing a lot of health but my clear speed is kinda slow... So just wanted to cross-check with your runes and masteries. I will send you some links as for my runes and  masteries.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/49e1c6c36d1881058caf203f249114b3.png\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/c2a23a390034f0ded02ba8dc86b9f833.png","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-24T09:16:45.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\nI'd be happy to play some games with you, and show you some tis and tricks, do you have Skype or TeamSpeak etc. So I can go over runes and masteris then?
