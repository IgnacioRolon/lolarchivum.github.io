It literally says you don&#039;t want to win the game, which breaks Riot&#039;s rules in Ranked.\r\n\r\nSo far the only argument I can find is if the teammate is trolling.

No!\r\n\r\nI reckon this should be a reportable offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-27T03:23:53.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they're banning it because it's a contested pick like Katarina and you're last pick then they aren't doing anything wrong (though it is polite to at least acknowledge your pick).

If you're down the bottom and one of the last ones to pick you better believe people will ban you're champ if they are a heavily contested one. Or also if no one is willing to pick it for you.

To put it simply: correlation ≠ causation. There are several reasons to ban any given champ, even those that a team mate might have as their pick intent. One example is as Roguestoney said, any champ that is heavily contested is likely to be banned if the first/second pick on the team isn't willing to select them, whether for themselves or a team mate, in order to prevent the opposing team from getting them. Another possibility is that the person banning the champ is going with a strategy/pick that they significantly struggle with against that particular champ, and so they ban the champ to give themselves a better chance of doing well, or they might see an ally with a pick that would struggle against the champ and just ban it to give their team mate a better chance of doing well.\n\nFact is, there are many reasons to ban any given champ, regardless if someone has them as a pick intent, that all fall within the category of \"trying to win\". Just because you don't like it when it happens to you doesn't mean it's suddenly going to be against the rules, players are free to ban any champ they want to.","replies":[]}]}
