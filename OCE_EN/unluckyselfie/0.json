Instead of 1 or 2 losses, or something similar, it normally takes *many* consecutive losses, since you only really get demoted if your MMR drops to around a Tier below your rank. You can see how this happens with those boosted to Diamond V. They will have the rank, but still appear in low-mid Plat games.\n\nSo unless you're being matched with Gold IVs and Gold Vs, you shouldn't worry about dropping out of Plat. Another good indicator (though not 100% reliable) is OP.GG under Solo MMR. If that says something almost a Tier below your actual rank, then you should worry.\n\nAlso, when you're about to demote a Tier, when you look on your Profile, there will be an exclamation mark over your rank symbol.\n\nIf you're *so* worried, don't play Ranked until after the season has ended. It's only a week away, so you won't decay from inactivity.\n\nHope this helps :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-03T23:46:49.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if you keep demoting and promoting plat 5 and your MMR ends up low, you can demote with 1 loss at 0LP.\n\nI have a STRONG feeling that I once demoted without having even been at 0 LP, but I never confirmed it.\n\n{{sticker:sg-zephyr}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlueFishRed","date":"2018-11-20T04:40:38.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UnluckySELFIE,realm=EUNE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xH6EkATt,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-11-03T15:50:28.034+0000)\n>\n> I&amp;#039;ve reached plat 5.
