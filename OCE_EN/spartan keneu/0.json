I do not believe so. \r\nThere must be server issues or maybe riot or the players famous for the game or even ranked players with to much time on their hands that decide to bug peoples games and make them lag, I have had several people I know personally to have perfect internet to lag on league and get in trouble for disconnecting, I feel as if the little guys is getting shit on because they do not make riot a lot of money. \r\nRegards one of those little guys","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-23T02:46:51.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nLag can be caused by a ton of different factors, some of them in your control and some of them not.  We constantly monitor our servers and their internet connections to make sure they are healthy, and try and ensure the best experience possible for all.  That's not saying its always perfect, but we're not currently aware of any large-scale issues with the LoL servers that would match what you have described.\n\nThere are many possibilities to troubleshoot to see if you can find the source of the issue, so here are a few questions that might help get started - \n\nOn the problems you are seeing:\n\n* When you say lag - do you mean higher than normal ping? choppy gameplay? client lock-ups? disconnections?\n* Has it always been like this, or did this start recently?\n* Do the issues happen all the time, or just certain times of day?\n* Do the issues happen to all players in the game at the same time, just some, or only you?\n\nOn your set-up:\n\n* What kind of internet connection do you have? eg. ADSL / Cable / Fibre\n* What ISP do you use & city are you in?\n* Do you connect your PC to your router using wireless or via a network cable?\n* Do you share internet with others in your house?\n* Try running & submitting the [network diagnostic tool](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs).  Check the trace route in the output for any issues.\n\n\nLet me know what you can\n\nCheers!\n-Mindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Spartan Keneu","date":"2015-02-25T10:37:48.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also being punished for bugsplat failures and other things out of our control, is rather irritating, leavebuster hounding us for these things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spartan Keneu","date":"2015-02-23T03:36:58.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for lag mean all of the above, my associates and I get very high ping, it can range between 500-2500.\nThis creates very unpleasant gameplay, attempts to reconnect during basic commands and full disconnections from league and the client all with our internet running perfectly. \nThis has been happening within a few months to us all. \nIt seems to be all of the time we play as we can only play at certain times. \nThe massive lag happens to at least 3 others in every game the issue is present. \n\nWe have various internet connections, personally I have ADSL2 \nAgain we all have different ISP, Personally mine is TPG\nWe all live in various cities from for example Townsville, Cairns, Melbourne, Brisbane, Toowoomba and Darwin\nWe all use PC, which we all connect directly via ethernet cable. \nYes we share Internet but that is the first thing we check, we go and ask the others if they are using it, generally they are not or only on sites that use very little internet eg. Facebook. \nWe have all run diagnostics on our computers and it provides us no problem we also repaired league of legends several times seeing if it was a faulty file. It was not.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-23T06:17:26.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"500 - 2500 is pretty out of the ordinary for sure.  Does it stay like that most of the time, or is it more of a temporary thing that lasts a moment or two when it happens?  What times of day do you usually play?\n\nAlso, in the games where you are affected, does it happen at the same moment for all 3 of you, or different times within the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Spartan Keneu","date":"2015-02-25T01:04:39.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally it is a prolonged exposure to the ping, there can be maybe 3 separate seconds in a game where it returns to normal.\nWe normally play from 10am-12am, where ever we can get a break within these times. \nIt happens to the three of us all at the same time all the same conditions.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2015-02-24T02:46:07.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had 50 stable ping, until a few days ago where the ping is now from 150 ping up to 300+.
