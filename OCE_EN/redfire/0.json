It occurs roughly every 1 in 3 lobbies and will last roughly 30 seconds to a minute where I can type in chat but everything else is frozen.  Sometimes it will catch up and there will be no issue but other times it will freeze and because of this I will not be able to select a champion/ban and result in a dodge.  This can be very frustrating and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas as to potential solutions or other summoners who have experienced this same problem? {{champion:34}}","replies":[{"poster":"JERRAM","date":"2016-02-21T22:09:17.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had the same problem i just repaired my client and it hasn't happened since then","replies":[]}]}
