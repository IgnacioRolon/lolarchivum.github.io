But everything else on the computer is fine. When we enter a game the problem disappears but it reappears when you get sent back to the game lobby. Another problem that has occurred is when you go into a ranked game no champion icons show up thus making you unable to pick or ban champions thus forcing you to dodge and Shaclone (youtuber) has had the same problem and made a video about it, I was in a duo when this occurred and I had to ask my friend if he could dodge because i was in my promos. These problems have vastly impacted my experience with the game lately and I dislike it because I really enjoy this game. My only request is if you can have a look at this problem and kindly inform me if it is a bug or if I will need to reinstall the game. Thank you.\nEDIT: (it also sometimes unexpectedly stops working)\n","replies":[]}
