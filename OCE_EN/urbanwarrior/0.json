I realize that your mastery does not need to be shown in the load screen because it could trigger unwanted camping of your lane but with the emote, you choose to display it and you can give off that extra little disrespect once you kill your opponent by showing them what you have worked so hard to get. At the moment I don&#039;t like that it can only be shown to your allies because they had already seen your mastery level in the loading screen so an extra reminder would be portrayed as a little cocky. Let me know about your opinions on this matter, i&#039;m curious.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-14T06:54:05.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh It's control 6, I was pressing all my keys as I have mastered Riven.
