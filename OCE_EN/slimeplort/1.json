Gave my account to a friend a while back so I decided to just start fresh again and I&#039;m in the middle of leveling up.\r\n\r\nJust looking for a club with discord that I can enjoy my time in. I&#039;m up for anything once I reach level 30. So if there&#039;s any chill clubs out there, let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Typhoid Mary","date":"2017-11-16T08:52:04.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate I am looking to expand the league community in my discord, more than happy for you to join at https://discord.gg/VPzyWYp","replies":[]}]}
