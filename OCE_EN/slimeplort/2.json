Just note, I play normals and I&#039;m not an amazing adc. It isn&#039;t that I can&#039;t &#039;outplay&#039; him. It&#039;s that anything I do against him is negligible. he just shrugs it off. As an adc, I can&#039;t damage him enough to do anything. I can easily beat the other four on the team, but I&#039;m useless against xin and my team can&#039;t even kite him enough to get him off me. It just feels so frustrating to play against him because I feel I can&#039;t do anything.\r\n\r\nThe usual build I run when I&#039;m facing xin is Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, Essence Reaver and a mix of QSS/Mortal Reminder (grievous wounds)/Black Cleaver\r\n\r\nWhen i try to run Mortal Reminder against him he still heals a ton through it, and my armor pen does next to nothing to penetrate his defenses so I&#039;m a  bit lost. I haven&#039;t tried Blade of the Ruined King because I&#039;m lazy with actives. Would this possibly give me enough damage to vs him? Is there any other item/strategy I can try?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-01T21:16:21.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much the only way to beat Xin as an ADC is to kite him...\nThe problem is: when they updated him they made him invulnerable unless you're in melee range, and gave him a long range slow. So you literally CANT kite him.\n\nGood old rito logic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-30T03:22:49.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use your dash (away) to counter his E, stay away from the third hit of his Q.\nBasically you need someone with CC to back you up.","replies":[{"poster":"SlimePlort","date":"2017-11-30T03:32:46.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not what I do, it's that my damage is so irrelevant even if I play well against him. I can probably tank around 30% of his health at most when I verse him, and then he just heals it all back up even through grievous wounds. He 1v5'd my entire team because of it last game (he and I were the only fed ones). As an adc, I should be able to do more against him but I just haven't been able to no matter what I've built.","replies":[]}]}]}
