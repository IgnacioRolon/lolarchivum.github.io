If Riot facilitated a more open and faster progression system that allowed players to acquire champions at a fast rate, with complete freedom of choice, they would find that not only will the community grow and be more supportive, but their net profit will be higher not lower.\n\nThis is because they lose out on a lot of potential customers because of their slow and painful progress system. New players simply can’t play the champions they want to, and so the game becomes stale fast. They also lose a lot of profit from cosmetics, because less champions means less available cosmetics for the player, so less purchases (champion purchases will never outscale cosmetic purchases, not even close).\n\nThe current progression system makes the game feel bad, confusing and downright frustrating. Players are more likely to make purchases when they feel happy playing. When you take that way, you lose far more than you’ll ever gain from it.\n\nCurrently Riot seems to be stuck on short-term goals that are having long-term damaging affects to both their brand and company, and coming back to the game it makes me sad to see it. They’re sucking the fun out of the game for new players, and there is no reason for it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone. I recently came back to LoL after I stopped playing for around 1.5 years (played since around the end of season 1/start of season 2). Had to start a new account because I don&#039;t have my old one anymore, so I&#039;ve been levelling up with the new blue essence system. Thought I&#039;d talk about what I&#039;ve experienced from it because of my perspective, as well as what I&#039;m seeing with the game now. I know a lot of people are complaining about the new system, but I thought I&#039;d try and point out the reasons the new system is flawed and actually a step backward, rather than forward, for players, as well as what this says about Riot&#039;s current direction. Frankly speaking, I don&#039;t understand why Riot is choosing this direction to take the game forward. They&#039;ve failed somewhere in their staff line-up if they seriously believe they&#039;re making a positive impact in the community or their profit margin from implementing this new blue essence system.\n\nTo briefly explain, the old system used an incremental progress that gave you the freedom to make your own choices at your own pace. it was limited, but it did what it set out to do well. However it was a system designed for a smaller champion pool, and as more champions were released it became harder and harder for new players to acquire the full playable character list without spending money.\n\nNow I have always agreed with the model of &#039;cosmetics cost, but gameplay doesn&#039;t&#039;. This model has been proven time and time again to be extremely successful as it facilitates a positive and loyal community while ensuring a consistent economy for the game (or other content). You can even look at Patreon content creators who offer free content as an example of this. Most people become patrons out of a desire to see their favourite content creators grow and expand, and they&#039;re extremely willing to do this. Because people love to see more of what they love, and when you give them the freedom to make their own choice most will choose to support what they love. People scoffed at this, they considered &#039;freedom of payment&#039; as a ridiculous idea. But those who dared to do it succeeded, and proved them wrong. If you produce quality content, you will inevitably draw an audience who is willing to support you. -Almost- without fail, as there are always odd cases in niche areas that get bad luck.\n\nNow back to LoL. The blue essence system was designed as an improvement and expansion on the original IP system that focused on small, incremental progress. However it achieved neither of those things. This is because they didn&#039;t address the fundamental problem in the old IP system - it was designed for a much smaller champion pool. We&#039;re at over 120 champions now, compared to the much smaller pool/s in the older days.\n\nBut the blue system doesn&#039;t make it easier to progress, it only makes it more confusing. Blue essence is as hard, possibly even harder, to acquire as IP. Shards provide the player with a false sense of choice. You give the player a choice with champion shards: do I sell the shards I don&#039;t like for more blue essence to buy the champion I like, or wait and save up my essence so i can get more champions later on (since shards give a discount). But it&#039;s not a choice at all, because the player acquiring all champions without spending money would take them many years. No-one&#039;s going to grind that hard, so you should just sell the shards you don&#039;t like. Because you won&#039;t use them. Ever.\n\nSkin Shards? It was a good idea, but it could really be improved on. The main problem is in the inability to spend orange essence freely like you can spend blue essence freely to acquire any champion. You should be able to do the same, spend orange essence freely to acquire any skin. if you really wanted to facilitate more chances and opportunities for free to play players, then you cannot limit and outright remove their choices when it comes to potential acquisitions. You opened up new possibilities for free to play players, and then said &#039;but good luck actually using it&#039;. Just...why?\n\nHextech chests and keys are absolutely worthless. For the amount of time it takes to acquire both a key and a chest, the loot you get from it is basically the same as the capsule you get from levelling. it doesn&#039;t feel better, it isn&#039;t better, and it&#039;s ridiculous that they put it in as a separate system. But I don&#039;t want to get into it, since that is something separate from what I want to talk about.\n\nThe essential problem with the blue essence system is that it doesn&#039;t make it easier to acquire champions, and this shouldn&#039;t be the case. a more confusing system, but not easier? That&#039;s a step backwards in my opinion. So this is going to be my main argument. **Champions no longer need to be hard to acquire, and there is no incentive for the company to do so**. They have two possible arguments for why. Profit margin and player retention through continuous progress.\n\nLet&#039;s look at profit margin. Riot may believe that facilitating a system where the player is more likely to spend money on acquiring champions will give them a higher net profit annually. I would argue that this is only the case if they look at the number of sales, and not the number of potential customers they lose. If they look at it statistically, it may show that 20% of their net profit comes from players purchasing champions. 20% is a lot of money in a company as big as Riot Games.\n\nHowever that is only if you don&#039;t consider two things. The first is the number of potential customers. The system of slowly acquiring champions is a huge turn off for new players, me included. i want to be able to play the champions I think are interesting, or I loved in the free to play champion rotation. But with the current system I feel so constricted because it is such a huge grind to acquire even one champion. So I have to make a choice. Which of these eight champions do I acquire? And then I have to grind again and again for the other 7, all the while spamming games with the single champion I enjoy. Quickly the game will become stale for me, and I will face a decision. Do I love this game enough to ignore this painful and soul-sucking progress? Most people will answer no. because you haven&#039;t given them enough time to love the game. Because you&#039;re killing them with your slow and demanding progress system. And so you are losing out on a lot of potential customers every year for this.\n\nAnd the second reason is really simple. Players with less champions are less likely to purchase cosmetics. It is simply mathematics. If a player has 10 champions with a possible 25 skins, maybe 8 of which the player likes then they have a chance to individually buy 8 skins. However if that same player, with the same amount of play time, has 45 champions with a possible 135 skins, maybe 46 of which the player likes then they have the chance to individually buy 46 skins. If we consider each skin costs $10 (not even including the expensive skins they&#039;re more likely to get) in this instance, that is the difference between $80 and $460.\n\nNow if that same player with only 10 champions buys 10 more (at $10 each), then that&#039;s $100 for the champions and another $80 for the possible skins. The difference is still huge, with that player spending $260 and the other player spending $460. It doesn&#039;t make sense how Riot is looking at this. They are thinking very backwards for a company that lives and dies in keeping up with the future.\n\nThe other argument is player retention. I&#039;m writing this part for argument&#039;s sake, because come on. No-one really believes this is a proper reason, not for the MOBA genre. So Riot may believe that players will become bored once they acquire all of the gameplay options (champion pool). Because they no longer have anything new, and new champions that come out are too slow to be a part of this progress system.\n\nHowever if we simply look at any old player who has their entire champion pool, they&#039;ll prove this argument wrong. Hell, just give all players with a full champion pool a poll to fill out, and they&#039;ll state &#039;when did acquiring champions become more interesting than playing them&#039;. Progress systems in MOBA&#039;s should really only be there to scale the player into the game at a comfortable rate, never as a long-term goal for player retention.\n\nIf they facilitated a more open and faster progression system that allowed players to acquire champions at a fast rate, with complete freedom of choice, they would find that not only will the community grow and be more supportive, but their net profit will be higher not lower.\n\nIt is simply about how a game feels. When a player feels like they&#039;re progressing, and they can freely choose champions to play (instead of spending tons of time grinding for a single champion), they fall in love with the game faster and are much more likely to become loyal to it. They&#039;re more likely to purchase cosmetics for the champions they own (because they have a lot of champions to buy cosmetics for!), because they feel **good**. They feel happy when they play. When you make a game feel good, you&#039;re already successful. Losing that is losing the essence of your game, and it will eventually cost you far more than you&#039;ll ever gain from the choice.\n\nBut what do you guys think? if you agree or disagree, let me know. I&#039;m not expecting Riot to respond to this, but facilitating player discussion is always a positive thing. Riot has to listen to the community if its voice is loud enough, or they have a management problem. Because currently Riot Games seems to be stuck on short-term goals that are having long-term damaging affects to both their brand and their company.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-29T08:32:07.916+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">They've failed somewhere in their staff line-up if they seriously believe they're making a positive impact in the community or their profit margin from implementing this new blue essence system.\n\nThe issue isn't Staff, it's Tencent.\n\n>Now I have always agreed with the model of 'cosmetics cost, but gameplay doesn't'.\n\nThe issue is, and this applies to alot of games recently, it has become Gameplay costs, Cosmetics costs more.\n\nThis isn't just league, hell overwatch is the one that really started the trend on this (having an opening price as well as lootboxes)\n\n>If you produce quality content, you will inevitably draw an audience who is willing to support you.\n\nThe funny thing is, that only Indie's seem to understand this within the game making side of the industry these days.\n\nRiot used to understand that, and probably still does, but Tencent doesn't, it's a bunch of Executives that don't give a shit for your values.\n\n>Skin Shards?

You opened up new possibilities for free to play players, and then said 'but good luck actually using it'. Just...why?\n\nThe issue with skin shards is more recent, since the BE change, it feels like Skin shards come out less often (anecdotal so potentially wrong, but either way that's how it FEELS) and the shards don't actually give enough essence any more for no apparent reason (read less then a 1/3 of their price in Orange Essence always means your worse off disenchanting them, because rerolling 3 of them makes more sense, even though it doesn't)\n\nAnd this is all recent with skin shards, it used to be that if you wanted to go for random skins, it was your choice, if you wanted a skin from a shard you got, it was your choice, now that just isn't the case.\n\n>Quickly the game will become stale for me, and I will face a decision.

Take Hearthstone for example. It's a great game, but if you want to be able to play a variety of decks you need to accept that you're going to spend a lot of money inside of it. It's a big money sink, and I had to stop playing for the most part because of it.\n\nYet Blizzard produces quality content, and they listen to their community and work with them for the most part. It's this strange conundrum where I want to hate them for the absurdly expensive business model, but the game is good enough that I can't bring myself to.\n\n> The issue isn't Staff, it's Tencent.\n\nI looked them up, their corporation buying shares into Riot Games was something I forgot about. It's a shame if they're really the reason for this major impact on Riot's direction. I believe a lot of external corporations buying in shares like the idea of running the company into the ground as they turn as high a profit in as little time as they can. Then they'll just jump ship and move onto the next company. But I don't know enough about the way these corporations run to say that soundly. Perhaps they really believe their practices are working. In that case, that's just really frustrating.\n\nI just honestly really don't want to see this game run to the ground, but I don't really see a way I can change that. It's like watching a friend you know slowly destroy himself and you can't help him, but you really want to. And you just watch as he slowly falls further and further into the abyss until one day you find him sitting there in his place, soulless and empty having given up on it all. And you know that the friend you knew isn't there any longer, and you have to leave no matter how hard it is. You have to get out.\n\nWell that metaphor was dark, but I feel like that's what I'm watching with Riot Games at the moment. It's sad for me, like a piece of nostalgia I may have to inevitably cut off.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-30T09:22:50.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they dont just own shares. its 100% fully owned by tencent. riot games has ceased to exist realistically. it only exists as an image. they could change the name to 'tencent games' if they wanted. the game literally only exists as a cash cow and to turn as high a profit as possible. they will reduce costs to the point they reduce quality (already happening) if they must. they have a legal obligation to the shareholders of tencent and those shareholders want increasing quarterly or yearly profits.\n\ni think something people fail to realise is that this game is global. it's not just out in the west. their biggest player base is china, and unfortunately in china they seem to LOVE this kind of business model. in china, the grind. the gambling and the pricing for LoL is way worse than here. being a chinese company, they will always focus on that base and model everything here in the west from the chinese version albeit it may be a \"throttled\" or \"mild\" version.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-30T03:34:38.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made as many posts on this topic as most (but not as much as some, Jason looking your way ;) ).\n\nI could try and add to the discussion, but I'd only be repeating myself.\n\nVote with your wallet, if you are unhappy with the current state of LoL, don't buy or spend any RP.\n\nIf they see a loss rather than profit from the changes, they will re-evaluate the system.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-30T05:57:15.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">but not as much as some, Jason looking your way ;)\n\nheyyyyy Essembie is doing just as much as me, why call me out XD","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-01T08:07:32.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ELsvprxj,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-11-30T05:57:15.500+0000)\n>\n> heyyyyy Essembie is doing just as much as me, why call me out XD\n\nIt's  not judgement, it's recognition.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-30T09:51:25.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ELsvprxj,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-11-30T05:57:15.500+0000)\n>\n> heyyyyy Essembie is doing just as much as me, why call me out XD\n\nThat's just the way it is baby.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-30T09:52:14.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ELsvprxj,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-30T03:34:38.299+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve made as many posts on this topic as most (but not as much as some, Jason looking your way ;) ).\n> \n> I could try and add to the discussion, but I&#x27;d only be repeating myself.\n> \n> Vote with your wallet, if you are unhappy with the current state of LoL, don&#x27;t buy or spend any RP.\n> \n> If they see a loss rather than profit from the changes, they will re-evaluate the system.\n\nFair comment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-05T00:18:52.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dear OP.
