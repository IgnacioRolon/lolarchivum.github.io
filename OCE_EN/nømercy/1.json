Upon reaching S1 there happens to be very high increase in the level of stupidity and uncoordination between team members. They would constantly feed their lanes upon return to lane every single match. Yeah strange how S1 is worse and much harder to get out since it feels like your playing with a team of B5&#039;s. It&#039;s Silver 1, shouldn&#039;t it be slightly better than the previous divisions and expected to have players a bit more skillful.... but no it&#039;s the opposite - somehow.. I feel as though Silver 1 is somehow the new Bronze 5 which is weird like I said. Any reasons why this is so..... and I lost 10 games and won 1 over the duration of 2 days... rip - my Mmr dropped so hard.... Of course climbing the ladder is hard, but not in the way you get ppl who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing and making really dumb decisions. Cmon ppl as you get a rank higher than before you&#039;re expected to perform to the standards and not bloody feed or die idiotically. Overall S5 to S2 was fun I suppose, pretty fair matches with everyone performing well and pulling their weight. S1 hmmm how does that division become Bronze 5. Its just literally an mmr drainer and drags to down.... way dddddooooowwwwnnn to playing with mindless players. Let me hear your thought and if you&#039;ve experienced a similar thing. Or if silver is just downright cancerous to play in. And yeah since being in Silver I or lower I had a team full of golds or even plats. Jeez, they're terrible as if bronze..","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-04-15T21:08:28.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well there is a big difference between Bronze-Silver-Gold-Plat if not then these rank system till plat would not exist, and in saying so sometimes its just bad games, secondly sometimes your gold 5 player might b v/s G1 or plat 5 (skill difference) or even vs lower rank doesn't matter he can still lose bcoz of his own miss plays, so that's how he/she lose lanes which makes them TILT and lose games.\n\n\nsometimes i lose lane to Silver players lmao and i am G2 well was, just got demoted to G3 lmao but it happens, sometimes you are overconfident and lose lane or miss plays, so learn and climb that's how i climb :)\n\n\n\n\nand if you see an unranked player and you notice he is feeding, it means he is new in rank and not aware of rank games, so please tell him in a sweet way that practice more in normal's than flaming that person :( i see so many players dont want to even play normal games nowadays bcoz of this OCE community is so toxic :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qilli","date":"2017-04-15T12:06:06.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unranked ppl start around that mmr i think :^)","replies":[]}]}
