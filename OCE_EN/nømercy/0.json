This cooldown is reduced by 1 second whenever Lissandra impairs an enemy&#039;s movement with an ability (does not apply to movement-impairing effects from items).  **NEW** passive: Frostbite: Lissandra&#039;s skills apply a stack of &quot;Frost&quot; upon hitting an enemy champion for about a few seconds(stays for 5seconds - maybe). Upon applying 3 stacks of &quot;frost&quot; to an enemy champ, their (&quot;Frostbite&quot; takes effect) HP regen and mana regen will freeze (+0hp regen,+0mana regen) for 3seconds and take 80/110/140 true magic dmg (+35% ability power) over time. While also being slowed by 25%/27%/29% for the first 1.5seconds then the last 1.5secs they aren&#039;t slowed but still the final amount of dmg.\r\n\r\nIce Shard\r\nCost: 85 Mana \r\nRange: 725 \r\nThrows a spear of ice that shatters when it hits an enemy, dealing magic damage and slowing Movement Speed. Shards pass through the target, dealing the same damage to other enemies hit. \r\nThrows a spear of ice that shatters when it hits an enemy, dealing 70/100/130/160/190 (+65% Ability Power) magic damage and slowing Movement Speed by 16/19/22/25/28% for 1.5 seconds. Shards then pass through the target, dealing the same damage to other enemies hit. Nothing I would change.\r\n\r\n\r\nRing of Frost\r\nCost: 50 Mana \r\nRange: 450 \r\nFreezes nearby enemies in ice, dealing magic damage and rooting them. \r\nDeals 70/110/150/190/230 (+40% Ability Power) magic damage to nearby enemies and roots them for 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds. Nothing I would change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacial Path\r\nCost: 80/85/90/95/100 Mana \r\nRange: 1050 \r\nLissandra creates an ice claw that deals magic damage. Reactivating this ability transports Lissandra to the claw&#039;s current location. \r\nCasts an ice claw that deals 70/115/160/205/250 (+60% Ability Power) magic damage to all enemies hit. Reactivating this ability transports Lissandra to the claw&#039;s current location.  **NEW**: Maybe freeze enemies + champ in its path for 1 second upon being hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrozen Tomb\r\nCost: 100 Mana \r\nRange: 550 \r\nIf cast on an enemy champion, the target is frozen solid, stunning it. If cast on Lissandra, she encases herself in dark ice, becoming untargetable and invulnerable. Dark ice then emanates from the target dealing magic damage to enemies and slowing Movement Speed. \r\nOn Enemy Cast: Freezes target champion solid, stunning it for 1.5 seconds.\r\nOn Self Cast: Lissandra encases herself in dark ice for 2.5 seconds, healing for 100/150/200 (+30% Ability Power), increased for 1% for each 1% Health she is missing, and becoming untargetable and invulnerable but unable to take any actions.Dark ice then emanates from the target dealing 150/250/350 (+70% Ability Power) magic damage to enemies. The ice lasts for 3 seconds and slows enemy Movement Speed by 30/45/75%. \r\n\r\n**NEW**: Randomly at the top river or bot river of Summoner&#039;s rift a small shard will spawn near the river (or in it-near to river as possible though). Lissandra can capture the shard by standing on it for 2-3 seconds and depending on which river it was at, the top/bot half of Summoner&#039;s rift will become a &quot;Cold/Icy&quot; terrain(would be nice if the terrain would change- starts snowing, ice patches on floor, snowy brushes, water in river freezes). The shard is similar to Skarner&#039;s shard thing, which he can capture + teammates, only in this case Lissandra can only do it. The small shard will then turn into like a shard similar to Lissandra&#039;s Utlimate(R), and will reduce enemy stats drastically + applying 1 stack of &quot;Frost&quot; which will stay there until the small shard in river is destroyed. Enemies can destroy the &quot;Shard&quot; if they find it, but it will take some basic attacks to fully destroy the shard, but once its destoyed it explodes sending out &quot;Ice Shards(Q)&quot; in all directions. Has the same effect as her Q(the slow and magic dmg). SO when it is destroyed, it will need a few minutes to regenerate, then it randomly spawns near the river where it was destroyed. \r\n**NEW:** SO the shards(2) are there at the beginning, if captured, the &quot;Icy&quot; terrain effect will last for a few minutes (affecting bot half of top half) or it will &quot;melt&quot; after a few minutes-either way. When it is &quot;melted or destroyed,&quot; the shard will respawn near the river that it was destroyed in after a couple of minutes. But you can go to the other river and freeze that terrain while the bottom one is destroyed. You can capture both shards at bot and top river making Summoner&#039;s Rift a full &quot;Ice&quot; terrain and increasing the reduced stats amount.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense, obviously it needs some work, but see what you make of it xD. I would love a Lissandra Rework.
