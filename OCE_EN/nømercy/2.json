So high Mmr expect to meet higher ranked and skilled players. When losing a game does your Mmr fall based on your overall grade/performance. Well usually for me it&#039;s not entirely my fault for losing the game. It&#039;s more like my teammates do, either bot lane dies constantly or a single lane keeps on feeding - seems intentionally. I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s possible to keep a high or positive Mmr if your win to lose ratio is something like 70W-76L. I think when you lose more than you win you kinda vs lower skilled players both practically (skills) and mentally (attitude). Basically most players get punished (lose games, loss of a lot of lp) because of their teammates..... and for that you get put into even worser, cancerous games. I guess I&#039;m saying that your Mmr shouldn&#039;t drop so heavily because of your teammates performance in which you lose the game. Any thoughts??","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-01T08:19:09.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"406W 396L and my MMR is normal as g4 but i still meet s4/5 a lot idk how bcoz RIOT match making is broken","replies":[]},{"poster":"NøMercy","date":"2017-04-29T08:04:15.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, say you get an S and you lose a game.
