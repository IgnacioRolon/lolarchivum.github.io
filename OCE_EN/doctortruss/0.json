This being a Perm ban on my Second offense with no previous warnings besides my first 14 day Ban. And now my account ive put 4 seasons into is Perm Banned. While i Personally feel that the Immediate Perm ban was a bit extreme i understand that, thats the way its going to be.\n\nI would like this to be a lesson. Don&#039;t Retaliate. Don&#039;t try and stop an argument. and just mute people. I would like to one day get my Account back. but i know this is more than likely impossible.\n\nAnd to you Mr. Clashy while you where not a very nice person i do appologize for being a dick. \n\nSincerly\nDoctorTruss\nKinda toxic but not really.","replies":[{"poster":"hekumatiaru","date":"2017-12-21T02:38:43.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just happened to me too. I played a game first time as Shaco with a premade group of 3 people where they constantly flamed and trolled to the point I had to retaliate by also cussing at them. They were stealing my jungle from the early game, and then blaming me for them losing their lanes except top. Most likely they received reports from different players against me which is why they permanently banned me.\n\nGame 1\nhekumatiaru: fuckk\nhekumatiaru: i pressed q instead of box\nhekumatiaru: ty\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: tf are u pinging me for\nhekumatiaru: i was at top helping nasus idiot\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: the turret was like 2 hits\nhekumatiaru: yea blame the jungler right\nhekumatiaru: not my fault you cant defend your lane for shitt\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: you guys took my jungle\nhekumatiaru: see that\nhekumatiaru: veigar just fuccking stole it\nhekumatiaru: ill just power farm then cause thats what u want right\nhekumatiaru: why didnt you ping so\nhekumatiaru: im feeding?\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: you're telling me if i understand english just because there was someone\nhekumatiaru: cant believe bad players need to blame someone lol\nhekumatiaru: thats because our mid fed him\nhekumatiaru: you idiots are flaming me for no reason because someone else fed him but since you thought i was the one doing it then lol you \nhekumatiaru: might as well change ur language settings to chinese\nhekumatiaru: do u expect me to be faker\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: help they're mad at me\nhekumatiaru: im glad i helped top instead of bot\nhekumatiaru: two butthurt boys\nhekumatiaru: lol ok\nhekumatiaru: you know i'll just mute you cause you're just crying now instead of playing lol\nhekumatiaru: nice\nhekumatiaru: lol\nhekumatiaru: ty\nhekumatiaru: gg nasus\nhekumatiaru: gg\n\nI sent them a support ticket too but it looks like I'll have to start from scratch.","replies":[{"poster":"cuckboii","date":"2017-12-22T10:46:06.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well since we're on the internet, that's a very friendly chat log.

It depends largely on what that toxic comment was, and what your history looks like. If you skipped straight to a 14 day ban before it seems likely you were using zero tolerance language (racism, hate speech, suicide encouragement etc), and if that was also the case here then they definitely won't reverse the ban. If it's not, you might have a chance for a reduction BUT you'd be on very thin ice.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-18T11:33:14.268+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean the only recent rollback i have seen of a ban, has been via me telling a volunteer and them getting Gehirn to look into the specific ban and have it overturned (after having been told no by the Support team)\n\nRiot support is kinda worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-19T01:50:47.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen bans reduced before, but a lot of players seem to either not care and just make a new account, or say screw you Riot and not bother.
