I have been playing league and getting random spikes of ping up to 300 odd (normally sits at 61) and the whole screen will freeze for a second or two then catch up again. I am playing on the same connecting as someone else and he isn&#039;t experiencing ANY lag whatsoever. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t really explain it. I was told its likely the game server but from what i understand i didnt think that game server side lag makes the ping change. regardless has anyone had anything similar? Im concerned that it could be a hardward issue at this point.
