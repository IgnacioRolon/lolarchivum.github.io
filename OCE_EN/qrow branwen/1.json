I finished season 4 as a diamond IV. I am looking for a diamond team to tryout in in the hopes that i could join and play competitive ranked 5&#039;s once again. \r\n\r\nI have been playing Since season 2, i have lots of game experience and knowledge.\r\n\r\nI coached for free on lol-coaching.net for 4 months to get better at teaching and communicating while passing knowledge onto lower tier players. my favorite lanes are ADC and MID, but i am an all rounder player. I can play anywhere, but i have the least experience in the Jungle. \r\n\r\nPlease consider me. Thank you!","replies":[]}
