That way you're somewhat forced to think differently and start looking for roam oppotunities once you hit 6. If you play them for a while it should improve your roaming noticably once you go back to your normal mid laners.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T14:37:27.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing {{champion:4}} wen you hit 6 just keep a eye out around the map you will soon see that top is pushing hard I can ult over in about 10 sec and help get a kill. \nSame with bot and you will start to see with other champs if I go bot now they will be at tower wen I get there its just stuff like that im not saying that you will get a kill 100% of the time as you wont.\nI think 87% of mid roams get a kill or assist this is in gold up tf is a great champ to start as you don't need to understand the second part of this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-25T11:24:49.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main Ahri {{champion:103}}, I find it easy to roam as her, obviously because of her ult, and her e helps. When I roam, I make sure my team know, so they're able to help secure the kill, and also warding helps too, especially in bot side river (usually the jungler camps bottom lane I find). I don't mind if I get pushed into turret during/after my roam (a kill is worth more than losing a few cs), but I always make sure to push into their turret first, giving you enough time to get back. Also having upgraded boots helps if you look to roam as you can get to places faster. You mentioned you play Zed, you can also use your W to get to and from lane faster.\n\nI don't know if any of this helped but I find it's what works best for me. \n\nTL;DR: \n- Buy upgraded boots\n- Ward the river - helps you not get caught\n- Use any movement ability you have, provided it isn't your ult and is on a relatively low cooldown (Zed's W)\n- Push into their turret before leaving to roam (which you mentioned you do anyway so..)\n\nHope this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-25T11:42:08.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, to add on from this, I can't stress how important vision in the enemy jungle is (and your own). You don't necessarily how to roam to other lanes, but if you catch the enemy jungler in their jungle you can try to 1v1 them quickly and get out. Also, if you know where the jungler is, it can help with your roams since you know if the jungler is there to counter-gank.","replies":[]}]}]}
