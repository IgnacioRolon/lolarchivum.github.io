By the very fact you never see her played there, and what people have said about her in this thread, you can assume that Kat is incredibly difficult to play and thus deserving of such a high score. If the stat was able to reflect every skill ranking it would vary but since it doesn't, there is nothing to stop you from using your best judgement and disregarding it completely.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-03T02:53:29.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nijiiyo,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=HcinYK8v,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-09-03T02:51:12.896+0000)\n>\nNow\n\nAye man.

Because as others have mentioned anyone with even a little understanding of the game will know how to shut her down. I played against a Katarina the other day as Vayne and she already had 20 stacks by 13 minutes. At 20 minutes I asked her what happened to her stacks as they had fallen to 3 and she was like \"you happened\". Which was because I deliberately saved my e for a counter engage. Which basically eliminates Katarina's combo instantly meaning she becomes an easy pick. Which is why you need to have good overall awareness of situations. Look for engages where you know you will be able to get your combo off without any interruptions. Whilst admit her difficulty level could be lowered there's a lot more to playing Katarina than the simple e in ult e out.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-20T00:48:07.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I do have to say, that when you survive her all in and she ults at the end, cancelling that pretty much screws her over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-09-03T03:50:06.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you think about it she actually requires skills to play.
