However, whenever I used my taunt, the symbol for Garen fell down onto the ground, and went back up above my head when I moved again. If this is a bug, then please let me know.

The logic also applies to dodging skill-shots with emotes, which you can't because. (Redmercy proved this). This is because visually the champion looks as if it could dodge a skill-shot, but the actual hit-box remains in its initial position.\n\nHowever, there could be a chance that I could be overthinking this, and is actually a bug. :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-07T07:25:13.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When did Elise get a taunt?","replies":[{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2015-09-08T06:21:19.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lone Summoner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XzAIeecm,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-09-07T07:25:13.069+0000)\n>\n> When did Elise get a taunt?\n\nTaunt as in the emote Ctrl + 2","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jezmae","date":"2015-09-07T08:36:09.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm that Elise is a bug","replies":[]}]}
