I&#039;ve seen a few of these threads that have gotten noticed by someone associated with Riot and seen a resolution so that&#039;s what I&#039;m hoping for here. Though by this point I don&#039;t really have much hope left.\r\n\r\nSo bit of background on my situation...\r\nI&#039;ve played LoL on and off for about three years, most recently coming back from an extended break due to studying. I was just getting back into the game (even put some money in to it for the Chaos vs Order event) and generally getting back into the swing of things while playing with some mates (I have a pretty core group of people that I play with and we&#039;re so tight we generally only play together. So this ban didn&#039;t just hit me pretty hard but my friends as well.) It was all business as usual for a few days until I got an email from Riot saying I&#039;d been permanently banned  for the use of third party programs. To say this came as a surprise was an understatement. I had no idea what was going on so of course I opened a support ticket.\r\n\r\n What followed was confusion and frustration (and I admittedly handled my conversation with support pretty poorly, which was wrong. It&#039;s not an excuse but I was more than a bit upset at this point) going down the rabbit hole of riot support and policy was a bit of a nightmare as I had no experience lodging tickets before and was not terribly well informed of policy. So learning about that while trying to find out what was going on was a nightmare (especially going through three different people on the same ticket, that from what I can tell now, started off as an account recovery conversation?) \r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t an attack on support, I know they&#039;re just doing their job the way they&#039;ve been told but I&#039;ve come out of it just feeling angry and hopeless and I don&#039;t think that&#039;s right or fair.  I don&#039;t really even know what I want to achieve with this post...\r\n\r\nI just know that my attempts to find a resolution has left me just as confused as I was when I first received that email. I&#039;ve never used ANYTHING that should interact with League in a way that violates the TOS. The only thing I run is discord to chat with friends while playing. I was worried that maybe my account had been hacked (For what I can tell that is more likely than a false flag) so I pursued that with support but got nowhere. Now I&#039;m just trying to figure out what could have actually flagged my account because now I pretty much can&#039;t even make a new account because I have no idea what happened and can&#039;t be sure it won&#039;t happen again and I really don&#039;t want to go through losing another account. (Not to mention concern for friends who have played on their own accounts on my computers)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day I don&#039;t want to stop playing League but I kind of feel like I have no choice now, not only from losing my account I&#039;ve invested so much time and money in but also not  being able to risk starting all over again.","replies":[{"poster":"Elski","date":"2017-07-17T04:12:05.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=13rain17ead,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=yTXFsEcL,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-16T06:23:02.536+0000)\n>\n> I've never used ANYTHING that should interact with League in a way that violates the TOS\n\n\n\nWHAHAHA..
