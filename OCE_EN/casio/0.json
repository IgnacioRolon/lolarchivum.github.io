Just not too long ago I was in a ranked game and I came across this player &quot;kangkangsama&quot;, who played &quot;Karthus&quot; top which didn&#039;t at all look fishy at any point however as few minutes went by into the game a friend of mine who was against him on top calls out &quot;WHOA this guy must either be a ***king GOD or a cheesy scripter&quot;, at this point I had a quick peep up there and  realized our jungle who was  Poppy decides to gank this Karthus however as I watch this tremendous gank going on I realized that the Karthus was constantly toggling his e at max range as if we&#039;ve stepped on a trip wire with an automatic sensor however that wasn&#039;t all. Poppy decides to solo dragon the place was secured with at least 3 pinks and 2 sensor to make sure that it wasn&#039;t warded and he initiates as we secured dragon without haste the poppy continues to take jungle creeps but a sudden ult from Karthus fell upon summoners rift and BOOM goes Poppy into heaven she goes without a word she calls out &quot;Lucky&quot;. This was just way too fishy so 3 minutes after that incident I decided to go and aggro the golem to hit me but as my hp slowly disappeared from taking free damage I hear the tune of Karthus humming through my headset and the next thing you know I&#039;m dead. From that I can be 101% sure that he was scripting for sure not only that what kind of Karthus places the wall of pain directly on his enemy every single time yup that&#039;s right him, scripts. I know that this won&#039;t do anything at all however I just wanna put awareness for people who might come across this guy because his attitude was a load of rubbish not only was he just spamming the words &quot;LOL&quot;, &quot;EZ&quot; and &quot;GIT GUD&quot; this is what triggered me so excuse my silly rant that I wanted to share thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"LostFr0st","date":"2016-01-06T03:23:56.737+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition, could you please tell riot via a support ticket instead of naming and shaming on the boards...\n\n-LostFr0st","replies":[]},{"poster":"VAGI91","date":"2016-01-14T04:58:40.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think so guys, I met him in soloq we duoed a few game he was really bad at few champs he only champs he could play was ryze and karthas. stop being BUTT hurt OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-06T04:18:35.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend sending a rito ticket since the boards isn't really gonna do anything for this kind of thing.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2016-01-06T13:24:51.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-06T07:19:10.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might want to include the actual replay in the post you send to Riot, you can download it [here](http://www.replay.gg/).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-06T03:21:40.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I looked at his match history and he's only played 3 ranked games as Karthus in the past 2 weeks and none of them had a poppy playing.
