Then Taric&#039;s (amazing) new lore was released, and in the comic, there was a dramatic scene where his ring falls off his finger and disappears down the mountain. Knowing that Ezreal is an explorer and loves relics and solving mysteries, I wondered what would happen if Ezreal came across Taric&#039;s ring. Thus, this story was born. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nEzreal turned the ring over on the palm of his glove, admiring its beauty as it glimmered under the sun&rsquo;s natural light. It had unknown origins, but the deep scars along its golden surface and the dull glow of its melancholy sapphire insisted a story in need of telling. As an explorer with profound interests in unravelling Runeterra&rsquo;s secrets and history, Ezreal had paid a high price for it, but the mysterious merchant had claimed to have found it somewhere near the foot of Mount Targon, and believed it had belonged to someone daring enough to venture up the mountain&rsquo;s treacherous slopes.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;There is a rumour of a disgraced Demacian soldier who had ascended the mountain to seek redemption,&rdquo; the merchant had told him, the skin under his wise eyes crinkling as he smiled. &ldquo;Very few know what lies at Mount Targon&rsquo;s summit, but the legends say that the protector of the world &ndash; the Shield of Valoran &ndash; watches over us from the stars.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nIn other words, a warrior from the recent war between Demacia and Noxus could have climbed up the mountain that was shrouded in mystery, and still be alive to tell his tale. With his knowledge in arcane magic, Ezreal knew there was something living within the ring he had obtained from the merchant &ndash; a dormant power that yearned for its original owner.  As such, after studying Runeterra&rsquo;s ancient legends for more hints and leads, the explorer had decided to visit Mount Targon himself.\r\n \r\nThe young blond man eyed the mountain in the distance, shivering as he was assaulted by a gust of icy wind and snowflakes. His boots sank into the thick white blanket, each step heavy and exhaustive. Somewhere further back, he had twisted his ankle from the twigs buried in the snow.\r\n \r\nWith a sigh of frosty air, Ezreal tightened his goggles and hugged his arms around his body. As he trudged closer to the foot of the mountain, his admiration for those who had journeyed through the icy, unforgiving wilderness to climb the slopes grew. Although he had travelled to the Freljord a few times, the atmosphere surrounding Mount Targon was ominous beyond words &ndash; whenever the explorer closed his eyes, he could hear tormented voices wailing at the back of his head, and he trembled involuntarily as he felt the presence of angry, restless ghosts clawing at him with invisible hands.\r\n \r\nAlone and freezing to death, Ezreal desperately wanted to return to civilisation. He wanted to sink down into one of those cushioned seats by the fireplace with a book on his lap and a mug of hot chocolate in his hands. His research had taken him from Piltover to the recovering war-torn nation of Demacia, where he had spent days upon days inside Alabaster Library, poring over ancient scripts and deciphering the codes of generals and historians who had been too afraid to write anything that could paint their country in a negative light.\r\n \r\nSeveral years ago, the library had an entire section dedicated to the wars between Demacia and Noxus. Statues of war heroes and relics, including swords, spearheads and pieces of armour, now replaced half the section. The remaining histories of the country now mostly boasted recounts of successful military campaigns, which promoted the adherence to Demacian values and beliefs. On the occasion that a loss was mentioned, the focus was on the soldiers&rsquo; honourable courage in the face of an oppressive, corrupt adversary, rather than the error in their strategy.\r\n \r\nIt had been an arduous task to read between the lines and speculate what could have been written on the various torn and burnt pages. Finally, Ezreal had found information about Demacia&rsquo;s traditional Crown of Stone ceremony for disgraced soldiers in their newspaper archives. By pure luck, a visit to a museum had lead to an encounter with an ageing soldier who had been eyeing a warrior&rsquo;s helmet and a hammer with longing and regret.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;They belonged to a brilliant commander,&rdquo; the soldier had whispered to him, frantically glancing around as if he was afraid of being overheard, but desperately wanting Ezreal to understand. &ldquo;Taric was his name &ndash; despite the carnage and bloodshed of the wars, he retained a kind heart and was able to see beauty in the small things in life. But they sent him away&hellip;they sent him away&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n \r\nThe mysterious ring had suddenly glowed as soon as the commander&rsquo;s name was uttered, and the soldier had immediately recognised the sapphire and the olive leaves carved onto its golden band. Armed with new information about the owner of the ring, the explorer had then resumed his travels, crossing the Mogran Pass until all he could see was the looming mountain, lonely trees and thick white snow.\r\n \r\nEzreal paused at a wiry tree to catch his breath. The darkening skies and howling of nearby beasts warned that night was approaching. The beasts howled again, and to Ezreal&rsquo;s alarm, he could see a pack of eight mountain wolves charging from the direction of the mountain towards him with gleaming eyes and exposed teeth. Ezreal felt his legs tremble, but he reminded himself that he had killed wolves in jungle camps before. Taking a deep breath, he placed a hand over his gauntlet, feeling the arcane magic activate.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; the explorer said between chattering teeth. &ldquo;Time for a true display of skill!&rdquo;\r\n \r\nHe blinked out the way as the leader of the pack lunged at the position he had been standing just before, and shot a Mystic Shot at its face. With quick precision, he threw an Essence Flux in the same direction, before shuffling back and efficiently kiting them with his basic attacks and skill shots. He smirked as his Trueshot Barrage finished charging and was about to launch it at the pack, when he heard a voice shouting at him from behind, yelling for him to stop, and then there was a beam of radiant light stunning him and the wolves mid-motion.\r\n \r\nMuscular arms wrapped around his torso roughly, the impact sending him crashing headfirst onto the snow. Unable to move, Ezreal watched in daze as the stranger&rsquo;s strong hands pulled him up.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Each life is a rare jewel,&rdquo; the stranger lectured him with disapproval in his tone, before the stun wore off and he was gently set down. Wincing, Ezreal turned over to gaze at the newcomer. He was solidly built, with long brown hair and wore a blue cape around his shoulders in addition to his armour. With a soft smile, the stranger knelt down and placed his hands over the wolves&rsquo; wounds. Green magic glowed from his palms, healing them.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Wolves are beautiful creatures,&rdquo; the man continued, patting the wolf on the head and receiving an affectionate nuzzle in return. Ezreal gaped at him in wonder, amazed by how fast the stranger had managed to tame a pack of wild mountain wolves. Now healed, the beasts flicked their tails and turned back towards the mountain.\r\n \r\nThen the stranger&rsquo;s smile turned grim. &ldquo;Were you sent here?&rdquo; he asked.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Sent?&rdquo; Ezreal echoed. He shook his head. &ldquo;I came here by myself to explore.&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;The mountain reveals the harshest truths in our souls,&rdquo; the stranger replied, frown lines deepening across his handsome face. &ldquo;You should turn back, young traveller.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nEzreal sighed and buried his head in his hands. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit too late for that,&rdquo; he complained exasperatedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already dark and I&rsquo;m lost in the middle of nowhere.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nThe brown haired man gave him an odd look. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t bring a map?&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Who needs a map?&rdquo; the explorer answered with a shrug, although he was seriously regretting it this time.\r\n \r\nThat earned him a gentle chuckle in return. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the stars will guide us.&rdquo; The stranger stood up and raised his head to gaze at the sky, his cape flying majestically behind him against the wind. &ldquo;Take a look &ndash; aren&rsquo;t they beautiful?&rdquo;\r\n \r\nThe night had enveloped them quickly, and Ezreal could see a million tiny lights glittering across the sky like gems. In that moment, he forgot about the freezing, harsh terrain of Mount Targon, and lay flat on the snow to marvel at the view. It was during times like this when the blond truly loved being an explorer.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;They are even more stunning from the top of the mountain,&rdquo; the stranger said, joining him. &ldquo;We see the beauty of the stars, and they see the beauty in us.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nEzreal sat up, considering his words. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve solved the mystery!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed. From his pocket, he took out the ring &ndash; the reason he had started his journey towards the treacherous mountain. Even in the dark, the sapphire began to glow, buzzing with intense arcane energy that threatened to burst from its confines. The explorer could sense its excitement at being reunited with its owner.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Outrageous,&rdquo; Taric breathed, recognising the ring he had dropped from Mount Targon many years ago during his ascent. &ldquo;Gems. Gems are truly outrageous. They are truly, truly,_ truly_ outrageous.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-07T01:35:15.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"needa break up the parts where it jumps with a \n----\nto make it easier to follow\n\nAlso, the freljord is north of demacia.
