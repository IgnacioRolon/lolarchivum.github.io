The champion design should look something like historic samurai armor. I know that you have already made yasuo but i hope you consider him. Things are a little undecided and i have multiple options for his abilities but here is the main ones\n**Lore**\nThe servant of a major figure of Ionia. After war and battle was abolished, he seeks to serve his master&#039;s bidding by joining the league\n\n**Passive**\n**Enchanted Armor:** Blessed by the gods and his lord. Abilities deal reduced damage, not auto attacks. (how this is decided you guys can decide i don&#039;t really know what you guys want to do but i imagined it to be lvl scaling from 7-13% maybe?)\n**Code of Honor and Virtue:** Full health champions take bonus 10%? dmg but as their health drops they take 5%? less damage (? means that you guys can change the amount or how it works)\n\nThe Q and R i dont really know which should be where and their effects change depending on which one you think they belong so im putting both\n\n**Q**\nLightning Draw: He blinks to a target location after a short channel (bit shorter than lb dash range and range is set) damaging all enemies in his path after a short delay (1 second). If he does not hit anyone he is slowed for a bit. If path collides with an enemy champion he appears in front of where they are facing (due to honor) and has increased attack speed/damage for a duration 4-5 seconds?, so basically he hits attack animation is a crit and also faster. Thought probably about a 10 second cooldown.\n                                                                                                                           OR\nTrained Strike: An strike which he trains all day and night to perfection. His next auto attack deal bonus %ad damage that has multiple effects. One, his attack animation (like a channel but cant be interrupted) is slowed for this attack. Two, the ability has a cleave effect if not on an enemy champion or large monster (from the shockwave of said strike). 3 Shatters all shields, counterattacks, parry&#039;s, pantheon shield etc but doesn&#039;t deal bonus damage, Low cool down about 4-3 seconds. Also thought about giving this ability flat armor pen instead of bonus damage but idk.\n\n**W**\nSamurai&#039;s Bow\nFor 3 auto&#039;s he has largely increase range and turns into a skill shot (bit less than cait ult?), but all bonus attack speed is removed and deals less damage. For this the reduced damage of his passive (Code of honor and virtue) is removed or, in this state his enchanter armor is removed. He then deals percent missing health damage. Long cooldown\n\n**E**\nSamurai&#039;s Training\nPassive: Killing units permanently increase his attack  up to a cap like Garen&#039;s passive but takes longer to stack.\nActive: All bonus attack speed is halved but gains attack damage equal to 20-90-150 depending on how leveled and attack speed sacrificed. All attack speed gained during the duration is also halved and added to AD (the 3rd figure is in relation to his R lightning movement). is  Has passive increased movement speed, next auto attack has somewhat increased range and also moves him to the target\n\n**R**\nLightning Movement:\nAfter a short channel, he blinks towards a target location. All enemies in path are damaged, but appears in front of the last enemy champion in the line marking then for battle. All attacks on target have increased range (not much though like 300 range or less) and dashes towards the target. The more enemies hit the more attack speed he gains. This can be sacrificed by e. Also depending on passive, after cast has been finished:\nA) His passive protection is doubled or\nB) His entire passive is removed, but the last champion hit with his ult is marked with the bonus damage increased depending on level of ability\n\nDevastating Strike:\nAfter a 1-2 second channel, he unleashes a devastating attack which deals damage in a cone. All enemies within attack range (without buff from abilities or items) will take damage based on total ad at time of cast (so you can e then ult) and stun. All opponents outside of the area take less damage and are knocked back slightly or slowed briefly.\n\n\nTo be honest, with the w i do not care if you change it because i couldn&#039;t really think of much else to do for that ability slot. you may wish to swap it out for the other option of the passive but this is the general idea of the champ i had in mind.\n\n\n\nSo either way hoped you liked it\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
