Just today I experienced a problem a couple of hours ago while playing League, just posting to see if anybody could offer me some assistance with it.\r\n\r\nEverything was fine I connected really fast into champion select like normal, but in the loading screen and when the game started I had significant ping. It spiked to high as almost 900ms and didn&#039;t go any lower than 600ms and every time I try to test to see if it has changed in a custom game my client was still experiencing lag. No one else is on the internet, my phone Wifi off, LoL is the only thing running and I still lag so I&#039;m certain it is league and not my internet provider. Youtube, Facebook, Twitch and everything else I tested all loading fast as usual but League is just sitting there at 600ms+ whenever I try to play a game. \r\n\r\nIf it makes a difference I am using a Mac and my internet provider is Telstra but if the root of the problem is League itself I doubt those matter.\r\nCan anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-22T09:36:13.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nDefinitely sounds like it may be an issue on your/your ISP's end.\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.

''If'' you do have access to your modem settings, I suggest you change your wifi channel to either 1,6,11. That way your wifi channel won't interfere with other wifi networks.  Never leave it on auto as if you do leave it on auto then the modem will just choose its own wifi channel which could interfere with other wifi networks if not set on the right channel. \n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]}]}
