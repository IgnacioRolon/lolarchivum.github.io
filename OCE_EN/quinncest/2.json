On top of this, Infinity Edge is no longer an early powerspike item and more of an item that gets stronger as the game goes on (provided you build more Crit). They have also made it so the game is easier to snowball and hence games end fairly quickly.\n\nThis is why we have seen bruisers and fighters in the ADC role since they get to their powerspikes faster, and why Crit ADCs have fallen out of the meta.\n\n**TL;DR** - Not sure if Crit is good on Quinn herself, but Marksmen Crit builds are definitely not in a good spot at the moment.\n\nI hope this helps :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-07-09T05:25:52.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn was one of the few marskmen that did not have their base stats reduced so she doesn't suffer with the same in-built early game weakness, and multiplicative stats such as attack speed and crit are generally better on her in the early to mid game than they are on standard marksmen.\n\nWhile flat AD and armor pen have always been and still are generally good on Quinn, the crit path is still highly viable at least in part. Most successful builds will run Stormrazor into Statikk Shiv at some point, with the option to extend that into an IE purchase for both good burst against squishies and tankbusting.\n\nPersonally, I was always fond of full armor pen builds on Quinn and they definitely still work, but in top lane I have felt pretty good when trying out BF > Statikk Shiv > Stormrazor > IE. Statikk first for the wave clear into roaming potential. But for mid and bot I'd recommend rushing the Stormrazor first.\n\nFlat armor pen into stormrazor > Shiv seems to be the most popular build atm and is probably just safer, but I feel skipping the armor pen and working with stuff like the above build can win harder past 3 items and be generally more effective against all targets if the game isn't too accelerated against your team by 10-15 mins.\nTo be fair I haven't had enough games to really explore the viability of full crit, and you do feel less punchy in the early game without armor pen, and of course it is risky because it takes longer to come online. But whenever I finally hit stormrazor/shiv/IE I feel I'm able to take on almost anyone no matter how fed they are. I'm just too cocky on quinn before 3 items when building crit because I'm used to building full armor pen so my success with it isn't consistent yet :P","replies":[{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-07-14T18:55:37.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It still seems like Lethality and playing her assassin-esque is still the way to go.
