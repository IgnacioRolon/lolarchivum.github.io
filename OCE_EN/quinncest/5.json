Personal.** \nEvery ban at our elo always is to some degree. I just dont like Lee, I don't like his be-a-hero playstyle, I don't like the people Lee Sin attracts as players. I don't want either in my games.\n\n**2. Power.** \nLee Sin has a hell of a lot in his kit. That is just a fact. But its not the raw power that bugs me, what bugs me is that his kit is 100% seamlessly smooth to use.   Some champs, for example the new Aatrox, have weird little cool downs, cast times and wind ups. Aatrox's new ult has no cast time listed, but I have died more than several times after pressing the button and before the ult activates _(putting the ult on CD, so the command has definitely been received)_, also there is a small cooldown between using the different casts of his Q, all of this makes the champion feel clunky, and most importantly, all that wasted time adds up and in the end can mean the difference between a kill and a death. Lee Sin has absolutely none of that. Everything in his kit happens as soon as you press the button, he has no cast times, no awkward pauses before being able to re-activae an ability, and whatever cast animations he has, are so minimal they don't make a difference. All of this means that Lee Sin is more responsive and more reactive to commands than most other champs, meaning sometimes he escapes not because he pressed the button before you, but because he doesn't have any awkward pauses, and you do. Sometimes he kills you, because even though both players reacted at the same time, Lee Sin moves first. And I don't like that un-eveness in the playing field.\n\n**3. Mind Games. ** \nArguably the most important aspect of the ban. It's no secret that many of the players who do play Lee Sin, ONLY play Lee Sin, and they are very good at it, and they know it. So banning Lee Sin has a triple effect, It removes the champ they have the most experience on, causes them to play another champ who they hardly ever play, AND shatters their own confidence when playing. Rather than spamming their lvl 7 after every move, they are left at the mercy of everyone else's mastery, while they struggle with a champ they are only playing because they cant use their 1 trick.\n\n**4. Calculated probability.**\nWether you hate playing against the champ or not, banning a champion that the enemy is likely to pick has a big impact. Often your ban is wasted because even though you hate playing against Zilean and just cant do it, chances are the enemy wasn't going to pick Zilean anyway, and just pick the champ they were going to pick, unaffected by your ban. So by banning a champ you know is popular, you increase your chances of actually affecting the enemy team. Lee Sin is a very popular _(if the THE most popular champ)_ banning him is statistically more likely to screw your enemy over.","replies":[]}]}
