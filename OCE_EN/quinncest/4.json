This is a deadly trap though, because alot of players have unfounded self confidence and aren't smurfing, and generally this smurfing approach works much better if you actually play midlane, and focus on macroplays. Sure bronze midlane Zed onetricks might have decent mechanics, but if you manipulate the wave for the early game, roam, and return with a 2k gold lead, it doesn't matter if he has a million mastery points on zed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-07T09:44:52.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it myself! There's one thing I'd like to add to your final point though:\n\n>in middle bronze, it became apparent that it would be much easier to just build damage and do damage. This is a deadly trap\n\nIt's not just dangerous because of inflated confidence and \"I'm better than my rank and all of you\" type attitudes, but also simply because of how the meta shifts as you rank up. In my experience once you move into mid/high gold you see *way* less caster supports (almost none really). Your other arguments still stand, and those champs still have their place, but neglecting to learn traditional supports will ultimately hurt most players as they climb higher and the shape of the game changes.\n\nImo, ranked is as much about adaptability as it is mechanics.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-09-07T00:04:19.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"As someone who regularly plays pretty much every champion as support i can explain a little bit.\n\nMages go support partially because adc's are bad and there's no point relying on an ADC if they're just gonna int, the other side of that coin is the match up.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnemy picks Thresh/Lucian bot lane - both are close ranged, and both are susceptible to AoE poke\n\nMy team picks Vayne ADC (because silver elo) so i go Ziggs support (something i'm very good at both supp and mid, even top if the match up works out) knowing how hard it will be for Vayne to get close to those two, i start poking them down, by 2 mins i've gotten them to half-health and we're level 3, whilst they're level 2, we go balls deep, we burn their double summs and even kill the escapeless thresh getting FB and access to the tower, with this one decent fight, we get first brick too, and thus snowball uncontrollably. This literally was caused by picking a mage, not because the Vayne knows how to play (in the game this is based off, this Vayne did nothing but flame me even though i gave her first blood, and ofc i got first brick, we ended the game in 25 mins with 25 kills to our name, just in the bot lane alone, i think total kills for the game were 45:23, inting top laner OP and needless to say, the Vayne flamed me for at least 23 out of those 25 mins)\n\nThis same situation seems to apply for all mages, and 9/10 times the mage that is support is not classified as a mid laner anymore (due to nerfs or even just a meta shift) **GLARES at Brand**\n\nif the idea is to get mages out of bot and return to enchanter/tank supports, all riot needs to do is nerf the assassin meta down, and buff the supports that are actual supports, however given riot's preference over skins than game balancing the chances of that happening are slim to none, so you're stuck with them until riot realises they've fucked up.\n\nHopefully this sheds some light on the question\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-09-08T22:26:47.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most insightful response I could have asked for.
