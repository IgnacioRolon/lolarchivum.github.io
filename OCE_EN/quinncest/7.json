I ignored them, and just continued playing, where the enemy team decided to take their sob story for a fact, so I was getting abused by about 6 people. \r\n\r\nAfter the next 30 minutes of taking flack from them all, I reported the 2 guys on my team for instigating it and continuously harassing me, I closed the client cos it was kind of upsetting, and re-opened it to get the message that one of the two guys were penalized. \r\n\r\nThe main question is, is there a way I can check if they we&#039;re 14 day&#039;s, or just chat restricted? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance guys!\r\n\r\n\r\n{{champion:53}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-07T14:15:22.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr No you can't tell, but if they've suddenly stopped playing safe top assume it was a ban of some sort.\n\n___\n\nRiot keep that sort of info intentionally vague, it's one of the reasons the notification only triggers under very specific circumstances, and for much the same reason we have naming and shaming rules here on boards. It's an issue of privacy and of reform. \n\nIdeally most players who receive a punishment will have an \"oh shit\" moment, actually read the reform card warning them that continued negative behaviour can result in the loss of their account, and if not actually improve their behaviour, at least keep it off the public forum that is the chat box.\n\nIt doesn't work for all punished players of course, but in those cases where it does, leaving those players making an effort to reform (or at least develop restraint) vulnerable to witch hunting isn't great.\n\nI'd like to commend you for not talking back. Whether a player is being toxic from a desire to be or as a result of frustration, talking back pretty much never results in anything good, but especially when we are the targets it can be hard to resist fighting back or trying to defend ourselves. I probably would have recommended you mute them, but I'm rather prone to curiosity myself so I also understand why muting can be very dissatisfying at times.\n\nSome extra context on the notification as well, getting one notification doesn't mean there was only one punishment. I'm not saying there was a second because I don't know the details obviously, just that the notification is very limited, and will only show once per game even if you reported multiple people that game that were subsequently punished. If you reported two players (that got punished) in two games, but got into the second before the notification appeared you would still only receive one notification. There is also a whole slew of reasons the notification doesn't appear even when a player you reported *was* punished. In short it's very limited.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-06-08T07:06:53.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked their OP.GG's and they haven't played a game since the report has been issued, which can only mean they have been temporarily banned from the rift.
