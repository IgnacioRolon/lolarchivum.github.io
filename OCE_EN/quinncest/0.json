So normals matchmaking wont consider anything about ranked, even though it should be influenced, even just a bit, by a persons rank/MMR in the respective ranked queue(s) to help better match players based on skill. I wouldn't expect Riot to implement anything like that, but we can all agree it would be a welcome addition.\n\nOne way situations like this can occur is that the player(s) in question might not play anything other than ranked normally, and/or they'll use normals as a way to just have fun, screw around with different stuff, try out new builds/rune pages etc. The kind of stuff that would mean they're not playing to their potential and, thus, not getting the same MMR as they would have in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-15T02:54:46.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's talking about the rotating game mode.

Like, sure, a challenger/master/diamond player is going to have better knowledge, skill and such but the modes are typically different enough that those advantages are less significant.\n\nAs far as rank influenceing other matchmaking, I'm of the opinion that certain modes should remain untouched by it (ARAM, URF, for example) while other modes (OFA, Hexakill, for example) *maybe* just tone it down a bit compared to how it should be in normals.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
