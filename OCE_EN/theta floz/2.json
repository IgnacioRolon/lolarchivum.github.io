The game has brought me joy, happiness and has been a huge part of my life for a long time. I love this game. I&#039;m constantly seeking to improve my play and enjoy the game in different ways. However, there are some things that make this difficult to do.\r\n\r\nOne of the key ways to improve your rank and get better at the game (along with playing regularly - a clever business model) is to maintain a positive attitude and limit negativity. An interesting system you guys implemented was to reward well behaved players through the honour system. A system which has all but died out and become obsolete. My question to you is; &quot;Instead of using an obsolete system to reward good behaviour (which is expected) why not effectively implement a system (which works) that punishes bad behaviour?&quot;\r\n\r\nThe majority of games and loss of enjoyment, and most likely the reduction in paying customers to your franchise is the behaviour and actions of players when things don&#039;t go their way. The way you approach scripting for instance, whereby you dish out severe punishment, is a perfect example of how to deal with people who break the Summoner&#039;s Code.\r\n\r\nAre poor behaviour, toxicity and rage quitting not breaching the Summoner&#039;s Code. Perhaps look at implementing a system which effectively punishes people who demonstrate this behaviour. Because it&#039;s been comprehensively proven that the Tribunal does not work. \r\n\r\nI hope you guys actually consider increasing the effort you put in to moderating your community, given that it is the sole point of negativity attributed to League of Legends. You&#039;re a massive company. You earn millions of dollars a week just from skins. You have the resources to implement a system which will make your game better for everybody who plays it.\r\n\r\nThe community WANT a better place to enjoy the game we love. I hope we&#039;re heard.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFlozzen","replies":[]}
