We&#039;re reassembling a roster currently (given availability and practice dates of our last roster didn&#039;t synergise). We&#039;re looking for a coach and analysts who are willing to spend time with us and talk us through games, items, gold efficiency and tactics.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested please add me in game (IGN: Floz) or add our manager (IGN: Theta eSports).\r\n\r\nThanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Makkam","date":"2015-09-05T07:14:23.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a friendly hint, you won't find a good coach/analyst without paying them a decent wage (which OCE esports doesn't have a big enough infrastructure for unless you're a top team). \n\nAlso, there is no serious competitive tournaments for another few months at least. No need to be looking this early as most of the recognizable coaches are on hiatus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frickichi","date":"2015-09-04T20:26:51.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello.
