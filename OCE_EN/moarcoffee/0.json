They don&#039;t talk- they just walk up to the enemies and auto hit as if he is some sort of bot, not a player. \r\n So I&#039;ve done some research... and it turns out that there are some sort of hack programs for players to set up so they can farm IP and EXP without actually playing. \r\nEg) https://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/league-legends-hacks-bots-cheats-exploits/3702135-bot-summonerfactory-level-30-bot-ip-farm-free-level-10-a.html\r\n(I don&#039;t know if this link will actually work, I have just picked whatever result came out first)\r\n\r\n The number of intentional-feeder is growing fast and I believe there must be some actions taken. \r\n On Korean Server, they post a list of people they ban (temporarily and permanently )  every week. I believe such restrictions is required here too.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-07-09T17:02:11.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats in ARAM and just fun. \nId rather have it in aram more than ranked. \n\nAlso, rito wont do anything and ive had board mods defend int feeding behaviour. And had one openly admit that trolling/int feeding/ generally trying to ruin the game is perfectly acceptable","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-10T05:11:19.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh? Please do share the comments in which these boards mods defended intent feeding and admitted that it was acceptable, I would be very interested to see them, since obviously that is not ok.","replies":[]}]}]}
