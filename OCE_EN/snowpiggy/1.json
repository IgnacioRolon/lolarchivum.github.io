This was all well and good until I saw that the Icon was missing (and maybe the essence but it&#039;s hard to tell becuase I can&#039;t recall the previous values) \r\nI have shut and re opened the client, turned my PC off and on, ect. and the icon isn&#039;t there. \r\nTo be quite frank I don&#039;t realy care for or need icons, but it would just be nice to know that I didn&#039;t get absolutely nothing out of that box. \r\n\r\nThanks, Snowpiggy","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-08-26T23:21:53.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner, \n\nHave you checked that the icon wasn't already placed into your icon inventory? Icons don't need to be activated with essence, they are instantly redeemed and therefore skip sitting in your loot tab.","replies":[{"poster":"snowpiggy","date":"2017-08-27T00:14:47.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I did check yesterday, but I'll open the client up and check everything again.\n\nThanks for the help","replies":[]}]}]}
