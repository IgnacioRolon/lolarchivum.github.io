But there was no URF mode. \r\nThis is the first time I&#039;ve ever put in the effort to make a post on the boards, so that alone proves the extent of my fury. I don&#039;t know what the bloody heck you were thinking, I&#039;ve been playing this game for one year now and on EVERY single april fools I have played URF, but not today. Why is that? Is not letting me and countless others play URF the prank this year?\r\nI&#039;m very disapointed, \r\nSincerely Snowpiggy","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-01T06:22:40.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was no URF on April fools last year?
