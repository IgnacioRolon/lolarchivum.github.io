I realize I still have to learn and open for criticism but believe I am ranked lower compared to my skills and looking for someone to climb or a team to join. My best are jungle, support and top. I also like to call shots, but that is not a necessary. Message me in game at LyonCubs, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"thetrollmast3r","date":"2015-04-02T21:26:57.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently am bronze 3 player but have been through the ranks to silver and almost gold in pre season. Have been very experienced and work well with teams that are willing to help. First ranked team i joined i was the jungler (rammus) and set up easy kills. We lost because of a disconnect. From then on ranked team just split. Similar things have happened to me and im looking for a team that will actually work. If this is it i will be glad to join.I have played since late season 2 on and off and have had a lot of experience with \"impossible games\" and have been able to bring them backing by having a positive attitude and trying.
