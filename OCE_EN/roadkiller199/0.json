The system assumes you're playing the game as it's meant to be played.  So you have to play it how it's not meant to be played.  In other words, play selfishly.\n\nUsually, If you're not getting S, usually you're not playing selfishly enough.\nIf you're getting MVP at the end of the game, you're almost certainly not doing it right.\n\nThe two most important factors in an S score _(in my experience, after lots of trial and error)_, are CS and deaths.\nLess deaths and more CS will give you more points towards your S than how many kills or assists you have.\n\nFocus on these two aspects of your play, above all else!\nIf you can do that AND help your team, great!  If not, you need to play selfishly.  If you're jungling Nocturne, then stay in the jungle.  Gank if you're certain you will come away with something at minimal risk to yourself.  If you're not certain, stay and CS.   If your team is about to secure a kill, ult in, and take it or at least be part of the kill for an assist.  If your team mate is in trouble and needs help, and the situation looks dicey.  Let them die, saving them won't affect your S score, dying with them will.\n\nRemember, you're not trying to win, you're trying to fool the game into thinking you're performing at a level above your own.\nThe game doesn't know or count, the times you 'should' have ulted.  But it does count the times you died trying to make a play.\n\nIf theres CS to be had, take it.  The best players in the server have a CS per minute that the likes of us can only dream of.  If you want to show the system you're at that level, you have to focus all your energy on CSing.  Take all the jungle, when the laners go back, take their minions.  When the enemy is aced, and your team is hard pushing mid for the inhib, you NEED to be in those side lanes cleaning up minions.  It doesn't matter if you're helping the team or not, the game doesn't know what you _should_ have done.  It only knows what you did and wether the stats line up with what it considers to be S grade.\n\nWhen I got my lvl 7 Taliyah, I did it with a score that was only barely positive.  It was a long game, and I ended with a score like 4/2/6 or something similar.  Doesn't look like an S score right?  I think I was in like 3 team fights in the whole game, and came in late to all of them.  I probably had like 10% kill participation, absolutely terrible.  But what I did have; was 697 CS, and that's what the game wanted.  I spent 40+ minutes ulting between lanes clearing them and getting out before anyone (from either team) could stop me.\n\nBut obviously even with all the CS in the world, the game isn't going to look positively on a 0/0/0 score at 50 minutes.  This is where luck, and being a dick come into play.  Sometimes you just get unlucky, and Kha'Zix is waiting for you in your jungle all throughout the game, and thats the end of your S.  And sometimes you get lucky and catch Kindred in the act taking scuttle crab at 300 HP, and thats a free kill with almost 0 risk.\n\nThose are the kind of kills and assists you need to be going for, to build up your kda.\n\nOther than that, be a dick.  Gank when it suits you _(not when the laner needs it)_, and have no qualms about taking the kill.  In-fact flash smite it if you can.  A lvl 7 banner is permanent.  The whinging of your top laner only lasts 30 minutes.\n\nYou get the idea.  Score is paramount, deaths and CS most of all. \nDo everything in your power to secure that, even if it costs the game, or costs your team mates their sanity.\n\n___________________________________\n\nThis is terrible advice I know, it's awful team playing, and I'd never suggest doing this for anything other than getting S scores.\nBut as someone with 17 lvl 7s and a bunch of lvl 6s too.  I can say it does work.\n\n\n\n**_PS: Also I should mention, that you are graded against other people in the same position you are playing.  And theres quite a lot less Support nocturne mains getting great scores, so its easier to have a S grade as a off-meta position for your champ._**","replies":[{"poster":"Techno","date":"2019-10-05T06:37:43.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you are compared against players of same role AND similar mmr.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-05T06:43:32.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does grade you against other Nocturnes in that specific role (which makes Support nocturne more likely to get S than Jungle Noc)\n\nbut I do believe it is every player in the server, not only your own MMR. But I have no proof of this.\nAll I can say is that players in my MMR certainly aren't getting consistently 300 CS per game as Kayle, yet thats what I seem to have to do to achieve S scores right now it seems. _(on top of good KDA)_","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-05T06:57:18.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is every player on the server.\n\nA Bronze that does well in Bronze is going to have a similar score to a Plat who does well in Plat. Matchmaking itself takes care of most of that discrepancy. \n\nBUT, this naturally makes CS and deaths a bigger factor, because generally speaking players in higher ranks are going to have fewer deaths and better farm, but I'm pretty sure that's also kind of the point. CS and playing from behind are big factors to consider when talking about mastery because each champion functions differently within those metrics.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to people who have earned mastery on *all aspects* of a champion to let people who have only mastered *most aspects* achieve the same rank in the same amount of time.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-10-01T05:22:39.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe adapt to everything (try do every role that suits positively according to your team and the enemy team) instead of most kills, least deaths, and an okay amount of cs.
