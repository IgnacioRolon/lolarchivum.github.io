Great replay value\r\nI&#039;ve played urf and odyssey more, but once the &quot;oh i wanna see what this champ does&quot; or the &quot;what about this augment combination&quot; rush is over, I kind of get bored, but with nexus blitz it&#039;s like a sort of rotation, where I jump in there to have some fun after a few games of ranked then it&#039;s back to ranked.\r\n\r\n2. Less punishing\r\nIf i do bad, the fact that it&#039;s so short makes it easier to get over with. I don&#039;t feel like i have to be stuck here for god god knows how long.\r\n\r\n3. Two people Jungling, shorter recalls, and other fancy QOL changes\r\nLove them, feels so snappy\r\n\r\n4. Good platform if you wanna test something out\r\n\r\nOkay so these are my personal reasons, please share if you have any reasons you don&#039;t see on here. Also if someone who is on the NA board sees this can you please post this on the NA board because I can&#039;t, and then just type &quot;posted on NA&quot; below so the other know thanks bye lol XD haha","replies":[]}
