On their July 5th -.- I think Riot should have released them much earlier, personally. Saves the confusion. So Apparently in a few hours. If they don't by 9 am AEST today I'm going to be a little bit more than disappointed since that's midnight in the UK. Legit saving 4K RP just so I can get Jhin and Syndra for me and Nami for my friend. -.-","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-07-05T12:37:45.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then why say on the OCE Broadcast they would be available on the 5th when its not true, I know its nitpicky but its just annoying that it gets my hopes up when I work like 70 hour weeks and I come home with RP cards and still nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-05T08:16:44.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that NA is behind us timezone wise. Even now it is only 4am EST which I believe is what the Riot offices run on. So yes it is Wednesday for us, but when you posted it was barely Wednesday for them. Likely they'll be up in a few hours.","replies":[]}]}
