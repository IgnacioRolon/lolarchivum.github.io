It's like a guy with no balls wearing a condom to avoid pregnancy... \n\nIts like saying; you should wear a helmet incase it takes another hit and you lose more brain cells... its partially correct, but you're going to lose more anyways... eg; condoms also protect against STi's....\n\nGet a proper recording mic, us aussies on youtube sound like total bogans when using basic desk mounted mics / headset mics, get an actual sound recording mic with filter to clear it up and make it less harsh. \n\nYou want views and subscribers, you realize Australian's have one of the hardest accents to listen to for English because we use the back of our mouths in our accent and the speed of which we do it, and the fact we break english up on a regular basis as if everyone understands, we know what we're saying, we understand our cultural tones, the world doesn't...\n\naccentuate your words clearly; nobody says \"Is that a \"FING\" anymore\" \n\nSlow down your talking, it's like you're on Ritalin or \"something\".\n\n\nHonestly; just slow it down, make it clear, im guessing you're lebanese or something from the way you talk also (no offence i dont care at all), it may work against you if you talk like you're amongst friends. Either play it as a draw card and be funny with it, be the wogboy of LoL doesn't matter, just don't try to ignore it / hide it when you're not speaking clearly. \n\nNot a bad start, there's no neither like nor dislike.\n\nBut you wanted honesty, there it is :)\n\ngood luck in the future","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gnar","date":"2016-06-15T10:14:40.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The series can work really well, but I think you should talk more about the champs abilities than skins to be honest, the title mislead me as it said everything wrong with malz expecting to be a video on what makes him annoying but you really didn't deliverer that","replies":[]}]}
