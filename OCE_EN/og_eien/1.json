I think the teambuilder system is too complex, rather than trying to find people/teams of similar elo to fight it should just match anybody who is waiting with others of any rank, because if people are playing something they actually want to play they are going to do better unlike in blind pick where everybody likes to relax and experiment and just have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T00:28:03.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the idea of Team Captains should be scratched all together. The fact that there are two ways to enter the queue automatically increase the wait time by double (Captains cannot have games without solo queuers, and solo queuers cannot have games without captains). It creates this strange balance which must be maintained of people being Captains and people being solo queuers, even more so by the fact that you HAVE to be a Captain if you want to queue with anyone else (you cannot invite someone if you just want to queue up, even if you have no preference of where your team mates should be).\n\nTeambuilder can be improved drastically, to be a better tool for getting people together and creating a very positive atmosphere. At its current state, though, it does not achieve that, combined with the whacky mmr system it's using, I recommend not playing it at this moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2014-12-12T04:48:33.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the role of a captain needs to be revised. Something needs to be implemented where you can search for a game with your role and champ and join into people just like a normal blind pick. This leaves no room for those select 2 people who want duo top or jungles, but Riot has obviously already made the duo bot, single jungle the only viable option to use with randoms. I.e How jungle items/camp exp works and most support items are tailored to having one other person in your lane.\n\nThat being said I wouldn't mind picking a secondary champ and role to be put into account when searching for a match that comes second after searching for your primary, just for queue speed and pick diversity.","replies":[]}]}
