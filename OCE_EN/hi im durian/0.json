What is toxic, unsportsman behaviour? What is cruses? Does it still count if it&#039;s in another language? What is abusive behaviour? What is ban-able? Some players can constantly harass other for many games without getting banned, but in some cases, we see people getting banned from one game.\r\n\r\nToday, I have been experience worst type of people on League of Legends. And excuse me if I am pissed. In rank, situation can get difficult because each rank game is intense, and rank is a player social status. Therefore, I believe each player will try their best to grind. However, some player are very abusive. They will cruse your entire family if you do not gank their lane. They will wish your mom die from cancer if you don&#039;t give them red. Though, we had all experience this time to time. It does not seems like Riot is doing anything to punish these type of player.\r\n\r\nThe question we must ask. Is this worth to report someone if they shall not be penalised? How effective is the system? If a player cursed another in a different language can it be punishable? What is worst than queuing a rank game, and 4 different player harass you. They called you in names. Ready to intentionally feed. They all chat the other team to report (like the enemy care, but it does have an effect on you).\r\n\r\nAs a player, encountering this situation can be very frustrating. How can we deal with it? Report does not work. It really does not. Ask yourself, how many time had you reported someone, and they ended up being fine. What&#039;s worst, you can be matched with them for many game in a row\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is a great game. But toxic behaviour has been on a rise. Players have been very spoken about the issue. What is the response from Riot Games, and League of Legends developers?\r\n\r\nI shall take my leave here. \r\n\r\nToday, I have been matched with a Chinese booster and his friend, who for 3 games constantly harassed me and other players. In game 3, I response to them and I got banned. Whilst, the player*censored* is still prop harass other players. \r\nIf Riot does not ban toxic players then they are not supporting sportsmanship behaviour. They are encouraging players to be toxic. \r\nIf players figure using other languages beside English shall not be noticed by Riot System, they shall abuse it. \r\n\r\nWhat is Riot plans to deal with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-05T08:37:13.451+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red Flag if you type anything in English.
