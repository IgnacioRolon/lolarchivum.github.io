Don't forget, bans for the use of scripts/third party tools are handed down in waves so while you may continue to see these people in games don't think they're not going to be punished.\n\nIf you feel you need to submit further evidence regarding a cheater/exploiter, or you forget to report in the end-game, please feel free to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support and they will send the report along to the correct people. Note: You will not receive feedback on any punishment the player receives, so don't expect it.\n\n>Or does RIOT not care at all and just try to sugar coat how lazy they are and take no action?\n\nBelieve me, Riot does care and they're constantly working to ensure every player can have a great experience in this game, in fact there was a recent wave of bans that came down for use of illegal third party programs/scripts, as evidenced by the many threads made on the boards recently from people claiming they were wrongly banned.","replies":[{"poster":"coldesser","date":"2016-05-11T21:42:22.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's been over a week since these players have been constantly reported not only by me but by many other players because they continue to use these programs. They don't even attempt to pretend they don't have it. They use it as if it were legal. And to say they don't go unpunished? No action has been taken by RIOT. There is more frustration that no action is taken rather than the actual players using illegal 3rd party programs. They are relentless because they go unpunished.","replies":[]}]}]}
