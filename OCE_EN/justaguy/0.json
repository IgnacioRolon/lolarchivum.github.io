However this means the enemy is no longer runnign so team catches up and eats them.  Caitlyn does not get an assist.  \r\n\r\nConclusion: This does not exactly seem fair,  that is almost the definition of an assist?\r\n\r\nSuggestion:  Make assists work even if the spell / attack that hit the person did no damage (from things such as the hourglass), as you were obviously involved in the kill, you just forced the hourglass.  It doesn't matter if the guy shielded your hit or someone elses hit, you were both obviously involved in the kill so whichever of you doesn't get the KB should get an assist.  I can see similar things occuring for say morg putting a puddle down on an hourglassed person, causing them to have to flash/evade somehow the moment they become un-hourglassed, meaning they can't then use that to dodge the attack that kills them 2 seconds later.  The spell was hitting them while they were glassed to \"no effect\" .. except for the very point of an \"assist\".\r\n\r\nJust a thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-03T07:49:44.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, adding in this would be weird. Like, if you get an assist for a failed Cait ult you can argue that you maintained vision on them for some amount of time, and deserve an assist. Then we get people complaining like \"Well, I put a ward there, so give me an assist\" or people taking Clairvoyence to farm assists at random.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-01-03T07:09:07.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. In order to assist you need to assist with damage or CC.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-01-03T07:39:21.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Soraka gets global assists with her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2015-01-03T07:43:58.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except Soraka assisted by healing her ally.
