Thanks Aus Internet) But that&#039;s not what this is about.  I&#039;ve been chating on voice coms with some others so I know this isn&#039;t just me.  The menu UI for pre-game selection, handling loot/store/game creation seems to lag like CRAZY at the moment.  Accepting invites and having waits of up to 20-30 seconds before it puts you in the game for example.  This seems to be a thing that started about 80% of the way through season 7, and has only gotten MUCH worse with the season 8 changes.  \r\n\r\nIs my group of friends (spread across country/providers) alone in this or has RIOT Broken something?  It&#039;s making joining a game, or even checking missions etc painful.  Not to mention the 2-3 times it seems to have broken entirely and not allowed me to click on anything. (Had to re-start the client post-game when couldn&#039;t leave the post-game stats screen).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-26T05:04:30.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this is something that is inherently wrong with the client, and is nothing new.\n\nThe new client is just a chunk of shit, that was made to look shinier then the last piece of shit we had.","replies":[{"poster":"Justaguy","date":"2018-01-12T23:44:17.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for super-late reply . this had been going on pretty much the moment pre-season for 8 started.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RiotUsesBogosort","date":"2017-11-27T23:15:32.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did this just start happening in 7.23, or has it been going on for a while?
