NO I just wound up the only guy on my team with 3 bots vs 3 players and 2 bots cause the other guy on my team had some issues.  and it wouldn&#039;t let me surrender .. and while that&#039;s the worst EVERY GAME I&#039;ve had with aram and bots has been painful forme or the other guys. there are no good bot games cause bots FEED LIKE HELL in aram.  I&#039;d rather wait twice as long for a game. I have not heard a SINGLE good thing about bots in aram games.  They honestly destroy the format for most of us.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-02-03T20:58:53.682+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are all over ARAM.

I'm lvl 30 and see them often during the weekdays in ARAM and they usually don't get kills and intent feed.  Maybe it's the time of day u play vs. me?  They don't seem like Riot bots either... if so they need to program them more similar to their intermediate bots since I remember the game mode vs. bots that could turret hug etc...","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-02-04T00:39:56.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots in aram have been around for ages.
