That makes for a SUCKY game whoever wins.  If we could get some faster policing of these accounts, and possibly something like ip (or better mac address) bans on them would be VERY much appreciated.  These things are more destructive to a good game then gold farming was in WoW. cause gold-farmers just sold crap for real money, THESE guys make it impossible to have a fun game while they do it.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexandSam","date":"2017-10-18T07:42:50.819+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm fairly certain that this could be largely fixed with a small amount of effort.\nI had a few aram's this morning, got a bunch of bots in them, roughly 9 in two games.\nFine, so I reported them.
