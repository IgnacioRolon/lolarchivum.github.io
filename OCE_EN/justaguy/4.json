I&#039;ve even seen it on games where a team has lost the entire game, turned aorund and managed to win by the skin of their teeth, and team-mates on my side.. or the other, are saying &quot;ez&quot; on what was obviously NOT an easy game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not expecting this to accomplish much but if I raise awareness and even 2% of players go &quot;oh yeah, maybe I&#039;ll stop being a smacktard&quot;.

It's more the fact that it symbolises a complete lack of respect for the people you've just played a \"friendly\" game with.  Which itself is symbolic of a slowly devolving toxic player base. If at the end of a friendly footy match you walked up to the enemy team shook hands and said \"thanks for the game, god do you guys suck balls\".  You'd have a 50/50 chance of being laid out flat, by your own team.  And they sure wouldn't object if the other guy crushed your hand for the privilege.  But we excuse it in things like this because \"It's only a game\".  or \"it's nothing special\".  I think the way you don't see the horrible stuff happen is by not letting the little stuff slide without comment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JaimeeK","date":"2017-08-17T02:25:40.605+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to just report them, I mean if they're going to be a dick then you can do something about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-16T07:08:00.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Saying gg ez, is _technically_ a reportable offence.\nand certainly it's not nice to hear, from either side.\n\nBut personally, my philosophy is: There are so many terrible problems in the world, \nand \"gg ez\" is the very least of them!   So if you're getting uptight about 4 letters \nsome kid wrote... your life is not going to be very fun.  \n\nI for one, don't intend on wasting my life being uptight about someone else's insecurities.\n\nPeople _**should**_, be nice and sportsmanlike, but they're often not, thats how the world is, and dealing with that is our own responsibility. Not Riot's or our sports coach's or anyone else's.\n\n**You have to draw a line at hate-speech and bullying of course!** \nAnything less than that, isn't nice, but isn't worth getting upset over. \n\nAgreed, In a perfect world It shouldn't happen, and if I could solve the problem, id do so in a heartbeat!  But you have to pick your battles, and taking on every anonymous 12 year old on the planet, is not one I see as winnable.\n\nThat's just my view of course. But life is limited, and theres no need to spend that time being offended by someone you'll never meet, and couldn't care less about.\n\nYou physically can't control everyone's behaviour, but you can control your own.\nSo instead of making everyone else **say **what you want _(which is impossible)_, just only pay attention to the stuff you want to **hear**. It takes so much less effort and achieves virtually the same result.\n\nBut in terms of the summoners code, I believe Riot takes GG EZ fairly seriously as an insult, and wants people to report offenders.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-16T09:47:34.012+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but if you finish a football match with a handshake with the opponent team while following it up with a quick spit on their foot, I'm pretty sure something will come to your direction, punishments or hospital bills, doesn't matter.\n\nPeople are only spamming \"ggez\" because of the security from distant interactions through the internet cables.

After you've just gotten home from a long day at work/school/space-camp you log in to have some fun and relax, the last thing you want is to be more worked up over folks being dicks then you were before you sat down.  That's the kind of thing that makes folks generally unsatisfied with playing a game and walk away from it after awhile.  No-one wants to play games to be MORE stressed.  \n\nIt's the little things that often matter in this regard, losing sucks.  But if the guy on the other side says give you a smile, shakes your hand and you walk off together is still a gg, of he spits down on you and sinks in the boot while you're laying on the ground gasping for air.  You're going to start feeling homicidal.  It's the difference post-game (and I exaggerate slightly) between post-game drinks and post-game bloodshed.  \n\nNow however lets take this one step further, are you making a better world?  You have someone who's had a crap day/week, they come home login to relax/blow off steam and at the end they either feel better or worse.  If better they treat their wives/kids better.  If worse they are snappy and angry, take one border-line personality or abusive person, and you can make a bad situation worse.  Your \"gg ez\" could, quite literaly, result in some other arsehole gamers wife/kids lying bruised on the floor.\n\nIf for this, albeit rare, reason and nothing else I think it behoves us to be at least polite and civil.  Personally we Australians have always thought of ourselves as good sportsmen.  There might be some teasing and ribbing, like \"got you, nice try though\", but we don't pride ourselves on being malicious.
