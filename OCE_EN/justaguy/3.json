I have reset my password now and changed it, and am currently scanning the hell out of my computer for trojans etc,  The password was unique to this game.   Is there currently an issue with either the login server that could have caused this? Or an issue with compromised accounts that I should be aware of?\r\n\r\nOr did someone just hack my account because they hate me?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-11-24T04:27:50.440+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\n\nI'd recommend checking your emails for a previous password reset request (one recently that you did not initiate) as the only way for the password to be changed is if someone completes the forgot password process and this would require access to the email inbox assigned to your account. If this is the case then you may want to change your account email address.\n\nOtherwise it is too early to tell if someone else accessed your account so if you still have concerns then I'd recommend raising a support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Justaguy","date":"2014-11-24T05:46:16.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did both of that already, checked caps-lock while trying to login.  Also checked for previous password reset requests.  Also checked archived and deleted mails in case somehow it was my email that was compromised.  No go.  Scanning computer still but no hits on trojans/virus/hijacks to date.  If I don't find anything I'll chalk this up to \"hmm that was weird\" for a bit unless something else occurs.  But I figured I should put it out there incase I'm not the only one.  Thanks for getting back to me Gehirn","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-24T05:22:12.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you sure you didn't just have caps lock on? lol wouldn't be the 1st time!","replies":[]}]}
