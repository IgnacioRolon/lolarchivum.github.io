Then the game popped anyway and we went in. Finished the game, did not get credit for the first win of the day. But when I went to re-queue for anything got a &quot;cannot form lobby&quot; error message, no matter the game type.  I figured a logout/login might fix it.  Now I get an error message that I could not log into my account due to basically &quot;something being wrong&quot; (no duh!) I that certain game types were down (could see that in queueing) but there&#039;s nothing on server status about servers as a whole down.  I basically sit on &quot;Authenticating&quot; for forever when I try to login.  And then get that error message.  Anything up?\r\n\r\nIncidently the error message was &quot;An unexpected error occured while logging in.  Please try again.
