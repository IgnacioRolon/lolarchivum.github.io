I placed in a support ticket and provided screen shots of the game and my loot. Nothing has been done. I am seriously frustrated.\r\nI recently played a game on Thresh were I got S- I recieve notification for level 7 mastery token. THERE IS NO TOKEN IN LOOT! I have restarted client, put in support tickets and waited. As someone who played with 164ms (minimal) and 12fps majority of time (I understand this is my fault not riots for my pc) its frustrating to get an S. But when you get S+ or S- and apparently &quot;Receive Mastery lvl 6 &amp; 7 token&#039; and NOT ACTUALLY GET IT. Is quiet infuriating","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-07-06T17:15:42.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner, \n\nIf you hit mastery rank 5 in a game, you will not recieve a 6 token even if you do get an S rank.\n\nFor your thresh game, you are already M6 and will need an s/s+ rank to get an M7 token.\n\nCould you please include the screenshots you have?","replies":[{"poster":"EternalEntegrity","date":"2017-07-06T23:28:27.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/YCfBb < Thresh Game","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-07-07T02:53:55.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, so you needed an S or S+ on the thresh game, your S- would not have given you a token. \n\nAhri game was well done, although since you reached M5 in the same game it will not give you an M6 token.\n\nIt's ok though, you have proven you can get these types of scores and I believe you can again :)","replies":[{"poster":"EternalEntegrity","date":"2017-07-08T01:33:23.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for your help. The main reason that I was frustrated with this was because I receive two notifications pop up for the Ahri game \n1. Congratulations on reaching level 5 Mastery with Ahri\n2. Congratulations on earning level 6 token. (could this be a bug? because I can imagine if this happened to other people it would annoy them a bit aswell - going from Mastery 4 to 5 and earning an S and getting the Mastery 6 Token notification)\n\nThankyou for your help Yaimone","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-10T05:14:30.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been confused by this before because I only skimmed the notification and assumed I knew what it meant. The second notification isn't telling you that you received a token, rather it is telling you that you now are able to receive tokens. I definitely think there should be more clarity there though, I'm not the only one I know who has been confused by that, and I have heard of quite a few more here.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EternalEntegrity","date":"2017-07-06T23:31:20.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/607ZY  < Ahri Game","replies":[]}]}]}
