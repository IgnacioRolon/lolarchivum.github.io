What is it that us supports must do to that is deemed &#039;correct&#039;. If us supports have a salty ADC we get abused if we ks even if unintentional. If we roam most of the time we are blamed if the ADC makes a mistake. Or if we make a play that a team mate doesnt follow up on, which results in our death.... we once again are most likely to be abused. \r\n\r\nNow to the &#039;Off-meta Singed&#039;, honestly Riot what the hell. He counter-jungles at level one which puts the enemy jungler behind (this support the jungler) than the Singed comes to bot lane to assist his ADC, who if he is lucky isn&#039;t raging and salty asf (does this not support the ADC) key word SUPPORT! There is no rule saying Supports must support the ADC! But if someone didn&#039;t well than they are in deep shit.\r\n \r\nWhy must us supports  be forced to play the standard &quot;META&quot; builds/picks.

As long as I communicate what I am doing with my team (and they don't argue too much), all is good. \n\nIt becomes a problem if I completely disregard the typical laning dynamics, and leave lane at level 3 to go proxy a lane or counter jungle. It would most likely leave me behind in levels, my adc pushed under tower missing cs and likely getting killed. \n\nAs someone that also plays a decent amount of ADC, I know that it can be tilting as anything to play with an off meta pick. You get used to knowing what the traditional support's abilities are, and how you can interact with them to make laning phase go in your favour. You automatically assume the player to be there for you, and having the support away proxying a lane or counterjungling for an extended period of time (even just the first few minutes of laning phase) can easily screw your average ADC over.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-18T03:33:49.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> We can still do what we want, as long as we **comunicate with our team**.\n\nNone of you are still getting it through your thick heads that he informs his team every game what he is going to do he DOES COMMUNICATE","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-11-18T04:03:01.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Copy pasting a paragraph into champ select isn't communicating.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-18T04:36:05.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is still outlining his strategy what more does he need to say?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-11-18T04:58:52.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outlining his strategy is not communicating.

A lot of people would dodge, even after looking through your match history and seeing you with a ~50% win rate. \n\nPlayers, especially in ranked, don't like to deviate from the player determined meta that they are used to. They take any sort of deviation from the champion meta or laning dynamic as a troll thing to do and it tilts them, effectively ruining the ranked experience. That's why he was reported. Not because he was bad, but because they felt their experience was negatively impacted by his pick. This amounted to a large number of reports over a large number of games, something Riot couldn't just ignore.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-11-17T00:27:50.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support players should play who they want, as long as we arent stealing cs its all gooooood","replies":[]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-16T23:58:58.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True as.","replies":[]}]}
