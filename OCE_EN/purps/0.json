I just walk around the map and suddenly I freeze, the game says, &quot;Reconnecting&quot; except everything around me still goes normally. This is so annoying and I wanted to start ranked but if I keep freezing like this I won&#039;t be able to. My ping averages 35 and FPS is around 60-80. I have no idea what is going on and SOMEONE PLS HELP.\r\n\r\nP.S. I am on a Mac operating system so don&#039;t dog me it&#039;s a good computer. Don&#039;t say get a pc aswell.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-07T04:30:29.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For something like that, getting a PC probably won't change it. Unless it's a software conflict, in which case just getting another Mac might fix it.\n\nPoint is, you don't have to buy a new computer to play League.\n\nDo you have any firewalls or anti-virus installed?
