They just decide who you're matched against.\n\nBut anyway, the way it works is that it judges your estimated mmr based on those ten matches, and then places you a bit lower than that. If you had the estimated mmr of a bronze III player when you finished your placements, then you'd probably be placed into bronze V.\n\nWinning seven out of ten games seems like it would bring that result.","replies":[]}]}
