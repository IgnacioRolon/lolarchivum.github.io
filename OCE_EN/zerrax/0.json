If you had bothered to read either the TOU or EULA you'd know that consistent disconnections is the fault of the player. They specifically state that the player is responsible for ensuring their computer meets the hardware/software and connection requirements of the game and, since your computer continues to crash, it's completely your fault (based on the TOU and EULA).\n\n*\"But I never read the TOU and/or EULA\"*\nDoesn't matter. If you've agreed to them that's it, you've agreed to everything in them whether you know what's there or not (think of it like a contract). There's no denying that it's your fault since you've already admitted to that.\n\n> If not, how can my crashing problem be solved?\n\nAre you getting any error messages before your computer crashes or does it just go? If you are a google search with the error code should give you a few good ways to fix it. A scan using anti-virus software might be a good idea too (I use [malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/) for scans, it's free and effective), you never know what might have made it's way onto your computer. If you've tried a bunch of stuff and still don't know what to do then it might be time to take it to a professional and, if all else fails, you can try resetting it to factory default (make a back-up before this obviously).","replies":[]}]}
