Your gains and losses are based on your MMR, so if you cant climb out because of that, the system doesn't think you deserve to be in your current division. On top of that, if you can climb out of your current ELO, being in higher ELOs will be even more difficult for you to win. Despite common belief, there's a huge difference between, say, Plat V skill and Plat I skill. The best way to climb is to better yourself as a player, don't rely on others to carry you, or else you will be in an ELO where you don't belong.","replies":[{"poster":"Stormmmmmm","date":"2016-05-20T14:15:42.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"excuse me but i was plat 2 last season and plat 1 in my country so i don't see any reason i shouldn't be in there this season or just because i lose too much cos of toxic people blame each other and afk then that's fine i'll just have to play my gold clean account to get up then.
