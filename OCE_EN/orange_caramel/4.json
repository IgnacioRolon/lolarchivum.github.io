I&#039;ve tried both, numerous times. Especially with thunderlords, all you need is a large rod -&gt; rabadon and you can qrwb &gt;50% hp, then do it once more.

Diana does have great assassination potential, but some players like myself would prefer to strengthen the lulls in her fighting pattern rather than all in on having to delete a squishy and dying, which also requires hitting a skillshot on a medium cooldown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-03-07T00:47:32.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana's build after lore changes: {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"0279","date":"2016-03-06T23:27:15.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-03-04T13:46:10.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer Lichbane","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-04T05:20:17.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive scales greatly with {{item:3115}}, usually you would see it on Jungle Diana but i guess Top/Mid could work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2016-03-04T02:58:27.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say, the 80ap is gr8.

Different items compliment her kit in different ways.\n\nOh and as Essembie said, Rabadon's first isn't that great, early game you'll get the same amount of burst from Diana with a Ludens/Runic/Hourglass/Nashor as you do from Rabadon's but the other items will give you more utility stats making them more valuable early game.\nFor Rabadon's most champions should aim for it roughly mid to late game, possibly the only exception here would be Veigar who can get a Chalice/Tear first back then rush a Rabadon's and figure his build out from there.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-04T00:41:56.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Farm?
