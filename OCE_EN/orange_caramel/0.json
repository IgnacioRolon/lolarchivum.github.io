Yes you should be rewarded for killing them with that skill level.\n\nNow, looking at the flip side, let's say you have 100 health left and the enemy is going B, but they also have 100 health, in the right situation you know you can flash in and get a free kill and not give any reward to the enemy, should you also be rewarded for this? Yes of course, but you already do, your reward is the death of the enemy, more gold for you and possibly more gold for your team also, plus you get the reward of not dying to the enemy and giving them a kill.\n\nYou need to look at the reward as more than just \"Don't let me lose stacks\", but think outside the square, by not dying to the enemy means you are not rewarding them with a kill and while you lose stacks you need to weigh up the situation, is it better to get the kill or keep your stacks?","replies":[]}]}
