We definitely need a top laner and possibly a mid laner. \r\n\r\nPlease post your position / rank / age / playing times if you are interested so we can find a suitable teammate. \r\n\r\nAbove all we want people who are chill but competitive. We all want to do our best but we&rsquo;re not pros so we make mistakes - don&rsquo;t want to get flamed for it. \r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"RRBS","date":"2018-04-22T09:22:27.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not top/g4/21/varied","replies":[]},{"poster":"Loois","date":"2018-04-18T23:34:45.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top or Mid/ Gold 1/ 17","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2018-04-18T08:39:31.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle/top/sup - G1 Soloq - p5 flex - 22 - varied times","replies":[]},{"poster":"girl poop tasty","date":"2018-04-15T15:41:03.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC Main, but can Top/Mid if needed. 18y/o, Plat 3 atm","replies":[]}]}
