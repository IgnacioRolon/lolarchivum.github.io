As I use a gmail account. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t change my email/access the email that explains my behaviour so any information as to how I should get my account back would be great. \r\n\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-06-21T14:02:50.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like your account got hijacked. \nContact support via support.riotgames.com you will need to prove you own the account but they should be able to return it and unban it.
