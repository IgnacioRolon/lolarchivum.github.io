Your quite addicted to the baron pit camera panning get up, i suggest you cut back on it just a tad. Like yeah cool circling on vaynes model on a vayne clip thats what i came for.\n\n- Why is half the screen cut off with black bars???. nearly all of the hud is gone and the top half of the screen too. feel like im watching a vcr or some shit. Please either render it to a different resolution or edit this aspect differently. \n\n- That random ass music change halfway through was completely out of the blue and a massive boner kill. \n\ni know its a short montage but yeah, nearly a quarter of your video was your intro alone. just tips for the future my man :)\n\nEDIT: just saw this was three months ago lmao. regardless, i can see from your most recent video your editing skills have improved. just keep these points in mind","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juked","date":"2016-06-03T10:45:26.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really enjoyed this good first montage","replies":[{"poster":"RlEL ","date":"2016-09-10T02:16:03.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty ty :*","replies":[]}]}]}
