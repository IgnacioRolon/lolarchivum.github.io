I have been finding it difficult to improve as my opponents do not punish me for any mistakes I may be making forcing me to focus on things like reflexive or knowledge based elements to the game to improve rather than positioning/Decision making. I wish to join a ranked team of primarily diamonds if at all possible to help me to achieve this. I main Janna as I struggle to find any reason to play anything else, other than that I play a lot of thresh, a little of Braum and a little of Annie. I can also play Morgana and Leona if need be however I may be a little under-practiced on them initially. I pride myself on my mind set and ability to take criticism and hope that I can find some like minded individuals to grow with.","replies":[]}
