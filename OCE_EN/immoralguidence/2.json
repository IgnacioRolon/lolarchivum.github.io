So twice now I have been demoted on my first game on 0 points. The first time I got demoted from plat 2 to plat 3, I hit 0 points, won a game and then lost 2. I figured that when I hit 0 points it triggered a best of three, losing two games whilst only winning one so I understood. However I just got demoted without that best of three. I was on 22 points, lost a game and dropped to 9 points. I then lost two more getting demoted. If the best of three mechanic were the case then it would have started when I was on 9 points instead of 0. Even if i were to win my next three then the best case scenario would be 0 points however there is no guarantee that I would get 15 points on my first win to hit promotional series. Any information that may help me would be great, my account is more than 20 games positive and I gain considerably more points than I lose most of the time so I doubt mmr is the issue. Any information would be appreciated. Thank you.\r\n\r\n- ImmoralGuidence.","replies":[{"poster":"ImmoralGuidence","date":"2015-07-18T14:36:22.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt do the math right I needed 25 and got 21. I'm just wondering if this is normal because it hardly seems fair to need 4 wins to make up for 1 loss.","replies":[]}]}
