The 1st game I babysat her and she did great. Next I told her to play some intermediate bots while I was gone. So she did. AND TWO GAMES IN A ROW SHE GOT FEEDERS. **IN BOTS.** I&#039;m not sure if they were trolling or just somehow feeding bots. It pissed me off because it was hard for her to learn, hard for her to pull off combos and late game hard for her to even just cs. The bots were too fed and even started towerdiving just to kill them. She sent me these two screenshots. Sorry for the rant but I just had to get it out there.\r\n\r\nGame 1: http://imgur.com/a/O0Y9m\r\n\r\nGame 2: http://imgur.com/a/kWte4\r\n\r\n(Bonus) Game where I babysat: http://imgur.com/a/ySftv","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-10-29T10:04:17.586+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is an extremely common occurrence in AI games, anyone who plays them with any sort of regularity has experienced a game where it's 2v5 or 1v5 because the rest of your team is bot accounts being leveled to 30 and sold (because apparently getting to 30 is difficult somehow).\n\nJust gotta take it as it comes, if anything it's good experience on how to play when behind, which is something she won't experience if it's a legit 5v5.","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-10-29T11:04:07.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!

My recommendation would be to try get a team of 3-4 and take her into norms. \n\nIf you lvl too far on bots you tend to develop bad habits (that are fine and dandy for bots but don't work out in PvP) anyway so I wouldn't recommend her playing bots past lvl 10 anyway. \n\nIf you like you can add me and I'll play on my second account with her/you guys sometime when I'm free (which unfortunately isn't that often, but the offer stands).","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-10-29T21:44:35.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, Thanks for the recommendation. I've started going to games with her with a lot more people recently and it has been great. But I have also introduced her to normals and she seems to be fine coping with that. \nStats (in case you were wondering):\n7/8/12 Katarina 104 cs\n4/7/2 Katarina 77 cs\n18/5/10 Annie 69 cs\nI've noticed this decrease in cs.

It'll give her the chance to focus on her farm a little more in games where her laner is more passive.","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-10-30T11:52:36.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now she seems pretty dedicated to the game so I'll be sure to forward this message to her.\nP.S why is your name green and what does it mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-30T14:51:28.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Glad to see someone new getting into the game :)\n\nThis is why my name is green and what it means: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Edu7E6Bp-introducing-the-emissaries","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-10-31T03:28:27.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like fun.

Alternatively just inform your friend to queue up with any real players they find and form a 5man bot grinding party. \n\nAlternatively play norms for even worse teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T14:13:13.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They aren't ignored so much as the vast quantity of them makes them difficult to stop. Botted accounts are banned in waves, same way 3rd party bans are done, but it's super easy to make a new account, so catching them all is pretty much impossible.

Most of the 'budget' grinder bots just buy boots of speed, no pots and run down midlane.\n\nI know people could make better bots to counter this but at a bare minimum; the feeder bots won't be as hard to carry. I had a game a fair while back where I played janna against ai to try to learn her, I had 4 feederbots and it was so embarassing to be lvl30 and just get destroyed by a bunch of bots.\n\nEveryone always says the same thing 'they're banned in waves' and I've reported and then checked up on the bot account weeks later and they're still farming ip to unlock everything and they're still lvling up and they're still feeding. Nobody hits lvl30 and still goes 0-15-0 with 8cs over a 20min game against intermediate bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-30T07:21:04.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a pretty smart way to go about it certainly. I can't really see any problems with a system like that and it would as you say get rid of the basic bots out there. Maybe it would be worth submitting that on the NA boards as a suggestion?\n\nI'm afraid there isn't much more that I can give you. I assure you the bots are being banned, but as you say the waves mean they'll be sticking around for a while before they do finally get banned. It's a frustrating issue certainly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-10-29T13:17:41.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually having brain-dead team mates is probably ideal preparation for playing norms","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"oPuredo","date":"2016-10-28T22:19:14.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you seriously complaining about farm bots feeding?\nLol.","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-10-29T11:03:11.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Just found about this farm bots thingy.
