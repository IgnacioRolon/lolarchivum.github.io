This is my first time trying this so please be nice and provide constructive criticism. I got bored and thought &quot;why not try make a champion riot will probably never make, but it will still be fun&quot;. So here it is!  \nAis &ndash; Champion creation title (TBC): Ice tank\n \nBase stats:\nHealth: 595.25 (+100.2)\nHealth Regen: 7 (+0.75)\nResource: Ice shards (refer to passive and ult for more information)\nMelee: 170\nAttack damage: 60 (+4.7)\nAttack speed: 0.620 (+3%)\nArmor: 25.34 (+3.8)\nMagic resist: 32.1 (+1.25)\nMovement speed: 320\n \nPassive: Ice shards           \t                                                                                Cooldown: 25 (CDR effects cd)\nEvery 25 seconds Ais' auto attacks deal double damage. If Ais kills a minion/monster/champion with the passive, the target drops an ice shard. (can carry only 6 ice shards)\n \nQ: Ais Leash         \t Range: 800                                                          Cooldown: 13/12/11/10/9\nAis fires an ice leash in the form of a projectile. If the projectile hits an opponent the ice leash drains 25 health per second from its target. At any point during the duration Ais may activate the q again to pull herself towards the target, this stops Ais from gaining anymore health but continues damaging the opponent.\nDuration of leash: 4/5/6/7/8\n\nW: Frozen Well  (Ty EzeBlood for partial help)                                                                   Cooldown: 15\nAis creates a small circle around her with the radius of 1 Teemo height. If any projectiles hit an ally inside of the circle it  deals damage equal to (%AP) + 20% of damage taken over the duration of the channel in a small area around her. \nDuration of channel: 2/3/4/5/6\n(Side note: I think this is great for team fighting, considering she is a tank)\n\nE: One left unfrozen                                        \t                             Cooldown:15/14/13/12/11\nAis creates a circle with the diameter of 775 around her. Everything within the circle becomes slowed by 25%. EVERYTHING! This includes ally champions and minions. The only one not frozen is Ais.\nDuration of slow: 2/2.5/3/3.5/4\n \nR: Ais Prison            Cost: 5 ice shards                                                    Cooldown: none \nAis creates a circle wall with the diameter of 800 around her. The walls close in on him at a rapid pace dragging along enemy champions. Once the wall touches Ais it collapses dealing damage to enemy champions inside of it. (champions are unable to flash inside of the wall)\nDuration of wall closing in: 1.5 seconds\nDamage: 250/500/750\n\nLore (Ty Ezeblood):\nIn the darkness that held power before the Rune Wars, an ancient race of demonic beings held the great powers of nature. Blood, Air, Fire, Earth, and Ice. These were the five great powers controlled by the Darkin. When the rune wars broke out, many years after the Darkin civilisation had fallen, there were but 5 Darkin left. Aatrox, the Blood wielder revealed himself first. Appearing in various important battles throughout Runeterran history, it soon became known that the Darkin were powerful, archaic beings. Now, Ais awakens from her frozen slumber, ready to return the great power of Ice to Runeterra.\n\nThe feel for Ais:\nTo be honest, Ais isn't going to feel good for everyone. I want people to have fun by being outgoing and going all out as Ais. Jumping in with your q, flashing into your ult for team plays and overall being brave and confident in your plays. I don't mean any offence to anyone but thats how I'd like her to be played.\n\nCounter play:\nTo be honest I don't think I should be providing this because im only level 28 but ok, \n- Try to bait out her ult first and then collapsing onto her team. Same with E\n- During laning phase she wont be that strong considering her only damage would be coming from her q (or w if   in lane with another champion) so use this to you advantage by bullying her and snowballing her during laning phase\n- Don't target her in team fights I guess. lol.\n\nIf you have any other counter play please just tell me so I can add it (I will give credit)\n\nThanks to whoever reads this <3","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-01T21:38:17.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is great, looks like you've put lots of thought into it! I do have some feedback, hopefully it is useful to you :)\n\nFirst off, that E sounds _really strong_. It sounds like a Bard ulti, except with a fraction of the cooldown! Maybe it could be a frosty slow instead of a stun? Imagine how easy it would be to cancel a teammate's crucial combo if you could stun them on an 11 second CD haha\n\nOther than that, the passive, Q and W sound like an off-tank/bruiser's kit. Not necessarily a bad thing, just that they seem more damage oriented rather than tank based. One thing to consider when designing a champion/their kit is the overall fantasy and theme of the champ. I think you've got this working well with the general idea of the E - as in, everyone else is affected by the ice except Ais. However, for the Q and E I can't see this thematic coming through in the same way. At the same time, you've got to be close not to run Ais's kit too closely to Sejuani's, lol.\n\nIn general though, great work - keep it up!","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-09-01T21:51:49.536+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow!

Seriously, team would just wait for her to stun, that's literally an instant ekko stun (stronger than old, in length, size and cast time). Or she assists enemies and e her own team... Or accidentally presses e instead of w in a fight\n\nAlso. Does this champion change gender or something? its female at start and male at end.\n\n____\n\nI would say making him/her(you kinda jumped with this one) a frozen watcher would honestly be better than a darkin, seeing as they were actually said to be just a warrior race, not elemental masters. The motive of that lore sounds more like a watcher than anything. Plus there has been foreshadowing of a frozen watcher finally awakening.\n\n____\n\nEdit: Then I realise...

The E is counter productive since it also slows allies, but the actual usefulness or uniqueness of the ability besides affecting allies is questionable. The Q is a pretty basic gap closer with laughable damage. Also I feel the passive could help make them more unique and 25 seconds is probly too big a cooldown. The ult is awesome, but I don't think they'd be very effective. The lore and stuff is really cool though, I think the kit is just meh however.","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-09-10T13:51:30.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dmg from q is mainly supposed to be used as an early game poke even though it has little damage (which I have now changed to 25) but later in the game its supposed to be a gap closer. In my mind if e is used properly it can be really useful, basically she can go in first slow and then her teammates can follow up, the w only affects people who are inside the radius when its casted. Also the passive as stated can be reduced by cdr, if you still disagree i can lower the cd because i'd like to do whatever is best for the community and the reviewers <3. If this is confusing just let me know. Thanks for the feedback <3.
