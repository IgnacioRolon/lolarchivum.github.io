This is, as you can imagine, very frustrating as it can often take more than 10 minutes just to get to the password screen. Is anyone else having this problem or anyone had this problem and knows a fix? \r\n\r\nIn windows 7 task manager it says that all 3 programs are open yet as you can see down the bottom there is no LoL icon open as you can see here http://prntscr.com/6njonm. \r\n\r\nTried and failed solutions :\r\n-Run as administrator\r\n-Repaired client\r\n-Fully un-installed and re-installed league.\r\n\r\nAny and all help is appreciated.\r\nChilly.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T11:30:42.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any firewalls/anti-virus installed and running?

And you're on Windows.\n\nGo to your Internet Settings and makes sure there's nothing outrageous that's preventing an online executable from running. It should be obvious.\n\nTry disabling UAC. This can be accessed from the Control Panel.\n\nSync your internal clock to an internet source.\n\nAnd lastly, if none of the above worked, [change your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5).\n\nIf all that fails, triple check that nothing is blocking the application or otherwise causing it not to execute on your computer (overzealous download manager perhaps) and then try looking over [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).\n\nIf none of that works, then you're probably out of luck, aside from reinstalling Windows again. You can make a support ticket about it, but they'll more or less just ask for logs and rephrase the support page itself.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Hunted xiii","date":"2015-04-09T12:47:32.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried all that...
