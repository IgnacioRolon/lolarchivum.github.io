I recently got banned, had a bad game and flamed a lil bit.\n\n\nLooking at my &quot;This is what you said to get banned&quot; thing. I think the ban was completely unnecessary. I&#039;ll post what was said, and for me to get banned because of this? Seems a little odd. And its only 1 games logs that are reported. I was in the reform period and only 1 bad game which i flamed that caused the ban?   Also linked the print screen of the box. It was only 1 game reported and that triggered a ban. \nHeres what i said in the ONE game:\n\nGame 1\nLuxium: bot with ryze\nLuxium: Garen is only chance you have\nLuxium: Suckit\nLuxium: wanna swap\nLuxium: Can you not see bot\nLuxium: may as well afk\nLuxium: cant do anything\nLuxium: cyas at 15\nLuxium: need lv 2 tho\nLuxium: someone help bot\nLuxium: Since no one is helping bot, game is over in about 5 mins\nLuxium: i said help bot or its over\nLuxium: but you&#039;re not doing anything\nLuxium: Cant do anything\nLuxium: you ignorant fuck\nLuxium: i called top\nLuxium: and you went top\nLuxium: dumb twat\nLuxium: no\nLuxium: im letting the game end\nLuxium: i want the game to end\nLuxium: cause i said\nLuxium: %%%got\nLuxium: you&#039;re trash\nLuxium: we cant do anything\nLuxium: complain more\nLuxium: cant do anything\nLuxium: complain more\nLuxium: they out range us\nLuxium: not once did i say i was good\nLuxium: Cant beat a lane that out ranges me\nLuxium: He&#039;s been salty all game, lmao\nLuxium: no he doesnt\nLuxium: no we cant\nLuxium: have you seen TF Q range\nLuxium: have you seen Maokai sappling range\nLuxium: idiot\nLuxium: im carrying\nLuxium: cry more\nLuxium: no\nLuxium: Report Viktor constant verbal abuse please\nLuxium: I tried to carry this team and all viktor can do is be salty\nLuxium: Silences and constant lock up. fear\nLuxium: You&#039;re feeding.
