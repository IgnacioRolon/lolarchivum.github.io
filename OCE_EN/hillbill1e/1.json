Ever since then I have been getting these massive lag spikes randomly occurring. I am usually on 40 ping and sometimes i will spend 5-10 minutes fluctuating between 150 and 700 ping, other times the ping will jump to 9k and stay there, causing me to lose games or be kicked for afk etc etc. This has been happening for 4 days now and I have no idea why. I can use an ethernet cable, Im on a uni hall wifi and the ethernet ports have the LoL servers blocked. Its not the wifi, people on the floor have no issues and have a constant 40 ping and I had no issue at all before I sent my laptop away for repairs. Can someone please help me. Ive lost my promos twice because of this and have been put into low priority queue twice for this also.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-07T10:41:35.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried to see if any new softwares/drivers were installed on it?
