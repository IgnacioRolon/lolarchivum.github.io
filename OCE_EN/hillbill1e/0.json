One was win 8.1 and one 7.\nthe same day i upgraded the 8.1 to windows 10 it started having (and ONLY the windows 10 pc) connection issues to PVP.net (also, my internet was being really funky about ping, shooting into the thousands for both of us, probably in hindsight it was windows update doing its thing)\n\ngames played fine, so long as we could find a match quickly, and pick the champs before dropouts (internet still worked on both PC's and only the windows 10 machine was d/c'ing) so it seems like a front end issue\n\ni upgraded the other PC to windows 10 today, and the first thing that happened in LOL was a \"you have been disconnected to PVP.net \"\n\nso it looks like its only a front end problem, and only with windows 10.\n\ni've turned off IPV6 on my router, and so far its been 30 min without a DC for both pc's (they are just sitting on front screen while i get some food prepared.","replies":[{"poster":"DannyDingBat14","date":"2016-05-02T21:03:55.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not a windows 10 only problem i have windows 7 and when i first started playing LOL the disconnected from pvp.net popped up when i looked up how to turn off ip helper it stopped","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"irDrue","date":"2015-07-31T19:45:23.782+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I found something that fixed mine. I upgraded to Windows 10 and I got the exact same problem. Every few seconds I would disconnect. Well I did some research and found out Windows 10 download IP Helper on the computer and that interferes with LoL connection. So, to fix this little problem....\n\nGo to your search bar, should be on the bottom with the Windows 10 update and search for SERVICES. Scroll down to find IP Helper (Click NAME to put in alphabetical order) and right click IP Helper and click stop. Restart your League client and everything should be fine. \n\nJust a reminder, when you shut off or restart your computer IP Helper will be turned back on so just remember to turn it off every time. Hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"hillbill1e","date":"2015-08-01T00:51:15.927+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to Windows 10, reenabling everything you disabled just to mess with you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charlemagne927","date":"2015-08-06T22:42:06.199+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks - I just tried this and hope it helps. will let you know.
