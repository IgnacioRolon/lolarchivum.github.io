You can see the notes and reasoning [here](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-815-notes#patch-items). Basic reasoning seems to be that 3 potions allowed supports to mitigate too much poke and trade damage in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-08-28T15:45:28.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thus encouraging mage supports who can bully poor little braum and thresh and alistar and other legitimate supports thus making the support role just a street fighter role and thus making adc's feel like shit.\n\nI mean unless what you were going for was to encourage mage supports and making other supports pretty much just as helpless as their adc. Then by all means good job.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-29T01:43:44.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enchanters handle mage supports pretty reliably (not considering the skill matchup), and mage supports do swing into the meta every now and again, so if you aren't familiar with Enchanters maybe it's worth picking one up!\n\nLulu is always a good, versatile and safe pick, she can play a lane pretty much any way you like comfortably. She can poke as well as most mage support (just at a shorter range), has top tier damage mitigation, a good kit for aggressive plays and is a hard counter to most assassins. Unfortunately this also means she will often be banned or picked early, and lacks true sustain, so someone like Nami or Janna is a good backup.\n\nIt's true tank supports don't do well against mages, and that when mage supps aren't in the meta tank supps are a pretty universally safe pick, but diversity in your champ pool hurts no-one. Saying traditional supports are helpless against mages imo just isn't true, it's just another matchup of the support role you have to learn to play and play against.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Im Scizor","date":"2018-08-29T10:55:55.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah Ok","replies":[]},{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-08-29T04:45:38.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, yes.\n\nHowever, as a Support you'll most likely be using an Inspiration path (either Primary or Secondary).
