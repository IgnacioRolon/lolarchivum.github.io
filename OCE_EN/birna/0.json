My friends and i think the reason for this is because last season i got banned so i didnt get season rewards nor borders and they think the system recognise me as Silver or Bronze, idk if this is the real answer or a bug but i hope i get a solution asap. \r\nThanks\r\n\r\nTLDR; cant duo with friends apparently even though i was gold and they were plat last season","replies":[{"poster":"Birna","date":"2016-01-23T08:25:35.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shard","date":"2016-01-21T14:02:09.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump, experiencing this aswell, so frustrating","replies":[]},{"poster":"Milky","date":"2016-01-21T09:37:58.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issue.
