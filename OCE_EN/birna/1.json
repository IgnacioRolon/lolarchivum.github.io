My friends and I are trying to get Plat for ranked teams and we were in promo, we just finished a game with a win and therefore we were 1-1 with promos, meaning 2more wins and we get plat for ranked teams, but due to the server hops we could not play ranked for awhile and everyone had been off by then, friday nights were our peak and throughout the weekend wehave our own individual activities. Im wondering may Riot extend the end of season 5 for 7more days\r\n\r\nThanks - League player who wants to get plat with his team","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-07T11:55:35.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're not going to extend the season cause 1 server had a few issues.\nyou still have a few days anyway so if you're that desperate get it tomorrow","replies":[]}]}
