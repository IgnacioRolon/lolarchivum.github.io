For many many years now forums have been working the same way because it is the most logical way.\r\nnewest threads are at the top of the board while newest posts are at the bottom.\r\nThis means you can see the newest or most recently replied to thread at the top while when you go into a thread you can actualy read the thread as a discusion from top to bottom not via popularity score.\r\nSure you say these are just options right? While they do seem forced apon you by a stupid system that demands it be your starting default it is changeable right?\r\nWell not so much, inside threads you have the option of most popular to least popular or you can read from the bottom up like some sort of deslexic Chinese person.","replies":[]}
