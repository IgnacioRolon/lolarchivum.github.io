Club A with up to 50 members vs club B with up to 50 members (with riot possibly increasing in the future)\r\nChatrooms which used to be full of people have fallen into a state of melancholic silence and clubs seem to be attracting groups of people so small that they are more of a standard friends list than that of a social club.\r\n\r\nWhy are there no big clubs and why are they not fighting it out against each other? \r\nI realize there is not formal &quot;club war&quot; type system but many games in the past only developed that type of system after people playing them made their own informal ones and they saw a need.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-06-13T02:57:56.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well its so hard to even know of a clubs existence until u see a tag in a game, or even get into one u may like other than the odd forum recruiter. theres no real way to view them at all or compare or anything. it hurts it. and if u wanna talk to a friend u just use private chat","replies":[{"poster":"SnuggleOSaur","date":"2016-06-13T09:22:57.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you believe that track-ability and some sort of listing of groups would improve the camaraderie of the club system?\nIt would at least make somewhere to rank your club vs others even with limited functionality like displaying number of members.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-07-03T13:49:59.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i do, not saying it would fix the problem but it would certainly improve it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SuperEccles","date":"2016-06-12T07:25:13.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clubs are less of a social group and more of finding at least 4 other people so you can all have a rude word at the end of your name.","replies":[{"poster":"SnuggleOSaur","date":"2016-06-12T08:17:34.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the way it's playing out but that is not the intention for it or what it could be lived up to being.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scuxxx","date":"2016-06-15T11:52:57.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont forget the 420 tags in any various way","replies":[]}]}]}
