I&#039;d landed into champion select and I got mid. Our Bot wanted to swap roles with me, and me being the {{champion:202}}  fanatic I am, I happily obliged. He highlighted {{champion:157}} , and the bans started. It was our 2nd ban, when our support decided to ban {{champion:157}} . His name is *NAME REMOVED*. He said &quot;Thrash yasuo, silver yasuo.&quot; To which I spammed &quot;Why did you do that.&quot; Turns out, our {{champion:157}}  was a one-trick, while you were in school studying, he was mastering the blade.  *NAME REMOVED*, our support, then locked in Master Yi, took {{summoner:14}}  and {{summoner:12}}  and kept flaming. This was all before we had loaded in. \n\n**I dodged. **\n\nWho wouldn&#039;t? Why did he? What was the- AHHH.{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} HHRGHGHHG  It frustrates me so much. Its the one problem I&#039;ve had with this game. I&#039;m very passionate, I really believe my team can win every game with the right mindset, and as long as we&#039;re working together. But it seems that&#039;s not the case. Some people don&#039;t believe. Some people don&#039;t have the passion. And it would be the number two reason as to why I&#039;m stuck in gold 5. (Number 1 being; I&#039;m bad at the game) Worst thing is, none of this was accident. It was intentional, someone decided to ruin 4 other people&#039;s afternoon. But hey, _welcome to OCE_ :^) \n\n\nThanks for listening to me complain.","replies":[{"poster":"Trankil","date":"2017-02-22T02:57:54.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo can i play with you :), dunno if i am gold but i am not in bronze right now xd","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirGrugglesworth","date":"2017-02-21T06:45:12.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not many people actually 'troll'\n\npeople just use it as an excuse to be shit because they got outplayed and can't accept the fact.","replies":[]}]}
