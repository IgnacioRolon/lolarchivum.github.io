When and how does it happen (does it start to do something but then fail? Does nothing happen at all? Does it give you any error messages?) \n1. Does it happen every single time? Most?\n1. When did the issue start? (Was it after a patch or an OS update? Just a random day? After a restart?)\n\nYour setup:\n\n1. Windows or Mac? \n2. What version OS?\n1. Do you have the normal login or the new one that is being rolled out to some people?\n3. Have you had any issues with any other programs in this time?\n\nFixes you've tried already:\n\n1. Did you clean reinstall through the Hextech Repair Tool, was it a regular old add/remove programs uninstall, or did you just delete your game folder?\n2. While it seems safe to assume you mean GPU drivers, in case it wasn't, have you updated those?\n\nYou should include the answers to all of that in your ticket since it will save them and you the time of them having to write back and ask.","replies":[]}]}
