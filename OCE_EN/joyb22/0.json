I was confused at first on how since I haven't played in quite a while so I decided to login to the discussion board of league to see if my account would login from there. When I looked into my game history I saw that there were ranked games (a game mode I never play at all or at any competitive level) being played. I want to start playing back on my account because it took be ages since 2015 to build such a solid account with skins and champions and all but can't since it's permanently banned. I was wondering is it possible to recover the account even though the actions were due to someone hacking my account??? Would really appreciate the insight! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-04T03:12:23.898+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to what HeartVine has said it's worth noting that there's a high volume of tickets at the moment (likely because of TFT) that are slowing down the process. Tickets for compromised accounts take a lot more investigation and are slower to process, so please be patient.","replies":[{"poster":"Joyb22","date":"2019-07-05T05:19:09.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that's understandable. I've heard some cases where they don't even consider recovering the account because they might think that the original user had done the punishable actions which is kind of my worry too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-05T09:43:08.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't do the thing, normally the only reason that would disqualify you from recovery is if you share or have shared your account. As soon as account sharing comes into the mix you lose a lot of the protections a secure account has.\n\nIt is of course up to support's discretion, for example, if you've been compromised multiple times that may also disqualify you from further recoveries. That kind of thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Joyb22","date":"2019-07-06T02:41:18.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay yeah I haven't shared my account so hopefully they would consider the recovery of my account.

They'll go through the process with you, which will include a series of questions relating to the account to verify you're the original user. You wont have to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt (any info not accessible through Riot or 3rd party services will also help with that). If they're able to verify you're the original account user, they should be able to track down the compromise and remove any punishments that triggered off that.\n\nI'd recommend running an anti-virus scan on any personal computers you have used recently, just to be sure (probably wont reveal anything, but wont hurt either), as well as looking into any important accounts (emails, banks etc) just to make sure they're secure and aren't being affected by the same or similar compromises. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a great way to help track down compromises, so checking that out might be a good idea as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Joyb22","date":"2019-07-05T05:15:37.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!!

Waiting for someone to respond to my ticket. I looked at the recover account form and I made this account before you had to even verify email so I just used a temporary address I can't remember, don't think I will be able to get it back.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-07-05T04:39:44.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First things first, you'll definitely want to try and deal with the compromise. I don't think you'll *need* to access the original email during that, as you should be able to communicate through the address you've used for this case while dealing with the issue (and you should be able to verify yourself as the original account user without original the email). Running an anti-virus scan on any personal computers, checking any important accounts and checking out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ can be a good way to ensure the compromise is not a widespread issue for you.\n\nSo far as dealing with the email issue, you can attempt to get that changed by contacting https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new (use the \"Account management, data requests, or deletion\" option), and hopefully they'll be able to get that changed for you without too much fuss. Again, though, probably best to try and deal with the compromise first, just to make sure no one else is able to access the account.","replies":[]}]}]}
