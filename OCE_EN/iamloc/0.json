Does anyone know how to fix this?~~\n\nEdit: I asked my brother about it and he experienced this before and helped me fix my problem. The DNS method works where you go to your network settings and go to properties of the internet protocol version 4. Then you press - use the following DNS address : 8 . 8 . 8 . 8 (didnt need to do the other alternate like everybody else). I applied these settings and run the client and it worked. \nHope it works for you too.\n\nEdit 2: The above lets me load the client but the error pops up again when I'm patching at 33%. I followed this thread \n[(http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/53Af63zR-unspecified-error-occurred-please-check-the-logs-for-more-information)] which is just the above but doing 8.8.4.4 then the next line as 8.8.8.8. Have a read of it and hope it helps. I'm  currently still patching it cause I was afk and didn't notice the error till now.","replies":[]}]}
