I know that if you leave during a game you&rsquo;ll be punished. But it isn&rsquo;t my fault my internet stopped working - I don&rsquo;t even know why it stopped working. I don&rsquo;t want to get punished just because my internet stopped working (keep in mind the game I was in was a normal, not ranked).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-01-04T19:28:59.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, the LeaverBuster system is designed to make *some* allowance for unintentional leaves (everyone experiences them from time to time, after all). So long as you're not leaving or being disconnected from games too often, you wont see any punishment from it (one game shouldn't do anything, for example). That said, Riot also can't allow consistent leavers to go unpunished, so if you do leave too often you'll start getting Low Priority Queue's, which will simply force you to wait an extra amount of time before actually being placed in queue (starting at 5 minutes, then increasing to 10 and capping at 20, each for 5 games).\n\nIf you believe you have been falsely punished, you do have the option of appealing the punishment by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), however it's important to note that Riot's policy is to leave low tier punishments (LPQs and Chat Restrictions) as they are, even if it's determined to be a false positive (the reasoning is largely due to the \"automated\" nature of the punishments). As such, an appeal wont change your situation, and only really has the possibility of giving Riot a bit more information on any flaws that exist in the system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-04T07:24:40.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarify\n\nAre you asking if you're gonna get banned?\n\nor\n\nAre you asking to be unbanned?\n\nIf the first question, generally not, you can't get banned for leaving one game, if you leave multiple however that chance increases exponentially\n\nIf the second question, no you won't get unbanned, just play out your low priority queue games","replies":[]}]}
