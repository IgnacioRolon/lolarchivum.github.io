I&#039;m currently sitting on silver 3 promos after hard work from bronze 3 this season. I was originally on silver 2 with 82lp. What i&#039;m trying to say is ALOT and i mean ALOT of my games always results in a disconnected person leaving my team 4 v 5. This is really Unfair for me. I have wasted so many hours and days trying to get to Gold, but these people keep weighing me down. I know this is not your fault, but please do something about this? Right now My rank is based on my team&#039;s connection for the entire game or not. I don&#039;t mind if its a loss with a Fair 5 v 5. Or even feeders. But 4 v 5 is just not cool! I really hope you guys have a solution for this, to compensate me and others. I really think I should be in High Silver or gold by now, if you minus all the disconnected teammates I had. Please Riot, I got a solution. Compensate LP, or let a summoner do a redo on their promos. This is the most simple and FAIR solution you can do. Without losing anything. Please, Please do something similar or a better one! and Please read this asap, and compensate me and others before season 5 ends! I really want to get to Gold 5 before Preseason.!!! I really enjoy playing, especially with my friends, but rank really frustrates me, and I don&#039;t enjoy it sometimes because of these ranked disconnected teammates. \r\n\r\nThank You for reading! I hope I get compensated in any way before this season ends!!! I really want the Gold 5 border.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-10-30T08:31:00.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about minusing all the LP you won when enemies dcd? You cant complain and say you're losing LP from people afking while ignoring the fact that you also WIN just as many games from enemies leaving.","replies":[{"poster":"Scared","date":"2015-11-01T21:51:21.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about you get less LP from that?
