If you have a bad team you lose. Its independent to how well you do just because one or two people screw it up. Ive been in promos three times each time i do well but one or two people just either feed or don&#039;t care and throw. Its even harder when I&#039;m a support main and do really well but one or another feeds then we lose because of that. Even if i don&#039;t play support and play top the same thing happens or a damage source decides to not group and split push. I&#039;m at a point were league goes from being based on skill to being based off luck. this just makes ranked unfun and not skill based at all. But then you cant play normal as you get a diamond t7 yasuo stop his lane and make the game unfun for you.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-09T01:30:41.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And what about those like myself who work shift work or don't have any friends who play this toxic game?\n\nWhat do we do? So far my entire morning has been losses, not from my own doing but from other soloQ players feeding lanes to the point where the game is over within 20 mins. Trying to deal with a 14 kill darius 20 minutes into the game when you and their bot lane went even is a joke.\n\nSoloQ is ENTIRELY about rng. You can sit there and deny it, make excuses all you like but it's purely that simple.\n\nIt's not about how well you play but whether or not you get paired with retards or not. Maybe in higher elo's you can come back from that kind of deficit but not at lower. The games over.\n\nI honestly think that's what wrong with League, people look at it from a standpoint that everyone is a pro player and living in a perfect world. But for majority of the player base that's hardly how it really is.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-04-09T03:17:19.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Q isnt about rng, you felt this way because you are exactly where you belong.

Riddle me this sunshine. I've been sitting at gold 3 comfortably for some time now. Winning roughly 50% of my games.\n\nToday alone I've gone from gold 3 to gold 5. Do you really think my skill dropped over night or do you think it's due to the fact that today is the weekend and all the little bastard kids are online killing ranked? Mind you, I don't normally play league on a weekend and I can definitely tell the games are trash today. \n\nNone of the games have even been remotely close. It's one team stomping another game in game out. If we are all supposed to be of equal skill why is this? Why is one team totally annihilating the other every single game?\n\nHonestly, I've had nothing but utter shit games ALL morning where atleast one person will feed their lane or afk.\n\nCertainly nothing has changed on my end. Playing the same champs the same style each game.\n\nIt's the same playing late night/early morning on the OCE server. The oversea's players jump online and even tho they are the same elo with similar MMR there is DEFINITELY a skill gap. I'm not sure what times of day or when you play but from my perspective it's definitely true.\n\nYou jump on mid day during the week when kids are at school and you generally have good games with good people.\n\nWeekend rolls around or anything past 4pm and the skill gap drops significantly and you end up with trashy games.\n\nHow or why I dunno, because technically we all should be around the same skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-04-08T10:35:55.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you cant win, enable others to, you say you paly support, well so do it, it isnt rng, a support can turn games around, itemize properly peel for your carries, do whaatyou need to do to enable the team. a good support can make a bad adc shine.","replies":[{"poster":"SollyTuatara","date":"2017-04-08T10:44:37.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the thing is its never the ADC that's the problem its normally the top jng or mid. But end game their score look better as i try to carry but  the ADC just gets killed as Ive used everything to peel for them but cant do it enough. ive had games where the mid goes afk to get noodles then comes back to feed the fizz, but gets assists just because he presses a button but does no damage or cc. Or a top laner who should of won lane but didn't or did buts leaves a nasus to farm to gets like 400 stacks by 20 and the jngler just doing bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-04-09T00:07:29.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then control those variables and play with a duo.
