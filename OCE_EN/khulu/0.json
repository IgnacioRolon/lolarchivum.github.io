ADCs, Mages and Assassins get good feedback from damage done and KDA and creep score etc. A Healer gets feedback from healing done. Obviously damage taken is shown for Tanks. but for some support characters with shields (Ori) or heavy MR/armour (Galio/Rammus) it would be nice to be able to get a Damage Mitigated statistic.\r\n\r\n[tl;dr] It would be nice to see a combined statistic of how much damage prevention you did for your team.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\nKhulu","replies":[{"poster":"Machismo","date":"2016-07-16T13:36:17.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this would be great.

As a Janna or Braum I'm consistently eager to see how much damage I mitigated/shielded for my peeps in the post game stats. This would be really helpful!","replies":[]}]}
