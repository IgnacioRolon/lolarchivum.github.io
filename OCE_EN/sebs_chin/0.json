I would like to hear any feed back toward these champion ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Sinceden","date":"2015-04-27T06:56:29.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo can i make a champion stick figure sporlight for this?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperAthleteRox","date":"2015-01-14T00:18:48.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A cooking yordle seems pretty dangerous.","replies":[]}]}
