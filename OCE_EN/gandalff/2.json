I know riot wanted to keep us updated on where they are at with it, but to be honest it feels like it's never happening at this point. Plus if i cant find it here, then maybe this could be a new thread for new ideas? Personally i think it should be something rugby related, I mean rugby is THE sport for most of the pacific nations, First five jayce, or prop gragas would make pretty cool skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Cam ille faut","date":"2014-12-15T04:41:31.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think cricket would be a much more popular sport in this general area, tho. Jayce, Jax and perhaps Veigar could be wearing this sport-themed skins.\n\nThat said, it sucks quite a lot that Riot hasn't fulfilled a promise made 1.5 years ago. I mean, come on.","replies":[]}]}
