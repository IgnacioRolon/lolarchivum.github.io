But i was wondering if anyone knows if they have a refund policy for skins bought on remade champions? Not that there is anything wrong with the champions, its just that I liked how they use to play. For example fiora, use to be a like a melee adc, kind of like a talon and I really liked that about her, so I bought a skin for her. Since the rework I&#039;ve played her a couple of times, and I really don&#039;t like it. It&#039;s not fun for me to play, and the skin now isn&#039;t what i paid for. I feel similar about the darius rework. I mained darus a couple of seasons ago, and instantly blew 20 bucks on the dunk lord skin when it came out. But then he moved from an early game cheese champion, to a late game hyper tank carry. I got use to the darius remake because he was op and I had high win rates on him, plus dunk lord is an amazing skin and I really wanted to keep it. But I&#039;m sure there must be others out there that felt more strongly about it, because he really doesn&#039;t play anything like he use to.  So I was wondering what everyone&#039;s opinions are on this? It seems a little unfair to spend money on something just to have it changed to something it isn&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-01-28T04:33:03.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought they changed this so that no refunds would be given out for reworked champs? \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-28T04:04:09.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be able to get it refunded, and I believe you can get a refund if you message Support.
