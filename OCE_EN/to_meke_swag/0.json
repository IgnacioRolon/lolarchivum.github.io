Any bugs on vi I like to see fixed though haha. just so I never have to encounter the issue when I an in an important situation.","replies":[{"poster":"to meke swag","date":"2014-12-25T02:34:36.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it has only happened as of the latest patch never had a problem before that but like i said i can recreate the bug rather easily so is worth noting","replies":[]}]}]}
