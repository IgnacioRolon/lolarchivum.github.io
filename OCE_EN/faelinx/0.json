I cant play many games as I may have to walk away, but I like to keep up with the game.  I really enjoy watching the games that are usually available from the main page, but for the last month or so they have been unavailable.  There are just adds and videos.  For awhile you had a double arrow you could click on and it would switch out one of the add, but those seem to be gone as well.  Could you please tell me how to view these games again or let me know what the problem is?  Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-02T08:34:53.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThese have been removed from the client at the moment.\n\nI cannot tell you if this is a permanent change or a temporary change as I do not know myself.\n\nSorry about that.","replies":[]}]}
