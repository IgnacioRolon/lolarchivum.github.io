{"poster":"Xilxini","date":"2016-01-12T17:21:20.275+0000","title":"Permanent Ban on main account and other questionable infractions.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account on the Oceanic server has been permanently suspended. After having seen this message upon trying to login I was pointed towards the original email of the account, to see why this was the case. However, despite checking my email and various other emails I have nothing was found. I am left feeling pretty frustrated at this result and wondering what I have done so wrong.\r\n\r\nNot to say i&#039;m an angel that has followed the summoner&#039;s code to its full extent, of course.\r\n\r\nI am very aware of having numerous Leaver Buster warnings over my time playing League of Legends in the past few months. This has been mainly due to poor internet connections at times ( I am aware that this is my responsibility and that I can contact the service provider, but nothing has worked). \r\n\r\nOther than Leaver Buster warnings and two chat blocks, I haven&#039;t received any official warnings, bans or infractions in the past that I am aware of.  I have flamed teammates in the past, I have said stupid things in the chat as a joke between friends and I have cursed, but what league of legends player hasn&#039;t?\r\n\r\nI have not once received a warning for offensive behaviour, harassment or language on my account. \r\n\r\nAll I can gather from this, without further communication or reasoning from riot is that my account has been permanently suspended for leaving a few games due to a bad connection and flaming occasionally, I would really like to have my account unbanned and if not that; a reason as to why it was banned so I can avoid this in future.\r\n\r\nBut wait? Why does the title of the thread say &#039;Other questionable infractions&#039;?\r\n\r\nI created another account a few hours after that in case i continued playing and couldn&#039;t get my account back, the first PvP game I entered I received a warning for harassment and offensive behaviour, despite trying my best to be friendly to everyone even though I was getting flamed myself. This summoner flamed me to no ends and then I received warning from riot noting how some people have bad days but it is important not to express those feelings in game! (Not quoting the exact message.)\r\n\r\nIt seems that players can just make biased choices to report other players in order for them to get banned, even if they did nothing wrong AND Riot will follow up on punishing them.  Yep, a level 3 player doesn&#039;t know what a leash is and experienced &#039;Smurf&#039;s will report them for not co-operating and bad teamwork, not exactly a great learning environment for new players.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post and unnecessary rants, but I hope I can get a decent response in return.\r\n\r\nI definitely feel I am in an unfair position and I request that my account be unbanned, or at least an explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-12T19:11:09.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Xilxini,\n\nBecause this is an account-specific inquiry, we can’t help you out here on the Boards. As such, you’ll want to direct this to Riot Games Player Support by [**submitting a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will help resolve this issue as quickly as possible: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n3. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[]}]}
