Faster!&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Do not worry dear Wolf. He cannot escape our hunt.&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nEverything is silent. Moonlight, casting the trees in a pale light. Shadows flickering across the forest floor. Everything, is as it should be. But if you listen hard enough, you can hear murmurs of music in the quiet night air. Twin harmonies, one gentle and forgiving, the other jagged and deadly. The music of death. \r\n\r\nIt echoes in the gentle footsteps of the figure in white as it makes its way quietly through the undergrowth, hands gripping an intricately carved bow of purple and blue hues. It is nestled in the bright eyes that weave between the trees, a hungry mouth opening wide. It is there in the hurried breath of a man attempting to escape fate.  \r\n\r\nHe thrashes through the trees, muttered curses springing to life on his tongue as he sees the shadows that are chasing him draw ever nearer. His eyes are wild. There is a sound like the crack of thunder and there, suddenly, before him, is the wide mouth of a wolf. He stops cold and glances back. Behind him is a figure of white, silently watching from the shadows. The man cannot move. The prey has been caught. \r\n\r\nThe pale creature rises, back straight as it draws on the light from the moon and weaves an arrow made of starlight. It pulls the arrow back, nocking it on the bow and aims. Waiting. One breath, two. \r\n\r\nThe man flinches away, fear vividly etched across his features and he tries to scramble forwards. \r\n\r\nIt is over in a second. A shape made of shadows spins forward, jaws snapping around him. And just like that, he is gone. \r\n\r\nLamb lets her bow fall.  _&ldquo;I had thought perhaps he was ready to face my arrows&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Not all who appear worthy at first, remain so when faced with our trial&rdquo;_ The shadow of the wolf appears around her again, circling slowly. _&lsquo;&rdquo;He was far better suited to my taste&rdquo;_ A grin, a promise of pain. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Even so &ndash; &ldquo;_ \r\n\r\nA sound snaps through the trees. Lamb pauses, her words lying forgotten as her bow is once more drawn tight. \r\n\r\n _&ldquo;Perhaps we have another hunt tonight, dear wolf&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nThey move with a grace befitting the twin creatures of legend. A stream of shadow and light, playfully flitting across the trunks of the trees as they leap, chasing the sound that is rumbling through the night air. \r\n\r\nTogether, they step out from behind the trees to see a picture of carnage. Ahead of them is a wide and open plain, stretching out towards ragged mountains on the horizon. Settlements are scattered on the silver sand but each one is burning, flames high. People are running, screaming, from the scene of destruction.   \r\n\r\nLamb holds up a finger, gently reaching for a burning ember.\r\n\r\nKindred shivers. Death is different here. They are different. There is something in the air that speaks of a new kind of destruction. Here, Kindred is not the hunter of the moon, both gentle and fierce. Here, Kindred is born of fire and shadow. Ready to set the world ablaze. \r\n\r\n _&ldquo;Is it time to chase them?&rdquo;_  Wolf swims into Lamb&rsquo;s view, no longer created from hues of purple and blue. Now, Wolf is a demon of flames, wearing a charred mask with an amber crystal set in between his bright eyes. \r\n\r\nLamb holds her bow out in front of her, taking in the new golden spires. Her black eyes are set behind a white mask, lined with wings of gold and a mane of fire. \r\n\r\nIt is not the first time that Kindred has changed. Death is far reaching and universal. It comes for all in time but each have their own understanding of what death is, of what it brings for them. Here, among the ashes and flames, Kindred is born from fire. \r\n\r\nKindred moves forward. Golden and red hues shifting. The thunder rumbles overhead and they laugh. \r\n\r\n**_&ldquo;It is time to hunt&rdquo;_**\r\n\r\nThey race forward, brilliant streaks of harmonies singing together. The mortals fall one by one to the flames and Kindred is here to take them to their deaths. Faster and faster they run. Wolf leaps from victim to victim, his laughter deep. Lamb leaps clean over broken buildings, drawing arrows from the fires that rage within. She shoots them into the hearts of her targets. The ones who are standing, defiant. She never misses.\r\nTogether, Kindred weaves the tale of death. \r\n\r\nSuddenly, Wolf stops and draws back. _&ldquo;Wait, Lamb&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;_ She pauses alongside him, feeling that rumble of thunder once more. Ahead, there is something shifting in the clouds of smoke. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;I smell the burning of stars. Danger lies ahead&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nLamb looks down and gently strokes the charred mask. The screams have vanished now as this creature before them moves. All is silent once more. \r\n\r\n _&ldquo;Do not be afraid, dear Wolf. It is an old friend&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nBright eyes swivel around, sensing movement and the creature looms large, its presence as expansive as the universe. A great serpent, coloured in a beautiful white. Eyes of burning orange are nestled beneath a golden helm with black horns rising from behind. A mane of pure fire reaches high into the sky. Golden armour sits on its coiled body, embers sparking between its claws. \r\n\r\nThe dragon&rsquo;s great mouth opens in a wide grin and Kindred looks within, expecting to see the ever constant twinkle of stars but now the mouth holds the promise of fire and death. Something has changed. \r\n\r\n &ldquo;ANOTHER HAS COME TO CHAIN ME.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA laugh. The sound crackles like the thunder once more. It echoes and digs deep into the earth. Above, the creature hisses, golden claws inching towards the solitary figures of Kindred. But just before they reach Kindred, the creature stops. Its eyes narrow. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;WHO ARE YOU TO STAND BEFORE A GOD&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKindred looks up at the legend and they say. _**&ldquo;The stars burn beneath your gaze and the universe is born from your breath. You are both creator and destroyer, Aurelion Sol. Now you are more. Now, you are born of flames and ash&rsquo;**_\r\n\r\n&ldquo;HOW DARE YOU CLAIM TO KNOW ME&rdquo; The voice rumbles and the very earth itself shifts at the sound. \r\n\r\nLamb tilts her head, the eyes of the winged mask piercing through the darkness. _&ldquo;Have you forgotten us so soon, wise one?&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nAurelion Sol draws back his head and silence falls. The flames held between his claws burn and smoulder as he gazes down at the small creatures. Finally, he bows his head. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;YOU ARE KINDRED&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKindred solemnly stares back up at him. Twin souls, captured in the never-ending dance of death. \r\n\r\n_**&lsquo;Tonight we hunt those who had chained you.&rsquo;**_\r\n\r\n&lsquo;THEN HUNT. WATCH THE PITIFUL CREATURES AS THEY FLEE FROM ME&rdquo; Aurelion roars. In that instant, the celestial being becomes a storm of fire, the unbridled power of a volcano held within his very breath. \r\n\r\nThe Earth cracks. Houses are swept up. Trees are incinerated. Life is extinguished in one move. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Chase it, chase it! While its blood still runs hot...&rdquo;_ Wolf gazes hungrily past the broken houses, fixated on the new hunt. With a flick of Lamb&rsquo;s wrist, he is off. But Lamb stays a moment longer and draws her bow up with a flick of her deft fingers.  \r\n\r\nAn arrow is pulled from the flames flickering around Aurelion Sol&rsquo;s form and it glows bright, aimed straight for his chest. \r\n\r\nAurelion watches Lamb but there is no fear in his eyes.  &ldquo;IS IT MY TURN TO FACE YOUR ARROW, DEAR LAMB?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBut Lamb shakes her head, letting the arrow fall back into the flames. \r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Not yet, old friend. Not yet&rdquo;_\r\n\r\nThe great dragon looks for a moment longer, his form immense and filled with an unimaginable power. Many had tried to chain him. Some had succeeded. But before all mortals, he was considered a God. The greatest of heroes would kneel and pay reverence. But here, before Kindred, he was humbled. Death came for all in time and one day, it would come for him. \r\n\r\nHe had been there at the creation of the universe. It was Kindred alone, who would be there at the end. \r\n\r\nFinally, Lamb turns and bounds off into the forest leaving Aurelion to his path of fury. As Kindred grows further away from the burning embers, their forms flick back to the white and black that they are known for. They chase through the night and into the early hours of the morning. Never faltering. \r\n\r\nFor now, they hunt the mortals. But one day, perhaps a day not too far from now, Kindred will chase down the Gods. And on that day, death will come and the fires shall burn anew. \r\n\r\n_**&ldquo;Born from shadows and light, born from fire and ash, Kindred will come for all in time&rsquo;**_\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"ThunderWielder","date":"2017-03-15T12:00:30.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting and very beautiful writing.

I tend to forget how many commas I use in a story so I'll definitely be taking a more critical eye to some of the sentences to make sure I don't overuse, which should cut down on some of that. \n\nAlso thanks for the comments about the dialogue. I'll play with it to see if I can get wolf sounding a bit less intelligent. For Aurelion, I do agree that he is definitely more intelligent and well-spoken than I've written him here. My intention was that he is more barbaric because this story is taking place after he has escaped the people who bound him to their service. He is naturally more angry and as a result, sounds a bit more barbaric. But yea I do get that usually he doesn't sound like that, so I'll see if I can edit that dialogue too so that I still have the idea of him changing after he has escaped but make him sound a bit more like Aurelion.\n\nThanks again for the feedback!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
