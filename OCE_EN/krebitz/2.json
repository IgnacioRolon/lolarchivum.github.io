Not sure what&#039;s causing it, but the client launcher is completely fine, it&#039;s just the log in screen and in game client. All my other games run/display as normal as well so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s an issue on my end? although I did try repairing the client and that didn&#039;t achieve anything, but my lol client was fine yesterday and I didn&#039;t encounter this problem until now and I didn&#039;t change any settings between then and now either. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-09T05:53:38.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Krebitz,\n\nThis might be due to a driver issue.
