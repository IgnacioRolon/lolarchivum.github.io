At first I thought the issue was on my end but after playing other games (some of which have servers within Australia and others where I need to conect to America) I found that I wasn't lagging in those games at all with 40 ping on Australian servers and only 80 to 100 on American servers (this is across multiple games) so it's pretty clear that the issue isn't on my end as my internet runs perfectly fine and I have no lag outside League of legends. My point is, as much as a useless complaint it may seem, is that Riot's OCE server seems to not be working as well as it should. I'm also not the only player experiencing these issues as in game I see multiple disconnects from both teams far more often than is healthy/normal and hear complaints about ping spikes and constant lag as well as bugsplats which also brings me to issues with the client. I've been getting a lot of bugsplats over the past month as have many of my friends and I've tried everything from reinstalling league to repairing the client and even looking up solutions online and nothing seems to work which just tells me that the client is naturally buggy and there's nothing I can do about it.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, between the buggy client and laggy server, It's incredibly difficult to play this game and is frankly frustrating to even try to sometimes, even though in a general sense I like the game and would like to play it if I were actually able to get in game without all sorts of issues appearing that are completely beyond my control. Also even if I do manage to avoid a bugsplat and not have any lag for a game there's almost always someone on my or the enemy team that does get those issues and aren't able to play as well as they would normally or even play at all which is really painful to deal with and even more painful when it's happening to you.\r\n\r\nNow I understand that running a server, coding a client and running a game franchise in general is difficult to do and there are problems that can't always be avoided or immediately fixed. HOWEVER, Riot is a company with only ONE game to look after and is one of the highest earning game companies at the moment, even earning enough to \"provide\" the OCE community with an artificial reef, yet the server and client are incredibly sub-par compared to those of other companies who not only don't earn as much income but also have multiple games to look after and also just as many if not more servers to deal with. I love league of legends, at this point though, I'm not a huge fan of Riot. I hope that everyone who reads this can understand why and even possibly relate as I know for a fact I'm not the only one feeling this way or experiencing these issues.\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone who gives a decent reply :)","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T04:30:17.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey raging666teabag,\n\nFirstly I want to say sorry you are having a bad time lately when playing League. It sucks when things outside your control ruin your gaming time.\n\nI'm not sure if you have seen some of the other threads going around at the moment, but we are ware that some players are experiencing issues when connecting to our game servers and we are trying to resolve the issue.\n\nWe have found the majority of players (so far) that are experiencing issues are on the Flip NZ network, but that is not to say other ISP's are not having some issues as well.\n\nIf you haven't already could you please head over to [http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs) and run the Network Diagnostic Tool. Then submit your results and a brief description of your issue (just in case I don't get the email first) to **ocelivereports@riotgames.com**.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"EzM Beefix","date":"2015-02-09T10:56:41.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a while (especially since new patch) I have been experiencing big lag spikes that will occur every game at some point for 3-5 minutes in length. Sometimes longer. During this time the game will continually try to reconnect. I live in Adelaide, Australia and am connected to Telstra ADSL 2+. When I play there are no other applications running to eat up my bandwidth, and no other computers (other than smartphones) are connected to my wifi. When these lag spikes happen I will alt-tab my game and open up the web browser to check if my internet is the problem, and it seems to run fine. This leads me to believe the issue is with the game. On speedtest.net and similar websites, my internet records an 'A', and 'netlimiter' has confirmed that no other programs besides LOL are eating up my bandwidth.\n\nAre there any suggestions you might have to improve my gameplay experience? I don't experience lag spikes like this on any other game I play, and I do love your game!\n\nedit: I ran the network diagnostic test and submitted it via your instructions also.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-08T09:49:52.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE is butt-hole of Rito confirmed.\n\nEy, look at the bright side.
