Since it seems really unfair that you need to choose between either completely giving up your series or suffering through a troll game for 20+ minutes and then possibly losing your series because of it anyway.\r\n\r\nI mean a player shouldn&#039;t be playing ranked if they own only a certain type of champion or can only play a certain role as it is unfair to the other players on the team, yet it&#039;s the other players who get unjustly punished for trying to get out of that game. Why should players who come into ranked prepared to play have to bend for the one other player who is intentionally going to be difficult and make the game harder?","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-01T02:35:48.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but by dodging, you're basically saying you would've lost that game even if you played it. it's a loss, without going through the whole losing stage. you're going straight to the losing lp part.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-31T16:57:28.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any system that makes it OK to dodge in certain circumstances is going to be exploitable, and there will be people who will exploit it (e.g. dodging because you didn't get the role you wanted or something) and make it unfair on those who dont dodge at every opportunity. It's fine the way it is. Sure caitlyn mid might not be ideal, and maybe you have a lower than average chance of winning if someone picks something  troll, but you still have a reasonable chance so you might as well play it out if you're in a series.","replies":[{"poster":"Krebitz","date":"2015-05-31T17:14:05.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess that's true, still though you shouldn't lose your entire series just for dodging one game...you should get the dodge timer and all the regular penalties, but if I'm in my series I'd rather have to just wait however many minutes it is to re-queue up rather than play out a game with a troll or something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-01T02:18:08.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Series is a best of 3 anyway remember.

Sometimes you don't want to spend 20~40 mins try to win a game for your series having an trolling person in there. Give a chance to dodge that game and wait like 5 mins for a better game might be a good idea, when you done using those chances you can only said :\" FFFF this really my unlucky day!!!\".\nMy point is give a chance to dodge more than have nothing.","replies":[]}]}
