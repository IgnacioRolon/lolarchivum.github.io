After quitting for a while and coming back a year later, I've notice significantly longer waiting times for matches. At the moment I have been waiting for 45 minutes for a game. And why is this so bad? Because there are people who search for a game then afk and don't click accept when a match comes up. \r\n\r\nYou have to start putting penalties up for there people!\r\n\r\nWaiting for almost an hour for a game is nonsense! There are so many people on oceania right now. There is no lack of players. But it is impossible for me to find a game! \r\n\r\nPenalizing a player isn't the best business strategy. But what is better. That hundreds of paying customers will be able to have a better experience, or you keep letting wait times climb up into the 1 hour or more area until you lose a significant portion of your customers. \r\n\r\nFix this shit","replies":[{"poster":"Draimond","date":"2015-08-03T23:21:49.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I normally take 1 - 4 mins to get a game, but today I had just over an hour free for gaming and I've spent that whole time waiting for a game.

Usually I only take around a minute to find a game, which has only gotten better since when I first joined (which may be related to my improvement of MMR). Even when I group with some friends to search for a game, max. waiting time is two minutes.\n\nIt's very strange that it's taking so long for one particular person to find a game. Have you tried playing on a fresh, new account?\n\nAdditionally, there *are* penalties in place for players who regularly dodge queue or not accept/decline games. Continued abuse of the queue system will result in an automated penalty, where upon the player must wait upwards times of five minutes or greater before they're allowed to re-enter queue. It increases as they continue to leave games, reducing the amount of damage they can inflict.\n\nOr, it could be a connection issue that you're having, where even though your client claims that you are in queue, you are in fact not. Who's your ISP? Do you experience any issues while in game with other players?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pyropanties","date":"2015-03-11T02:26:38.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, every time I get a good champ in aram or place in summoners, some idiot leaves.
