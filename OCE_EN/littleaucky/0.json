What&#039;s more we all know he can work quite well as an ad bruiser. I encountered an ad bruiser fizz recently and found that his abilities despite him having no ap were absolutely shredding my health bar, you would think that if he were to build ad his abilities would more be used for mobility and not so much damage. But this full ad fizz who I might add was a lower level in game as me was able to kill me with JUST his abilities, q w e r. I don&#039;t necessarily think this is fair, and I know many of you will probably just flame me that I should just &quot;get better&quot; but outplaying fizz is quite difficult when the only skillshot he needs to land for a guaranteed kill is his ulty. I am interested in your thoughts\r\n\r\n(I am having lots of bad games against fizz, and just want to know if he&#039;s truly balanced.)","replies":[{"poster":"Fndrr22dxd","date":"2015-04-26T03:08:37.366+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruiser on-hit fizz already been nerfed. They shifted the 8% shred of your hp to 8% shred over 3 seconds, which is about a 33% damage output nerf if you have 1.0 Attack speed(not that fast). His fish is slow moving, so saving your mobility spell to dodge the fish will basically destroy a large portion of his damage output. Outside of that, you have items such as QSS. You basically play against bruiser fizz how you play against riven - they have decent upfront burst which you disengage from, counterattack when they have cooldown's running, but don't stay too long or they'll have another full rotation on you.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleAucky","date":"2015-04-26T03:11:19.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks dude","replies":[{"poster":"Knight Of Dawn","date":"2015-04-26T05:23:44.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good advice bro","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-26T11:15:11.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He IS balanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-26T06:39:47.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz already got gutted and then became OP as an AD. Now they changed him back to AP and he is an average AP laner. The way to deal with fizz is fiddle his butt in lane and don't give him free kills.\nFizz's laning is really weak vs ranged champs and he is outplayable now that his Q damage can be flashed and has been nerfed too.\n\nHe's like any assassin, if he gets a 2-3 kill lead on you, you may as well turn around and bend over because he will be 2-shotting you for the rest of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-04-26T06:32:40.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah let's just switch him between AD and AP every patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worst Mid Ever","date":"2015-04-26T06:03:55.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only high base damage spells he has are the troll poll and ult, both of which can be avoided\n\nas for getting bursted by this abilities, his Q applies the onhit affects of his BoTRK + his ad, so that is ~15% of your hp if he Q + autos, and if he is in melee range he can AA reset for an instant AA Q AA, then the botrk active for another 10% of max hp, all amplified by 20% if his ult is attached to you, then trident deals missing health %, its got nothing to do with his base damage, just botrks synergy with onhit AA resets","replies":[]}]}
