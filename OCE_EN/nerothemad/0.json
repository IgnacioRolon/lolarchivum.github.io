It was taking a while loading so I just quit out of it and went off to something else. \r\n\r\nWhen I came back looking to keep playing, when I logged in it came up with a message saying &quot;Game Abandoned. You have left a game in progress. Please reconnect to the game.&quot; The game doesnt exist to reconnect too because i didnt abandon it. We just lost. \r\n\r\nWhen i click reconnect (hoping it would realise its mistake and send me to the match results page) it just sits on a black screen failing to load anything. When i force quit the app and re-log it just comes up with the same message. \r\n\r\nI am now stuck in an endless loop of reconnect screen :( pls help","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:12:00.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ghost games 2spooky.
