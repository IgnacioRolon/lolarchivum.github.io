Players who's behavior can be characterised as offensive, victimization or bullying are in fact common in league games, particularly at the lower levels. Player will call each other offensive or hurtful names, belittle players for their skills, even going so far as to make vile comments as to another players self-worth. Riot Games has expressed a desire to make sure that these behaviors are not tolerated. However, it is clear that the effect of their effort may, in fact, be quite the opposite. Here, I will discuss how the incentives involved actually tacitly promote or at least do very little to curb bullying. The main problem is the leave buster system.\r\n\r\nThe Leave Buster system is designed to make sure games remain competitive by censuring players who leave games. Obviously, as league is a finely balanced team game, it requires a team to win, and if people leave, then winning is much harder,  in many cases impossible. This system has many positive aspects, in that it requires players to commit to a game for the duration, which keeps the competitive spirit high, and dissuades people from abusing games by purposely leaving in order to cause a loss.\r\n\r\nThe problem with it is that this actually incentivises bullying behaviors. Essentially, bullies know that they have a captive audience, because if the victim leaves, it is the victim who will suffer censure, not the bully. This censure is backed up by the threat of economic sanction, if the player leaves often enough they may be banned from playing, essentially denying them access to good and services they have bought and paid for. Furthermore, the bully is safe if this happens as bullying behavior can only be reported directly after a game, and if the victim leaves the game prematurely, they do not actually reach the screen where reporting is possible. Essentially, the system incentivises bullying to the extent that they force their victim to leave.\r\n\r\nNow it could be argued that all the person has to do is stay till the end of the game, and then the report can take place. However, firstly, league games can last 40 minutes or longer, and I'm fairly certain (not having the facts immediately to hand) that even 30 minutes of abuse is probably enough to cause emotional scarring. Secondly, bullies are not usually known for impulse control, and tend not to really consider the consequences of their actions. Hence the possible threat of future censure is probably not enough to make them stop.\r\n\r\nIn most situations where people are bullied, one perfectly acceptable response is to leave the situation. Walk away. It is here that the problem lies. Riot's system punishes people who take this option. I don't know about any body else, but it is clear to me that this is a situation that needs some attention.\r\n\r\nNow, enough of focusing on the problem; what we need to suggest as a community is ways to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nHere are a few ideas I thought of:\r\n\r\n1. Allow people to report bullying behavior as the reason that they left, with review by the tribunal (leave buster system will still punish leavers though, so some might not what this option)\r\n\r\n2. Apply a system similar to dodging a game at champ select, but for a longer period (say 1 hour), without ramping up the penalties (as the leave buster system does). This should stop players from casually leaving (as they won't be able to play for some time), without overly disadvantaging those who leave for legitimate reasons (players who have been recently bullied are unlikely to want to play another game directly anyway.\r\n\r\n3. Leaving blocks the player only from the auto-match queues. This means that they can still play with friends, and people who choose to play with them, or practice further against bots, but that they will be barred from true competitive matches.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the 2nd or 3rd options are best, as they install correct incentives to promote competitive play, without allowing avenues for bullies to take advantage of. \r\n\r\nOf course, others out there probably have their own ideas about this issue, indeed, perhaps I am alone in feeling this way. However, I would be quite happy to listen to any points or counter-points that anyone might wish to add, and would love to see any other people's suggestions for ways to handle this.\r\n\r\nChristov","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-12-06T02:09:29.689+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"you really dragged that out longer than it needed to be.\n\ndidnt even bother reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Christov","date":"2014-12-06T03:48:02.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sorry, I was just trying to fully explain myself.

(kinda like I am right now)\n\nSecond of all, Tribunal does not exist currently in any form what so ever on any server, don't mention it as a way to curb arseholery in the game when it doesn't exist.\n\nRiot is in the motion of repairing community faults such as trolling, AFKing, and general harassment. Unfortunately the only issues that get a spontaneous response from Riot currently are death threads, sexual harassment and homophobia.\n\nIf you leave a match because you feel you are being unfairly treated by someone in it, it is still your fault for doing so and you shouldn't get leave of punishment for it. Once someone has started abusing you, you have the option of stopping them or at least not seeing what they are saying by using the in match ignore system, once the match has concluded naturally you can report them from the post game lobby.\nIf you pay attention to what someone is saying in an online game to the point where you become emotionally scared then you really shouldn't be there in the first place and you should find therapy in real life to help you overcome your pre-existing anxiety issues. This is coming from someone who has been a victim of bullying in real life.\n\n\n\nNow on the chance that this is bait, meh %%%% you.\n\nOn the chance you are just copy pasting some %%%% you read about cyber bullying in some crappy internet journal, you are an idiot and those journals and reports are written by people who have no idea what bullying is really like.\n\nOn the chance you are sincere, you still have no idea what bullying is actually like, just like the people who write those journals, and your points are ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-06T09:19:07.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"XJ9.
