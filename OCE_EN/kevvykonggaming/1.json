Also play with friends who you can communicate with online! (If you can, it helped me out a lot)\nIf you need basic knowledge on a variety of champions and how to teamfight play a few ARAMs (a few.. too many and you'll forget how to play normals at all lol) otherwise keep playing normals and you will slowly learn more and more about the game..\nJungling I absolutely suck at I'm not even gonna go there, but I'd search video's on whoever you jungle with on youtube and watch those (seriously, very helpful)\nAt lvl 20 I recommend you start purchasing T3 runes you should find they do help you quite a bit :)","replies":[{"poster":"KevvykongGaming","date":"2015-09-21T13:36:52.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx I appreciate that XD","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-21T13:48:48.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also you should use mobafire or another site to see what items go well on the champions you play. (Recommended items in game aren't always the best)\nTake everything you see with a grain of salt though.. Every game is different and you won't always or shouldn't always build the same every game!\nFor example if you're playing a mage in the mid lane your first full item may change depending on who you're laning against.\nIf I'm Ahri and my enemy is Veigar or someone else AP who counters me, I'll go Unholy Grail {{item:3174}} cause it has Magic Resist as well as other nice stats.\nBut if I'm laning against someone who's AD, E.G. Yasuo or Zed I'll go Morellonomicon {{item:3165}} instead cause the extra AP will prove more useful than having  Magic Resist and it still has all the other good stats the Grail does ^^","replies":[{"poster":"KevvykongGaming","date":"2015-09-22T01:02:20.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main tris and now I have everything to do with her from lvl 1 to 18 thankyou TK9277.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KevvykongGaming","date":"2015-09-21T13:03:33.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EG how to JG better ....................","replies":[]}]}
