So, the concept art and model always comes first before the Splash is created. So yes we always look at the model very closely when creating the splash art. \n\nThe reason why there may be some differences between splash and model is because in splash art we want to sell the fantasy of the character or skin as best as possible. To do so we need to illustrate them in certain scenario's that have intense/dramatic lighting. Also we sometimes like to embelish the character with a bit more detail than what you see in the model to sell the material of the armor, or skin details..etc.  We really consider how much we add to make sure its still close to what you see in game. In game they have to be careful with how much tiny details they put on the model as things can get visually busy if too much is on the model and that may affect gameplay. :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-02T01:41:24.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like Singed's handiness?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2015-05-02T00:08:39.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dragon Slayer Pantheon was hawt\n\nPat yourself on the back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alexithymia","date":"2015-05-02T06:43:02.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"So why does riot always make the female champions have over sexualized outfits and completely nonfunctional Armour?

Also why are all the women being given harsh angular lines on their faces? (Look at Janna's {{champion:40}} new classic for what I mean) They are starting to look sexually ambiguous. \n\nDon't get me wrong, much of the new splash art is amazing, But for some I feel like they are taking on a more of a cartoon-ish look rather than the usual CG animation that seems to be the league of legends style. (So I guess I am wondering if there is a particular reason for this, or if its just that each artists has their own sense of style) \n\nOther than that, its been great to see some of the out-dated art work getting a modern makeover - for the most part they add a real sense of fantasy to the character and demonstrate their personality, which is really good to see. (Just that one pet peeve of Janna who's face I can't get over it just bugs me so much, I get that she is meant to be elf-like but the features have been over-exaggerated and seem too sharp taking away from the overall flow) \n\nSome of the changes I am most impressed with are; \n\n{{champion:1}}  - I love how the artist here decided to show her physical growth, and improved upon her \"Annie in wonderland\" and \"Red Riding Annie\"  (which lets be honest used to be creepy.) The new Annie really captures the whimsical nature of children. (Much like Lulu - except for her creepy skins) \n\n{{champion:15}} - Sivir was really bought out of the dark ages with her rework and face lift, you can really tell that she is charging into battle, its almost like she is in the middle of her ultimate chasing down and enemy. \n\n{{champion:25}}  - Morgana look seriously pissed off, a real fallen angel seeking her vengeance, the particle effects really draw your eye and seem to come from inside of the character. I can't remember what was wrong with the old one, but I know it was mostly just old and lacked detail. \n\nI have probably bored you enough with all of my comments and I really should not go through every single one of the new models. I will just say the following;\n\nGreat work bringing the characters to life and presenting aspects of their personality and play style in their artwork, keep up the good work. \n\nPlease consider looking at some of the female faces that are a little more angular than is typical for a female. \nJanna{{champion:40}}  and Katarina{{champion:55}}  being the main points of concern (If the angular look is what riot is going for - you may consider making their hair shorter so that their faces do not appear to be made longer and drawn out by the hair.)  An example of where the angular face works is Fiora {{champion:114}} who's hair is quite short. \n\n\nP.S I could never use a computer to create art as well as the RIOT team, (pencil's and paper only for me.)  I would love to be able to try and create something like what I see done in the spotlights - or just from what I found in the archives.
