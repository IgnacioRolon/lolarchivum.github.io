I have no idea why I would be banned I don&#039;t remember raging last game. The only thing I remember is being forced updated into the new client. (Oceania server, this is what [my LoL icon](http://i.imgur.com/BR0kKwc.jpg) looks like btw) so I checked my email and it said I was banned for use of [3rd Party Programs](http://i.imgur.com/Qa0Kqer.png). \r\n\r\n_**Currently I have no 3rd Party Programs active, has been that way for at least a year. **_\r\n\r\nHere is the list of programs I have used since I have been playing:\r\n\r\n* LolReplay\r\n* PlaysTV\r\n* Championify\r\n\r\nThat being said, I&#039;ve uninstalled all these at least a year ago when I temporarily quit League.\r\n\r\nI also was hacked a few weeks ago, although I have no way of actually proving it. [Here is a OP.GG screenshot of his games](http://i.imgur.com/tiR5LW3.png). I already recovered my account and changed the password, since he didn&#039;t bother changing the password himself.\r\n\r\nThis is the [event](http://i.imgur.com/c6ENWRl.png) that made my password public. Basically I can now google search my password and it will show up in a notepad filled with other usernames and passwords for entertainment services like Netflix. (The reason I omitted my username from the screenshots)\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m being forced to [answer questions](http://i.imgur.com/apk7T58.png) that are nearly impossible to answer to prove it&#039;s my account and I made my account nearly 7 years ago. Currently I own all the champions I cannot remember my first 5 champions I owned.\r\n\r\nThat being said I have no idea what to do, **please help me someone.**\r\n\r\nHere you can see how much money I spent on a free-to-play game and laugh at me:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OKnrVQ2.png","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-06T09:17:55.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, that's a pretty unfortunate situation to be in... :( I'll do my best to help, but I can never promise anything in these cases.\n\n+ First thing though, the account recovery you talked about, did that happen through Riot Support? \n\n+ And secondly, roughly how many of the answers to the account recovery questions do you remember for sure? 30% 40%?\n\nAlso continuing to work through Riot Support is a great idea. Remember they have the power and expertise to help you the most :)","replies":[{"poster":"RolyPaulie","date":"2017-04-07T10:27:24.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I talked through Riot Support. I'm gonna be honest I don't know if any of my answers are correct I did this nearly 7 years ago, buying my first champs, skins and refunds. I know for sure I made the account for North America since Oceania server wasn't released then, I made it all the way to level 30 before Oceania released. I don't know if my account creation date is correct either as my best friend invited me to play when this game was in beta and I don't remember if I made account then or I made it when I played for real (near the end of Season 1).\n\nThe thing I'm scared of the most is making a new account (yes I'm willing to make a new account as I love this game even though I'm bad at it) and having it banned again due to having a program on my computer. I asked Riot Support if they could tell me why I was banned so I could avoid it again, but they wouldn't help me out.\n\nI'm sorry I know me venting here won't unlift my ban or really help me out with the issue, I just wanted to talk to other people as riot support wasn't really helping me unless I could answer those questions.\n\nThank you for replying!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-11T23:17:57.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the super late reply, I had some trouble getting hold of a Riot support employee with knowledge about this. I hope you're still around!\n\nThey strongly advised you to contact them again, and have a second go at the questions, but this time really really put some thought into it (like maybe several days thought). Gather info from other people who you used to play with, bring up old credit card or paypal history if you have it and scroll through old Facebook messages with League friends (any mention of buying new champs or skins?). \n\nAlso give Riot as much additional info as you can. If you used a credit card once to buy something, give them the card number. If you were ever punished with a chat restriction tell them roughly when it happened. etc.\n\nIf you need any help feel free to add me on discord at Tele#0343\n\nBest of luck my friend :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-06T14:36:09.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add to what Tele has said. You don't have to answer all of the questions support gives you, nor do the answers have to be 100% accurate. For example if they ask the date of your first skin purchase, without some kind of record noone is going to remember that, but you could give them say, the end of season 3 kinda timeframe. It's not AS useful, but it still serves to prove ownership.\n\nAlso, you can give information more or different than support has asked for. Any information regarding the account that is not visible to someone with access to said account is useful. Any skins you remember buying the day they released for example. Or skins you bought in bundles. Skins you got from hextech crafting or gifts (if you remember who from it's an extra bonus). Any information of that sort is useful for verifying ownership.","replies":[{"poster":"RolyPaulie","date":"2017-04-07T10:30:18.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried to answer as many of the questions as I could but unfortunately Riot Support says it wasn't enough or it was incorrect. This is my fault, I should have kept these answers written down somewhere. This is just way too hard for me to remember nearly  years ago, most of my memories of this game are of playing it and not buying my first champions.\n\nI'll try again but I don't really know what to say to prove it's mine, I could try to name all the skins I own.\n\nThank you for replying!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-07T13:00:33.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't have to be your first champions. Say you remember buying Lucian on release, that is useful information. Maybe you bought one of the Legacy skins, telling them what year you bought them in is useful information. It doesn't have to be stuff from 7 years ago, it just has to be stuff further back than the purchase history at the time of compromise and that isn't otherwise visible on the account.\n\nMaybe you don't remember when you got a skin, but you know it was a mystery gift. That is useful. Maybe you got one you really wanted from hextech, again, useful. Maybe you remember which champ you got Mastery 6 or 7 on first (ofc this is only useful if you have a few at that level).\n\nYou aren't limited to the questions they give you, nor are you limited to information from back when the account was created. The questions they give you are a guide to get you on the right track, but if you can't answer enough of those, then give them some extra info that will help them.","replies":[{"poster":"RolyPaulie","date":"2017-04-07T23:11:55.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I just told them all the skins I owned, they said it's not enough information for them to discuss the ban. I honestly don't know what else to say that can prove it's mine. All that other stuff I've said as well, like I know I received Pool Party Lee Sin as a gift and I got Super Galaxy Rumble from a Hextech.\n\nI'll try give them information on which champions I mastered (I think I have 3-4 at level 5).\n\nThanks for trying to help me man!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-08T04:02:11.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A list of skins you own is useless to them because it's visible on the account. Anyone who had access could have gotten a list of skins you owned. It needs to be information that could NOT be obtained by having access to the account.\n\nIn the same vein, telling the what champions you have mastery on is also useless for the same reason. If you can give a timeframe on when you acquired mastery that is different, but simply listing it doesn't prove ownership at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FaTXmInG","date":"2017-04-07T03:17:42.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was banned yesterday . i though it is bug. did u send ticket to riot support?? mate","replies":[{"poster":"RolyPaulie","date":"2017-04-07T10:30:42.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I sent a ticket into riot support.\n\nThank you for replying!","replies":[{"poster":"FaTXmInG","date":"2017-04-07T15:30:07.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what did riot support say? unban account?","replies":[{"poster":"FaTXmInG","date":"2017-04-07T15:32:55.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they said i used third party program in game, but i did not.","replies":[{"poster":"RolyPaulie","date":"2017-04-07T23:09:29.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They won't discuss the ban with me unless I can verify it's my account by answering these questions or similar questions.\n\nAccount Creation Date: \nDate of Birth on the account:\nLocation where account was registered:\nPlease explain how you first gained access to this account: \nOther people who have ever had access to the account:\nWhat was your first ever RP purchase?: \nWhat did you use your refund tokens on?: \nDo you remember the first 5 champions you have purchased?: \nFirst 5 champions you ever purchased: \nFirst 3150 IP Champion: \nFirst 4800 IP Champion: \nFirst 6300 IP Champion: \nDid you receive or give gifts on this account?: \nGifts Received: \nGifts Given:","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
