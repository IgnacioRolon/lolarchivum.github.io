So can you please make a new spell \r\nthat can be used in Summoners Rift. \r\nCheers, belibez.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-01T22:36:44.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"..Evan","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boomshakalacka","date":"2015-05-01T11:13:24.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait no revive lol didn't even realise coz no one used that shitty summoner spell perhaps they could make 1 where u r temporarily invisible or in targetable for a period of time for a quick escape","replies":[{"poster":"Cloudy342","date":"2015-05-01T12:29:32.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's like a buffed version of Zhonya's. {{item:3157}} But then again, it'll give you an early game advantage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloudy342","date":"2015-05-01T07:59:23.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How about a summoner spell that temporarily increases attack damage or ability power?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-01T08:10:26.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There used to be one called Surge, which increased attack speed by 35% and ability power by 10-78 (based on level) for a few seconds.
