CSing seems to be a big issue not sure if you're trading to much or just plain missing but try and hit them as they go for CS while making sure you can get as many of your own as possible 260 cs should be a benchmark for a 40 minute game in bronze at least which is your average game time. Looks like you're caught out a lot probably in a solo lane pushing due to your high number of deaths consistently. Winning the game comes first of course but a tanks role isn't to die it's to take the highest amount of damage possible while disrupting the enemy then live ideally at least imo. Try and steer clear of blitzcrank support if you're not able to hit 70% of hooks it's not particularly worth having him as when his hooks down its essentially 1v2. As far as your champion selection goes Nasus Renekton Jinx Annie and Lux are all splendid choices especially for your skill tier. Probably steer clear of varus cassieo and riven till you're more comfortable, higher skill ceiling isn't always better. As far as itemization goes you really REALLY struggle at buying boots, not having boots by 40 minutes is a huge problem not having them by 20 is a huge problem Ninja Tabi and Merc treads are so strong for top lane it's probably a large factor in you getting camped or kited throughout the game. Your itemization could use a little work, if you having any questions about that (runepages, Masteries) general gameplay you can add me if you'd like thats all i can really tell you just from your match history.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-28T04:07:51.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just a tip: make sure to make more fullstops/punctuation, as it is very hard to read all that writing without it\n\n:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"consaibot47","date":"2016-09-28T02:44:57.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey and thanx max range i have added you. account name is ( shazza wins ) i would love to get the help, ive stoped playing as much as i use to play due to getting annoyed at my self for loseing games :({{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"consaibot47","date":"2016-09-28T02:40:17.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey thanx guys, hey max range do you think i can add you, not on this account but my main account :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Max Range","date":"2016-09-28T00:05:05.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm only Platinum, but I'd be happy to help!
