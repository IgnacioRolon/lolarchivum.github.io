If someone is harassing you, just mute them instead and you won't have this problem.\n\nPermanent bans are also the final step in the [4 tiers of punishment](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback), meaning either you have been warned and punished before for negative behavior, or your behavior this time was so severe that it warranted escalated multiple punishment tiers.\n\nYou admit to harassing other players, so it doesn't sound like there was any error in the system. If you want to discuss the validity of your punishment with the community I recommend posting your Reform Card here for us to view, and also mention what prior punishments you've had (if any).
