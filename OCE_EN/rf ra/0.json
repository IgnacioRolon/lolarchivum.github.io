Riven is a very easy kill for me.\n\nChat with your League of Legends friends, and if any of them have Riven, ask them how to counter Riven, and perhaps get into a custom match of fighting Riven with them (your friend use Riven against whatever champion you pick), this should help you to fight against Riven as well.","replies":[]}]}
