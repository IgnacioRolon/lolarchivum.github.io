Want to join an Australian ARAM clan? \n\nI have been a long time lover of ARAM and have seen quite the influx of NZ ARAM players sporting their NZARM clan so I decided to make an Aussie clan to perhaps start a friendly rivalry between our kiwi brothers n sisters\n\nFeel free to add me and join OZRAM\n\nEDIT: I have been in contact with the owners of NZARM as well a heap of their player base. Also now other ARAM clans around OCE and looking towards what we can do in the future between us all\n\nthanks all I'll see you on the bridge","replies":[{"poster":"Warbird01","date":"2019-04-14T12:21:04.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm korean n i love aram n i played long time to aram. can i join your clan Warbird01 it's my nickname n just send message or reply","replies":[]}]}
