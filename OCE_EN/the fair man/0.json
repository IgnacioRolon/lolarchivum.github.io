The notification is notoriously unreliable and *very* limited in when it shows. Not getting the notification doesn't mean no-one has been punished. Don't count on that notification, consider it a bonus and nothing more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-02T15:32:56.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report weight used to be a thing.

Back when the system came out, it would only notify the most recent report prior to punishment, and even though it has \"expanded\" a bit and will now (occasionally) notify multiple reporters, it's (as Seras said) notoriously unreliable and will often notify only 1 player (and I reckon it does occasionally fail to notify anyone, based on some of the feedback and first-hand accounts about the notifications).","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-04-02T14:39:04.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That isn’t how the system works. Unless you are consistently making false reports the system will check any reports you put in.  Also the number of reports doesn’t change a thing you can have 9 people report 1 person and it won’t change a thing, it’s the same as having 1 person report them. As for not getting a message saying they were banned this is a little old but I’m pretty sure it still applies it’s from deep terror Nami from the na boards “No, you can only receive the notification when your report is the one that triggers it. If the review and punishment is triggered in their next game you won't get it.”","replies":[]}]}
