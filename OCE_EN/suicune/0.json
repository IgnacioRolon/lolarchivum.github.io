I&#039;m currently Silver III on summoners rift ranked solo/duo and was Gold V last season so I expected maybe Silver V or Bronze I. But after all 10 games I got placed in Bronze V? I don&#039;t understand at all. Someone please explain why I got such a low rank?","replies":[{"poster":"Xenonfrenzy","date":"2017-02-02T13:16:15.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranks are relative, as far as your mmr for ranked TT is concerned you are in the bottom 10% of the ladder in terms of performance.\n\nYour ranked flex/ranked solo mmr and rank have nothing to do with your  ranked TT mmr and rank.\n\n\nTLDR: Ranks don't have any affect between different queues, only your performance affects this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-02-02T13:39:05.316+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct, you're basically start from the beginning in a new queue like this.  It's also worth keeping in mind that in general, losses/wins aren't always equivalent. If you were playing players who had a lower rating during your provisionals and lost, you might have lost more MMR than you gained from your wins, which could drop you further than you'd expect.","replies":[{"poster":"S7 GOD","date":"2017-02-03T03:01:10.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why do i never can play 3v3 its always aram or nexus siege I only can played  yesterday otherwise each time its not available.
