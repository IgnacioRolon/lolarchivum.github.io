You have two options. 1. Use a VPN or 2. Set your DNS manually.\n\nIf you don't already know how to do 1. then just don't attempt it. Usually costs more than it's worth.\n\nTo set your DNS manually depends on your OS. You need to be an admin to do the following. On Windows, you go into Control Panel>Network and Internet>Network and Sharing Center>Change adapter settings. Then, right-click your adapter and click Properties. Scroll down the box list until you reach \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\" and click Properties. Manually set your DNS to 8.8.8.8 as your primary and 8.8.4.4 as your alternative.\n\nThen flush your DNS.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
