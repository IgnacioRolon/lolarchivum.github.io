Basically none of my friends play LoL anymore and trying to get some new people to play and climb with. I can play any role but am probably best at top and ADC. Also wanna try playing some pre made 5s bc I haven&#039;t done that in forever and that was the most fun I&#039;ve had playing league. Hit me up if you wanna play!","replies":[{"poster":"godsrighthand600","date":"2017-03-16T13:58:02.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man add Kairutox hes looking for some players.","replies":[]}]}
