Oh my bad I forgot we can’t allow adc to have a counter as a class. I mean adc only have life steal, percent damage reduction, ga, a cleanse, mr with a magic shield. And that’s not counting all the supports item to protect them. Let’s not forget that they out range every champ in the game and thanks to rapid fire they can seige decently well  and they can crit for easily +800 damage. Let’s not forget that zed falls of hard late game as it becomes all most impossible to burst an adc through all the free shields and heals that are chucked their way not to mention the supports protecting them","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-19T22:52:58.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea..... I'm guessing you don't play ADC aye?\nI doubt you'd be saying these things if you had an inkling of what ADC life is like.\n\nAny assassin can pretty much always kill any ADC at almost any point in the game, if they can't, the player is pretty damn shit! Seeming an assassins kit is purpose built around that 1 simple task _(and in an assassin meta as well)_. \nRiot have even said as much, that no matter how fed, assassins should always be able to take down the high priority target. _(otherwise they'd be a useless class when not fed)_.\n\n> I mean adc only have life steal, percent damage reduction, ga, a cleanse, mr with a magic shield.\n\nLifesteal is very ineffective against assassins, _(not least because assassins nearly always take ignite as a summoner spell)_,  becasue assassins burst down the enemy so quickly they don't have enough time to lifesteal, _(1 or 2 seconds isn't enough for an ADC to out-lifesteal an assassin's burst damage.)_\n\nPercent damage reduction is also useless against assassins, seeming assassins do burst damage not sustained damage. _(like, thats basic stuff man... come on.)_\n\nGA, lets not forget that if you're an AD assassin, chances are you're more likely to have this than the ADC.\n\nCleanse, how does that help them escape your insane burst? Last time I checked, most assassins didn't have hard CC to cleanse....\n\nMR with magic shield, you mean this: {{item:3156}}? or this: {{item:3814}}? Both are... **assassin** items bro. Built for and structured around... **assassins**. If an ADC is using them, then they are severely compromising their lategame damage, which should make them easier to kill, not harder.\n\n> Let’s not forget that they out range every champ in the game\n\n{{champion:268}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:115}} {{champion:142}}  \nTo name a just a _few_, Much outrange, such wow.\n\nThe assassin class is 100% purpose built to kill high priority targets such as ADC's\nIf you are failing to do that _(especially as Zed, late game...)_, something is drastically wrong...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-19T10:13:30.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally loved the strategic thinking that you had to do when playing reworked LB.\nDumbing her down again to 'hover cursor, spam all buttons as fast as possible.' is a bad move, especially seeming many mages/assassins already embody that play style.\n\nThe strategy and thinking made her unique, but more importantly fed into her 'The Deceiver' theme, which made playing her that much more immersive.\n\nWe dont need another braindead supernuke assassin, _(who once your fingers memorise a single combo)_, is hell to play against.\n\n____________\n\nBuuuuuuut what about Kindred?
