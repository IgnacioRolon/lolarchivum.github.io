Her q got nerfed so her early game isnt as strong she has no get a-ways besides a passive that you need to get a kill with or an assist. her zap is a skill shot that in lane is easy to dodge as long as you don't put yourself in a place to get fucked, her q during lane phase costs a hell tone of mana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-21T17:49:27.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBJepfm2cGs\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StE-f3PqSQ8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PLgn_5mNxg\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCIHiAV7J8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4x3dXai7vo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7UFgTWE898\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnhS4PwkIws","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-21T04:34:11.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i believe she is balanced right now especially after the Q attack speed nerf.
