Her bubble stun thingy has a small delay, so place it on enemy path instead on enemy.\nHer ult is very useful in team fight, can use it to split up enemy party or chance running enemy\n\nI am also new, and I main soraka for support, feel free to add me in game :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rooksy","date":"2016-03-13T23:57:09.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey hey, I peaked at 4.8k MMR back in 2013 before swapping over to League to play with friends. League supports are very different to DOTA2, but the role is much more consistent in terms of gold, experience and your teamfighting ability. \n\nIn lane, you want to help your ADC trade even or favourably with the enemy ADC, while minimising the effectiveness of your rival support. \nSoraka has great poke with her Q, you should be using this consistently to harass and gain health to heal your ADC. \nNami is more of a waiting game. You should save your Q and poke with W. Use your Q (and E your ADC) to interrupt the enemy ADC or Support at a critical point in the trade.\n\nBoth are ridiculously spammy compared to DOTA2 supports. While you learn the game, I'd stick with Soraka - she's mechanically simple and her purpose is to keep everyone alive. Nami can be quite complex and is often required to initiate or make picks. \n\nGood luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-11T12:05:53.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Banans, they have a nice taste to them\nI enjoy them alot in banana form, cake form, fritter form, or even smoothie or milkshake form\nBananas are amazing\n\nWelcome to LoL\nI have played Dota2 and LOL\n\nNow i dont know if it is just because i started on LoL but i find it much more fun and easier\nDota2: so many champs i dont know waht to do, what to build itesm, donkeys all sorts\n\ndifferent tower mechanics\ndifferent stats and roles\nI dont feel like i hit hard on that game\nin LoL i really feel like ive hit someone or a minon\nin dota 2 i feel like i havent\n\nNow soraka and Nami... I havent played the new soraka and never played nami\nBut it looks like your support\nthe way i see it is it is your job to harrass the hell outta the other team. try to get damage stuns everything on them\nMake them scared of you.. if you run towards them they back off and miss out on CS\nusually if there is a siege minion i harass hard make sure they miss it. Run at them throw skills.. scare them\nIf i see an oportuninty i'll Stun them.... i usually support Lux morgana or blitzcrank\nI like the support that can stun or really change the game by pulling the enemy in, i dont like thresh so much as i have to hook and go in.. but thresh has lanterns which is cool\n\nI dont know dota2 champs very well but if there is someone on dota2 you are used to, explain their skills and im sure someone will direct you to that type of champ\n\n\n* i can eglish but much scotch to be had by now\n** this post probably didnt help at all :P","replies":[]}]}
