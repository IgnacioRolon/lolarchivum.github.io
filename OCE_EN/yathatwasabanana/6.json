You go on the boards, ask for friends to play with, then reject a bunch of people for \"too low rank\". This is asshole enough but then...\n\n2. You are unranked. This is just ridiculous. You say someone is too low ranked, but you aren't even ranked. Your logic just goes out the window.\n\n3. No, you are not Diamond skill level. You are no where near Gold skill level to be honest. You haven't experienced how ranked it and how hard it is to climb. Time to face up to the facts. Your boyfriend is only saying that to make you feel good.\n\n4. Your entire original post is just redundant. If you want friends to play with, don't complain on the boards in the first place, and if you do, at least accept people when they agree to. You are unranked. The only players \"too low ranked\" for you are level 29s and below. \n\nI swear you came on here to be a toxic incoherent retard, and not to actually make friends. I play with a Challenger friend sometimes, sure he hacks my friends accounts but he's still good? Fact is I don't get any better by observing his play and watching his strengths. I still stay shitty bronze, and improve on my own.\n\nYou do not improve at all, because you clearly don't play ranked. Go ahead. Play provisionals. If you get past Bronze I will eat my words.\nOh btw, I can see you are a support main. Your masteries and rune pages are absolutely horrible, you clearly don't have much game knowledge whatsoever, and sorry to break it to you, but if you are only playing normals, support takes pretty much 0 skill. \n\nEven playing with a diamond player you still get matched with fair opponents, so 1-2 enemies are around your skill level, which I have determined it to be low. \n\nIn conclusion, you were unranked, don't have many friends to play with, go online, ask to play with people, get people to play with, reject them because they are too low rank, and finally reveal that you are unranked, you get hate.\n\nYour a toxin, kid.","replies":[{"poster":"YaThatWasABanana","date":"2016-04-10T04:02:04.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know what source you have to look at my rank but I'm unranked, and cant rank untill I get enough champions.. Saying support takes no skill is far from the truth - As you said you're bronze so your words are literally from someone with no knowledge of the game. My rune PAGE and mastery PAGE (not plural) are fit to my playstyle which is poking and roaming, the runepages aren't complete yet with lack of IP. my mastery PAGE is changed every champion select for different circumstances, so both runes/masteries are irrelevant. End of the day you're bronze you have no say. You're stuck there with a solid % of the oce community, you're no special snowflake. \n\nHere I am going to get at least plat this season maybe diamond and be the top 2% of OCE. You should work on your own rank before even talking on boards - calling others trash at the game.\n\nsaying I rejected a bunch of people? It was one person and I accepted his friend request and he knew that. I think you need to mind your own business. I'm glad I didn't make friends with you.

Don't even say I have no knowledge of the game. That's the most retarded thing I've heard since people saying Clinton > Trump.\n\nAnd my personal skill level has nothing to do with this conversation.\n\n_\"I don't know what source you have to look at my rank but I'm unranked, and cant rank untill I get enough champions..\"_\n\nThat's the point... you don't play ranked, there is no way you are up to ranked standards.\n\n_\"Saying support takes no skill is far from the truth\"_ \n\nYeah, it is. If you read again I said that in normals your getting carried. You have played very little games. \n\n_\"Here I am going to get at least plat this season maybe diamond and be the top 2% of OCE. \"_\n\nOk then, get Diamond. Prove me wrong. I will eat my words. If this is your main account then you make me laugh.\n\n_\"You should work on your own rank before even talking on boards - calling others trash at the game.\"_\n\nI don't recall ever calling you trash at the game, my point is you can't ask for friends, then say they are too low rank, when you aren't even ranked. It just make sense.\n\n_\"You should work on your own rank before even talking on boards\"_\n\nWell considering I have been posting for 2 years, and have nearly 1 fifth of the lifetime up votes of the most popular Blue, then yeah. I'd say my opinions are here to stay. Sorry to let you down.\n\nLook I'm glad you sorted it out with the rando, but next time you go on the boards asking for friends to play with, and your unranked, saying someone is too low rank it just ridiculous. Your argument here is poorly formatted, not to mention poorly written, and you are taking things out of context, and most importantly, just making things up instead of quoting.\n\nYou need to realize that until you are ranked, you are unranked. You only have the right to be selective about player ranks when you have achieved a high rank. I really honestly doubt you will get Plat, let along Diamond, and if you do, it's getting carried as support. But you can't ask people to play then reject them if technically, they have a higher MMR than you.\n\nWhich means they have a higher ELO, and technically, they are a higher rank. So are they too high rank for you? By the way, I wasn't saying support takes no skill, I mean it clearly does, but I am saying that when you think your a mechanical god because you go good as support, you might be getting ahead of yourself. You have a lot less to focus about than say an ADC, JG, Mid. It's not braindead as much as it is easy.\n\nAlso, we were discussing your rank and your post. Not mine. You cannot bring my Bronze rank into this argument, because it is out of context. I have very good game knowledge. Clearly more than you. I have been playing this game for three years. But where my knowledge thrives, my mechanics lack. I am not such a good player mechanics wise. That is why I'm bronze. \n\nI haven't seen you play. Maybe you are actually a gem after all. Maybe I'm stupid for thinking you are at low ELO skill level. But my point is, you are unranked, and you have yet to prove it. So come back when you are Plat or Diamond and then spit at my face. But you don't make any sense when rejecting players with higher MMR than you, and saying it is because they are too low rank.\n\nAlso if all you play is normals, then how do ranks make any difference to you anyway? That's just retarded.\n\nAlso, about 20 days ago you said you had two other accounts, both Plat 1. If this is true, then why haven't you mentioned it here, only mentioning that you are unranked. I'm sorry but I detect some lies. What are your other account names?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"YaThatWasABanana","date":"2016-04-10T19:05:05.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"tl;dr stopped reading when you said you've been here for 2 years, in which case you'd have been around in General Discussion. Or in the GD chat on the client, which both I don't recall you being on/in either.\n\nFor someone of 2+ years experience in the game and to still be bronze you're obviously doing something wrong, for someone of 2years experience on boards/GD to get ticked off by the most obvious bait of all time... PLEASE tell me you're joking lmao! you seriously take 5+ minutes to type an argument over something so petty. Please, next time understand it's a bait and don't try to act superior. You are low-class and your upvotes mean nothing to me. Ive been downvoted more than anyone on boards except for maybe petanko or molendo. You need to git gud. \n\nI will get diamond this season by only supporting as it was a challenge I set myself to prove to people like you it can be done with \"bad\" teams.
