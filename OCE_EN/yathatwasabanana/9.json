I play with my boyfriend a lot but I am really toxic and if he makes a mistake that is detrimental to my lane, usually after I warn him not to do the stupid thing and he does the stupid thing, I flame for a few minutes focusing on that one mistake rather than taking it as a challenge to beat my opponent who is now ahead of me. Personally I would just say don't play with him, or mute him, perhaps even have a talk to him about how his attitude towards your gameplay is making you feel. I'm sure you'll be able to find some queue buddies to play with rather than having to put up with a flamer. Completely up to you though. He needs to realize that you are new to the game and of course you're not going to make massive plays, you WILL make mistakes, everyone does. Hell I've been playing for 3 years and I STILL make rookie mistakes with fail flashes and missing my {{champion:1}}  ult by a mile, but I try to learn from that. Certainly doesn't help when you've got someone pointing out these obvious mistakes which you know were silly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-13T01:03:50.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dump him and find someone else?\nproblem solved","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-13T06:09:58.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dumping someone over a videogame is just stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-03-13T06:48:07.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you could say that it's 'JustTrash' =P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-13T06:14:38.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only just came here from dota.
