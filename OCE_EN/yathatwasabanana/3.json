The pigs cry out in pain, they explain it would feel like their insides burning up for the minutes they have to live before they die to the gas. I asked my friend how would she suggest we kill the pigs for meat, my friend thinks we shouldn&#039;t kill them to begin with. So i&#039;m like aite fair enough, I&#039;ve seen my fair share of disturbing videos and I cant think of a more humane way to kill pigs other than a bullet to the brain, (which i assume there&#039;s reasons they don&#039;t do that) So after I offend my friend by explaining pigs are our food and it doesn&#039;t matter how we kill them, with the argument all meat eating animals kill &amp; eat their prey alive &amp; or kill them in a much more disturbing painful way, my friend doesn&#039;t want to discuss the topic any further. So i accept that, I then reopen the tab of which i watched the video she sent me and the next video suggested is &quot;5 least painful ways to kys.) Why would it suggest that video?

Certainly hunting may be the most viable option, but there would also be plenty of plant life available. As long as they had a half decent knowledge of how to identify \"edible\" plants they could *potentially* survive, making the point mute. Even if they didn't have such knowledge, they could take the risk and try foraging rather than hunting anyway.\n\nA better analogy might be a desert, where you would find minimal plant life, or an island where the only immediately available food source is fish (of course, \"fish isn't meat\" *apparently*).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-30T13:24:48.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The energy it takes to forage and keep warm in that environment would be a great amount, its unlikely most people could survive on plant life alone even if they did have the knowledge, but you're right, its certainly possible!\n\nI may have to use the desert analogy next time then, that is a good point\n\nand yes... i fail to see how fish/molluscs etc are less of an animal than reptiles/mammals  (especially seeming octopi are one of the most intelligent animals.) but when you're deluded enough about reality to be vegan in the first place, I guess regular logic no longer applies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YaThatWasABanana","date":"2016-07-30T10:49:07.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grubby Paws","date":"2016-07-30T22:57:54.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a vegan (per se, which I'll get in to more later) and there are many reasons why someone may choose to do so. Whether it be ethical, environmental or health related the decision that someone has chosen should be respected. The most important thing is to approach the discussion with an open mind.\n\nThere is significant research over the western diet, the obesity epidemic and health and I encourage you to take the time to read in to the literature and make the decision for yourself. In addition to this, animal agriculture is a very energy and space intensive industry. But again, take the initiative and explore this yourself. I'm not going to get deep in to the subject on the league of legends boards but if it's something you are interested in I can suggest a few places to start.\n\nToo often, people get their emotions embroiled in their argument and stop arguing rationally which it sounds like your friend did. Lord Sesshomaru's argument is the meat eaters version of this. If I were stripped naked and left in the wild perhaps I would eat meat, most likely i would consume my protein by eating insects. The primary source of protein for a vegan is legumes which would be extremely hard to come by in those situations and at least I know I could capture and kill insects ethically. Regardless, this situation would almost certainly not occur which makes the argument somewhat invalid. \n\nAs far as the fish eating is concerned. These people aren't vegans. A vegetarian who eats fish is a pescatarian. A vegan won't eat any animal based products. No meat, eggs, dairy, honey or related products. In actuallity, my diet is considered a plant based, whole foods diet as the term vegan is meant to cover all aspects of your life. It is just often misused in our society. \n\nAnyway, I could continue on all day and this kind of defeats the purpose. Your diet and the way you live your life is YOUR decision. Don't let your friend or the people on this forum influence you without first being informed. If it is something you are interested in, research it properly and then decide what you feel is right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-07-30T13:02:23.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're probably better off googling this subject rather than asking the largely teenage audience on this forum. Most teenagers don't develop a notable sense of empathy or deeper thought until they are almost 18, girls usually before boys, but only by a year or so, on average.\n\nVegan =/= Vegetarian.\n\nVegan is usually the extreme side of the bar, and they come in 2 forms, super morality warriors who are quite often deluded about reality, and those who eat that way for health/dietary reasons.\n\nVegetarian is just not eating meat. Many Hindus don't eat meat for example, but eat all sorts of dairy and otherwise, making them vegetarian.\n\nThe argument to be made, is that humane deaths, treatment of life, etc. is important. We developed the Geneva Convention for war, something that contradicts the feeling of war, that you should eliminate the enemy completely, because greater minds came to a realisation that when you dismiss the value of life in the minds of the people and let them kill all their enemies, it's a rather... rabbit hole effect, it's hard to bring a culture/society back from something like that without some pretty amazing revolutions. \n\nTheir is no difference in valuing human life and valuing the life of animals in many respects. Most people in the modern world wouldn't be able to bring themselves to slaughter an animal themselves and/or would be changed by the experience if they did, because they have not been exposed to the reality of it. \nMost meat is culled and cleaned for you and you just go to a restaurant or supermarket to have your fill. If you had to hunt wild game and put your life at risk like those of our expansive past, you would probably have a far greater respect for life than the view that \"they are our food, it doesn't matter how they die\".\nTake the native American Indians for example, before they were decimated by outsiders, they were savage, but their view of the wild and it's inhabitants was one of respect, they took and used what they needed and wasted nothing.\nWe waste too much on top of our seeming uncaring of our animal neighbours.\n\nThe conversation could go on for hours, days, weeks, and it all comes down to preference until the majority of society dictate which one is \"true\" and adopted as policy, policies that change with the wind, as does people's attitude towards any other social issue.\n\n- A Meat Eater\n\nEDIT;\nPS.

As far as I'm concerned, the fact that humans are innately different because we operate on more than instinct separates us from most/all other species and, because of that difference, the way we treat the living creatures that are destined to be our food is part of what defines us. We can't simply take the moral high ground of \"other omnivores/carnivores do just as bad if not worse so why should we change?\" because we are distinctly different. We are far more advanced and, as such, should take a more advanced stance on how we attain our food.\n\nAs for what methods we could use, I couldn't say. Euthanasia comes to mind, but I'm sure that's come up before and would likely have a reason for it not being used (Maybe it would \"taint\" the meat to be too dangerous for consumption? I don't know, honestly). Maybe we could go all medieval on this and use guillotines (I'm sure that decapitation is much less painful than current methods, and likely a great deal more efficient).\n\n> I then reopen the tab of which i watched the video she sent me and the next video suggested is \"5 least painful ways to kys.) Why would it suggest that video? Would it mean many people who have watched this animal rights video would also look at that video?\n\nThat honestly doesn't surprise me. Seeing those kinds of videos can really affect a person, more so if that person has a strong stance against eating/using meat/animal products. If you add that to the world we live in, it could drive a great many people to consider such a \"solution\" because they simply can't see a way to change anything (at least not significantly).","replies":[]}]}
