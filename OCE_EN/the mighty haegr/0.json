Why is there no way to navigate to the other regions E-Sports sites from the OPL site? \r\n\r\nCould be that the NA site has some way of detecting I&#039;m from OCE so that&#039;s why there&#039;s no OPL in the drop down menu. That still doesn&#039;t resolve the fact that once on the OPL site, you need to take extra steps (address bar, etc) to get to a different E-sports section which you don&#039;t have to do with other regional sites. \r\n\r\nIf the OPL straight up isn&#039;t in the drop down though, seems like Riot just doesn&#039;t want to promote the OPL. Which is the most likely thing IMO, especially running an OPL series alongside the LCK Finals tonight.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-08-31T06:21:43.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback Mighty Haegr - you have a strong point!\n\nI'm fairly confident this was a decision made as opposed to just something that we overlooked, but I can't recall why - so I'm going to ask some questions.\n\nThanks a lot for passing on the comment :)","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-09-02T07:59:52.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the same reason they scheduled the OPL Grand Final at the same time as LCK Regional Qualifiers - the OCE Rioters are morons.\n\nI was making this same point about OPL not getting advertised on the LoL Esports website [TWO SEASONS AGO](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/Hc3HFjce-ok-weve-had-competitive-lol-in-oce-for-2-full-seasons-now).","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-09-04T23:58:14.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ABlueQuaker,\n\nWe thought it would be a better experience for the Oceanic players to have the OPL Grand Final at the time where most of them want to watch some Esports, which meant kicking off at 5pm on Saturday. Naturally there is some fans who would prefer to watch the LCK Regional Qualifiers, and that's totally cool - but for the OPL supporters, we wanted to put it on at the best time slot we could. Sorry that this didn't work out for you.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-09-05T08:51:30.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fortunately I have two screens so I had LCK on my Primary Monitor and OPL on my Secondary Monitor with the sound muted. Still doesn't make your decision any less flawed. Honestly, OPL has enough trouble just competing against streamers - putting it up against KOREAN Regional Qualifiers was pure stupidity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
