I&#039;m here to say that I hate the new system with blue essence. Because 1. The only way to get all the champs now is to pay! And 2. I have 4791 BE! I need 9 more! But I need to level up. If the ip system was there, I could have gotten the champ I want today! But no. I have to wait until Saturday or Sunday or even Monday. \r\nTL;DR Switch back to the old ip system.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-21T20:37:09.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Between this and the insta 14 day suspensions being handed out like candy, riot are doing a lot of damage to their brand with existing customers .

Ea tried that with sim city, dungeon keeper and swbf2 - they killed those games by making monetisation the focus rather than game play. It sounds good to accountants and consultants but when you screw your players the numbers dont materialise and you're left with a dead game. Such a shame because riot really had the best ftp model.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-21T22:25:56.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah because a lot of people don't understand that \"whales\" might make your games, but the \"whales\" get bored when no one else is playing, \"whales\" don't like playing by themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-11-22T06:03:04.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, the only good years in league were 2014 and before. \nNow, they're losing their playerbase.\nedit: years not year\nedit 2: were not was","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-21T21:43:26.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only been here since season 2 (before OCE existed), and I have never seen LoL in a worse state than it is in now.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-23T05:32:01.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally i played a little in season 2 or 3, not sure which (i didn't enjoy the Ping for NA before the OCE server so i didn't really get into it.)\n\nBut played a decent amount since Season 4 (OCE exists) and honestly, i feel it's been getting worse every year.\n\nAnd it will only continue to get worse and worse, because Tencent's focus for Rito game is milking this shit dry before it just dies.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T09:44:20.284+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=agZ0HggL,comment-id=00020002,timestamp=2017-11-23T05:32:01.321+0000)\n>\n> Personally i played a little in season 2 or 3, not sure which (i didn&#x27;t enjoy the Ping for NA before the OCE server so i didn&#x27;t really get into it.)\n> \n> But played a decent amount since Season 4 (OCE exists) and honestly, i feel it&#x27;s been getting worse every year.\n> \n> And it will only continue to get worse and worse, because Tencent&#x27;s focus for Rito game is milking this shit dry before it just dies.\n\nI've actually been pretty happy with it up until the last few months.
