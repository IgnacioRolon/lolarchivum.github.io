Currently, the ADC goes into a duo with a partner in the bottom lane, the partner usually goes a support champion. The role of ADC is to be the main source of physical damage in a team fight. Commonly these champions attack from a range, generally, the average range of an ADC is 550, although, sometimes this differs, champions such as Ashe, Vayne, Tristana, Caitlyn, Draven, etc. have ranges spanning between 500 and 650. Thought, these champions are easily killed, so they usually kite (run away while attacking) to deal damage without dying. But the easiest way is staying in the back line out of harms way to deal the damage. They usually sacrifice general tank stats in exchange for more damage.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-30T13:58:54.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i mean thats pretty much what i said xD","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-30T14:23:46.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sloth Almighty,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OdNnz8LO,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-30T13:58:54.451+0000)\n>\n> Well i mean thats pretty much what i said xD\n\nit is, the bold was just fixing your cryptic/wrong words","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-30T21:40:47.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if you wanna be OCD might wanna go back and fix the grammar on your correction reply ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-08-30T19:25:04.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then does anyone know a good, cheap adc?","replies":[{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-09-04T07:15:45.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epixragequit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OdNnz8LO,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-30T19:25:04.726+0000)\n>\n> Then does anyone know a good, cheap adc?\n\nI highly recommend Tristana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-30T23:19:17.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe,sivir and trist","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-30T23:15:13.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epixragequit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OdNnz8LO,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-30T19:25:04.726+0000)\n>\n> Then does anyone know a good, cheap adc?\n\nAshe.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-08-31T05:11:04.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then now I need to find a champion that can 1 hit or 2 hit at late game... lol","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T10:56:33.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Epixragequit,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OdNnz8LO,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-08-31T05:11:04.762+0000)\n>\n> And then now I need to find a champion that can 1 hit or 2 hit at late game... lol\n\nCait.\nCait with crit dmg runes and IE.\nThey step on a trap or get hit by your net, you auto attack and crit for their entire hp.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-30T22:21:29.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to clarify, ADC is an _acronym_, just so we can get that crystal clear.","replies":[]}]}
