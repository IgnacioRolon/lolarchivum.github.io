If you're an inexperienced player/newbie I RECOMMEND you to NOT play ranked at all. (i regreted jumping straight into ranked, have a look on oce.op.gg)\n * unless you happened to be coached by a gold or higher friend\n2. Just keep playing normals and learn the basics of each role, laning and have a decent champ pool\n3. then learn the strats in game. so when do drag, baron, teamfight, siege, push, defend etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-17T11:23:18.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long have you played the game for? If it's less than 6 months its best not to jump into ranked, you'll be way too green.\n\nI recommend **winning** 200 normals before even thinking about ranked games. While you are winning these 200 normals, focus on learning about 2 champions in each role. Apart from using your ip gained from winning these games to buy those 10 champions, also spend your ip on rune pages and runes for these champions (visit sites like mobafire to learn some tips and tricks on your selected champion).\n\nIf you have a background in other team war games it may help you in understanding macro plays ( i.e. strategy). Keep the objectives in mind, you win by killing the nexus, this is achieved by killing inhibitors, this is achieved by taking towers in front of those inhibitors. \n\nThere is no easy quick fix to winning games, you learn by experience mostly. If you wish to be a jungler, remember the ROLE of what a jungler is. That role is to get your team ahead. This can be by getting your laners ahead, establishing vision around objectives that are about to come up to be taken, and denying the enemy team these things.\n\nToo many new players chase around the map like headless chickens searching for kills. These players without a strategy end up in bronze. And when you end up in bronze its very hard to escape, because you have to play at a much higher level to carry your 4 bronze teammates who have no strategy in the game. It's much easier however to improve your skill and understanding before you jump into ranked, because then you have a chance of being placed ahead of those bronzers. This is not only beneficial in that your games will be more fun and rewarding because the skill level is higher, but you will also avoid so many trolls and feeders that demoralise teams in lower elo (80% of the entire  OCE server is ranked below silver 2).\n\nGood luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-01-18T19:56:55.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started around 2015 snowdown.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-17T12:34:34.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're still keen on ranked.

AD, AP are the main 2 and you can also have an AS and Tank page.\nLearn proper runes, masteries and builds from websites or from play testing in normals. probuilds.net is a usefull website.\n\n----------------------\n\n**Create a champion pool and select your roles**\n\nYou should try and focus your attention to 1-2 roles in order to become good at those roles. However there is no problem being a \"fill\" main if you are good enough at most roles.\nYou should pick 4-5 champions for your main role(s) and 2-3 for your other roles.\n\n---------------------\n\n**WIN atleast 300 normals** and maintain a 50% winrate\n\nThis is important as it gives you time to not only learn permutations within the game, but also gives you time to learn how champions work properly and how to win when playing against certain matchups.\n\n-------------------------\n\n**Learn what EVERY champions abilities do** and their powerspikes.\n\nToo often I have played with Bronze friends who say \"How does that even work\" or \"wtf i didn't know he could dash\". Its so important to know how each champion works and how they want to do damage. If you know this, then you know how to avoid it and beat it.\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Playing to learn**\n\nIf you focus on winning, too often you will become angry and disappointed when you don't. Even in losses we can learn to play better. Remember at the end of the day it is a game.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nLooking at your stuff: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Epixragequit\n\n1. you played a ranked game with a rune page that had 19 runes out of 30 and they were mostly tier 2.\n2. your mastery page only had 28 points in it.\n3. you kept your warding trinket after buying a sightstone. Always want to swap it for a sweeper.\n4. you didn't buy any control wards. this is an important part of the game, especially in the support role.\n5. you only have 62 normal wins. Thats not really enough to learn how this game works.\n\nSeeing this I would recommend 2 things. Don't play ranked until you meet the above 5 criteria AND download the replay of that ranked game and critique yourself. Everyone can see when they make mistakes when watching a replay.\n\nIf you want jungle tips there are youtubers like Foxdrop who make good educational jungling content.\nHere is a list of jungle streamers you can check out to learn from: https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/wiki/101/streamers#wiki_jungle_mains\n\nThere is also a reddit community called \"Summoner School\" that post tips and stuff.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} GL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2017-01-16T03:15:11.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My tip would be get your 2 rune pages full or enjoy bronze","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-16T00:43:26.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not advised to start Ranked as soon as one reaches lvl 30. Why do you ask? Because it's asking for a ticket to Bronze 5. Now Bronze 5 isn't impossible to climb out, but that you have to be vastly superior than any of your peers and opponents in order to make a meaningful climb, which while an easy task for any of the high-elo players, however for someone who learns from within the environment of Bronze 5 it's very hard, as it's like trying to be a good football player and make it big when everyone you play with or against sucks BBs.\n\nNot to mention the Ranked queue is role-based, and because auto-fill is a thing, most people should practice and be confident in at least 2 to 3 roles (including support) to be able to play confidently in Ranked. As such more reasons why you shouldn't jump straight into it after getting lvl 30.\n\nMuch like what the other guy has said, play more normals, you still have things to go through before you're ready for Ranked. You need at least 200 games won on Summoner's Rift Normal to really be considered ready for Ranked imho. So just chill and play more normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-16T00:41:09.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice is to not rush into ranked.
