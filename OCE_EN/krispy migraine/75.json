Not all players you report are necessarily worthy of punishment either.  Many players do just have off days, and sometimes they blow their top and vent their frustration in a multitude of ways.\n\nAdding players to your own personal 'Revenged' list would only promote negative behaviour, with people trying to grow their lists and smite certain players for any small indiscretion.\n\nIn essence, the player behaviour system is meant to _enhance_ everyones in-game experience, yes this is sometimes achieved by punishing offenders, but that is the method, not the goal. The goal is for everyone to enjoy their games.  Having a 'naughty list' doesn't help achieve that end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-05-12T08:47:29.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically there's no \"list\" you can see of what players have been punished off your reports.

One major point of the IFS notifications is that they were originally designed to show only the *most recent* reporting player when action was taken, so that can still (potentially) leave dozens of other players in the dark about whether an action was actually taken. While it's my understanding that Riot intended to expand the notifications, it also seems like the system is worse off than when it was introduced, often failing to inform *anyone* when action is taken as a result of their report.
