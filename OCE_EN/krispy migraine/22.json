Remember to give your jungler a leash (help them with a jungle camp AND DO NOT TAKE IT FOR YOURSELF) if they ask you, since it's something you will come across alot.\n\nMarksmen in the early game are generally pretty weak especially since most of their damage comes from auto attacks. You only become a real threat once you accumulate a lot of items so it's important to try and focus to last hit. It's good to try and harass enemies so you can bully them away from the minions and thus, from gold, but it's important that your last hitting minions yourself so your harass actually pays off. Once you start getting items then you start to feel pretty powerful.\n\nPositioning is really important in my opinion when playing a marksman. Your a really high priority in teamfights since Marksmen are generally pretty easy to kill and they are such a huge damage factor to the team. This means dive into the enemy team to take down the squishy back line. You want to focus on the frontline since you can safely attack them with your range and melt them quite quickly. This also means your safe, which is what matters most.\n\nFinally it's important to try and find a marksman that you enjoy playing. Assuming you have gotten used to the basics of League of Legends, {{champion:22}} Ashe, {{champion:51}} Caitlyn and {{champion:222}} Jinx are great champions to learn the ADC role. All of them have great utility and good damage and they all have long range ultimates which can help catch you up if you end up not doing so well in lane. All of them are pretty easy to pick up as well, especially {{champion:22}}, a champion who not only made me love the marksman role, but made me interesting in League again.\n\nFrom then you can decide which ADC's you are into. Once you find one that suits you, ADC will become a breeze. {{champion:21}} is well known for her ability to mow down a whole team with bullets thanks to her ultimate, {{champion:81}} is also a fairly popular adc as he likes to blink around and burst people with skillshots, if that is something you prefer to do. It's a good idea to take a look at all the various ADC's and how they play because finding an ADC that you love to play is the first step in become really good at the ADC role. It would be really cool if someone else could post their favourite ADC below and tell us what that ADC does best, to help this guy out.\n\nI personally like {{champion:222}} because she has the whole package. Good clear, nice AOE that can crit, great at taking down towers, has poke, can lock people down with support, Can snipe people from across the map, and can cleap up quite well with her passive. Combined with her awesome adorable personality xD.\n\nEDIT: A full list of all the champions that are meta for the ADC role are as follows:\n\n{{champion:22}}Ashe\n{{champion:51}}Caitlyn\n{{champion:42}}Corki\n{{champion:119}}Draven\n{{champion:81}}Ezreal\n{{champion:104}}Graves\n{{champion:222}} Jinx\n{{champion:202}} Jhin\n{{champion:429}} Kalista\n{{champion:96}} Kog Maw\n{{champion:236}} Lucian\n{{champion:21}} Miss Fortune\n{{champion:133}} Quinn\n{{champion:15}} Sivir \n{{champion:18}} Tristana\n{{champion:110}} Varus\n{{champion:29}} Twitch\n{{champion:67}} Vayne\n{{champion:203}} Kindred\n{{champion:6}} Urgot\n\nThere are some unique ADCs that are played every so often like {{champion:4}} Twisted Fate,{{champion:85}} Kennen, {{champion:412}} Thresh and even {{champion:82}} Mordekaiser (who isn't even ranged), but for now, you should focus on choosing from the list above.\n\nTL;DR:\n- Find a marksman that suits you first.\n- Last hit minions, your very weak without items.\n- Stay well away from danger, you are very easy to kill but you are a ranged character, so you should abuse this. Only attack the frontline in teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-10T10:42:37.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just flame everyone and you're halfway there.\n\nno in all seriousness. Generally take a marksman champion to the bottom lane with a support champion. Build try to last hit as many minions as you can and follow up on your jungler's ganks and your support's engages. build attack damage champions and try to stay safe in teamfights. You are almost always the enemy team's highest priority target and your death will be very detrimental. The reason you're so important is because you're the team's sustained damage, which is incredibly important","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-11T03:01:17.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how to be an attack damage carrylord.\n\nle support - *takes 1 cs by accident*\n\nle adc - *pings furiously on dead minion* \"wtf?! this supp so bad, ff at 20\"","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-04-11T03:28:58.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=u5Lxybt5,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-04-11T03:01:17.216+0000)\n>\n> how to be an attack damage carrylord.\n> \n> le support - *takes 1 cs by accident*\n> \n> le adc - *pings furiously on dead minion* \"wtf?! this supp so bad, ff at 20\"\n\nnoob shit support\n\nsb","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-11T10:06:58.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze support\n\nreport this alistar\n\ntook my kill","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-04-11T05:47:33.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you really wanna learn adc.
