Now i've been bronze 5 before, so i can tell you as someone who has been down there and got out, you need to lock in basic champions so you can learn the basics of the role you are playing. This means no kha, shaco or azir, nothing more complex then a screwdriver (xin zhao and trundle, perhaps amumu/warwick for jungle, Garen/trundle for top, Annie mid). Put some normals into these basic champs, then once comfortable on them, bring them to ranked. From here, you can learn the basics, as you don't have to focus on any complex mechanics and at bronze level, most people do this very poorly (myself included sometimes), so these basics alone should get you climbing if you can do them well, as long as you stick to these basic champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-05-18T05:23:30.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only champ i do decent with is brainless ww now\nedit: and i havent got a win in 11 games","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-17T09:36:05.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are jgling.
