As for me, 40 seconds after all the champion has been selected should be enough because I have enough pages, that I don't have to spend too much time editing runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-10-04T00:49:51.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sucks, since weâ€™re forced to do blind pick in the morning you barely have any time to do your runes so I just took grasp of the undying on twitch, because of client lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-10-04T04:46:20.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even one minute after all the champions are selected is not enough for you?\nHow long do you want? Two minutes, three minutes?\nDo something about your lag by optimising your computer, like ram, and other things, and try and get more rune pages. If you already have 20 rune pages you seriously don't need that much time. If you only have two rune pages I can understand why 30 seconds is not enough for you to edit the rune pages.\nSeriously, if riot make the countdown like two minutes, three minutes, or possibly more, then some players will find waiting that amount of time boring when they don't need that long to edit rune pages.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
