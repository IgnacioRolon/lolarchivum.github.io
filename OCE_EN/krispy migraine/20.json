After doing all the tasks required as a jungler, my dps is barely above support. Also, as op says junglers do have to keep clearing camps and it is hard to set up a gank ignoring camps to be cleared. It is really a bad thing for our jungler to be outleveled vs opponent jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Rectum","date":"2018-03-30T13:46:25.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you are not a good player and cant carry the team.

Junglers are not laners who continuously trade with lane opponents so their dps is of couse expected to be low (depends on champs tho) Also, if u hunt down weak lane and play clean, you do ur job doing minimal dmg and time possible. There is no such thing as afk farm. How can u call someone afk when a player is still active in game? Only thing differentiate a good jungler and bad ones are time usage and pathing. Also, there is no point doing fancy things without mastering macro of specific lane you are playing. I didnt op.gg you but problem with low elo players are that they always oversimplify things and make emotional relationship to what other teammates are doing in game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-03-30T02:02:06.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes sir","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-31T03:19:58.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the issue is if you're still 0/0/0 at 16min with no objective participation...\n\nAlot of the game is decided in the first 12min, and if you're only doing rotations, you're putting your team at a large disadvantage, since only one side has jungle pressure.\n\nA good jungler will actively contribute even just pressure to lanes, since unless you're doing something wrong, clearing jungle camps and rotations should only take about 60% of your time. What else are you doing during that remaining 40%?, controlling river vision? matching and tracking the enemy jungler? looking for a gank or ways to pressure a lane? providing a lane priority so that it can safely clear wards and establish their own defensive warding? \n\nAlot of junglers will do none of this, and they deserve to be flamed. Lanes aren't always shoved to tower either, whilst you're clearing camps, you should be looking at lane pressure and minion wave timings, maybe considering skipped two camps, ganking top as it bounces out and extends, and then wrapping around again to pickup the wolves and gromp you skipped and then recalling.\n\nYou're acting like jungle camps are super hard to kite and clear, and take so long to do, and that it's unreasonable to expect the jungler to contribute pressure to lanes, but really a jungle main should be able to take literally any champion and kite out a relatively fast clear with just the starting items and still have enough capacity left to play hearthstone whilst doing it.\n\nThe hard part of jungling is the macroplay and establishing good pressure and rotations, adapting this to consider lane priority, vision, incoming minion waves and powerspikes. Killing jungle camps is the easy bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-31T03:22:09.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also if you're the type of jungler who waits on the spot for 40-50s for their jungle camps to spawn, stop, don't play jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-30T04:09:16.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play for team gold effeciencys the most effective hedge bet","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2018-03-28T05:49:47.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trye aye, push like a maniac, got killed because not controlling vision well, start flaming\n\"Jg difference\" typical lol","replies":[]}]}
