I know some champs can get super strong when they are fed and are able to fight your team almost single handed. In my experience Fiora, Darius, Maokai are a few examples of champs that feel really powerful when they get ahead. \n\nI'm no pro at this game so i don't really know how to play against a powerful fed opponent such as this but i think it would come down to building correctly and evening out the playing field, to my understanding the kills give your opponent a nice gold advantage so trying to even out that gold advantage would make it easier to fight them. That said I know some champions are designed to counteract a certain way of playing (which is probably why they are divided into classes or roles) so it could be harder to deal with this champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-17T08:17:39.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its actually the exact opposite of that; this season has been the most team orientated league has ever been.\n\nYou clearly didn't play 3 or 4 years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-18T06:50:51.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.......

Mind you not much skill about gold level I know wtf but it does take skill if you're team play smarter you could possibly of won but let's be honest the only way you could of won that is if you had 2 adc of good skill and a good JG besides that a feed zed is gonna snowball the game and there is nothing you can do I know I was mid lane as zilean I went 38/0 against a zed we still lost cuz zed went hot and top and went 9/42 and he carried the game I could 1v5 there whole team could not stop me but I could not defend and push zed can and his team just pushed and won.","replies":[]}]}
