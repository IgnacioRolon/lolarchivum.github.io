If you go 21/3/7 its not as impressive if your team has an overall kill amount of 60. It would mean you were only in 28/60 kills which is less than 50%. You might as well have gone 1/0/5 in a game where you team has 12 kills.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T15:43:04.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damage, vision score, cs, objective damage, damage taken.
