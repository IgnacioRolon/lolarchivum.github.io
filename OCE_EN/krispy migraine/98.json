This detrimental self entitled attitude is conditioning a very undesirable personality. \n\nDont be the kind of person that when things go wrong; Instead of looking at oneself to truely understand what one could've done better; Start a victimhood narrative and look for perpetrators to blame. Aslong as there is someone to blame than you dont have to TAKE A HARD LOOK AT YOURSELF. \n\nPeople generally dont like to look and criticise their own actions. But those that do, they'll become the kind of person that others can depend on in times of need. Because those who are willing to admit to their mistake, wont pull others into a lie. And have adequate strength of character to bear humiliation. \n\nThat is the kind of people society look up to.","replies":[]}]}
