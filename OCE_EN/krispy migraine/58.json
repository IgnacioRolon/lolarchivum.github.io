Especially as most people are left with 100-300 RP after buying RP. The idea itself isn't bad but if it were 1RP - 100IP people would abuse the hell out of that seeing as you just need 10RP to get 1000IP. So that being you just have to get 100RP for 10000IP, which you can be using to buy runes and rune pages??(can't remember the price) champions and when they come out for IP chromas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-03T23:03:33.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry ahah, you're not missing out on much. 5 RP is worth about 4.8 cents.
