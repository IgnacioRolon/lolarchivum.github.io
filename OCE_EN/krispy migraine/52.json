Simply from a scale-ability perspective, majority manual review isn't feasible. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while using post game reporting is and always will be the most effective method for reporting (because it flags the game, allows you to leave permanent comments attached to that player's history, and teaches the automated system), reports sent through tickets will always be manually reviewed.\n\nThey won't necessarily be manually actioned. If the automated system is already onto the reported player they're unlikely to mess with that process, because they're close to action anyway and the more the automated system is allowed to learn on it's own terms, the better and the more efficient it is in future. There's also a whole slew of other reasons manual action might not be taken, but that's the one most relevant to the automated side of things.\n\nGameplay offences are in a bit of a tricky spot, in that they're harder for a machine to recognise (takes a lot more teaching for a machine to learn to recognise intent in action than in basic text), and far more time consuming for manual reviews to identify (watching a 40 minute game is harder than reading a chat log).\n\nThat's not to say gameplay offences don't get punished, because they do. They are usually just slower to be issued. Blatant gameplay offences often get caught first or second game, there's even been a few recent posts about it.\n\nAs for that popup, don't rely on it, *at all*. Treat it as a bonus, not as a source of information, because that's not what it is. If you get the message it means someone's been punished, but the reverse is not true. Even if your report directly contributed to a punishment for that game, you aren't guaranteed to get the popup. It's unreliable, and very limited in when it appears.","replies":[]}]}
