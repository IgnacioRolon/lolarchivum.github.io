So I panicked, thinking I would get permabanned. \r\nIf you&#039;re someone like me with lots of school and stuff, and can only fit in 1-2 bot games a day, you&#039;ll know the pressure of &#039;do I queue?&#039; or &#039;do I not queue&#039; \r\nMost of the time I pick not queue, but one time I decided to queue. And that was a bad idea. Because 1. I was playing with 2 of my very very new friends that keep walking into towers. And 2. The other people were bots. So the game took longer than usual. Then I had to leave. \r\nWhat I&#039;d like to have is no leaverbuster on bots. Because personally, I don&#039;t really care about people leaving on bots. \r\nOr you could add a gamemode that only lasts for 5-10 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-18T22:22:33.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go play beginner instead of intermediate bots then.
