It&#039;s quite difficult to actually get a game where you&rsquo;re actually making it even. 90% of the time I&#039;m either winning by far or getting absolutely destroyed. It&#039;s starting to get very very annoying now. Will we ever have a time where our games aren&#039;t too easy and aren&#039;t too hard?\nedit: just did a eve game where the enemy we afkd for the first 30 ish mins and we still lost. Even though it was our fault why is the matchmaking so bad. I'm currently on a 6 game losing streak a bit after my 10 game winning streak. I want to quit but I just can't. ","replies":[]}
