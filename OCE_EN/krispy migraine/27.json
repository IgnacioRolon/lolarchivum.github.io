If you build bruiser he takes too long to ramp up and he loses his greatest strength, his early game. I play shaco alot and he's a strong case of use his power to win early because lategame in teamfights his job is to wait for the team to engage and try to rush through the confusion to assassinate the backline and this isn't exactly reliable or especially effective unless he's already gotten his team ahead. He's pretty good once you have gotten the hang of him but shaco is an early game spiking jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-24T23:47:28.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ap shaco on the other hand does scale into lategame and though but he's not as strong early (again his earlygame is his greatest strength) and it's much much harder to play; he's pretty powerful at all stages of the game building tanky ap, especially lategame though his teamfighting isn't amazing. I personally feel this shaco build can be a little unreliable if you can't master the mindgames and so I rarely play ap but it's just as viable so long as your opponents aren't more experienced than you.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-24T23:18:10.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nightjar, you really need to learn to read.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-24T08:29:51.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always say this, but I only play ARAM, so my comments need to be weighted as such.\nShaco is great as is, I often top-dmg to champs as Shaco, and although champ masteries haven't been included for ARAM that long, he's one I got my S grade chest for pretty easily.\n\nWhat I'm curious about though, and why I post, is what do you think needs a buff? Could I be guessing that you play AD Shaco, and find him weak lategame because he scales with AP? Most ARAM Shacos go AP, unless the team is lacking in AD.\n\nI object to \"buff this/nerf that\" comments that don't actually suggest what needs buffing or nerfing. What in his kit is weak and needs buffing? Plz suggest objectively, not subjectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-24T14:44:31.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please don't use aram as a reference point for balancing, in summoners rift ad shaco is currently very powerful in the early game but he falls off hard in the mid and lategame and he requires heavy snowball and an extreme focus on ganking, counterjungling, pushing objectives and towers in the first 8-10min of the game since he needs his team to be ahead at this point, since he needs his team to be the stronger dominant side in any teamfights so he can assassinate high priority targets and not die, once everyone scales up and the game begins to focus on teamfighting. Ap shaco doesn't exactly fall off on the other hand persay but has a weaker earlygame, his ganks are weaker and he's much harder to use and isn't very useful in teamfights, so he's generally less viable. Lategame ap shaco is all about mindgames and his boxes and e and his clone becomes more of a mindgame tool rather than just doubling his damage and forcing you to try to focus one shaco down. \n\nThe issue is that in terms of gameplay it's very hard to be useful as shaco if you fall behind or your team is losing or the game goes too long. In most cases stealth asssassins who spike at lvl6 and don't fall off like kha and rengar are just alot more viable since even in the current fast paced meta the game is usually still pretty even prelvl6. I personally feel shaco shouldn't be changed too much; though making his clone a little more interactive would certainly improve his gameplay. Shaco is kind of weak at the moment bit he's not unplayable and whilst he falls off as the game goes on, his lvl2-5 ganking power is among the highest in the game and he can simply dominate games if you can play the map right and use his strong earlygame to carry his lanes to an early lead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Frag","date":"2016-08-24T09:22:23.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're probably shit at him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-24T08:20:25.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By your logic so does zed akali talon rengar kha'zix LeBlanc kassadin fizz evelynn ekko katarina riven vayne twitch pantheon yasuo  nocturne nid, pretty much anyone with a (sub)class of assassin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-24T08:14:54.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whilst he may need a little more damage; if you play shaco right there is no champion that can match him in extreme early ganking potential. If you think he's really weak you are probably not ganking enough since he's one of the strongest champions prelvl5 and if he's ahead, he's absolutely terrifying in the midgame. He's garbage when not snowballing hard though. If you haven't gotten a kill or assist in the last minute you are falling behind as shaco. He's strong early but he has a requirement of being able to keep up the snowball or at least have all lanes decided really early by giving his laners a large advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-24T08:16:08.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of shaco like an even earlier pantheon, have the game won in the first 12min and end early or you're going to have a hard time playing shaco well.","replies":[]}]}]}
