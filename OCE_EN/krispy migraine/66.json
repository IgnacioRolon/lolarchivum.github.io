We managed to win hard early, probably could have ended pre-20min, but we dicked around and chased kills, and at 40min, we literally couldn't scratch their malphite, leona and trundle. We ended up losing a 40-18 or something game.\n\nMy team refused to group, they thought since we had broken the base, since we had 2 inhibitors, that the game was already in the bag, and so they started taking jungle camps and chasing kills to improve their chance of getting a hextech chest or for our yasou to get his M7 token. Eventually my fears were realised as the effect of 2 thornmails, 2 randuins, 2 sunfires, a locket, a frozen heart, 2 deadmans and 4 ninja tabis stacked up.\n\nThis is what mastery tokens and hextech chests create. People chasing kills. Having this in ranked is unhealthy.","replies":[]}]}]}
