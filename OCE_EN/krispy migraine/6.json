His utility becomes pretty useless when cc, his q doesn't actually do any damage and goes on full cd if you cc him during its cast. He has double crit not because its broken, because he would be really useless without it, say you have say Lucian, he doesn't need crit to do his job, all it does is make his job easier as a boost, while yasuo, crit is his sustained damage, without it his damage is unreliable and quite weak. His shield is only to make up for his low base health, his low base armor+scale and the fact he doesn't have a natural mr scale like most other melee champs. His W has a large cd and is his clutch save, without it he would still be more useless than a nasus who missed the first 10 minutes of a game.\n\nIf you took his utility away he wouldn't be \"mediocre\" he would be a dogs shit that every now and then stabs a minion and does a wind shit on minions, he wouldn't hit his q on champs because he needs his dashes, only way he would hit is q is if their enemy is afk.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-26T23:35:47.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only dash?\n\nhecarim e, fizz q, akali ult too ever tried ulting through a veigar stun? you most definitely stop dead in your tracks.\n\nInfact i cant think of a single dash in the game that isnt not stopped by cc aside from shyvana ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-27T01:52:26.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol retard much? Veigar has a special stun if you read the tool tip it specifically states stopping all dashes on contact with the wall, before that added that feature in his miniature rework dashes continued through.\n\nAnd I specifically mentions stuns and snares before, not general CC because knockups and their sub categories do stop stuns, I only mentioned cc as yasuo because any form of cc other than a slow stops his dashes altogether(even slows reduce the dashes speed by a further 50% for every 20% slowed). How many times have you stunned or rooted a maokai and still had him pop up on you? Hw may times you presses snare as morgana and hit the shen but he still went over the wall how many times have you had quinn knock you back that little and then burst you anyway because her e hit you even when you presses w as ryze how many times has leona gotten to your adc because your zyra snare hit but didn't snare how many times have you ulted a tristana and ashe but she still finished her jump. You can't go and use champion specific cases to prove a general point. A general dash and a general snare/root does not stop dashes, hecraim can have his e stopped because its a damn run not a dash, fizz q doesn't stop when you stun or snare him, this isn't a specific scenario when he is going through veigar's e this is general. A sion ult and q will stun the dashee because there is a knockup before the stun and knockups do override dashes stuns and snares do not, but knockups and knockbacks do. How many times did the old akali (because new has shit all burst) kill you after you desperately tried to snare her but she already used the dash and got to you? yea. too many. Do silences stop akali mid dash? no, Do snares? no, Do Stuns? no, do slows? no(slows donot stop yasuo but they drasticaly reduce his speed, meaning at 67.5% slow he would have been better off walking anyway), Does an ahri charm stop any champion other than a yasuo dash? no. Does blind stop any other dash? no (blind prevents him casing and planning the dash due to removing vision of the target, which he needs to cast the dash, but yes this is a special case and does affect similar dashes like maokai which require a target, but 80% of dashes are linear anyway. Disarms such as entangle stop his dashes and the other disarm Polymorph doesn't stop other dashes either, they finish the dash then get transformed, yasuo stops on the spot and becomes a squirrel. Fear, flee and taunt all allow the afflicted to continue their dash then the effect overrides movement, on yasuo this effect is instant and puts his dash on a 10 second cd. Suppression also stoops his dashes but not other dashes, thats why malzahard has the easiest time versus a yasuo rather than say akali because he can put yasuo on a 10 sec cd and prevent the entre dash movement while akali can either still move out of range after he casts or get close enough to him to burst him as soon as the effect ends, she is also able to cast her w at the end point in the middle of her dash as the supress has no effect on her until the dash is over. Every form of cc heavily affects yasuo's dash by either stopping or altogether, preventing its usage (silence stops and prevents it, nasty cc), or reducing the speed of the spell by so much it's faster to walk. Meanwhile the only cc that affect the dashes on other champs is only the airborne category of knockups and knockbacks. \n\n TDLR; In champ specific cases like veigar yes the stun will stop dashes, only because it is champin specific, but in general dashes other than yasuo's e will not be stopped by a general stun or snare, the dash will continue its fully length and duration before applying that rooting effect, on the otherhand thing like blitzcrank or thresh q, or sion r do stun because they apply a knockup effect before the actual stun, and if you had any game knowledge you would know knockups override all dashes, while (non-special) stuns and snares do not stop any dash other than yasuo's.\n\nAs for that dash list.\nEvery champ in existence that dash a dash other than yasuo.\n\nFor special stun cases (ie. veig e)\nSion (ult is considered a run/dash, becomes cc immune)\nHecarim (Ult is unable to be stopped)\nMalphite (Ult is unable to be stopped)\nShyvana (Ult is unable to be stopped after buff)","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-27T02:19:52.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maokai isnt a dash, its a blink, so assuming you let the cast animation go through the stun wouldnt do anything as its already been cast.\n\nI think you need to have a read up on the differences between blinks and dahes, and the very small list of uninterruptible dashes (most of them are noted on the actual skill itself because its not common but there are a few that dont have that info listed)\n\nAlso re read veigar e http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Veigar it doesnt say anything about explicitly stopping dashes.\n\ninfact the only reference to dashes and blinks is where it says it doesnt affect blinks.\n\nAgain if theres any one thing you dont want to go against me on its game knowledge.
