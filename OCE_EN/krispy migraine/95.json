You have to bind it in your hotkeys menu\n\n2. I believe the defualt is V, although you can check this in your hotkeys menu also. \n\n3. It only works for that specific skin.\n\n4. Likely because you jumped into ranked too early. That being said, 10 games is a very small number of games and it is possible just to have a bad run (I went 1-9 in my placements and am still trying to fix it haha). Around 100 games it actually starts being a better testament to your skill as you will have a bigger sample size and it will make games with AFKs and trolls more negligible. \n\n5. You are likely lacking experience with jungle pathing and tracking, and your mechanics are probably still developing as well. A lil confused at your blood moon builds, although I dont play either khazix or blood moon so I wont judge. Spend some time watching khazix jungle videos and looking up guides.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-15T08:11:36.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Other than changing it with the in-game Settings menu, I have no idea.\n\n2. You know how Ctrl+Click is Danger? If you Ctrl+Click on an enemy champion, it says to back away from them.\n\n3. Only for the Lunar Revel skin you got it from (or the set of Lunar Revel skins that were released alongside as long as you purchase them all before the end of the sale).\n\n4. You're either having a very bad loss streak at the start of the season, or you're ranked higher than your skill level and are simply outclassed.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow about Kha'Zix:\n\nKha'Zix is not an easy champion. There are many intricate factors that go into his playstyle and kit. There's also the added bonus of Jungle being different to every other role, with different knowledge required.\n\nIf you're maining Jungle, Xin Zhao and Warwick are both really simple to play and easy to pick up. That said, if you enjoy Kha'Zix, by all means play him. Your entertainment is more important than listening to someone make you play someone you don't like. It'll take a while, but with enough practice you can easily get good at him. 18 games in the last month is simply not enough.\n\nLooking at your OP.GG, it seems like you jumped straight into Ranked with Kha'Zix (but that could just be OP.GG being funny). Your itemisation is also... how do I say this nicely?... bad. For example, building Last Whisper into a none-tank/bruiser team.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you want to improve with Kha'Zix, I would recommend watching some guides or Challenger VoDs, and properly analysing them. And when I say Challenger VoDs, I mean Challengers playing in high-Diamond+, not a Challenger smurfing in Silver and building AD Crit Annie.\n\nHere are some videos to check out:\n\n - LS Coaching a Challenger Kha'Zix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRow-ZQg74w\n\n - Danyon Togia Challenger Kha'Zix commentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68M0io6CZjI\n\n - OCE Kha'Zix (no commentary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHX8JQ2fWwE\n\n - Metaphor Coaching a Plat V Kha'Zix: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM3392gD_qw\n\n - Nightblue3 (on his Challenger account) playing Kha'Zix (just mute the weeb stuff if it's unbarable, but a good watch): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANp1C_QOosE\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope this helps :D\n\nGood luck!\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Balthazar007","date":"2018-02-15T04:43:03.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not the best either mate so no stress haha, haven't played in years and they whole game has updated so much. \nI wasn't aware there was a way to signal that there is Enemy Vision here.\nBut for the first two question I just hold down G and use either enemy missing or danger... question mark sought of acts like a question wondering why they are going that way etc. DANGER just means to stay away or be careful really.\n\nPRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! I'm still shit at a fair few players you just need to get to know how they work and what abilities to use and when to use them.. takes a while but keep at it and you'll have it down to a fine art.","replies":[]}]}
