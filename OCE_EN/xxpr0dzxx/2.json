As a result, the system tries to match players up with a slightly bigger range than usual, so you don't have to wait for an hour. \n\nThe other thing is that sites like OP.GG are still displaying soloq rank in flex games, and if you investigate further into the flex ranks of the players, it is likely that they are actually pretty close to one another.","replies":[]}]}
