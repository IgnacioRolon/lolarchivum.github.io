The thing that breaks my break. The player that said KYS when I called them out on it because they called someone else for being toxic. They said I quote \" You deserve it \" \nIs still playing right now. But me on the other hand... I am not allowed because I was toxic. \n\nSure I do rage a little from time to time. Like the rest of us. Some point you and everyone else will say \" Fuck you people suck \" or \" Damn stop feeding FFS you drongo \" but I am fair from toxic.\n\nI can link 3 OPGG pages of people that have told me after the game \" Gamexover KYS wanker..

Going by the auto reply from the Bot. \n\nPlayers have reported you 7 times in the past 20 games for negative or abusive behaviors in chat - in human terms, this means giving up on games, griefing your fellow players, and generally being difficult to play with over a large number of matches and teammates.\n\nHere are some chat logs from games where you were heavily reported:\n\nGame 265535154:\n[All]GamexOver: FYI the dragon\nGamexOver: Said the player who said to me kys\nGamexOver: Ironic af\nGamexOver: Lol\nGamexOver: Sure\n[All]GamexOver: GGWP\n[All]GamexOver: please report adc very toxic.

I myself was once banned for calling my teammates “weak, fleshy underlings.” Even though I meant well, enough of them reported me for it that I re-programmed my communication style. By acting diplomatic and calm, I’m now able to bend them to my will without succumbing to the forbidden dance of verbal abuse.\n\nYeah..... You see. I am in the mind set of \" How can I win this \" not \" Riot is out to get me \" so mute is what I normally do.\nWhich is why you see about 9 lines of text in a game that went for over 20 mins.\n\nI always found this the funniest part about forums { I guess everyone else too } saying to mute people. Here is a better idea to being with. \nWHY ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO KYS ALLOWED TO PLAY THIS GAME AT ALL!\n\nYou see I see it from this point of view.. What if they did it. I mean really. What if you were watching the news and you see this person named John and in the online world known as \" EGGEATTER \" has killed them self over a league game. What would you feel like.\nI am trying to \" appeal the ban \" but lets face it...\nRiot wont lift it. They will try and claim some BS about how I was negitive and so on.
