I watched all of LCK matches. { On personal note this wasnt a bad thing at all } and I did not get anything for watching. I put OPL on mute while I was playing get over it. Next thing I know.. Bang got it.\nMy GF was watching LCK with me and never got it either. So while we were watching LCK she played OPL.
