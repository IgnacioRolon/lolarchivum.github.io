I searched online for a solution and found none so I stuck with it. Until this patch. It takes the same amount of time to pop up but now I have to accept the EULA. After I press accept it instantly closes and does not let me into the client. I can spam launch all day after this and the same thing pops up. Extremely frustrating and I can&#039;t even play at all. Any help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Cadith","date":"2015-08-20T17:48:18.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have bitdefender 2015?","replies":[{"poster":"Rem Ram","date":"2015-08-21T02:34:46.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I do have bitdefender 2015. My windows 10 install broke my 2013 version without me noticing and I only reinstalled it a week ago so this is probably it. I have tried messing with some settings but no luck so far.","replies":[]}]}]}
