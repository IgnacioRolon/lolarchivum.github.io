It is important that players understand that abelist slurs like the R word are damaging to disabled and neuro-divergent⋆ people. \n\nI love the range of diverse characters that have been created in video-games in recent years but many people have pointed out that there is a lack of neuro-diversity⋆ in video-game characters. Apart from Overwatch's [Symetra](https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Symmetra), an autistic technomancer, I am unaware of any other officially neuro-divergent characters in popular video games, though it is cool that League of Legends own speedy bird support, Rakan {{champion:497}} seems to have a lot of traits associated with ADHD. \n\nIf the team did decide to take on the task of creating an autistic or other neuro-divergent character, it would be important to [ask for input](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskAnAutistic?src=hashtag_click) from [a range of different people](https://twitter.com/search?q=actuallyautistic&amp;src=typeahead_click) from the ND⋆ community, including adults and women. \n\nThank you very much  \n\n\n\n\n⋆⋆** Vocab** ⋆⋆\nableist: discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities\n\nneuro-divergent: A person with neurological differences eg. Dyslexia, Autism, ADHD etc...\n\nneuro-diversity: Having different kinds of neurology eg, the group had a dyslexic and an autistic person, it was a nuro-diverse group. \n\nND: short for neuro-diverse\n\n\n\n_edit - spelling , syntax error _","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2020-02-04T10:29:26.817+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike this post for various reasons that I don't all care to explain, first off I dislike it when someone very clearly avoids saying the actual word in question, retard, for some misguided noble sentiment. It's not like you expect people to not know what you mean and if you did then why? It's the same thing for %%%%%%, saying \"n-word\" doesnt make me think anything other than %%%%%% and saying \"R word\" doesn't make me think anything other than retard. So not only is it doing nothing in that regard, it's also giving power to the word by placing it on a pedestal.\n\nIf you've seen Harry Potter its the same thing, \"He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\" is the same as R Word and only serves to give power to the word itself.\n\n\nAdditionally, I dislike the idea of having characters be labelled as ND simply because it really doesn't need to be said. It's insulting to laud something as being noble or progressive because they made a character who's personality is Autistic. I think it's fine for Rakan to potentially have ADHD or Amumu to be depressed or Jhin to have OCD. Because in their cases it's not a situation of creating a character to fit the illness and rather a character who naturally has it. I believe if Riot set out to create a character that had any form of mental illness / disability they would ultimately create a caricature of that type of person.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I'll accept the censoring on this board as reason enough to say R-Word and N-Word, but I still find it counter-intuitive","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-04T12:49:42.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. \n\nWhile I do believe that we have to acknowledge that it's a sensitive topic, if you're having a discussion about the use of such words, then there isn't really any need to censor (in my personal opinion).\n\nOf course, the auto-censorship on boards (and in-game) exists not for discussion posts like these, but for posts where people are using the words as slurs/insults. While you could argue that it gives power to the word, given that both just censor the whole word and often the number of letters too, I would argue that it's just denying the assholes some degree of power.\n\nI also agree with your point about creating characters. I'm all for representation, but Lucian/Karma/Senna/etc. would have felt a lot more like a pandering cash grab and less like real characters a part of the vibrant world of runeterra if Riot had advertised them as \"League's new black champion!\", rather than simply introducing them as they did. \n\nI would argue that the recent champion releases have been fantastic examples of how to do representation right. Illaoi, Qiyana, Jhin, Kai'sa, Neeko (just off the top of my head). They all represent a wide array of cultures, backgrounds and personal struggles/circumstances, but they do it in an organic and meaningful way, not just because \"we have to create a [insert diverse option here] champion soon or people will get mad\".\n\nThis is though, coming from someone who can't claim to be perfectly healthy but relatively speaking, hasn't faced a great degree of hardship simply for what I am.","replies":[]}]}]}
