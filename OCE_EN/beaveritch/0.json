I don't know if this is involved but it's a fairly common fix.\n\nNext I would recommend running a clean reinstall of League of Legends through the hextech repair tool (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool). This should clean out any extraneous League files floating around that might be causing issues.\n\nIf neither helps then submit a ticket to Player Support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).","replies":[]}]}
