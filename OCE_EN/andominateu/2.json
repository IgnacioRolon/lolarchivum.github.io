I have lost about my last 10 to 15 games cause of people trolling in game it&#039;s unacceptable riot you need to be accountable for this and do something immediately. I really hope someone of importance reads this and takes the time to fix the issue. idk maybe hire people to work as a tribunal cause what ever system you have is letting people get away with ruining games scott free","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-06-24T11:50:52.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Andominate1,\n\nIt definitely sucks when you get a troll or extremely toxic player in one match, let alone regularly, and I feel your pain. Riot is doing what they can to mitigate these issues and are always looking to improve their system but sometimes it may feel like it isn't enough.\n\nWhat you can do on your end is encourage your teammates with a positive attitude; lead by example and you may be able to sway the tide of emotions to your favor instead of the team being swept up in a destructive argument. If a player doesn't want to play ball and keeps being a jerk, don't say anything else to him and just mute and report (don't even let him know you have done so). If they are trolling just focus on what you can do to win the game in spite of them, and don't forget to leave an accurate description of their behavior in your report.\n\nWhile you may not receive a notification of their punishment, know that accurate reports you make will contribute to a punishment in the future if they continue to behave that way. Once the League Client Update (LCU) is finished, they might be able to return to working on the return of the Tribunal Voting system which will accentuate our reports to make the system more accurate, so look forward to that.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]},{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2016-06-23T22:30:44.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they are picking troll Champs you can dodge, you don't lose mmr for dodging, just 3lp. If they are INTENTIONALLY  feeding or ruining the game then they get punished if enough people report, I think it help if members from both teams report them.","replies":[]}]}
