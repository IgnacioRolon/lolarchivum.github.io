You only think it's a lot because THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO COMPLAIN ON THE FORUMS!\n\nPeople who are actually in the wrong don't come onto social media and complain, because they know they did wrong. That's why what you think is so %%%%ing completely from the truth of the matter.\n\nStop with the %%%%ing bleeding heart mentality and actually look at how the real world works and how psychology actually works.\nNothing should be based off your fantasy view of the world you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-09T05:53:10.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Jeez whats with the rage?? \nit is my personal opinion that because it is an online game that people come to for enjoyment, that the punishments are too brutal.\nand I'm not talking about the forums, from my own personal experience from playing lol 80% of the people that DC from games i am in DC for reasons out of their control and 60% of those people re-connect halfway through the game, i don't know what you have experienced and given your rage you have lost credibility so i wouldn't believe any statistic you gave anyway.\n\nI dont care how psychology works in the real world because this isn't the real world, it is a world people go to, to escape the real world and enjoy themselves, you can trust me, the world i live in is far from this 'fantasy' you mention, and anyway in a fake world where people come to enjoy themselves, fun should be the main concern, not worry about losing your hard earned account, or anger that someone left your game, incase you hadn't noticed a 4v5 is very winnable i have even won quite a few 3v5s and the worst thing that can possibly happen is that you lose a game, not an arm or a leg but a game, a few pixels that portrey something that never even existed. I'm not the kind of guy to get annoyed about losing, you obviously are, so its natural that our opinions are different.\n\ni dont mind a AFKer or two every few games, it makes the game more challenging win or gives you an excuse to not blame your %%%%ty playing when you lose, if i can play a game as one of my favourite champs with a friend or even alone then thats me happy, if i lose it doesn't matter, if i win its great, ranked is a bit different, i do get slightly annoyed if someone leaves a ranked game, because (at least in the lol world) ranked matters, so my opinion is that leaver buster should red-flag you or whatever for leaving normal games but only punish you for it when you play ranked, its not a perfect solution but its the one i believe is right, \n\ni don't care if it isn't the most efficient way of reforming the world, just walk down any major street in the world and you'll see \nweed-soaked filth just lying in the street or kids drinking and throwing up everywhere graffiting shops and houses that people have worked hard to maintain and you'll just accept that much of humanity cant be re-formed. You can make the world slightly better for everyone, or make it a lot better for just the people who care about it, we cant solve the AFKing problem because people do have lives out there that are more important than some pixels on a screen, but we can make life better for those who don't AFK by rewarding them for not doing it.\n\nthats my opinion, you don't have to like it but you don't have to rage at it just because it doesn't match yours either","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-09T06:09:06.607+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I \"rage\" at your opinion because IT IS WRONG.
