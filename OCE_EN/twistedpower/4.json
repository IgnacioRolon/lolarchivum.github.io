He was told that the currency would just convert but unfortunately, League didn&#039;t support USD paysafecards. So if there are any interested fellows out there, I am willing to trade my paysafecard $10 usd (which can be used in Steam as it supports USD) for a $10 League of Legends RP card for the OCEANIC region.\r\nCheers everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-06T00:21:38.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nHave you tried submitting a ticket to Riot Support?
