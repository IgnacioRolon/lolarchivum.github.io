If you know all the account data then you should be easily be able to change the account email and password. In addition, you must have given your account information to someone in order for it to have been stolen. Because the likely hood of someone being bothered to key log you for a League of Legends account is very low. Like seriously, there are much better targets than that. \n\nBut to answer your question. Riot has a player database that ranges in the millions. If Riot is receiving Support Tickets like yours from at least 5% of those players a day then that's a lot of tickets to respond to and as great a corporation as Riot is. I doubt they have enough man power to personally respond to each of those tickets asap. Just be patient and whilst you're waiting try and solve the problem yourself if you can.\n\nRegards,\nFog {{champion:34}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-02T06:20:19.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on how many requests so far its been 2-3 days for me could take upto 5","replies":[{"poster":"Camre","date":"2015-02-02T06:39:13.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that!","replies":[]}]}]}
