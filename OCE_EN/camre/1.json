It's very weird lag too it almost looks like fps lag but my PC is a beast. I play on wireless connection and there are 3 other wireless connection users int he house and I'm pretty sure we're all on the same channel. So could changing my channel fix these problems or should I ask to move the modem?","replies":[{"poster":"VeiledHorizon","date":"2015-01-21T06:42:16.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wireless will never be as good as using an Ethernet cable.
