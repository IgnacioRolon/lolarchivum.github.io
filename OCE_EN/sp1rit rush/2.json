But custom skins give no advantage and are purely cosmetic. (All the officially released skins I buy this isnt to emulate a skin sold by RIOT Via the store for RP) Things like Dark star orianna or Surprise party Rengar.

I mean the custom skins look cool, but not cool enough to get an acc I have spent like $2600 even a slight chance of a ban. I mean I support Riot and league to the best of my ability. But some times the community comes out with cool stuff that riot doesnt have the time to make them self or doesnt agree for whatever reason. I personally think they should do something similar to valve and allow people to make the skins, have a market to sell them on then take a cut of the sales of the skin. I would go for that but the down side is it would need alot of moderation and resources and time to implement. To Riot it probably wouldn't be worth it sadly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-03-14T04:32:29.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nightjar's response is pretty spot on, but I'll just re-iterate it a bit for the sake of clarity. \n\nCustom skins are on a [_'use at your own risk'_](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/cIfEodbz/d/5kx4F7VE) status. That means Riot won't ban you for installing and using them, but they're not responsible for any issues surrounding it. So for example, if your custom skin program is faulty and edits an area of the files that isn't allowed, then you could get banned and it would be your fault for \"taking the risk\".\n\nAlso watch out if your program does custom skins + other stuff. If the \"other stuff\" it does isn't allowed, you'll get banned for it. Even if you disable those features. MKLoL is like this, so stay away from it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-14T03:25:22.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"technically no, but even so, sometimes riots automated system will pick up the changes to their client, and will ban you, and I've heard from multiple sources, sending in a support ticket will not rescind this ban.\n\nSo odds are you won't get banned, but sometimes you'll just be unlucky and then there isn't much you can do. \n\nAlso alot of people will say that custom skins never get banned simply because riot has said on forums that it is not a 'bannable' offence, however doesn't change the fact that many people have complained about being banned for custom skins and even some youtubers have mentioned that they now only use custom skins on their alts, since they don't want to risk their main.\n\nTechnically Riot's stance from what I've seen on the forums for different regions on this matter and complaints, is custom skins are fine, but if the automated system picks you out for it, you're screwed since they're not going to correct any mistakes made.","replies":[]}]}
