If it says Active and you still can't login on the Alpha client, try submitting a ticket [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the screenshot attached.\n\nCheck out the Alpha Client FAQ regarding the login problem [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/206201070#h3q8), and the Login Issues page [here](https://riotgames.zendesk.com/hc/articles/201761944-Login-Issues) before submitting any tickets.\n\nGood luck!\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}]}
