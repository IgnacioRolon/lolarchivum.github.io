(We all love you for it, TY)\r\n\r\nI main Yasuo and I read the reintroduction post about Your Shop and I noticed that epic skins were available for discount.\r\n\r\n(Some of you will already know where I&#039;m going with this)\r\n\r\nBecause I main Yasuo, I&#039;m hoping for PROJECT: Yasuo to go on sale in my personal shop, at probably 50% off. I currently have 613 RP but require 675 RP should PROJECT: Yasuo go on sale at 50% off. So I did the math (Inputs 675 - 613 into a calculator) and I need 62 RP more to purchase my beloved Yasuo skin. So I drew a picture of my interpretation of PROJECT: Yasuo&#039;s splash art.","replies":[{"poster":"Averach","date":"2017-05-23T06:31:27.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good news!\n\nI sent the support team a ticket yesterday and they already credited me 62 RP :D\n\nThanks to Rito (especially the Rito support team) and @SephirothSG for helping me send the ticket!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-21T02:55:00.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI hear the rito support gods much prefer if you submit your offering to them [via a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new).\n\nGood luck :).","replies":[{"poster":"Averach","date":"2017-05-21T10:17:46.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the luck (also known as Dangerous Game) @SephirothSG!\n\nI posted it on the board because it seems that you can't send a support ticket regarding RP purchases from an OCE account as the support website is in NA. When you attempt to access the support website it automatically logs you out of your account. I am unsure of what other topic I can place that is relevant to my reason of sending the ticket.\n\nAny assistance on this topic would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-22T07:32:29.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, \n\nTry opening the support site in an incognito tab or a different browser and attempting to login there.
