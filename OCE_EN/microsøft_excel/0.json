I&#039;m so honourable I get given key fragments practically for breathing, Riot throws them at me.\r\nI&#039;ve got at least 20 keys at any given time, and whenever I unlock a chest, Riot throws three more fragments my way.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not even excited anymore when I get a level 5 honour capsule, because it&#039;s _always_ 270 blue essence, and 3 key fragments that I simply cannot use. \r\n\r\nA rework of how the honour capsules would do it for me, but if Rito is happy with that then I think we should be able to trade in key fragments for capsules - even at a rate of 10 fragments for one capsule would be delightful. That way at least I can get _something_ from them, rather than just stack them up for no reason.{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[]}
