Quite often i find myself in champ select and i click on a champion to lock in and it doesn&#039;t load resulting in my lobby breaking. I have had it happen a few times with summoner spells and runes/masteries as well and I&#039;m finding it irritating. I have fiber, Ethernet cable and a custom built pc that I know can handle normal lag and performance issues reducing them to a minimum but this just seems to far out of character to be anything on my end. Thinking might be a Alpha Client bug and wondering if anyone else has the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-11-03T06:48:58.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is the client itself, it should be fixed when the beta comes out. I have had it a few times when the client wouldn't let me pick my champ.","replies":[]}]}
