When we launched League of Legends we picked up some off-the-shelf forum software because we had no idea how big the forums and LoL were going to get. I think it was certainly the right choice at the time but over the long run there have been some pretty significant limitations that stem from that choice.\n\n* **It’s difficult to integrate into the rest of the League of Legends experience.** Remember how long we had those question mark icons? We've been plagued with account authentication issues, etc.\n\n* **It’s extremely challenging to technically scale.** It wasn't built to handle tens of thousands of concurrent readers and tens of thousands of daily posts. Forums going down whenever NA has stability issues, etc.\n\n* **It’s extremely challenging to extend.** Doing seemingly easy things like adding search that “every other forum has” would involve months of hacky engineering work and is still not incredibly reliable. The time-cost of any given feature that we’re building on this technology is a fraction of what the same work would have been on the classic forums.\n\n* **It wasn't built to handle moderation at scale.** The toolset that allows large teams of 24x7 moderators to effectively collaborate just really didn't exist in the software. And it shouldn't have because we were using it in a way that it wasn't intended to be used.\n\nBuilding our own Boards platform - while a significant effort – goes a long way towards making the future better. It allows us to build forward-looking features and functionality, and lets us experiment to find the best types of community experiences.","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-18T02:34:26.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> \n* ** It’s difficult to integrate into the rest of the League of Legends experience.** Remember how long we had those question mark icons? We've been plagued with account authentication issues, etc.\n\nWell, considering the forum software you purchased clearly had avatars built in all you really needed to do was set up a folder of icons for people to choose from that were League specific. That or allow people to upload their own and then go through and delete the inevitable R34 pictures.\n\n> * **It’s extremely challenging to extend.** Doing seemingly easy things like adding search that “every other forum has” would involve months of hacky engineering work and is still not incredibly reliable.

We already had Avatars in the old forums that was linked to your summoner icon. Now admittedly I am not on the Boards team so I can only speculate. But think about more ways the Boards could be integrated to the League of Legends client itself in some way.\n\nAs for your second point, that you don't believe what we said. There isn't much I can do to convince you. But hopefully you can understand everything we do is to bring  a better player experience.\n\n\nThere were also two other points on there that I guess you do agree with at least.\n\nMake sure to read the Q&A if you're looking for more insight.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-18T09:28:13.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maraudaur,\n\nYour speculation, while possibly accurate, really doesn't mean much to me as a person who preferred the old forums. My personal friends who I play with have no interest in the boards and had no interest in the old forums. Even if there was some form of integration into the client, they still wouldn't care about the boards or any of the content. We had a community in place that you removed through the development of boards while completely removing the old forums. It wasn't like you guys needed to support them anyways, Tamat himself said that the GD board was the \"Wild, Wild West where you can talk about anything\" and Pendragon said that you tried to build a traditional \"GD\" experience which you could've done by just leaving GD forums open because of the preference for them over this reddit-style layout.\n\nSpeaking of preference, Riot can claim what they want about the colour scheme, it is annoying and my personal preference would be to have a light background with dark writing (which is what the original forums had). Sweet even acknowledged that a common personal preference is for a dark on light background through experience with print media and other forms of writing, why would you not have that as an available option? The FEK had the option for a night-style mode on the old forums if you really wanted to have light on dark designs so it was definitely possible on the old system if you guys had to force that change and you already had the dark on light layout available to you.\n\nSpeaking of the FEK, I'm going to break this part of the discussion down into two parts:\n1: Bear Hat Alice's response to the colour scheme question was insulting in many ways. Many of the things that Pendragon wrote to explain the changes revolved around the fact that Riot wanted more control over how they could implement features to the boards that they claimed they could not do on the forums without excessive work. \n\nSo with that in mind, her saying that users could use an extension if they wanted to change the colour scheme because Riot had no plans to do it themselves is disappointing. We had a system in place that users could use to customise their experiences in place already, why you would take that one away to implement your own control and then tell us to go and use something else is mind boggling because it goes counter to everything Riot was claiming about the reasoning behind boards development anyways.\n\n2: It's easy to not believe what Riot is saying about the inability to use avatars or search features on your old forum system because we already had a program that worked perfectly with the old forums. The FEK enabled the user to completely customise the forums to their personal preferences including the ability to search, quote multiple replies, add our own avatars, blacklist users we didn't want to see posts from and also see posts which had responses to them from threads that we had previously commented on.\n\nRight now, it seems like you guys just added those features to the boards, added a further annoying layout and didn't consider that someone had done all the work for you already on a platform that you already had access to and probably wouldn't have to pay all that much extra for.\n\nI feel like Riot is just trying to use a worn PR plan to cover for the fact that they want to force this on a part of their community that had no vested interest in being a part of it. Whether or not you admit to it doesn't really concern me, it's what it looks like and no amount of trying to convince us that this was done for the community will convince me that you made the right decision.\n\nTL;DR I personally think you guys made a mistake with the boards, and there are a lot of reasons why it's possible to feel that way.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Silver5aruman","date":"2014-12-18T07:55:25.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why the reddit formatting?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gixa","date":"2014-12-17T23:03:53.340+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thanks for the reply :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sectarion","date":"2014-12-18T07:15:58.133+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like it, better then the old one anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-18T01:05:36.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"boards is actually really nice\nthey give you updates on things you said\nthey unban all the troll posters\nThe design becomes far more tolerable overtime","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-21T13:39:38.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know Boards is so bad that when Riot tries to defend that Boards is good, they end up getting negative votes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-17T23:19:19.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your main problem is the design by what you say.
