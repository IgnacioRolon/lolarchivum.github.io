The reason i am saying this is i find that the game is now to reliant on the first 10 to 15 minuites of the game, while not really allowing for comebacks if you fall 1-2 dragons behind and yes thats all it really takes. Also this would force more pressure onto the jungler/ team to actually push for that extra dragon so they can get the buffs again and if they are at 3 dragons or so and the other side gets dragon they can actually get a decent reward for it by not only denying them thier boosts but now having a boost that is stronger than the enemy teams currently. \r\n\r\nsuggestion 2 is have the same thing except have it as a scalling timer with your dragon buffs so more multipliers the longer the buff lasts\r\n\r\n1x 90 secs\r\n2x 150 secs\r\n3x 210 secs\r\n4x 300 secs\r\n5x 360 secs +180 secs for double buff\r\n\r\ni just feel it's a bit futile to play beyond 20-30 minuites more than ever if the enemy team has enough dragons comebacks are nearly impossible","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-13T06:45:12.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let a team get 4 drags, we got baron 3 times and stomped them. 1st, 4th and 5th are really the ones you want","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-03-12T23:52:04.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won as malz against a team with 5 dragon stacks and baron, its not op its weak, we had no dragon stacks keep them at range, or make steals if you're that annoyed by dragon, the dragon buffs sometimes make the game faster other times its a staller so lets just ignore the whole thing about dragon needing a timer for the stacks...","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-12T14:34:39.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"won a game tonight, enemy had 3 dragons uncontested. we turned around and actually had ward coverage for once....bam, 4-5 dragons in a row and baron and we won.","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-03-12T12:44:48.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont allow them to get dragons. get them yourself spud","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-12T13:10:14.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^\n\nThe whole point of giving the dragon buffs was to give it this quality. Riot said it themselves in the Pre-Season 5 patch. I'm sure you can find them somewhere if you dig up a little bit. Riot said that they wanted to make Dragon a bit more than tower compensation with global gold and exp. so they have it its stacking buffs to make sure that the dragon has its own right to be an objective that doesn't just act as a gold injection.","replies":[]}]}]}
