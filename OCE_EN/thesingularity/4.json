Personnaly i would pick the old ancient golem over every smite combined plus the health upgrade. It was a core item on every utility jungler, if you have 6 items and u wanted to remove golem for randuins, the golem actually gave you more HP overall.\r\n\r\nObviously riot ain't gona scrap the idea however I propose the removal of the tenacity from the health upgrade and simply throwing in ancient golems old stats, primarily the 25% bonus health. The ward, CDR and gold boost weren't crucial and we already get gold from the smites.\r\n\r\nPost your thoughts on which health jungle item you'd prefer, and you all know where I stand\r\nANCIENT GOLEM FTW~","replies":[{"poster":"N7 Teddy","date":"2015-01-19T08:15:54.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, d'you even Juggernaut?","replies":[]}]}
