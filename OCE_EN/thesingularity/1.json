Since the beginning of the season naut has suffered drastically with the absence of the spirit of the ancient golems' additional 25% hp passive and the 200 hp nerf on warmogs armour. To put it into perspective, last season I could achieve over 5 thousand HP+ his shield with one warmogs, randuins, ancient golem, boots, Sunfire cape and banshees veil. Now I can barely get 4k+a much smaller shield. THAT'S OVER 1000 HP difference when the shields included. \r\nThis wouldn't be to much of an issue if these changes didn't make just about every other utility class, tank out class him in tankyness, with LESS! items. eg braum, Maokai, Sejuani and even damage based champs like vi, lee sin and hecarim almost out hp nautilus of flat out smash him out of the park with HP.\r\nMy proposition would be to revoke the shield changes they made to nautilus completely(maybe even buff the duration or scaling a little) and give a slight hp/level buff to help fill the purpose of a the absent ancient golem.\r\n\r\nAlso, nauts skin re texture, is atrocious. imo naut seems to be this deep sea warrior who has surfaced to face his enemies in a rusted suit of armour which his first skin achieved nicely. The re texture resembles a plastic action figure with a big foam anchor. The lighting on his shoulders and eyes are dimmer and the colour pallet is crap.\r\nhttp://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php%253Fattachmentid%253D1069187%2526d%253D1410558135&imgrefurl=http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t%3D4861814&h=589&w=1077&tbnid=_Kw8WZ5uvfLiaM:&zoom=1&docid=nsmu_amazi5WgM&ei=OQv0VPvKA8bdmAWC3YDwDA&tbm=isch&ved=0CCMQMygHMAc\r\n\r\nPersonally I thought nauts classic was the best skin of them all and I'd happily pay to have a choice between the 2 or even if it means replacing it for my eyes only, anything is better than this atrocity.\r\nWhat're your thoughts on these subjects?","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-02T11:30:55.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's gonna get a statue.\n\n> show some love","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-03-02T11:29:24.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't even know what you're talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-03-03T05:56:12.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PRIMAWESOME,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=4rV5REwE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-02T11:29:24.144+0000)\n>\n> You don't even know what you're talking about.\n\nReally?

Nautilus's shield is lower than it was early game, but it now becomes bigger than it ever was later on. About giving some love to Nautilus, he's getting some more changes in the PBE currently. You can play all the Nautilus games you want, but you'll still know nothing about Nautilus it seems especially since you haven't noticed the shield buff. So yes really.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-03-04T07:35:12.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buff takes about a full build to become useful.

TBH though. Everyone gets it so it wont put him ahead of anyone. He'll sit where he is right now with an = hp boost to everyone else who uses the mastery","replies":[]}]}]}
