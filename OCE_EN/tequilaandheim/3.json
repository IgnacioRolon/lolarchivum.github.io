(And yes, the &#039;mysterious assassin&#039; is Jhin.  I&#039;m pretty sure that much is kind of obvious though.)_\n\nEDIT: I added some possible item, champion and summoner spells that might synergise with her kit, as well as some ideas for gameplay quotes/interactions and even the 'How to play as/against' page you see on all the champions in the client.\n-----\n\n**Lore:** _(Warning: It&#039;s a bit of a long read.)_\n\nBorn in Piltover, Vienna lived most of her life with her mother.  When she turned sixteen years old, her life changed abruptly after her mother was killed, when an anarchic outlaw destroyed a building to escape from the clutches of Caitlyn.  The building happened to be where she and her mother lived.  In the carnage, Vienna was saved by her mother who cast her body over her dear child to protect her, sparing her daughter&#039;s life from most of the falling debris.\n\nVienna crawled from the ruined building.  She was alive, but her face and arms were badly cut by jagged pieces of metal and the falling rocks.  As the wounds healed, she was left with her face scarred and disfigured, forcing her to flee, hiding in shadows.  Now that her mother was gone, she knew people would try to convince her to return to her father, yet her father was a violent drunkard and Vienna&#039;s mother had fled with her to escape that life.  She would sooner die than return to his care.  \n\nOne night, she was watching a lavish Masquerade Ball from behind a fountain in Piltover, hoping to perhaps sneak in, steal a few bites of food and be gone before she was noticed.   A masked man knelt beside her in the shadows.  He wore an ornate mask but and as he pulled out his weapon, it was clear he was not one of the guests.  He fired his gun.  As a woman fell, the bullet striking her in the back, guests began looking to see where the shot had come from but the man had already dragged Vienna with him back into the shadows, out of sight.\n\n&quot;I hope I didn&#039;t startle you.&quot;\n\nVienna whimpered in fear.\n\n&quot;You know, I enjoy Masquerade Balls as well.  The Masks are beautiful.&quot;\n\nLooking back at where he had shot, his eyes lit up as if he was smiling behind his own mask.  &quot;Hers was especially unique.  I think it would be a perfect fit for you.  Be quick about grabbing it though.  Before someone else does.&quot;\n\nDiving out of the shadows, she sprinted to the body of the woman and without slowing down, snatched up the mask from the dead woman&#039;s hand.  As she fled from the furious shouts of the onlookers, it almost felt like she had run into a tunnel as the world went dark.  Suddenly, she was back where the man had dragged her.  He was sitting down, his back propped up against a wall with his gun sitting by his side.\n\n&quot;See?  Unique.  A strange artefact from the Shadow Isles, if I&#039;m not mistaken.&quot;  Looking at her with a curious sparkle in his eyes, Vienna felt obliged to speak for the first time since her mother died.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;\n\n&quot;I am the director, the actor and the stagehand of life.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why me?  Why did you tell me about this mask?&quot;  \n\n&quot;Two reasons.  Firstly, because longing for a mask is a feeling I know well enough to see in someone&#039;s eyes and secondly, because every performance must have a final act.  No matter how the audience applauds, the day will come where I will not be able to give them an encore.&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot;\n\n&quot;What better way to keep the audience on the edge of their seats...than a sequel.&quot;\n\n* * * * * \n\n**Summary: **\nVienna is an AP Assassin most at home in Mid-Lane or the Jungle.  Using her sai to deal damage with her melee-range basic attacks, she relies heavily on her movement speed to be of use in a team-fight, since her passive allows her to gain bursts of both ability power when she wants to go aggressive or movement speed if she needs to escape trouble.  \n\nWhile very high-damage and high-mobility, she is very squishy and her Masque of Defiance is only a short-term solution.  if she cannot get out of trouble before the effect ends, the slow not only makes her easier to catch but reduces her ability power boost from her passive.\n\n* * * * *\n\n**(P) Born for the Masquerade: **\nVienna quickly made herself most at home in Masquerade Balls and as a result, everything about her revels in the dance.  With her dance flowing into her kills seamlessly, she gains 10% of her current movement speed as bonus ability power, with the bonus increasing to 20% for 3 seconds after delivering a killing blow to an enemy champion.\n\nIf she delivers another killing blow to an enemy champion during this time, the duration is refreshed and her next basic attack deals bonus magic damage based on the target's current health.\n\n**(Q) Dancing Assassin: **\nVienna lashes out with her sai, hurling it as a linear skillshot with a simple leather cord attached.  If the sai hits an enemy champion, it deals magic damage and they are stunned for 0.8 seconds.  During this time, she may re-activate the ability to pull on the rope, jumping towards them to deliver a swift kick that knocks them back.  \n\nIf she does not re-activate this, then if the enemy champion has &#039;Crest of Cinders&#039; or &#039;Crest of Insight&#039;, they are removed and Vienna gains those buffs for the remainder of the duration they would&#039;ve had if they had remained on the target enemy champion.\n\n**(W) Quickstep:**\nIf Vienna is in the fog of war, she can delve into the shadows and blink to a target location, gaining a bonus 5% movement speed for the next 1.2 seconds.  \n\n**(E) Masque of Defiance: **\nVienna removes crowd-control effects and gains a bonus 10% movement speed for the next 3 seconds.  After this movement speed expires, she is slowed by 70% for 2 seconds and her tenacity is reduced by 10% during this time.\n\n**(R) Death Waltz:**\nVienna grabs hold of a target enemy champion and begins to dance with them, channelling the magic of the mask and charms the target for 2 seconds.  At the end of this effect, the magic of the mask activates fully, granting her incredibly strength as she flings the target up into the air before blinking to them, impaling them with both of her sai, dealing a large amount of magic damage and flinging them to the ground.\n\nIf this kills the target and her &#039;Quickstep&#039; is on cooldown, the cooldown is automatically reset.\n\n-----\n\nHidden Passive: Whenever Vienna is against an enemy Jinx, she gains +1 Movement Speed when running towards her.  \n\nQuotes:\n\nChampion Select: \"Life is a Masquerade...and I'm crashing the party.\nOn being banned: \"Ugh...killjoy.\"\nMovement 1: *hums the waltz tune*\nMovement 2: \"I will follow the melody...\"\nMovement 3: \"Double-time, now.\"\nKill Enemy 1: \"You should have stayed a wallflower.\"\nKill Enemy 2: \"Having two left feet is a death sentence when I'm around.\"\nKill Enemy 3: \"I _always_ take the lead.\"\nTaunt: \"Don't make me go for the kneecaps.\"\nTaunt vs Enemy Jinx: \"Such a unique perfume.  It reeks of gunpowder, hubris and poor life choices.\"\nDance: *waltz with imaginary partner*\nDance (if near allied Jhin.): *waltzes with imaginary partner* \"Dance with me, Jhin.  I'll even let you lead.\"\n\n-----\n\nPossible Core Items: Lich Bane, Luden's Echo.\nPossible Aggressive Items: Hextech Gunblade, Nashor's Tooth.\nPossible Defensive Items: Zhonya's Hourglass, Abyssal Sceptre.\nSuggested Aggressive Summoners: Ignite/Ghost or Heal/Ghost.\nSuggested Defensive Summoners: Flash/Ghost or Flash/Heal.\n-----\n\nPotential Synergy: Sivir, Kled, Sona.\nPotential Threats: Brand, Teemo, Ashe.\n\n-----\n\nTips for playing as Vienna:\n* Vienna's damage is tied to her mobility.  Building movement speed and ability power is high recommended if you want to stay alive but tenacity and slow-resist never goes astray either.\n* Only use your ultimate on the target it will most likely kill.  If you fail to kill them, your Quickstep cooldown will not be refreshed, making you easy pickings for the retaliation.\n* Masque of Defiance is best used alongside your Quickstep for the best chances of escape.\n\nTips for playing against Vienna: \n* Exhaust is invaluable against Vienna.  Not only does it reduce her damage from the effect of the spell, but the slow reduces the damage from her passive as well.\n* A Ghost/Heal combination is best treated as an aggressive lane, due to both of these granting a short-lived boost of movement speed, which translates into more ability power.  \n* Items such as Rylai's Crystal Sceptre or Frozen Mallet can prove very useful, effectively kneecapping her damage as well as her mobility.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-12-22T01:36:33.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, looking great!
