No resource usage, minimal cooldowns, if URF was available to use making custom matches against bots, it might actually fill the need players have for a way to practice mechanics.  \r\n\r\nCan&#039;t nail that Insec?  Take Lee Sin into URF and practice, over and over and over.  Struggling to land your skillshots?  Take your champ into URF and practice against bots.  There&#039;s probably a lot more to it than I think there is, but I think having URF available at any time to play vs bots would really fill a void that League needs.  An efficient way to practice without having to endure the salty players in Normals while you learn.  Little less &#039;Oh great, we got a first time Anivia, GG&#039; and more &#039;Oh, so I land that ability and then this one does more damage?&#039;  \r\n\r\nPls Rito.  I&#039;m Bronze for a reason.  I suck at this game and I want to improve, but there&#039;s nowhere to practice effectively and I think URF actually provides an ideal environment for it.","replies":[]}
