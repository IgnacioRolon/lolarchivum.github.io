Wouldn&#039;t be the first time, if it&#039;s the latter, so I&#039;m sure someone will tell me if that&#039;s the case.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that getting Gold, instead of just giving you the rewards and the victorious skin, unlocks a &quot;Victorious Shop&quot; throughout pre-season, where on top of the rewards, you can spend BE to buy limited-time emotes, icons, and perhaps even buy skins that you&#039;d otherwise have to spend RP to get.  Champion shards are kinda redundant when you own every champ and have more Blue Essence than you know what to do with.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m wondering if something like this would not only give a little more incentive for people to climb ranked, but also make BE a little more versatile.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-30T03:24:07.174+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This basically already exists! It's not a Victorious shop, they call it the Essence Emporium, but it's a twice a year shop in which you can purchase things like mystery ward skins, icons, limited icons, gemstones, a limited skin and various other things with BE. \n\nIn fact, it'll be coming around real soon, a new batch of chibi icons (which are only available as mystery icons through the essence emporium) went up on PBE a few days ago! Preseason and Midseason are when we'll see it, though we don't have exact dates. :)","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaAndHeim","date":"2018-10-30T05:05:33.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, that's what sparked the idea.  Admittedly, I kind of forgot it was coming back around, but I was thinking of something like having 'Victorious' Emotes, Icons, Wards, etc that are exclusive to those who obtained Gold or above, but that are still just bought with BE, rather than given.  \n\nThat being said, if the Essence Emporium is coming back around, I guess I have more to spend my BE on than I realised, so all my concerns were in {{sticker:vayne-pose}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-30T05:16:07.163+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot doesn't want to have too much riding on rank. It needs to feel like a reward for reaching gold, not a punishment for being lower then gold.\n\nI like the idea, I just think in practicality it might cause more harm than good.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-11T00:54:42.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not related, but how do you get so much BE?\nI can't afford anything since BE came out...\n\nI'm assuming you had all of the champions BEFORE the BE update?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-11T03:49:53.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You earn currency faster in the new system than you did in the old. It was always damn slow. There are also more ways to earn currency now, since what you get from Hextech chests goes into the same pool, and you use less currency if you are lucky and get a shard for a champ you want.\n\nReally the single thing that got worse is that you can no longer reroll champions.\n\nThe biggest thing to remember is that the Essence Emporium isn't designed for new or semi-new players. It's designed as a currency sink for long time players who have nothing left to spend it on so they don't have to keep watching this meaningless number go up. So there's actually something worth saving up for still.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TequilaAndHeim","date":"2018-11-14T03:36:46.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras Dragon is right but so are you.  I did have all the champions before the BE Update, but because you can earn BE so easily now, even spending it on that glorious URFwick skin didn't stop me accumulating it all over again.  \n\nI wouldn't be as bothered by it, if Orange Essence, the one I actually want, wasn't so difficult to come by without spending money on Hextech Chests, which usually give me champion shards that are worth nothing but a small addition to the growing pile of BE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xX CyberChaos Xx","date":"2018-10-30T03:23:17.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the BE shop is coming back in preseason, which is basically what you're asking for.","replies":[]}]}
