Not gonna fret over numbers.  I&#039;m more focused on the concept itself for the time being and I&#039;m better with the creativity than the maths.  Given I freely admit I have no idea what I&#039;m doing, but want to practice and practice until I&#039;m good enough to perhaps one day get work doing it for Riot, any constructive criticism is very much appreciated.)   \n\n_**Silas, The Ghostfoot Assassin.**_\n\nSilas is an AD Assassin that tends to call the ADC Role or the Jungle home.  With his beloved two sai, &#039;Sathe and Sahara&#039;, Silas often can be found planting one of his trusty weapons in an unsuspecting foe&#039;s back.  His appearance is tall and slender, wearing a dark purple cloak over a black and silver tunic, tied with a simple rope belt.  His skin is pale and his eyes are black, save for silver where the irises would be.  He also has long black hair, tied back neatly in a low-slung ponytail and has a bit of an &#039;aristocratic assassin&#039; feel to his mannerisms.  \n\n_Passive: Ghostfoot -_ \nWhen an allied or enemy champion is killed, a small orb will sit above the slain champion until they respawn.  If he walks over the orb, he receives a small bonus to his movement speed.  This also occurs over a Large Monster but only after that jungle camp has been fully cleared.\n\n(Edit: Passive altered from just allied champions to both allied and enemy champions, as well as Large Monsters after a camp is cleared to synergize with his intended Jungle/ADC role.)\n\n_Q: Inhuman Precision - _  \nSilas hurls one of his sai at a target enemy, dealing physical damage.  He may activate this twice before it goes on cooldown.  This ability guarantees a Critical Strike on an enemy that is affected by hard CC.  (Stuns, Snares, etc.)\n\n_W: Lilith&#039;s Fervor -_ \nSilas dashes forward and strikes the target with his sai, gaining increased Attack Damage and flinging the target overhead, to land behind him.  Critical Strikes will cause the target to bleed over time for a percentage of the damage done.\n\n_E: Veiled from Light - _\nPassive: After 3 seconds without being struck, casting an ability or attacking, Silas can revert to stealth.  He gains increased movement speed but decreased armour and magic resist.  This can only take effect in the Fog of War.\nActive: Silas gains increased movement speed when running away from the last enemy champion that struck him and gains additional Critical Strike damage while standing still.  This effect lasts for 3 seconds.  \n\n_R: Unwavering Focus - _  \nSilas dashes towards a target enemy champion, dealing a critical strike.  If he kills the target enemy champion within 4 seconds of activating this ability, he may dash towards another enemy champion and deal another critical strike.  \n\n\n(Let me know what you think.  Too OP?  Too complex?  Too simple?  I kind of based the idea off the assassin playstyles, like Katarina or Talon.  Slippery to catch but if you can lock him down, he&#039;s about as resilient as a wet paper bag in a jet turbine.  I've attached a quick sketch I managed with what supplies I have on me at the moment but I'm no artist.  Terrible at it, actually.  \n\nI couldn't get much detail into the face with my supplies yet, but I was toying with the idea of a ballroom masquerade style mask, and tying his lore into a sort of idolotry-turned-rivalry with Jhin.  Basically picture someone who idolizes a well known figure and when he finally meets him, learns that his idol is actually kind of a jerk.  Basically what happened with Silas.  Adored Jhin.  Wanted to do what he did.  Met Jhin.  Thought Jhin was kind of pretentious and said \"I can do better.\")  \n\n[]https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t1.0-9/12832482_1561134217529953_3425931824034526151_n.jpg?oh=eb2fafc020418ea4aea49a56226785a9&oe=5791B049\n\nI am hopeless at drawing hands or faces but I'm creating the concept right now, the art can be left for more fitting times, perhaps by artists with more ability than I have.  \n","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaAndHeim","date":"2016-03-17T12:25:03.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did some modification to the abilities to tune up his 'Hecarim' issues.  His Lilith's Fervor works more as an engage than anything else now.  Fleet of Spirit is replaced by 'Veiled from Sight', a stealth ability that only works in the Fog of War.  Movement Speed, but less armour/mr.  If he gets caught out by a pink ward or similar, I want him to be squishy enough that the Critical Strike focus doesn't stop him being shut down.  The active on it also provides incentive for him as an ADC, to avoid danger.  His modification to 'Inhuman Precision' gives him better synergy in ADC roles with supports like Lux, Zyra or even Annie.  Stun/Root > Silas Q = Crit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-16T10:25:12.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">(Let me know what you think. Too OP? Too complex? Too simple?

Maybe change his passive from allied champion to allied units and enemy champions? Pretty cool simple design, but movement speed is a generally poor gapcloser and would have a rough time inlane.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaAndHeim","date":"2016-03-15T08:21:59.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he is an assassin.  Enemy champions being able to proc the passive on death makes sense.  It would give him a bit more efficiency in getting in and out from a kill.  I'd probably still keep it allied champions to make it simpler.  (Movement speed from minions might be a little too strong, even if it's just cannon or super minions.) or possibly Allied/Enemy Champions and Large Monsters (to a lesser degree.)  The passive working on large monsters would allow him to get from camp to camp a bit quicker in the jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrup","date":"2016-03-14T23:02:18.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha, that last comment\n> [{quoted}](name=HexDDG,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=R82hR6qH,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-03-14T14:30:08.154+0000)\n Slippery to catch but if you can lock him down, he&#039;s about as resilient as a wet paper bag in a jet turbine.\n\nI don't know how he would do mid lane considering most champions there are mages and I can see him putting himself in a vulnerable position a fair bit. I like the 'aristocratic' mannerism though and generally as a character he sounds great. W would have to have a decent cool down though, it feels like he would be OP if he's doing knocking people in the air every few seconds! Maybe the second hit is actually a skill shot and you have to click again to knock them back, but it's more effective....? o:\n\nIf you feel like drawing a picture of him too, that'd be cool.","replies":[{"poster":"TequilaAndHeim","date":"2016-03-15T08:18:53.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of had some inspiration as to Talon being played in Mid Lane but in hindsight, perhaps his synergy with Crits he'd be more at home as an ADC.\n\nI do like the idea of the skillshot knockback, but I feel like it would take away from his reliance on positioning.  Assassins tend to have a lot of focus on that side of the fight.  Perhaps I could make that start with a dash to function as a gap closer?  That way the ability could be a skillshot and knockback based on where he dashed from.  His E is really intended mostly as an escape, hence the tenacity/slow-resist.  The removal of those would occur after the effect of has run its course.  (So when he returns to normal movement speed, he loses the tenacity/slow resist until the ability is able to be activated again.","replies":[]}]}]}
