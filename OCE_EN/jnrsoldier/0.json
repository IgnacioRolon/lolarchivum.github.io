Ganking a losing lane is less likely to net a kill and can sometimes even gift the enemy a double if they're already fed. Plus a losing teammate will oftentimes still be losing even after you repeatedly gank for them (especially if the reason they were behind is because they are simply worse than the enemy laner), and its better to instead invest your time into getting the other lanes a big lead so they can make up for the deficit of the guy who is stuggling.

Thanks\n\nSure, hecurim and nocturne like to start blue (like gragas) but if you want to clear both buffs on your first run then get a Very heavy leash on golems (make sure you ping to back off so dot champs don't accidently kill it) kill red buff, do raptors or wolves if you think you have the hp/mana (this gives time for smite to go off cooldown) and then hit blue buff (also make sure by level 3 you have one point in at least every skill so you can maximise survivability and damage, I know its obvious but some people become illusioned by having a level 2 skill at level 3 as being good)\n\nAlso if you start golems, then ward red in case they are looking for a steal ( this gives you time to think on your next move) and when doing your jg route ward river entrances and major buff areas (not in the buffs, near the entrances so you can see if they get surrounding buffs).\n\nNow, a lot of people will try to use you as a crutch when falling behind, THIS IS BAD. You don't want them to do that because a) they don't care if you fall behind and b) it makes you \"inactive\" in the rest of the map so their jg has free reign to go where ever they please. Make sure you tell them if you cannot help them in a certain situation, (ie just did a rough jg and are low, completed an objective and/or gank and need to b) because while it is important to help your main priority is you, you don't want to fall behind so someone else gets ahed because that only works 1/8th of the time.\n\nTo be effective is to be vigilant, know who is getting pushed and who is low.\n\nin a list to break this down:\n- who is where\n- who is ahead\n- did they ward? (ask your teammates for confirmation)\n- is it just them alone? do the numbers tilt in your favour?\n- what items do they have? (This is actually mega important, a top lane with ryleas could get you killed if you don't pay attention to that)\n- how long has jg been gone? (jglers who gank 80% time won't be able to gank again immediately)\n- can your teammate follow up if you cannot fight them alone?\n- what is on cooldown? (for you, the enemy laner and your laner. This is really hard to determine without practice)\n- what is your hp and mana?\n- can you actually kill them?\n\nThe last one is the most important to consider as it is not as black and white as it sounds, sometimes it is worth scaring them off to give your ally a break or to save/ avenge them if you came too late. However bad judgement will get you killed 9/10 of the time when sizing up your gank opportunity.\n\nOne last thing on being effective, don't take cs. Kills are fine, if anyone gives you shit for it just mute them because you have every right to get a kill if you help them out (not if you just rock up and ks) unless you are greedy and try to deny your ally the kill.\n\nDon't bother going around trolling your enemy jg, you will just fall behind.

Some of these tips I have been working on and trying to improve, but some are new too me and I will do my best to incorporate this into my game-play. Again, thank you for taking the time for this comment. A few things though, with Gragas, i have always started at Gromp,  moving from there to Blue, then to Scuttle Crab and finishing on wolves then Recall. With Heca i do the same, except im left with enough HP and Mana to also get my Red, although, i do hesitate to get that Red before i recall because i think it may be more useful to get it on my way out on 3 for a gank. And Nocturne, i am yet to decide whether it is better to start Blue or Red? What is your opinion on that?\n\nI will be definitely trying out this heavy leash on golums in order to get this full clear.\n\nIn response too your line about taking CS, i haven't ever really stolen the cs, when i come in and pull a successful gank, i will either get the minions low for our laner, or if my laner is away from lane i just push out the wave and then move on, leaving friendly minions the push on the tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-04T11:44:58.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JnrSoldier,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ALRuArLu,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-06-04T01:42:18.846+0000)\n>\n> Very helpful!

The reason I say this is because with the red buff the rest of your jg will get cleared much faster (especially since your passive lets you renekton q) and he isn't skill reliant in jg (like evelyn, nautalis or gragas) meaning mana isn't a big issue for the first 3 camps or so.\n\nAlso for a utility ganker such as noc blue is best for ganking as you can run in with q, fear and spellshield at the same time and finally your auto's should finish them if your ally is backing you. Then because you have blue you can then glide back in to your jg with mana to keep on farming (if low you should even consider starting at red then clearing out the rest, enemy red because most likely you will get blue on the way to gank. Also make sure your jg has vision at 2/3 of your camps and you have wards to probe unknown territory)","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-06T04:28:14.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like quite misinformed advice.\n\nYou should always start q on nocturne, and im fairly sure taking w at level 2 for the passive attack speed boost is more effective than e for the first clear (haven't played nocturne in a while so not 100% sure this is still true), especially if you start red buff side and dont have mana regen from blue\n\nStarting red or blue buff side is often determined more by which side of the map you want to be on (bot gives better leash because theres 2 people, but maybe you want to start top to be on the right side of the map for an invade or early gank) rather than the actual buff. You shouldn't get into the habit of always starting gromp on some champs and always golems on others\n\nRed buff is always better for ganking. Red buff has damage and a slow, and blue buff has 10% cdr (which is usually irrelevant because you still only get 1 rotation of spells off anyway) and mana regen which doesn't do anything in a gank.\n\nAlso, nocturne definitely isn't a utility jungler, he has only 1 cc ability which is single target and requires you to stay in range for 2 seconds before they even get ccd","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JnrSoldier","date":"2015-06-04T01:10:02.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chicken4dinner,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ALRuArLu,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-04T00:46:26.999+0000)\n>\n> I know this is me generalizing but with what I'm reading from your comment you think you have already what it takes to make it high in ranked/ league ect ect, but all you are missing is some secret knowledge to push you there.\n> \n> Tips?
