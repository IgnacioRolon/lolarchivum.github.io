The same can be said for the Crystal Scar (Dominion).\n\nSee Sephyre's comment [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZzQR1haM-queue-schedule-updated?comment=00050000) regarding this.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Sephyre,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ZzQR1haM,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2015-09-23T04:11:22.125+0000)\n>\n> We regularly evaluate whether we can have it, as we do for all of our queues.

Every thing about the game of League is revolved around Summoners Rift. Balancing, Champions, meta, Competitive play, even item builds! (granted TT does have a few item exceptions, but they're bascially just a remix of summoner items)\nHeck, the way Rito is being run now, they don't want to support any other gamemodes, with the complete axing of Dominion. Just you watch, TT will be next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-02-10T20:22:52.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH I've always wanted a 1vs1 playlist and possibly 1vs1 ranked.
