Will Riot actually do something about this? Or do I really just mute them and accept the situation as it is cuz yeah whatever.

Ask any given OCE player which language is the one to use and chances are they'll say it's \"English\", but that doesn't make it official, just community consensus. As Seras (more or less) tried to point out, a \"language barrier\", in and of itself, is not a reportable offence.\n\nWith that in mind, I do think there are legitimate reasons to report individuals who aren't using English in chat. The thing to keep in mind is that it's always best to report if you suspect someone of breaking the rules, even if you don't know what they're actually saying. Either the report will be deemed invalid, in which case nothing happens, or it will be deemed valid, in which case action is (rather, *should be*) taken.\n\nIt makes logical sense for Riot to have systems in place that deal with the various languages used in-game, particularly those which are \"dominant\" on particular servers. As Jason put it; \"supposedly if they are being offensive they are meant to be banned\", it doesn't help if Riot is allowing such behaviour simply because of \"language barriers\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-31T00:52:52.798+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chinese isn't a language, it's a nationality.

First, consider a question from a realistic perspective. Can you ask a person who can trade with your country to leave your country and not to communicate with you? Even if he can't speak English. In addition, I believe that all people who can play LOL in OCE can speak more or less English, some of them may have bad grammar(like me) and poor vocabulary(still like me ). If they don't want to communicate with you, there's only one explanation that they don't care about you. But I believe don't care others’ feeling are personal problems, it's definitely not a national problem. If you often encounter some foreign players who refuse to communicate with you, then I'm sorry to hear that. \n\nTo consider your problem from the perspective of the game, I don't know if you know, in Asia especially China, many professional players will go to South Korea's server to play and training, because their service is recognized as the most powerful server, but in fact, Chinese can't spell Korean, they are used to communicate in English. The reason that LOL can get so popular around the world is people of different cultural backgrounds, different languages can play the same game,  like other sports, which is a good thing, I believe that Riot will not prevent such cultural exchanges, because this is active, you can also check out how many foreign game player in OCE, I  believe in a lot of numbers (You might need to see New Zealand and Australia as a whole). If from the Esport perspective, each serves do need fresh blood is not it？\n\nSo enjoy the game, I believe you will encounter a kind of foreign friends, but you need to work on yourself, sometimes more of their own do not recognize themselves in the game do deficiencies, that others refused to communicate with you, others may just mute you, this may also be of course there.","replies":[]}]}
