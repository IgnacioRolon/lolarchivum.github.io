There's still a lot of mystery around what the \"they are coming\" actually refers to. The most popular theory is that it refers to a new champion called Dha Ma.

It's a fan made champion concept idea for Dha Ma. If you look closely at [this](http://i.imgur.com/8uWLonQ.jpg) image, you can see the Ying Yang style emblem there, which is extremely similar to the one on PBE.\n\nThe final champ could be quite different to the original idea, as we saw with Gnar and Bard. But it's almost certainly a new champion, not Ao Shin, sorry :D\n\nTL;DR\nIt's not Ao Shin, it a new champion called Dha Ma.","replies":[{"poster":"Rcade Circles","date":"2015-09-03T12:38:21.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But ok that was definitely worth my time reading","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-31T12:11:23.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dha ma.....rito plz stop with these ridiculous and 2-part names....DHA....MA......","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-01T11:23:24.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This one makes sense this time though ahah, it's technically 2 champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-31T04:58:02.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ORRRR It might just be for the project skins. which are coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Rcade Circles","date":"2015-09-03T12:37:22.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Argh srsly i did read about dha ma but i didnt really think it was going to be a champ due to problems with developing thing with the community etc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2015-08-31T06:00:02.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"His release has further been delayed to early 2016 because of kit, tech and theme difficulties regarding the champion.\"\n\nScroll down to second paragraph: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ao_Shin","replies":[]}]}
