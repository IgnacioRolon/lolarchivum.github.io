He's so underrated, and I have no idea why! Sure, he does get a bit boring after playing him a lot, but so does every champion after a while! Hes OP in lane, team fights and 1v1! Tbh, I'm sorta glad to be the only Yorick player here, he's a lot stronger then people take him for... Poppy is eh, she's an OP supp (yes, I did create the Poppy supp meta) and Taric one of the strongest supps there is if played right... I remember my first time Taric, I went 13/1 and still got my adc fed... We carried so hard XD If I was to pick a champion update, it would be TF or singed... TF is an AP Mage, and I think he should have the potential to be able to burst someone easily, ATM. He can only poke and can die really easily. Now singed.... Singed is prob my least fav champ in the game, he's just plain boring and weak, he can only tank and flip people, and can only run away and be useless to actually get kills... But that is my opinion. \n\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-04T20:30:59.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well we know those guys (and midget) are pretty strong but its more just about their kits and how they're played and how they affect the game. i feel all of those champs have too simple of kits to be able to be effective in various situations\n\ntaric has the absolute least complicated and most boring kit in the game. i would definitively call him the worst champ in the game but he has a +52% winrate so welp.....fuck me right. his tankiness comes from his boring yet op armour aura, which just gives him and everyone around him more armour...so fun amirite\n\nyorick has 3 abilities that are essentially the exact same just with different effects. i never wouldve thought summoning a bunch of of ghouls would allow a champ to be the least counterable and possibly most sustainable champ in the game. it also doesnt really make sense for that sustain, \"need health? press E, gg2ez\"\n\npoppy is another example of just having things. she just naturally tanks a whole lot more damage than everyone, she just gets move speed, armour AND ad from pressing W. uses ult, gets absolutely 0 damage from everything on the map besides the target and fountain laser. her q is one of the strongest attack resets in the game, but it only does damage, and nothing else.\n\nat least with singed he has a gimmick, or a number of them, and they work pretty well together. i dont play singed but i think poisoning a large amount of an area around you is pretty strong and great for controlling prolonged teamfights. his fling is an engage, a disengage, a counterengage, at least its harder to do than blitz and thresk hooks. in fact you can fling them into your adhesive for a stun, or they can just land in your poison and they try to run away but you're already at their intended escape route poisoning them the whole fight. a lot can still be done there","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-04T17:50:08.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riven needs a rework the most or to be nerfed so you can pick her up and not get a penta first game with her","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-04T20:08:26.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no please dont group your petty complaints about riven into my srs plea for champ reworks thx","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-04T20:15:46.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahhahah","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-03T23:38:48.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I think it's about time Quinn and Valor got a little love.

Shyvana and Olaf are probably getting something to make them feel more unique.\n\nThis doesn't really mean any of the champions mentioned are useless (even the ones getting full reworks still have uses) it is just that they will have more to do to feel impactful. Look at the Tristana rework. Sometimes an ability just needs some retuning to expand their options, like the Lux Q buffs.\n\nWhat about Quinn then? Say Tag Team was a toggle, how would you balance the map presence that would give you? What about something completely different? I know the _here I come/can't catch me_ crazy Jet Plane Bird feels great but what if that was ditched and Valor became a controllable pet on activation ~~like ~~ better than a Morde ghost that gave Quinn a new Q while it was active? So it really was a \"Tag Team\".\n\nThat being said I really want it to stay so Riot can make Toxic/Bioforge Quinn and give Valor a gas mask and a toxic nuke effect for Skystrike.","replies":[]}]}]}
