I&#039;m not sure if this problem is only happening to me, but during random times in low priority queue the timer will reset itself back to 20 minutes. If there is a fix for this or if it is happening to anyone else, I would love to know about it, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Unfriending","date":"2017-12-21T09:35:19.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed this multiple times as well - notably every time my computer goes to sleep or if I log into another windows account leaving this one logged in - but sometimes also just completely randomly. Even right now I'm noticing the timer going down at a slower rate than it should be (for example I've been finding a match for 11 minutes and it says that I have 14 minutes left). Haven't seen this before and I don't know about any fix...","replies":[]}]}
