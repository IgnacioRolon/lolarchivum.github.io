Lagging in champ select, told this to my team and tried to dodge, however because the client was lagging it was trying to &quot;retrieve information&quot; for about 30 seconds before it took me into the game anyway. After this, the game didn&#039;t load, and when I tried to reconnect to at least make sure the game wasn&#039;t a 4v5, I would either crash, the screen would go black, or the Reconnect button would be greyed out and I was unable to join the game. (This lag wasn&#039;t even from my internet either, the past few days after 11pm league has been guaranteed to be laggy, while my internet works perfectly for everything else {{item:3070}} )\r\n2. This is the game I shouldn&#039;t have left. I called ADC and picked vayne, then another person who called top but didn&#039;t get it called bot and locked in riven with ignite. Once I got into the game I told her I&#039;m inexperienced with Vayne and asked her to not take too much cs. Unfortunately she didn&#039;t listen and either last hit every minion or pushed so hard that I couldn&#039;t last hit any myself. After the first 2 or 3 waves in the game with zero cs and zero communication from Riven besides laugh taunts, I left the game because I was going to be made useless\r\n3. This game was today, in Australia where I am its over 30 degrees. During my game, I think about 15 to 20 minutes in, struggling to play support with a feeding zed who was in bot lane either pushing, last hitting, or giving kills, my computer overheated and crashed. The computer I play league on is old as hell, while it can still run league fine enough to play, it&#039;s fan to cool itself down is pretty terrible and almost useless. Because of my computers inbuilt limit that prevents me from even turning it back on once it hits a certain temperature, I was unable to even try to reconnect to the game\r\n\r\n3 games have given me low priority queue, and 2 of them I believe I shouldnt be punished for at all, seeing as riots servers and the weather are completely out of my control. Maybe if someone can look into my situation it would be really appreciated. I&#039;ve nearly been robbed by this terrible game once before and I don&#039;t want to have to sit through nearly 2 hours of waiting just to play 5 games, while other people who genuinely break the rules (feeders, actual people who intentionally afk in ranked, abusive people) go unpunished","replies":[{"poster":"Jolyne Cujoh","date":"2015-10-05T09:11:03.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that I think about it, I don't really care that I have to wait for these 5 games (I guess it's technically my fault), I'm mostly just annoyed that many other people aren't punished and that I need to wait 20 minutes each game for things out of my control","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-05T10:09:52.070+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it sucks a bit, but there's really no way of knowing if you left a game because your PC overheated or if you just wanted to ruin 4 people's day.
