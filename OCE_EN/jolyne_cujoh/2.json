Instead of getting into champ select I get a black loading screen. I waited it out just in case it was simply taking a while to load but nope, I was connected to champ select and because I didn&#039;t pick a champ I lost one of my promos. Really don&#039;t think this is fair seeing as how I need to win both my two last promo matches to advance, and in my 3rd or 4th attempt at getting and staying out of B4, I think we know how hard it is to win. Would really appreciate something to fix this up, if possible.","replies":[]}
