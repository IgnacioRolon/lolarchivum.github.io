The video doesnt state that it diamond gameplay but most of it is with the exception of some flex and norms games here and there, whilst doing your research on my ranking you shouldve noticed that i actually am D5 as of season 7 and as of this season as well which would also lead you to see that i haven't played thresh as much as i once used to.. which was.. yet again.. to be presumed roughly in the range of that elo at the time.\n\nTldr: yep, or atleast was at the time, players that are shown to be mid gold were playing in those \"diamond\" games at the time (riot match making btw) and nope, i just havent played on my main regularly to climb back up to diamond, was there when clips and montage was made am there now\n\nThanks for compliment and thank you for watching","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2018-11-07T11:56:51.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Music is garbage IMO, everyone has different taste.\n2. Editing is pretty basic and tacky in some areas but nothing wrong with it I guess.\n3. Plays are standard or flashy for reason. Picks aren't really good plays, just mistakes by the enemy.\n\nComments: As a thresh main I can say its easy to take kills as him and you must take care not to KS, getting a quadra on thresh isn't a good play, the gold is better for your team.\n\nBest plays were 5:00-5:40 and also due to map pressure the dive with wukong at 4","replies":[]}]}
