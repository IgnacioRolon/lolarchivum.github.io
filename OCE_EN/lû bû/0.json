Really  energy is balanced enough as it is. \n\nTake Akali for instance, people dislike her enough as it is already. If you added an energy item it would mean more crazy range pokes or not punish her enough for spamming them not having enough for her smoke. \n\nI personally think it is bad enough she has the point system for her ult as it overall is already incredibly powerful and gives her escape and chase to the point of absurdity. So buffing the rest of her kit with an energy item would be just stupid and i think RIOT know that already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-22T02:35:03.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and early game power and sustain; since mana champions often have mana issues early but can eventually get to a point where their pools are more than enough.\n\nI do feel energy needs a rework though since some energy champions are seeing some issues competing with the new round of low mana cost meta mages (also a number of offmeta mages have ridiculous mana issues whilst doing less damage and often have similar utility which makes it hard to compete in that area because riot balancing sucks) though alot of assassins who run on energy would be completely broken with an energy item whilst others wouldn't really notice much of a difference.\n\nI guess if you wanted an energy item it would have to be an 'out of combat' energy regen like a warmog because energy is still currently stronger than mana early levels and we're still in a fast paced meta.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-22T08:11:08.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I guess if you wanted an energy item it would have to be an 'out of combat' energy regen like a warmog because energy is still currently stronger than mana early levels and we're still in a fast paced meta.\n\nEnergy regen isn't that slow that you would need an \"Out of combat\" energy regen part.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-22T11:57:53.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I mean you can get energy runes to be fair lol","replies":[]}]}
