Anything that can block his w, is mobile enough to dodge his q and e, can out tank his damage in trades, goes invulnerable or can outright burst him, things like veig can easily kill skarrl, then because he is so squishy without skaarl they can literally 1 hit him, eq veig literally needs to his qr and then w where kled will land because he cant dodge it or anything because of the .5 sec cd on his spawn (after landing), his stun also stops him using e and stuff. Syndra's (and other prolonged effects like fizz w or zed r) will last through the dismount and can kill him before he even lands.\n\nAka, mobile champs, assassins, and burst mages, tanks with enough damage to win a trade or auto attack blocks can easily fight him and win, but champions that are really squishy and need a window to kill him usually lose, so most adcs do usually die to a kled unless they are a bit tanky, have a damage buff (like jinx will lose most fights unless she has her q pre stacked) or is a late game, full build kog.","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-06T14:14:50.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Teemo gets fucked by anything that can jump on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-06T14:24:27.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Icy Spectre,realm=EUW,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vAOs67NJ,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-09-06T14:14:50.804+0000)\n>\n> Teemo gets fucked by anything that can jump on him.\n\nand teemo fucks anything auto attack based, kled also weak to dot effects.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-06T08:47:38.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would suggest not vayne, definitely not vayne. If you want to counter kled, you need someone with ranged poke, lane bullies, good sustain, non-mobility cc (blinds, supression, knockups), tankiness and dueling potential. My suggestions are sion, moakai, teemo, cho'gath and basically anyone along those lines. Kled excels at killing squishy targets with his high mobility, enhanced aa's and the extra tankiness skaarl gives him to allow him to go all in. Tanky targets like sion can generally win all in duels with kled if he has comparable health and with the heavy zoning and poke sions' ranged abilities give him, kled has alot of issues picking the engage and winning the fight, not to mention if kled can't win by enough of a margin to keep skaarl, he's going to die from sions' passive. Teemo can shut down kled's main damage source with a well timed blind and the cd means that kled won't be able to outtrade the classic toxic shot damage.\n\n Anyways generally kled is good against squishy mechanically difficult champions and bad against mechanically simple tanky duelists.\nSo pick Sion, Teemo or Cho'gath. (I would also suggest cho'gath as a good counter to riven, fiora and yasou since he's tanky but does alot of damage and the aoe silence is a pain in the ass for any champion that relies on outplay)","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-06T14:14:20.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Kled excels at killing squishy targets with his high mobility, enhanced aa's and the extra tankiness skaarl gives him to allow him to go all in.\n\n> Teemo can\n\nget countered by high mobility and damage, because anything that can jump on teemo, will fuck him over any day.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-07T01:07:16.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blind him and walk away, kled's main damage source is his w, so if you blind him after he activates it, he can't use the increasing damage per hit of it, effectively neutering about 60% of his damage and it's on a long cooldown whereas blind is not.

That said I guess it depends on how you play these champions. Sion has a shield and lots of cc, zoning tools and some decent range and cho'gath is tanky with high base damage and again lots of cc and very good range. Sure they're not mobile but kled has a hard time killing/winning trades with them as well. For Sion in a defensive lane like this, I max my w then e, since q already scales off ad and the early shield and poke wins you the early laning phase. For Cho'gath I do my regular skillmax order for toplane, maxing e then w then q, giving the highest sustain since the silence is good for preventing kled from engaging properly with his joust (in much the same way I argue that cho'gath is good vs riven and yasou) and the knockup can be placed under you to disengage and allow you to walk back safely. His e spikes passing through the minion waves deter kled from csing and trading with you using his qw combo and so long as you aren't one of those idiots who wastes your ult on his skaarl, even though you're a tank he won't be getting the skaarl reset midfight.","replies":[{"poster":"LiLFlopper","date":"2018-11-24T23:06:55.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i played into kled as sion and was demolished in trades because kled runs conquer meaning the longer the trade the stronger plus the mobility and ranged attacks kled has (q) and the triple extra damage burst ability make tanks void since true damage kite ability with the graves knockback from shotgun-mode and the fact he regains tankyness while you chase him since he attacks and runs away at the same time plus out sustains with the fact he dosent use mana and starts tanky since he has 2 health pools and gets a massive shield that buffes his damage essentially then you cant run since tanks are slow and he has a dash and ms buff ult so in what world did you lose","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-06T11:39:55.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tbonelewigi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vAOs67NJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-06T07:36:16.485+0000)\n>\n> I think Vayne does \n\nFind me something that % health true damage doesn't counter and ill be impressed xD","replies":[{"poster":"LiLFlopper","date":"2018-11-24T23:13:03.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"here is where trynd excels spin auto kill thats that to vayne","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-06T14:10:47.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Teemo.\n\nAs long as he has pink ward/red trinket and does not get stunned.\n\nEDIT: now that's ironic, because pink ward/red trinket counters teemo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcsecond","date":"2016-09-06T13:14:42.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kled is countered by high burst damage or kiting such as Kayle or Akali.
