We are now Oceanic League Lounge.\n\nWe are here to carry on what the old server was initially designed to facilitate - a healthy community for players, one that also accommodates for new players. Here, there will be many resources for League of Legends and TFT. Whether you're trying to improve at the game, finding new groups of people to hangout with, or are looking for individuals with a common love for League of Legends, you will find your place inside the OLL. \n\nOn August 29, we will be hosting an RP giveaway to commemorate our first month as a newly branded server. Stick around, and react for the giveaway. Invite your friends, maybe they'll win and split the RP with you!\n\nSo pop in, say hey, and a friendly member will greet you. \n\nWe hope to see you around.\n\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"jaromeo","date":"2019-07-30T09:42:01.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happened to the previous discord server?","replies":[{"poster":"Boris1","date":"2019-07-30T10:25:27.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The owner deleted it due to reasons that I don't want to discuss.

I believe that there are multiple ones created by people who think that they could carry on that community in their own ways. As one of the previous long time members of that server (as well as ex mods/admins), I can tell you that the insane population growth was because of the owner's efforts as well as other members who had advertised the server in the past. Once they start gaining members quickly, it acted like a catalyst and proceeded to get as big as it did.\n\nAlso that server didn't grow that big in just a few weeks or anything.  It took months or at least a year before it even got that big so I don't know why you're talking about it like that. I'm not sure if you were aware of how the server actually acted and behaved throughout most of the time it was up.\n\nWe aren't really competing with anyone either. We have our own goals and we will aim to achieve them over time :)","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-08-03T15:15:34.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ah yes, you were one of the chief people associated with moderating a toxic server - and for the most part achieved the status of maintaining a discord server where it breathed arguments and toxicity. I'm well aware of how the server actually acted and behaved, having been a casual floating member of it for well over a year or so.\n\nOf course you're competing, the downvotes and seizing numbers to monopolise an OCE discord league community is something that you guys are trying to accomplish. Let me tell you, you as well as the ex mods/admins who are recreating basically an identical environment to what it was before is only going to come full circle eventually.\n\nHow is Trin doing by the way? Is he okay? Because he sure made the right choice abandoning the server. There is this wild obsession of power that some of you guys have some fantasy over. It's never about the community. :)\n\n**DO NOT JOIN THIS SERVER. **","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FrogsAreSCARY","date":"2019-08-01T09:28:03.895+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"****I would Not recommend you to join this server.**** \n\nFirst of all, it is run by the same admin/mod team that ran the old discord, which promoted hate speech and toxicity. They say they aren't going to be about this in their new server, but through looking at the other servers looking to rebuild a community, I can see that they haven't changed a bit. I was looking in the chat of one of said servers, and was surprised to see one of the admins of this server openly flaming the way that their server was going about things. \n\nI found both this server and the other server through a boards post, and when I was viewing the posts yesterday, this post had 31-0 upvote ratio while the other one had 18-0. When I checked again recently, this post's votes hadn't changed at all, while the other server's had a ratio of 19-22. It seems plainly obvious to me that the admins of this server are actively trying to sabotage the other servers to get ahead, by using all of their accounts to downvote other people's posts. This really is childish behaviour, and goes against their 'values'.\n\nToxic children like these shouldn't be running a discord server!","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-08-03T15:27:56.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Couldn't agree more. I don't see why the admin/mod team on that server can't just have a tiny 10-20 ppl discord server where they all can chill, since it's only them talking to each other really. \n\nIt's such a troll discord league community, and while i'm an advocate for free speech - these guys have no shame in inciting behaviour that would otherwise be called out for in real life. LoL already has a toxic OCE community, this _**\"Rebranded Discord Server - Oceanic League Lounge\"**_ compliments such toxicity to the next level where things that may offend or cause disunity towards individuals is left approved by the so called admin/mod team. \n\nIt really is a cesspit and for those reading these posts - I highly recommend you DO NOT JOIN this server. The probability of being disappointed in joining a chill community atmosphere is high.","replies":[{"poster":"Boris1","date":"2019-08-19T04:53:41.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm sorry that you feel this way about our server. Since starting up the Oceanic League Lounge, we've strictly enforced our rules to enhance the experience of our members. I have not seen any instances of what you have mentioned in your comments in OLL. I would advise you to read through the Rules &amp; Welcome page in our server, as it's clearly indicative that we take toxicity pretty seriously and don't condone it. I hope you give OLL a shot.
