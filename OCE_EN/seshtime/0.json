If anyone knows please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-03T08:02:22.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP gain is based off of a number called MMR (match-making rating). This number is a rough indicator of that player's skill, which is calculated off of all their previous games and whether they won or lost. It's basically a more accurate version of league/division. When you are waiting in queue, you're matched with people of similar MMR to you, and then the teams are distributed to have the closest amount of total MMR spread among each team.\n\nOf course, there will be instances where one team has more MMR than the other. In those cases, the team with higher MMR is the \"favourite\" to win. If your team is not the favourite to win, but you win anyway, then you will gain significantly more LP for that match as you were expected to lose. Same thing vice-versa.\n\nIn some rare cases, the MMR difference is extreme and the LP rewards are changed very unexpectedly (like, only 1 LP gain for a win and 50 LP loss for losing.) This are fortunately *rare*.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-03T05:24:06.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's called MMR.\n\nGoogle it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seshtime","date":"2015-03-02T19:20:35.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why does it say my IGN is EyeD i changed my IGN ages ago to Pawn","replies":[]}]}
