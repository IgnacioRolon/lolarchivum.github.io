Explosive charge does 100 at max if lucky. basic attacks do nothing and the ult seems like your shooting a pea. Am I doing something wrong??? She seems really weak compared to all the adc&#039;s in the new season. Almost every game its graves or Miss fortune and they seem to do tons of damage even when they have nothing. Does ADC tristana need a buff of some sort? If im just bad and Tristana is fine then could somebody tell me a build/skill chart for her\r\n{{champion:18}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-06T14:30:34.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you building {{item:3094}} first?\n\nTrist is all about the Crit, not CDR so {{item:3031}}  is better than {{item:3508}} on her.\n\nAlso remember that if you coming up against tanky champions.
