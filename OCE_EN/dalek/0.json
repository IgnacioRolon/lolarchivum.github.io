It&#039;s a gem of a game if I am able to find a team that won&#039;t threaten to AFK or troll in order to get their respective roll that they believe they (Trolls) can do better than you. I feel as if people who do this in champion select that are caught with proof should be banned or given a warning, and if they were to abuse other players inside of champion select again, their account should be banned for a longer period or permanently. \nhttp://gyazo.com/be7164f5b5b61624574fc4ec51c5216f\nhttp://gyazo.com/170964a70c40ba35e89cffb41fcdee4c\nhttp://gyazo.com/cd3a7bd094b32c8b57b0e9f06ba15f72\nhttp://gyazo.com/01a21e398bd94329bc80241e2436c557","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-15T09:35:48.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n\nIf you see someone harrassing others in chat, then you should report them for the behaviour at the post-game lobby screen. You can also submit reports via [support tickets](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), if for some reason you weren't able to do so from the post-game lobby screen. You can also provide your additional evidence there, but that usually isn't required as Riot can read their own chat logs if they desire.","replies":[]}]}
