So I was playing some ranked games with my mate. In the first game of the day, we encountered a player by the name of **[REMOVED]**. The second we entered champion select he typed &quot;Taking mid otherwise trolling.&quot; (he was assigned support). When he didn&#039;t get his way, he insta-locked Teemo with Cleanse and Ghost. In game, he did everything you would expect a guy like this to do. (Feed, AFK, make smart-ass comments and just being a dickhead in general.) The following are the screenshots from champion select. **[REMOVED]** shows the stats from the game. (I am Dalek and my mate is Vashta Nerada.)\nPlease ban this scum Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-03T09:10:43.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"raise a support ticket if it was particularly nasty.
