I&#039;ve tried all the fixes in Internet Explorer but none of them work, I don&#039;t know if anybody can help me, considering its an internet problem, but I thought I might as well post anyways. If anyone can help that would be great.\r\nThanks. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-06T07:55:08.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dalek,\n\n>Exterminateeee! \n\nCan you try configuring your DNS using the guide linked below? \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5","replies":[]}]}
