You are NOT the omni-god of your team,  people do NOT have to listen to you. If he thinks he can go in the enemy jungle to outplay his opponents or get a ward/steal a camp without being spotted, then he has full fucking right to do it.\n\n\"Both situations are aware of the outcome before doing it, its a fucking joke that \"it's not intentional unless I say it is\".\" \n\nDo you read minds for a living? You have NO IDEA that they are fully aware of what exactly is going to happen. Just because you told them what you think the outcome would be, doesn't mean that IS what the outcome will be. You cannot always be correct. \n\nAnd who the fuck said it's only intentional if they say it is? You will know yourself, it's not that hard to fucking realise the difference, and when you do realise, you report for intentionally feeding, not for failing to listen to you, because they do not have to.\n\nGet the fuck over yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-25T05:25:44.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you report someone who is walking into their team for intentional feeding and they get away with it, because \"lol, just a bad game friend\" was said. \n\nOkay.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-25T06:43:44.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no clue if you're referring to a scenario that actually happened or if that's a made up story, but I'm pretty sure if someone is intentionally feeding and gets reported for it, Riot's not going let him get away with it because someone  said \"lol, just a bad game friend\"....

Just because you've put it in chat doesn't mean the other person has seen it. Ever heard of the mute feature? Well there are plenty of players who immediately \"mute all\" at the start of any given match to avoid dealing with abusive players, and such players would never see you telling them that \"x champ is in that bush\" because they have you muted. If you're using pings, and you use it right on top of their champion, then it could be considered \"refusing to listen/communicate\" if it occurs more than once (and assuming there is enough warning for them to react in each instance).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-14T02:31:02.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a learning process. \nIn another players eyes they believe they know better than the random person telling them how to play.\nIn some cases it's true.\n\nHowever, you learn better by making mistakes over and over again.
