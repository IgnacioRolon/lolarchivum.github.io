(with a slight bias towards assassins tho)\n\nBut I am thoroughly enjoying seeing some champs I haven't seen for ages coming out of the woodwork.\n\nFor example My friend has just started playing Diana, I personally don't play her, but I'm amazed at how well rounded she is as a champion, she is devastating when ahead (but not unstoppable) and weak when behind (but not weak enough to be completely useless) she is an assassin, but not one that can 1v3, get 2 kills and then escape (like Zed can).\nIt's champs like her that can hopefully redeem the assassin meta!\n\nAlso if you don't mind, as a jungle main, what is your view on ivern?\nI'm a mid laner so i don't know much about the jungle, but I am loving ivern (im lvl 7 on him now) \nSo as a jungle main, I'm just curious to know your thoughts on how he fits into the jungle as a whole?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-11-29T01:55:24.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't like him.
