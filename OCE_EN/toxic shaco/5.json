When someone from the player behavior team does a Q&A, I'll point this out to them. Although, if you're feeling bold you can ask **Riot Lyte** yourself [here](https://twitter.com/riotlyte?lang=en) and [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/).\n\n> The third one was to an enemy Lux who was shittalking after dying 3 times. It is harmless banter. If someone is offended by that then they really shouldn't be on the internet.\n\nIf someone is offended by it, then by definition it's not harmless. \n\n+ **Riot** loves banter among friends, but when you include strangers and others, you can't expect them to understand the context. Therefore just like in real life, you need to be more careful. \n\n _Think about it this way:_\nIf one of your friends wears something weird to work or school, the all the lads are going to give him shit for it. That's just banter, because he understands the context.\n\n If you see a stranger dressed awkwardly and you give him shit, it's harassment. He doesn't understand the context at all. To him, you seem like an asshole.\n\n **Context is everything.** \nAlthough to be honest, I doubt you were banned for this or most of the other stuff for that matter. What would have actually triggered the ban is **Fiora** incident.\n\n> Was spoken by me, to my premade ally, in team chat.

The community is not willing to tolerate people walking all over each other and trash talking.\n\n You chose to express your opinion about **Fiora** in a public environment where there were 3 other strangers.  Someone saw this and rightfully thought that it was not behavior he wanted to see in League.\n\n You could have private messaged your friend with the in-game chat system, but since you decided to post this in a public environment, you are subject to the rules and standards we have.\n\nI understand that the in-game report system can feel PC culture-ish at times, but it's really just protecting values that the players treasure and want to keep. If you want to play League you'll have to learn to fit in.\n\nIf you have any further questions feel free to reply, I'd be happy to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-04-07T09:13:19.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OR what is more likely to have happened is \n\nEnemy team happy to shit talk and banter while ahead, when we come back they get butthurt and decide to report everyone on the enemy team out of spite, because one of them is bound to have done something wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-07T09:40:20.286+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely likely something similar to this happened, considering that for most of the match you just trash talked the enemy team.

For this reason alone, a blanket application of a US-based global system cannot work to its full potential when the US and Australia are seen as being on opposite ends of the swearing spectrum - where in the USA saying \"damn\" is kinda rude, but in Australia the first word out of 90%* of children is \"f$ck\"\n\nI reckon riot is getting a bit precious on the swearing front in a bid to look like they're taking action, but is the system used in oz a mirror of the system used in the USA and, if so, is it unnecessarily harsh on Australians for whom swearing is pretty much part of day to day interaction?
