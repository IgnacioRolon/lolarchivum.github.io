Ali may have an overall win rate of less than 50%, and may not get picked or banned much, but he is decently popular in the higher ranks because he is actually very strong.\n\nMalphite likely will be hit with a nerf as soon as they can work out any kinks and find something that will make him balanced instead of gutting him completely.\n\nBalance isn't as easy as you might think. There are a whole lot more statistics to look at that just pick/ban/win rates, and a whole lot more than just statistics to look at. You have to look at team comps, playstyles and everything that is player based and try to balance around that as well, so you don't accidentally get some super strong or super weak team comp in the mix. \n\nBalance is about keeping that 50% winrate in ALL avenues of play as best as is possible.\n\nLee Sin has a <50% winrate even in Plat+ with more than 100 Lee games (at least as of a couple weeks ago). Do you feel he should be buffed? Most people feel that Lee Sin is too strong, and yet his winrate defies that. Pick/Ban/Winrates aren't everything in balance, there';s a whole lot more to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-19T22:57:11.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The statistics I used were Plat V and above, the top 10% of players. \n\nI am aware of that, but Zed for example has a 50% banrate over all divisions, and a 15% pick rate despite the high ban rate.  He also has a 52% win rate.\n\nClearly, if he is banned 50% of the time in every division, players are screaming his current state is unhealthy, but they don't even seem to looking in his direction.\n\n\n\nOr why when they do nerf something, it seems to be a completely unrelated issue.\n\nEzreal for example, is recently very popular with the blue build, so they nerf his ultimate.\nAll his power is on his Q damage/kite potential, so they nerf his ult, leaving the actual problem unresolved.\n\nThat's like saying \"Annie's burst is too strong, so let's nerf her base AD by 1 per level.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-15T14:21:35.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not the pbe","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-15T14:30:11.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sarcasm, I assume.\n\nWhat prompts them to make the change is what I am asking.\n\nThey come up with a change, send it to PBE.
