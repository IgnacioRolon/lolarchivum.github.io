The problem is I need to spend $20 to get 2250 Rp because just buying $10 of Rp would only get me 1100 Rp, which isn&#039;t enough for a name change unlike on NA where $10 or Rp would be enough.\n\nMost people tell me to suck it up and just buy the $20 of Rp, and I would, if I wasn&#039;t an under age person without a job or any kind of debit/credit card, whose parents will hardly every buy them anything online unless it is a physical object.\n\nI guess I just wanted to get this off of my chest, even if it makes no sense and just sounds like I&#039;m complaining about first world problems.\n \n>The more I read over this, the more I don&#039;t want to post it because I just sound like a whiny brat.\n\nRp Ajustment in Oceania\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/MXv9uHnL-rp-adjustment-in-oceania","replies":[{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2016-03-15T22:57:21.130+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't you just use like 13000 IP for a name change instead? that way you don't need to buy RP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-15T13:10:55.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the problem comes from the government, whenever Liberals are in our dollar value tanks, whenever Labor are in our dollar soars.\nRiot as a company made the best choice for them to maintain profits as are instead of losing money in the OCE region.\n\nUnfortunately companies rarely care that while the currency is weaker to them, it's not weaker or stronger in the region it's from.\n$10 AU is still $10 to an Australian same for $100 or even $1000, but for a US based company that $1000 is only $700.","replies":[{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-03-15T15:13:28.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=24Y1Z4pr,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-03-15T13:10:55.822+0000)\n>\n> Honestly the problem comes from the government, whenever Liberals are in our dollar value tanks, whenever Labor are in our dollar soars.\n> Riot as a company made the best choice for them to maintain profits as are instead of losing money in the OCE region.\n> \n> Unfortunately companies rarely care that while the currency is weaker to them, it's not weaker or stronger in the region it's from.\n> $10 AU is still $10 to an Australian same for $100 or even $1000, but for a US based company that $1000 is only $700.\n\nI'd like to say the reason the dollar went down is because mining profits which was holding our dollar up during the gfc went into the ground as china stopped buying anywhere near as much as they are now making it themselves, and has nothing to do with the party that is in power (although they do have some power to influence it, they wouldn't because we want the currency to be low for our exports(same reason as why riot make us pay more for the same rp, because they are selling an American product and we have to pay for the gap in currency values, even if really we shouldn't really have to because our purchasing power is so much higher here)).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PROJECT Cosco","date":"2016-03-15T13:07:17.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If maxandmillion is still your name, i do like it {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
