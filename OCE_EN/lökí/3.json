Whats happening in game the last year or two, is people understanding that they can get away with a few games in a row or just straight up game play sabotage.\nRiot are too afraid to get more strict with their punishments (banning from ranked play etc). chat bans do not do anything, if a player is punished for game play, the have instant access back to ranked playlists. if someone just got punished for something, that person will repeat again the first chance they get.

Sounds great! Until a losing team starts bullying the worst players into taking dives for the team so they lose less LP, or from people just doing that in general and skewing everyone's LP and ranking.\n\nSuch a system also imbalances LP and MMR, which causes all sorts of backend drama that would throw matchmaking into inaccuracy chaos.\n\n>banning from ranked play\n\nThey tried this, and the result was all the toxicity just got pushed into other game-modes instead. In other words, it had exactly 0 impact on toxicity, which is why there are just straight-up hard bans instead.\n\n>chat bans do not do anything\n\nThey do, but it ultimately depends on the player. The vast majority of players reform after their first punishment (usually a chat restriction). \n\nUltimately, it's in *Riot's* interest to be as efficient as possible in this (while still maintaining their policy of attempting reformation before removal). If the data didn't support the effectiveness of chat restrictions, they wouldn't use them.\n\n>if someone just got punished for something, that person will repeat again the first chance they get\n\nAs I mentioned, usually that is not the case. However, accounts with recent punishments are generally under much closer scrutiny than accounts without.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-09-19T02:32:04.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Norms/aram has less negative players, yet banning/temp banning as punishment from ranked play pushes the toxicity around?
