It's very hard to not just go into your Settings interface, and just click the button that allows us to enable our ability to chat and be nasty to people.\r\n\r\nI'd be in such a state of relief to be able to not flame my team mates in situations where i have no control of using it.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion, if anyone has any thoughts i'd love to hear them.\r\nTHanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2020-02-14T20:51:52.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this already exists. in your client before you queue up. settings -> interface ->scroll down to \"chat\" section -> uncheck \"show allied chat\" -> uncheck \"show all chat\"","replies":[{"poster":"MMkk","date":"2020-02-15T02:20:17.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not what i'm talking about.\nWhat i'm trying to say is there should be an option in the \"Client\" That STOPS you from allowing the chat to be RE-ENABLED when you go into the game.\nHaving it as an option would stop toxicity rates by a lot for ppl who don't want their acc's banned.","replies":[]}]}]}
