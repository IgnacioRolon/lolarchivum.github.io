I wanna know who wins.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my friend and I were playing a 1v1 Vlad game on Howling Abyss and the only way either of us could have won is through first blood, first to 100cs or first tower blood. \r\n\r\nSince Vlad can sustain in battle because of his q (transfusion), both of us would have struggled to achieve first blood, so we aimed to get 100cs. Both my friend and I were close to 100cs. So my friend pushed forward to achieve the first 100cs, however, I was close to killing him because he was low compared to me. Somehow my friend achieved 100cs but I killed him while his auto killed the minion meaning that we both achieved our objective at the same time. \r\n\r\nWould you consider the first blood or 100cs top priority in a 1v1? I would like to hear your thoughts because I want to see if either my friend or I won the 1v1.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-08-29T10:28:37.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think normally it's whichever happened first, but on the assumption they occurred simultaneously, rather counter intuitively, the ranking is\n1. tower\n2. 100cs\n3. first blood\nin terms of deciding the victor.\nSince first tower means they managed to maintain lane dominance and force you to run away, 100cs means you were pressured off the wave, and finally first blood is the lowest priority but is often the first to take place and shows that they managed to kill you.\n\nIn summary, you might have killed him, but your friend won because he had showed dominance in lane, since in 1v1 diving a tower is particularly difficult.","replies":[]}]}
