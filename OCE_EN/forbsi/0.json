Melee could circle to the turret and may fight the enemy melee minions unless a champion kills them before them to allow more damage to the turret (Players would be inclined to protect the minions more in this instance) Maybe have 2 bridges in mirror fashion \r\n\r\nOther creative ideas on this discussion will be appreciated :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-12-11T06:00:02.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Although the creation of new maps sounds really cool, it is really hard to balance a game with several maps. This is because\n\n-Ranked queues would be confusing because it would be harder for people to win on certain maps with different champions\n\n-MMR for different maps would have to be re-thought\n\n-There would be different champion META throughout different maps\n\n-Queue times would be longer\n\nBy all means follow through with this, and i think the idea of bridges where players could walk over eachother would be really cool. Maybe even different floors, you could add in an elevator or something. The problem is it would have to be its own game-mode, because if someone was challenger on Summoners Rift. Then moved to a new map against challengers on it, they would be at a large disadvantage. Maybe you could add a new ranked system into the new map, like instead of having Bronze, SIlver, Gold etc you could have different tiers. Anyway, just an idea ill stop ranting.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbsi","date":"2015-12-11T06:27:33.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see your point, however it isn't impossible to implement 1 or 2 maps like so. They would have to get creative in its layout so that such disadvantages won't happen.\n\nA new ranked system sounds good but I think they can just adjust the current ranked system to suit the maps in mind.\n\nI was thinking like weaving lanes that have the same direction as the summoner map 3 directions but less uniform and with chokepoints like the bridge scenario. But essentially have the same type of map but with variations. When people choose the summoner PvP map it'll be random style for flair","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T16:28:55.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id be interested in you killing yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-13T09:59:06.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think a new map is warranted in terms of layout. As CrispyLeaves points out, it would be nightmare to balance. However, as I've mentioned before, skins on the existing Rift map would be awesome! Like how they changed Howling Abyss to Bilgewater, you could change Summoner's Rift into Void Rift, or Snow Rift, or Dark Rift, or Overgrown Riftâ€¦ Molten Rift? Metallic Rift?\n\nSo many options! You could have it change perhaps 10-20% of the games you play, so perhaps one in five games is on a different map skin on average, and it could be like a rare treat. It would require minimal work compared to a completely new map, and it would spice up your games every once in a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbsi","date":"2015-12-13T10:59:04.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds great, however having the same map even in different skins of the same map would get a little tedious at best. Its a good point to say that it would be difficult for them to implement a new map but for them to make the effort to create it would reap benefits for us all.\n\nI still like the bridge idea, maybe have a similar map design but with added bridges amongst the map at turret intervals etc. \nIt would minimalize the balancing required... thx for your imput","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-11T06:40:35.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bridge sounds cool, but the problem lying there is that there is no z axis in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Forbsi","date":"2015-12-11T12:00:01.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok then I didn't realise that, maybe they one day could implement it. They seem to be doing rather well for themselves, improving the game further like that will only increase their profit. Maybe in another installation in a sequel or something...\n\nMaybe like in the other map where there is a single lane they could expand into maybe a dungeon map (with the 3 lanes respectively) while without the z axis currently. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"choclatethunder","date":"2015-12-11T05:34:12.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one likes change.","replies":[{"poster":"Forbsi","date":"2015-12-11T12:04:15.084+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"The creators can put forward a poll to the players in whether we would be interested in such maps (including z axis talked about with TALON12)\n\nI understand there is risk involved in such an endeavour but since when does anything worth it doesn't have a risk factor.
