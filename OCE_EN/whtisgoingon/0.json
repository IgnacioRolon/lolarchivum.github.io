Your client has corrupted files. Even if you *just* did a reinstall, some files may not have been installed correctly. Troubleshoot your computer and see if there's anything interfering with data transference.\n\n2. You have normal cast enabled for those spells. These require you click the spell to select it, and then click again to actually cast it. Some spells even require a third click, but that's mostly for things like champion abilities and such. Go into your key bindings and make sure everything is how you want it to be.\n\n3. An external program like LolReplay is intefering with your cooldown timers, thus making you believe you have spells available when you actually don't. Try disabling those programs and then running League to see if that fixes your issue.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"whtisgoingon","date":"2015-04-04T03:27:49.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you I think it is a keyboard issue, maybe HP problems. \nPrehaps issue 2 on your list and I am looking at keyboard and Direct X  as","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-04T07:54:04.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, you might want to try using the generic keyboard drivers instead of whichever ones you are using then. To do that:\n\n1. Using an admin account, open your start menu and search for \"Device Manager\". Open it.\n2. Navigate to \"Keyboards\" and identify the one which you're using.\n3. Right-click and go to \"Properties\".\n4. Go to the \"Driver\" tab and then click \"Driver Details\"\n5. Check the provider. If it's anything other than Microsoft, then that means it's a third-party driver.\n\nI am presuming you're on Windows, version Vista or above. If the driver is not default, tell me and I'll instruct you on how to use the default one. Don't attempt this by yourself if you don't know what you're doing, as you may permanently disable your keyboard.\n\nAnd, of course, if there's any programs you have installed which alter your keyboard input in any way (such as programs with *global* shortcuts, or ones that add 'hotkeys' to your keyboard) try ending those applications before running League.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
