If it's legitimate lag (the number you see with Ctrl+F) then it could be either your side or Riot's.\n\nCould you tell me what appears when you run dxdiag.exe, that is if you're on Windows.\n\nPS You mentioned that you have an OS, **implying that it's optional.**","replies":[{"poster":"ShroomZ","date":"2015-05-18T01:48:32.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both frame rate and ping randomly spike, OS is Win7 64bit ultimate, Graphics card is a ati radeon HD 6570 and will run dxdiag.exe when I get home after work, also I mention my pcs specs so my pc or connection is not the first thing to be blamed for this annoying lag.\n\nPS how does a OS become a optional thing ????","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-18T09:03:04.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">aswell as OS\n\nI presume you meant \"as well as an OS\", implying that normally people don't get an OS, and that it's an optional extra. You probably meant something else, lol.\n\nIf your frame-rate is grinding down as you near other champions, that it pretty much on your end. Your ping spiking up would be a result of your frame-rate going down (it doesn't work the other way around, though, so a high ping will not cause a low frame-rate if your computer was perfectly fine and capable).\n\nHave you updated your graphics drivers recently, along with Windows 7? There have been service packs released, and newer versions of frameworks.\n\nDo you regularly check your computer for viruses and other malicious softwares?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
