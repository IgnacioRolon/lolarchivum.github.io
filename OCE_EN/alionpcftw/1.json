Zilean's father arriving from his shopping saved the the boy just in time freezing the beast in time and left him below the clock tower but as zilean's life and his clock tower now trapped forever in time he had forgotten about the beast and after a century and a half the spell had deteriorated Tre'ox escaped running towards anything that could satisfy his starvation eating people and animals alike untill he found noxus and ravaged the area summoners were able to capture him and discovered the beast could speak saying his name was Tre'ox and he was from a time before any of this was ever created so the summoners made a deal with him if you fought in the league we would return you to your time and home he agreed but on one condition if he saw zilean he was allowed to kill him on sight so to this day he is hunting, searching for the boy that trapped him underground for nearly 2 century's.\n\nAppearance:He would basically look like a Tyrannosaur but from the void blue and purple skin,barbed tail,mane made of bristles i need more help on the appearance \nAge: He would be around 67 to 66 million years old because he has been teleported from way back in time but his real age would be around in his 30,s \nLength, Height and Weight: His length would be around 40 feet , he would be 13 to 15 feet tall and he would weigh around 5 to 6.8 metric tons\nPersonality: Think a very angry, primal cho'gath cept with loneliness and depression (i feel slack for my own creation) \nVoice: a deep slow speech his original language wasn't common so he has trouble with it.\nHobbies: Chasing nidalee's and dueling udyr's also counter jungling warwicks.\n\nAbilities:\nPassive-Awoken Rage-Tre'ox gains 5 fury on attack, up to a cap of 100.\nWhen Tre'ox uses an ability, he gains a buff making him deal 2/4/6 extra physical damage on attack for each 5 fury he has. The buff lasts for 5 seconds. When Tre'ox has this buff, each basic attack will reduce his fury by 5. If Tre'ox\ngets down to 0 fury, the buff ends. If Tre'ox uses an ability while this buff is active, it gets refreshed and he gains 10 fury.\n\nQ-Primal Slam-Tre'ox Slams his foot infront of him, sending a shockwave dealing damage to enemies, and fearing enemy minions and monsters it passes by. Damage 40/50/65/85/100 Scales 1-3.5\n\nW-Ferocious Feaster-Tre'ox grabs an enemy minion/monster he will carry it around until his health reaches below 40%, when it reaches below 40% Tre'ox will feast on the minion/monster restoring 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30% of his missing HP (you cannot attack while feasting but you may choose to drop the minion/monster at will if needed)\n\nE-Perfect Hunter-Tre'ox enhances his vision gaining increased vision range for a short time, and is able to detect stealthed enemies in close range of him (evelynns' detection range is increased for Tre'ox only) \n\nR-Wrath of the Ancient Walker-Tre'ox Seethes his wrath for 2 seconds and then lets out a massive roar fearing all nearby enemy champions for 1.5 seconds and all minions and monsters nearby for 4 seconds, after the roar Tre'ox has +25/40/60 bonus physical damage for 5 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"AliOnPcFTW","date":"2014-12-25T07:27:53.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2014-12-16T04:05:25.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great champion concept. However, I have some questions/suggestions. If Tre'ox  looks like a tyrannosaurus Rex, maybe it can be a bit more voidish. Like a barbed tail, or even tails. Perhaps a spiked mane, like a frill. And of course, purple and blue. \n\nSecond, when he feasts on the minion/monster, he cannot attack. So what if he's chasing. Then the enemy damages him. Does he stop to feast or moves while feasting?","replies":[{"poster":"AliOnPcFTW","date":"2014-12-17T07:27:19.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm ill change it to a turn on/off thing so you can choose if you want to keep it in ya mouth and let go of the snack if you want also I've added some of your ideas to his appearance thank you for your suggestions ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-15T14:14:54.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds nice, we could always use a variation on the basic Void characters :) the abilities are nice, im still a bit new so i cant tell u if they're balanced but they sound like a good kit :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AliOnPcFTW","date":"2014-12-13T04:21:06.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have suggestions please by all means tell me ill change it to suite the peoples needs and wants","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxDragonHunterXx","date":"2014-12-12T09:45:04.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice champ, maybe a bit more difference between the names of each ability.
