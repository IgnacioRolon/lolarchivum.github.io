Normally get a loss prevented or something when the server goes to poo during a game, but it went down as a loss this time.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T11:24:22.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If both sides were getting lag at crucial events, why would that cause **your team specifically** to lose?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-04-09T08:39:59.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pissing me off so much I might just go postal.
