I ended up drawing two Ashe skins (20 and 70% off) and i have a mere 2.2k mastery on her  so like 4 games. I also pulled 2 {{champion:19}} skins (one of them going on sale later this month) and i have only about 20 normal games on him.\r\n\r\nSo to conclude im disappointed with the &quot;personalized&quot; offers i got from this, i don&#039;t know how the math works but why did i pull a skin for 2.2k mastery Ashe when i 70k on Riven","replies":[{"poster":"oJezah","date":"2015-12-17T02:25:22.214+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i really liked the concept of YOUR snowdown shop but it just didn't work for me, im not sure why when it is meant to be personalized it would offer champions how does rito know what champions i want. example it offered my lvl 7 smurf acc rek sai when it has only played {{champion:55}} \n\nFurthermore from the wider sample space of 2 smurf accounts and 3 friend accs, ashe tends to be popular all my accounts have been offered 2 ashe skins and two of my friends have been offered ashe skins they own. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jaya","date":"2015-12-17T08:53:50.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=oJezah,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8uEyItEE,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-12-17T02:25:22.214+0000)\n>\n> I mean i really liked the concept of YOUR snowdown shop but it just didn't work for me, im not sure why when it is meant to be personalized it would offer champions how does rito know what champions i want. example it offered my lvl 7 smurf acc rek sai when it has only played {{champion:55}} \n> \n> Furthermore from the wider sample space of 2 smurf accounts and 3 friend accs, ashe tends to be popular all my accounts have been offered 2 ashe skins and two of my friends have been offered ashe skins they own. {{item:3070}}\n\nWHAT EVEN\nI JUST BOUGHT CHALLENGER AHRI THINKING IT WOULDN'T LET ME {{champion:107}} AAAAAAAAAAH","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2015-12-18T02:42:37.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got two Dr Mundo skins... and i've only played him once in the free rotation...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-12-17T23:45:26.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I got skins that I particularly like and want.

I understand that what you get is random and the idea isn't for players to buy ever skin, which is fine. But when you get the 3 shen skins you don't have and two singed skins. it's a bit meh.
