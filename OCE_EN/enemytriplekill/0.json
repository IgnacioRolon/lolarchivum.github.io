Why would they waste time sending in a report ticket? It would be nicer if the new client had a way of sending in a report on certain chats that happen in the client.\n\nBut I can understand why this probably won't be implemented: The trade of for Riot hiring staff to deal with the many more reports vs dealing with the current level of boosters is probably not great for them.\n\nI did see a booster on some website that was a known OCE player though in high diamond. It's remarkable that Riot doesn't just hire 1 guy to go around boosting sites, getting their accounts boosted just to nail some of these people. I guess there's no real interest to catch boosters because boosted animals are the type of people to spend money on merchandise from Riot itself anyways.\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that I saw this boosting website where you could ask your booster to play certain roles and champions for a little extra money. You could seriously troll the booster if you went into a duo-queue arrangement (so they can't script on your account). See how good they really are in elo hell divisions {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-15T07:49:21.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TELE, PLEASE REPORT TO THE NAME AND SHAME DEPARTMENT PLEASE.
