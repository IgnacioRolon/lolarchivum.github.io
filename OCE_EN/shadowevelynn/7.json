Would it not be possible to implement the ability to click on the flag to bring up a trade for that lane/role as it will be alot clearer for your team mates if you do swap roles. And in the instance someone is chat banned they would still be able to change lanes without having to talk in chat.\r\nJust an idea","replies":[]}
