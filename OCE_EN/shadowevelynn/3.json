Or original ones for each champion, though i Doubt they would want to put time into that one. \r\nHaha, I want to what other Idea&#039;s people have out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-08T05:33:34.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be nice, although i think it should be something like, idk, \"you can't get more than 5\" type of deal.\nEnough to have the icons for your mains, but not enough that everyone has tons of icon. Keep it exclusive to the guys who really get dedicated to those champs.\n\nas for when/how to gain them or how/when to drop them (make space for a new one)... not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-08T06:26:51.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well at the moment rito at least has plans for a Tier 6/7 (there are game files for them) and given how the champion mastery points scale at this time, this will actually require some level of extra effort on the part of maining a champion (unless your gonna take months to get tons of Tier 7+ champions)\n\nI still think that instead of selling chroma's they should be with champion mastery but that's not gonna happen cause Rito want's money.\n\nPersonally i'm looking forward to trying to get my nidalee mastery up to Tier 6/7 before they even come out.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-08T06:48:32.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito does want the money. Compared to other major game developers they are quite generous with their time and resources. Most of the League community don't realise how hard Rito try to include the community within skin-ideas and updating-the-game departments.\nI think maybe adding the base skin chromas for every champion once you reach a high level of Tiers or max mastery for that champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-09T03:54:59.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, duh, servers don't run on +1s.\nAnd you're right, only it's not just the skins you _see_.\nI was lucky enough to get in the office - and holy damn, the scrapped ideas. I remember a Vayne skin concept on the wall... i think it later turned out into the graphics for Lucian, 'cause it had a very similar look, but still. Tons of drafts i've never actually got to see in the client.\nThere's a lot of work going on, and we only get to see the shiny part of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-08T06:47:14.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*wants\n\nWe'll have to see if, once reaching T5, we still get CP. As for Chromas they seem to be more custom-made recolors than change-one-setting recolors, and i think they're just checking community reaction to them...\nWouldn't object to a profile banner for T7 :D","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-08T08:27:31.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the mass lash back that Rito received and the fact that Reddit now has a section devoted to actually making chroma's that are only visible for you (and they don't take that long to make) I really do hope they end up folding and bringing it out with champ mastery, simply because yes they aren't straight re-color's but fact is, they aren't as hard as riot is trying to sell them to be.\n\nFact is why spend so much for what is just a shitty re-color?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
