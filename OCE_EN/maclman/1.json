Giving out random free skins to every summoner with a clean record isn't exactly a routine task, and the last thing they'd want is for someone to feel cheated by getting an extremely bad skin, or for a toxic player to accidentally get a reward.\n\nHave some patience. It's just a stupid skin, not really relevant to your enjoyment of the game in any way. Not really trying to apologise for Riot's actions, but we don't need idiots like you spamming the forums when it's only been 3 days (when they specifically STATED it'd take a few days).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
