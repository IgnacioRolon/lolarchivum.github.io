Ranks up with his ult.\r\n\r\nQ: Puncture\r\n\r\nAatrox impales a target dealing 70/110/150/190/230 (+0.6 Bonus AD) physical damage and slowing his opponent by 5/10/15/20/25% for 2 seconds.\r\nPassive Aatrox has 2/4/6/8/10% Armour Pen. Also an Auto Attack reset.\r\n\r\nW: (Need a name)\r\nAatrox pulls in the blood of his enemies dealing 90/110/130/150/170 (0.4 Ability power) Magic damage, healing himself for half the damage\r\ndealt, but weakening himself in the process reducing his AD by 10/20/30/40/50.\r\nPassive: Whenever Aatrox kills an enemy champion he heals for 2% of their max hp.\r\n\r\nE: (Need a name)\r\nAatrox slams his sword underneath an enemy unit knocking it up for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds dealing 90/105/120/135/150 (0.4 bonus AD) physical damage.\r\n\r\nR: A Darkins will.\r\n*Can only be cast when below 33% hp*\r\nAatrox gains 25/30/25% damage reduction, 25/30/35% Attack speed and 30/40/50 Attack damage.\r\n\r\nAatrox is a Off-tank top laner with great sustain and sustained damage.\r\nRecommended items: {{item:3071}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3742}} {{item:1316}} {{item:3153}} \r\nTell me what you think and/or how I can improve this","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-01-28T03:30:17.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you say he's bad but if the meta ever goes split push he will be king of top","replies":[{"poster":"Encryptar","date":"2016-01-28T04:01:15.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really he gets beaten out by many other more favourable split pushers","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-01-28T09:54:06.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're just not playing him right then.

Faster than yi with more sustain since he doesn't use mana, faster clears than ww, faster clears than fiddle, every other jungler he out sustains. I used to be able to do a full clear including dragon and rift herald, while also picking up a few kills on ganks. He's a monster before 10 mins and if you get sated before 20 you'll be unstoppable. But devourer is getting rotated out now so he's not going to be viable anywhere lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-28T03:29:09.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q slow is pathetic. Also the armour pen is weak.
