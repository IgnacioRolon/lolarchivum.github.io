After recalling for the first time the person I was laning against called me retarded. I immediately told him that it was inappropriate (in the nicest way possible &quot;don&#039;t call people that it&#039;s rude beyond compare especially if they aren&#039;t&quot;). After doing so 2 other people joined in resulting in me being called &quot;autistic&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; and a shemale (to clarify I am none). I told them that I would be reporting but they continued anyway. In the end I was told to kill myself because I was an autistic %%%got.\r\n\r\nI have been in so many games like this, another included someone telling the support on my team to die of cancer. When we found out their father did the person then said &quot;he deserved it after making you&quot;. Everyone on both teams reported yet there was no notification of anything happening to him and I kept in touch with the support who said that he had been against the person since that time who then continued about not being banned.\r\n\r\nRiot, I love this game - made so many friends and it has kept me away from stressful times but when all that seems to be happening is this (in every game) I find myself no longer telling people to play with me, my stories with friends is no longer about climbing to a higher rank or funny plays it is now &quot;another person told me to kill myself&quot;. Please, I know that people ban for no reason and you cannot check on each but I would really hope to see some improvement because all that is happening (in my eyes of course) is it is getting worse.\r\n\r\nLast week I played a game with a Riven who had apparently _purposefully_ abused people in a very large amount of games in order to get reported and they hadn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nI hope that there is something that can happen to solve this.\r\n\r\nThanks for the awesome game and fun,\r\nSli\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI didn&#039;t know where to post this so I did it here, could someone tell me where to next time (hope fully no next time).

Simple.\nIf it's from your team, mute them immediately, problem solved. Or if your delicate mental state can't take hearing the words \"kill\" and \"yourself\" in the same sentence. You can go '/mute all'. If you can't bare to do this, I don't think you should be playing League of Legends.\nAs VideoGameDunkey said, \"I can understand being banned for cheating or going afk a bunch of times, or picking orianna adc, or feeding on purpose, but talking shit to a guy who's a dumbass? What is this fucking pussy-ass baby preschool time?\"\n\"Autistic\", \"Gay\", \"%%%got\", they are all common phrases used by the internet as a form of expression. Half the time the terms are not meant literally. If you can't see that the internet is not for you. So I suggest you grow up and leave and stop whining about how riot should police our freedom of speech so you won't get offended. \nIf you would like to chat further, do not hesitate to leave a reply or add me and we can skype about this.\n-Order 66","replies":[{"poster":"SliStreamX","date":"2016-05-10T09:24:15.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No matter, the idea of the report system is a way to stop the toxic players and enjoy and clearly enjoyable game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-22T00:57:59.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quiet shemale.\n\nPs i like your name.

Look at csgo as soon as you report someone, give it up to a week and that person is getting a perm-ban or a temp-ban but meanwhile rito takes like a year for toxic players to actually get banned. Hopefully in the near future they do something to fix this problem so that less toxic players are present in the game. Maybe adding a system that if you have been a good player then you get this amount of rp (or a champion) but if you have been toxic you are not viable for this prize, you know something like that.","replies":[]}]}
