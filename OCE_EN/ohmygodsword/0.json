Right?\n\nJust suck it up and accept that fact that \"1 afk player outweigh 9 other players\" under current system. If you got an afk/dc, just pretend that the person you played with just suffered a heart attack and died in front of his pc.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-17T10:55:47.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you got an afk/dc, just pretend that the person you played with just suffered a heart attack and died in front of his pc.\n\nThis is good advice.

This is only done when there are severe issues with the servers that are affecting the majority of players. It is not a service that's applied on an individual basis.\n\nIt would be cool if it happened, but then it brings up the point: if you know that your game will be loss prevented because of an AFK player, then why would you bother playing that game at all? It would actively encourage everyone to leave a game when just one person leaves, which wouldn't result in many games actually being played. It's not fun to verse a team where all the players disconnect because of one disconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-05-14T22:47:41.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"would be good to get some sort of response to this.
