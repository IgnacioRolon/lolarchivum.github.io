There may be more but it's my partner's account and he's kind of a smurf so he doesn't have or play a variety of champions.\n\nMF is one of his favourites so like, please take this seriously...\n\nTo put this into perspective I am running a 2012 Samsung ATIV 700T which has an integrated gfx processor. My own computer is completely under-spec'd compared to the iMac however I do not experience ANY issue with any champion. My Samsung is running a fully updated version of windows 10.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stab","date":"2017-08-13T22:32:34.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same exact problem with that on mac also.

If you don’t care about recording your gameplay, disable Game DVR for performance reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, Game DVR takes system resources. On a slower computer–or if you just want maximum graphical horsepower for your games–it can noticeably slow your in-game performance and lower your FPS. If you don’t care about recording your gameplay, you’ll want to disable this feature. This Game DVR feature may or may not be enabled by default, depending on your PC’s hardware.\n\nPlease disable both Game DVR and Game Bar.\n\nTo disable Game DVR, head to Settings > Gaming > Game DVR. Ensure the “Record in the background while I’m playing a game” option here is set to “Off”.\n\nTo disable the Game Bar, head to Settings > Gaming > Game Bar. Set the “Record game clips, screenshots, and broadcast using Game bar” option here to “Off”.","replies":[]}]}
