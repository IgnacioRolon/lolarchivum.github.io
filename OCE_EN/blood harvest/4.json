They both have low damage and really bad auto attack animations Try to get as many last hits as you can, if not all of them. If you can last hit with soraka you can do it with anyone. It's a matter of learning the champions attack animation+missile speed if ranged and timing that with just before the minion is goi to die.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-22T02:06:09.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do i use any runes or masteries?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-22T02:22:04.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go with whatever way you want. either start at the easy end with max AD everything, or go from the difficult end with as many negative effects as possible.\n\neither go with highest AD, full AD runes and masteries, or lowest AD/AS/bad animation. anivia is possibly the best to learn the hard way. but its much better to start with the easy way and work your way backwards to the common champs you use. or just go with what you know and use AD flat reds on everyone until you get to a point where you know how to last hit better and better.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-22T02:29:33.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the best champ for the easy way\nwhat has the best animation+ AD or what ever is good :O","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-22T09:50:21.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get ad runes  + attack speed runes for last hitting better. \ni also cant help with last hitting with mage and supp champ with terrible auto attack anmiation.
