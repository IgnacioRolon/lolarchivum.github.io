If the target is a champion they will gain 2x the health + 15% movespeed for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nQ-Tah'Ras sneezes blowing out a gust of air in a cone shape.\r\nW-Tah'Ras stops all unit movement, stunning them if they are minions or monsters, and snaring them if they are a champion or large monster. Shielding them if they are an allied champion.\r\nE-Tah'Ras Shoots out a small missile that does reduced damage to minions.\r\nR-Tah'Ras Turns himself into a vapor form, Using himself as a shield, Tah'Ras can get off his ally by pressing R or if 20 seconds has passed.\r\nWhile Tah'Ras is on an ally they cannot be killed until they Kill Tah'Ras, CCing him and his ally will stun both, Tah'Ras can still cast spells while on his ally, However the damage is slightly reduced, The allys basic attacks now apply his passive, but only the basic attack (works with on hit)","replies":[{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-01-07T14:33:03.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive is basically a rip-off from braum but instead of a stun, its a heal + a movespeed buff.\nIs the Q a knockback? I dont know if its like a janna ult or something. Otherwise, I have to assume its only damage and not cc.\nW is basically broken, being similar to endless voids ult, but even more broken with the fact that it give allies a shield.\nE is a simple skillshot so nuff said\nR is very very broken indeed. The fact that he can still use spells under his vapour form is really something. But the fact that the \nform lasts for 20 seconds is %%%%ing ridiculous. That just %%%%ty. Even if the damage from the passive is reduced. This is disgusting,\nand breaking the boundaries of broken champs.\n*cough *cough {{champion:421}} *cough *cough {{champion:84}} and {{champion:23}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-18T14:14:05.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"We already have a void support champ.\n\n{{champion:161}} : [\"Knowledge through... disintegration.\"](http://images.wikia.com/leagueoflegends/images/3/34/VelKoz_Select.ogg)","replies":[]}]}
