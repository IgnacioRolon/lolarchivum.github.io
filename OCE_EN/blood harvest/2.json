Personally I think that might be a bit complicated to implement and use. I'd say 1 or 2 would be a good number of such items, maybe even a trinket type thing like Rengar's Bonetooth Necklace that adds bonuses based on how many times you've changed between Quinn and Valor? Then just be able to purchase other items like normal. Another possibility could be that those items would build into items already in the store, but with that it does kind of limit your build paths if there's 6 items.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-12T03:14:30.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe i meant that each of the items base gear is like a machete with little to no stats, and u ahve to upgrade it, the first upgrades are cheap and increases for each upgrade.

Like I said though that would be over complicated to implement and use for just one champion. I like the idea that Valor would start with items (or have unique items) but 6, each with multiple build paths, is too much. I think 1 or 2 would be enough and, as I said before, potentially a trinket comparable to Rengar's Bonetooth Necklace.","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-12T04:32:45.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was just an ideation or maybe Valor can buy one which greatly increases his stats or something, But i still think Quinn and Valor should have seperate inv slots, and when u go into valor form ur name changes to Valor because you are no longer Quinn.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-12T04:50:16.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> when u go into valor form ur name changes to Valor because you are no longer Quinn.\n\nThat I can definitely agree with. I mean they have Gnar as Mega Gnar when he changes form and he's the same person/champ.\n\nBack on topic, I do think it's a great idea and I will support it, it's just working out the details that's tricky. I like having items just for Valor, it's just I don't think there should be more than 2 + (maybe) a trinket, especially if they're going to have multiple build paths.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
