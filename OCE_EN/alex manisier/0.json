I&#039;m Alex Manisier, and I&#039;m the content editor at Riot Oceania. My summoner name is Riot Manisier -- I&#039;ve actually never had a proper ID across all the online games I&#039;ve played. I&#039;ve just always gone by my surname because it&#039;s unique enough that most people think I made it up.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m 19 years old and I&#039;m studying a Bachelor of Business, majoring in economics at the University of Technology, Sydney. I&#039;m juggling that with full-time work at Riot. The first video game I ever played was Super Mario 64 -- I immediately fell in love with all the characters and I&#039;ve been a Nintendo junkie ever since. My esports career started at the age of nine when I was entering competitive Pokemon tournaments and winning prizes. I retired from competitive Pokemon when I was fourteen. Turns out it&#039;s hard to make a proper career out of that game. {{item:3073}}  {{item:3073}} \r\n\r\nI got into League of Legends during the open beta (this is way back in 2009), and I&#039;ve been playing ever since. I wasn&#039;t heavily involved with the Oceanic scene when it first started up, but I did love watching tournaments from all around the world. I used to write for Team Liquid (the NA LCS team), producing a lot of articles about the Korean scene. From there, I started writing for LoLesports, and then I got a job at Riot Oceania! \r\n\r\nOutside of gaming, I play basketball, I love to cook, and I play drums for my church band.

Not to be an asshole or anything, but it's very common on OCE to see wrong dates on champion sale schedules and events (e.g Snowdown reveal). It can come across as unprofessional at times. As a content editor how does this happen so frequently?\n\n2. There's been a big push from Riot HQ to give the competitive scene more exposure and attract more players to watch matches. What are you doing right now to get OPL into the mainstream within OCE?\n\n3. Will you ever invite other non-Riot journalists or analysts to write articles? (Thooorin, Montecristo etc.)\n\n4. Why do we get champion skin sales announcements at American time, which makes them late for us? (i.e I wont be told about the new sales rotation until Tuesday in America, making it Wednesday here)\n\n5. Do you think Stealth Rock over-centralizes the Pokemon metagame?\n\nThanks for doing this on the forums BTW, we really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-07T03:17:42.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I'm sorry if you've had a negative experience with our sales and events. I localise all of those posts from NA and I do my best to make sure all the dates translate well across time zones, but from time to time, a few things slip through the cracks. This is especially true of massive pages like Snowdown that have a tonne of dates to change and crosscheck against our sales schedule. But that's not a good excuse -- I feel really bad whenever a mistake like that happens, because it means that I directly affected a lot of players' experience. That's something I never want to happen. \n\n2. What do you mean by getting the OPL into the mainstream? If you mean mainstream media, I'm of two minds about it. On one hand, esports has never needed the attention of MSM to succeed, and I certainly don't believe it needs big newspapers and TV stations to succeed in the future. On the other hand, I can certainly see how some MSM love could serve to push some sponsors into the scene. Overall, it's not something I've thought about too much -- you'd have to ask the esports guys about it. \n\n3. I would absolutely love it if we had some well-known content creators or analysts writing for us! The main problem is getting them interested in OCE in the first place :P In theory, it would be cool if some quality writers like Emily Rand got involved with OCE, but they all have their own things going on (which is fine, have you seen the awesome content created around Brazil and Japan?). I'm looking for good writers who are passionate and knowledgeable about OCE, because I don't think it's fair to OCE readers if their articles are written by someone who isn't invested in the region. I used to dip into EU LCS content a bit, but everyone could tell I wasn't really an EU fan. \n\n4. Sales announcements occur at the same time worldwide, and the sales (for the most part) run simultaneously. That means that no sale announcement is ever 'late' for OCE. To give you an example, if we post a sales announcement on Friday morning (2AM), that's 7AM in NA. The sale switches on at 7PM on the same day (12AM the next day for NA). What this means is that there's a 17 hour gap between a sale being announced and being made active, no matter where you are. \n\n5. One of my main peeves with the Smogon community is the sudden rise of discussions centred around 'overcentralisation' that popped up in Gen IV with the introduction of Stealth Rock. I've never believed that overcentralisation is innately a bad thing. I can think of a few examples where a heavily centralised metagame was truly harmful (Gen VI Rayquaza-M, Gen IV Latios, Gen V Blaziken), but for the most part, I actually enjoy metagames where there are a few premier threats. (As an aside, chess is an example of an overcentralised game that is perfectly viable and competitive). As for Stealth Rock, I hated it. I liked the idea of a catch-all hazard that made switching a less safe option, but I did not like how it drove certain Pokemon out of the metagame (Yanmega out of OU, for one). The fact that Moltres was only a containable threat in Gen IV UU because of Stealth Rock was absurd in my opinion. I think Stealth Rock is in a healthier place now that it's easier to remove (and more risky to set up), but I think it was an example of poor execution.\n\nThanks for asking some tough questions, I appreciate the feedback and I want to be as open about it as i can.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-07T04:36:55.953+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for clearing that up for me.\n\nI'll be sure to give the next Rioter who comes by the boards equally tough questions XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ungodly Fruit","date":"2016-01-06T07:06:53.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Manisier, this topic probably isnt privy to your position at riot but I wanted to get your opinion on the matter. With the addition of the OOL, going from a completely newly formed team to OPL is now going to take a minimum of a single year (moreso if your team doesnt form in time to enter the OOL and have to wait for the next opening and even longer if you don't make one of the qualifiers). Considering how low our infrastructure is it doesn't really seem viable to have a mandatory waiting period of a year before you see any sort of return (I'd say it's pretty impossible to get a sponsor in the OCS and even teams like SIN gaming who have qualified and already played a split still don't have sponsors so at that point you're just relying on the money you get from riot). I can see why an open ladder is a good idea for regions like NA and EU where it can be a real time consuming and frustrating process to get your team into ranked 5 challenger for those regions, but OCE only have 4 teams in the masters section for ranked 5s, and the lowest team is only at 130 points (this is also at the end of the season, I can tell you for the majority of season 5, the ranked 5s challenger ladder wasn't full) and I feel like switching from a system where sure, you did have to grind a bit to get into ranked5 challenger, but it didnt take you 6 months which is what the addition of the OOL essentially adding. There are also several players that are in challenger teams, but place really low in soloqueue, several people I know which are Diamond 5 that would get crushed by any given OCE professional player in individual skill, so I feel like it would be a bit disingenuous to make the statement that youre trying to give everyone a chance to become a professional OCE team, when there are already players who are within the guidelines to qualify for OCS but realistically have no chance to.\n\nSorry if seem like i'm attacking you or riot on the issue, but i've been recently thinking of making a shot at getting into the OPL and I feel like the addition of the OOL makes it too inaccessible for the amount of time that we would have to wait before anything payes off. I really do hope you can answer each of the issues as best as you can because I just don't see how this could be any sort of good for the growth of esports in OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-01-07T03:47:28.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Mr Ferlong, I think I'd be most equipped to answer this question for you.\n\nThe first thing I want to address for you is that there is no 'addition' of the OOL to the competitive mix, in fact the OOL (Oceanic Open Ladder) is the one thing that has remained very much similar to past representations of the Oceanic scene. The actual addition has been **the inclusion of the Oceanic Challenger Series** (OCS) as a fully functioning and running ladder.\n\nThe immediate perceived downside and this is something I've been addressed on multiple times since announcement, is the fact that a brand new open ladder team could take a very long time running through the OOL to accrue points, then moving into the OCS to hopefully remain consistent and perform well, finally looking towards the OPL. \nThe thing about this is we're trying to increase legitimacy the challenger scene much like that of NA/EU as you've drawn comparisons to, creating and nurturing a much more overall competitive league for the future. We are looking to promote consistency through brand name and team rosters, as currently we are playing hot potato with the professional leagues and even more so with that below.\nAbove and beyond that,** the OCS as a league is actually a competitively viable option for teams to compete in**, which is a fact indefinitely being taken for granted as past iterations of this league were simply qualifiers to the OPL.\n\nIs it impossible to get a sponsor in the OCS? Definitely not. In Fact the perfect example of this is finding an already established OPL roster and organization to pick you up, Chiefs Black was announced yesterday, Sin Academy exists, legacy Genesis picked up a roster also and I've no doubt the rest of the OPL Organization should now be looking to reach further down towards the Challenger series teams. This is not only a fantastic way to find recognition and immediate brand building, but over performing could look to have rosters be interchangeable. \nIf your goal is to be an individual brand and find your own sponsorship, if your example to draw is that even Sin doesn't have one then your goal should not be to be the same as the OPL teams. There are things you can do as an OCS or even OOL team to interest sponsors, it's about being marketable.\n\nWhat I will be able to tell you is that the OOL is a **different system** this split/year to what it has been in the past. The ranked 5's comparison that you draw whilst definitely true and unfortunate, will not be utilised in the coming Open Ladder whatsoever. We will be devising and _Soon™_ releasing all of the information pertaining to the aforementioned league.\n\nI hope I was able to at least help in answering some of your concerns,\n\nRusty. _(The caster guy)_","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grit","date":"2016-01-06T05:17:07.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo,\nLong time listener, first time caller (on the boards).\n\nWho are your players/teams/regions to watch in 2016? \nIf I wanted to relearn League (haven't played much recently) which region/casters would be best to learn the basics from?\nAside from money, what are some important things the OCE scene needs to grow?\nAny guesses on how the meta may \"play out\" this year?\n\nLove,\nTwitter stalker and full time {{champion:25}} ~~main~~ lover","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-06T05:51:10.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey hey! I see your name a lot in my notifications -- glad to get the chance to talk!\n\n1. This is a massive question and would require a full video to answer! But for OCE, my shortlist is Legacy and Hellions. Legacy made some cool changes and I'm extremely excited to see k1ng (or YB as he now calls himself) playing with a strong leader like Carbon. I'm looking out for Hellions just because I'm a KR fanboy. Bomb is the real deal. \n\nIn other regions, I do think my first love LCK will be an exciting league this year. Longzhu have an incredible roster on paper, and they might be the first superteam to truly be super (rip OMG). Out of all the regions, here's one player to watch from each: CJ Bdd, VG Easyhoon, NRG Moon, ahq Chawy, FNC Spirit. I just find mid laners and junglers more interesting to track in terms of the evolution of their careers.\n\n2. I think the NA LCS cast is absolutely superb in terms of delivering information at an easily digestible level. For individual casters, I like Rusty, Kobe, Phreak and Deficio for their deep knowledge of the mechanics of the game and individual decision making. Jatt, Monte and Froskurinn are awesome if you want to understand macro-level strategy.\n\n3. The most obvious answer to this question is more endemic sponsors, but that's a different kettle of fish in itself. Growth needs to be organic, and I'm not sure if OCE is ready for investment on the scale of the NA LCS (Rick Fox owns a team? And Froggen is on it? WHAT?). But I strongly believe that we have some great teams in our region that deserve to be noticed by sponsors!\n\n4. The meta's always evolving -- we saw Cinderhulk hamstring a large number of junglers when it came out last year. Chaser went from the best jungler in Korea to one of the worst just because he needed to adapt to the new jungle meta. In broader strokes, I think there will be an increased focus on mapwide team play this year. More intricate wave control, simultaneous attempts at objectives, early 5-man pushes -- that kind of stuff. Rift Herald is underutilised in the games I've watched so far, so I'm keen to see how it all plays out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-01-06T04:31:00.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favourite shoutcaster and why is it Rusty? \n\n_Probably his lack of bias right?_\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-06T05:04:57.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess he's okay.

I'm not a game designer so I can't really give a proper answer (and certainly don't take my word as gospel), but here are some of my thoughts.\n\n* Rengar's power spikes and troughs are too sharp. If his ultimate is off cooldown, you're basically incapable of farming a side lane in fear of getting instagibbed. But few champions team fight as poorly as Rengar, especially a Rengar without his ultimate. I'd shift the power of his ultimate to his other abilities. Invisibility (in my opinion as a Rengar main) is the core identity of his ultimate. I don't know what it would look like in practice, but I'd like to see the mobility or even target detection on another ability.\n* Rengar's lane matchups are too volatile and reliant on Level 2 cheese. There isn't a single lane in the game he truly wins (maybe squishy, immobile mages in top lane? Kappa), and much of his lane strength was hurt when Bola Strike was changed to a skillshot. Restore some of his laning power at the cost of the benefit he receives from lane gold?\n\nThere are a lot of Rioters who are much more qualified than me at answering this question, check out the [gameplay and balance boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance) :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Timstan","date":"2016-01-06T05:11:45.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's up with your unusual love for TSM?","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-06T05:19:29.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never cheered for TSM in my life.

Do you put only a little mince in at a time to avoid all the water escaping?","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-01-06T05:18:05.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The water still escapes, but instead of sitting at the bottom of the ban and gently boiling the mince, it evaporates quickly because of the increased surface area. You get less moisture and more browning when you cook in smaller batches.\n\nOf course, there's something to be said for the juiciness of a slowly-cooked sauce. Sometimes I do half-and-half -- a watery batch of mince flowing with meaty juices, and a crispier batch of mince that's well-browned.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Smite","date":"2016-01-06T05:10:19.196+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which generation of Pokemon have you enjoyed the most?
