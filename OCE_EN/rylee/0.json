Kill participation, objective damage and vision score are just a few things that can contribute.\n\nOne thing I can say about this, based on the information provided, is that it seems like poor amount of CS for a 30 minute game. The general \"rule of thumb\" with CS (excluding Support, obviously) is that you should earn 100 CS for every 10 minutes of play (which means, ideally, 300 CS at 30 minutes). At the *very* least, you should be achieving half that (in shorter games) if you're trying to get an S grade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rylee","date":"2018-11-26T07:03:08.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still waiting for urgot to become urgod again","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatEngineerGuy","date":"2017-01-23T04:56:39.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0/1/15 support with 17 wards placed in a 24 min game.
