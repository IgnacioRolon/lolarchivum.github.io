Knowing exactly what was detected tells them what wasn't, and sure it might be detected int he future, but if they're scripting to boost someones account and make bank, they don't care about that so long as they get their money.\n\nThis is why Riot doesn't give specifics about what someone has been detected for.\n\n3rd party and scripting bans have the lowest false positive rate of any other ban type, which is a tiny percentage of players that see them. In the vast majority of cases where someone swears (truthfully) that they haven't used scripts, they have shared their account with someone who has, which in accordance with the ToS is the player's responsibility (the exception ofc being if their account has been compromised).","replies":[{"poster":"Mix N Swirl","date":"2016-12-23T06:42:45.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i was banned for \"exploits\" not scripts.... if they would just fucking tell me what ive done so i can at least have some god damn closure..... and by the way.. why do you consider every fucking possibility other than the one that maybe they fucked up?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-23T07:25:13.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Exploits\" refers to anything in the game being used in a way that is not intended.

Assuming you gave the info willingly (for the purpose of a boost or to a 'friend') then this is your responsibility and you will not be getting your account(s) back. If your account was compromised then Riot could see that, or assuming they missed it they would see it once you submitted your ticket to prompt a second look.\n\nTo clarify, the copy paste answer you received from your tickets does not mean your ticket has not been read, rather it means that the agent took a second look at your account, determined that the ban was legitimate, and gave you that response in lieu of information they cannot give out. (i.e specifics on what was detected, see my response to SEKAI below).\n\nIn fact Riot did address your ticket, which I assume said something to the effect of \"The ban was false can I have it removed?\" to which their answer (addressing all points) was \"Everything we see says the ban was legitimate, we will not remove it.\" Sure it feels unfair to you, but they did address your issue, just not in the way you wanted.\n\nSince I'm not going to assume which case applies to you, I will cover all my bases. \n\nIf you did in fact use scripts or 3rd party, congratulations, you are facing the consequences of your actions.\n\nIf you did not use scripts/3rd party but shared your account with someone who did willingly (whether you knew they would or not), then sorry but these are still the consequences. Giving out your account information in and of itself is against the ToS and can technically get you banned (though it doesn't happen all that often since there are legitimate reasons to do so) and that realm of account security is 100% on you. Riot will help you out if someone gains access to your account without your consent, but the second you give out that information of your own volition, any and all consequences are yours to face.\n\nIf you did not use scripts/3rd party but shared your account with someone who did UNwillingly then you have a case to make. If you believe your account was compromised you can communicate this to Riot and they will dig a little deeper. Assuming they can find evidence of such (which isn't hard if they know exactly what they're looking for) then you may well retrieve your account.\n\nIf you did not use scripts/3rd party and have not shared your account then you must have used something that got you detected. Contrary to popular belief macros CAN get you banned, however Riot is very careful with these so as not to ban people for using things like text macros or macros for emote spams. There is a possibility of you getting unbanned if this is the case, but it is not a guarantee.\n\nThat pretty much covers all the possibilities here. \n\nIt's worth noting you shouldn't expect a Riot response here on boards, there are not nearly enough Rioters on OCE boards to answer everything, which is why us volunteers are around.","replies":[{"poster":"Mix N Swirl","date":"2016-12-23T06:35:49.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nobody had access to the account but me and i didnt have anything nor do anything with \"exploits\" end of fucking story.","replies":[{"poster":"Mix N Swirl","date":"2016-12-23T06:36:45.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"literally the only applications on my computer are league... teamspeak google and discord...... no macros no nothing no shit.... i dont know why  i'm banned this is just fucking retarded","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-23T07:30:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing what I know of past cases, the detection systems and how Riot handles these cases your claims lost a lot of water when you got a \"no\" back from support.

The fact that you have been banned for this on two separate accounts does not speak well for you either.\n\nOn your side we have your word, and on Riot's we have a history of tiny numbers of false positives in the system and a long history of people lying on boards about it to try and get their accounts unbanned, so you can perhaps at least understand how the evidence is stacked against you and worry less about criticising those who assume your guilt, and worry more about proving your innocence.\n\nHaving a civil conversation with support will get you a lot further than the behaviour you demonstrate here.

As for your suspension I have taken another look into your account just to make sure everything's correct for you, and it does seem there were exploits being used by this account with no signs of ever being compromised. However if an account is ever compromised, as the account creator you are ultimately responsible for all behavior on your account as well as maintaining its security and the security of its login information. While we can help players recover their accounts if they are compromised, we can't ignore any negative activity that occurred on their account while it was shared or compromised.\n\nWe took action to protect the fairness and integrity of the Fields of Justice.
