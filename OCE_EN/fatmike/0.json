From when I started playing League of Legends Gragas has been repeatedly nerfed, at a guess roughly 5 times, and even the kit has been changed since then because Gragas was still too strong!\n\nIt's about the kit. The kit that Gragas possesses/possessed can be extremely volatile if tampered with too much, Vlad is another example of this.. Any buff would potentially make them overpowered, but yet it feels necessary because they aren't as strong as they once were. Extremely delicate situations like this in my opinion call for either a full rework or trial and error knowing full well they may become overpowered for a period of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-10T11:12:20.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fatmike,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ebYuVUbZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-10T11:00:52.530+0000)\n>\n> He is absolutely useless now that he can't 1 shot with Q + R combo.\n\nYou've opened my eyes man, there are SO many champs who can't one shot with two abilities, therefore making them underpowered. Because you know, that's not **over**powered or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Fatmike","date":"2015-02-10T11:16:11.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"this is why ur a bronzie, u dont no %%%% and u talk like a  nerd . p.s u should probs uninstall and play d0ta coz its easyr for u haha lol","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-10T11:22:54.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fatmike,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ebYuVUbZ,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-02-10T11:16:11.079+0000)\n>\n> this is why ur a bronzie, u dont no %%%% and u talk like a  nerd . p.s u should probs uninstall and play d0ta coz its easyr for u haha lol\n\nLMAO I actually lose it so hard at comments like this.
