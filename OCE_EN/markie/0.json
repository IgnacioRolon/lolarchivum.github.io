What about when there is no gank? And your teammate is 0-10 while you&#039;re 8-0?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been waiting for something like this to be changed but seriously.\r\n\r\nAdd a tier called Hell under bronze. What the honest f**k is the point of adding Master when there&#039;s so many more people getting undeserved ranks in Bronze-Gold.\r\n\r\nIt takes one person to f**k up everyone&#039;s experience.\r\n\r\nAlso I do rage a lot. And I get chat banned but why? Because I rage a lot? You do realise if someone holds their rage in something much worse is going to happen other than the bad person actually being called bad?\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s so many factors of this game that piss me off.\r\n\r\nI lose ELO because of one person.\r\nMy enemies gain ELO because of one person.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-16T03:44:28.491+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that this is how a team game works right?
