What that would also introduce into the game besides the benefit of less queue trolls would be of course, general bullying where people literally lolking his teammates and kick until they get the perfect roll.\n\nThat wouldn't be ideal either, hence the rule of thumb in this type of game should always remain as:\n\n**\"The real fun lies in premades and ranked 5s.\"**\n\nIn solo queues, anything can happen and frankly I am afraid there isn't much that can be done about them without either being a little too extreme or introducing other problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2015-07-09T12:35:23.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me this stupid stuff happens throughout the whole of the elo scale. which means it never stops. Unfortunately, I am not in gold like u so i get paired with worse players than this. You can get the ignorant people, the selfish people, the afks, the smarta**, the \"i cant look at the minimap\" people and the \"Ahri ADC is still viable\" pple. See there are so many categories of players, its hard to avoid them. However it is what happens when you go through solo/duo queue. \n\nSee, people and there mentality in Solo/Duo queue are \"i can't think about others, only myself\". It doesn't help when this game is team based oriented as it just stuffs up the whole system. Man... I can't say anything else to you apart from this is the way League is.
