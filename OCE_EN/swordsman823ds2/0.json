Currently whenever I log in, my client chats do not work (one at the bottom just says \"logging onto chat service\" and doesn&#039;t change and the game lobby chats are not accessible as well). Its fine when i get in game though, as i can chat perfectly fine. Im also pretty sure its not a connection issue as i can start any type of game perfectly fine. Anyone know how to solve this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"RaBella","date":"2015-06-01T16:57:21.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously I'm in OCE and have no problems at home, but at my friends on my laptop it won't login to chat. Can start games fine but can't see anyone and don't show up to them as online.  Tried the weird fix of disabling login animation and music but no dice.\n\nHELP ME RITO PLS","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-18T13:32:24.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hay dar,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T06:21:03.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The chat used in game uses a different server to the chat from the client. Notice how if you have to specify if you're talking to your friend while in game, and it also doesn't work? That's because it's connecting to that other server.\n\nIt's most likely server-side, due to the fact that NA players are coming to the OCE boards about it. I'd say go and check the status over there.","replies":[]}]}
