Getting into OPL would be insanely cool and if we did that itd be sweet but honestly I dont expect it to happen so I&#039;ve set my sights on Gold 1 for the moment.\r\nor now.\r\nBeen playing for 5 years on and off  I know a lot, but there is always more to learn so will take any advice I can get. \r\nI can do any role, but specifically prefer JG and ADC as they seem to have the most control over winning games. \r\n\r\nFav champs include;   Xayah, Varus, Jinx, Xin, Nasteh Nasus, Nidalee, Illaoi, Lux, Fizz, Ziggs, Veigar, Vi, Diana, Sivir, Fiddles, Rengar and learning Rakan now.\r\nThose above champs will probably be the ones I am opting for every game, with the order being;  Xin, Xayah, Lux, Illaoi and Varus  being my first choices.\r\n\r\nIf you already have a decent club please let me know, either that or we start a new one. I&#039;m currently in prelims, lost a couple games in the solo/duo Q and decided i wont bother ranked without a club/team.\r\n\r\nIGN; Slendah  \r\n\r\n:)","replies":[]}
