Heres the kick though, I never disconnected. At the start of the game  i had to leave and went to the bathroom for approximately 2 minutes. i came back and played the rest of the game, all the way to the end. Riot is going overboard with leaver buster and ruining my experience. we cant even go to the bathroom anymore and come back shortly after, is this a joke? I've easily put over $1000 into this for skin champs and various other store items, and then I get told i have to sit around for 1 hour and 40 minutes staring at timer as i wait for it to hit 0 and finally start queing....\r\n\r\nI agree that leavers and afk people should get banned or leaver busted. But this is too damn far. 2 minutes in the bathroom is not going to ruin the game for people. ive watched people spend 2 minutes in the summoner pool looking at items to buy for christ sake!\r\nSo, thanks for ruining my league of legends experience. I dont think i want to spend another dollar on your greedy money hungry company beacuse why would i pay money to look at a timer.... You stuffed up riot.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:44:16.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two minutes is a joke. You mustn't have gotten the leaver agreement warning for that.

These penalties should only be as strict as this for ranked of which YOU should be in the game from 0:00, You chose to queue for RANKED and a lot happens in those 2 minutes mainly setting up a good communication strategy and invades.\n\nBut they're still balancing it so give it time.","replies":[]}]}
