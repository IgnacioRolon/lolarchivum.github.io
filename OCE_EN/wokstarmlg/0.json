No I am not a scammer as most of you would think. I am just a person with good gifting luck and would like to share that luck with the wider community. Some skins that I have gifted include Omega Squad Teemo, Gentleman Cho Gath, Corporate Mundo, Firefighter Tristana, Pulsefire Ezreal and DJ Sona to name a few. This is most preferably a case where you send me RP and I send you back the number of skins you would get with the amount received.\n\nI am only testing waters here. Please comment if you would want this so I can see whether or not people are interested in this.\n\nThanks a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-10T14:53:43.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesnt have a full rune page has only play around 300 games (including bots) and Still wants you to believe he's an honest bloke who's going to send you the skins when you send him the RP. What a straight up bloke. Here's a hint people. Stop people like this ripping you off. Make another account put RP on YOUR account and send skins to YOUR account.","replies":[{"poster":"WokStarMLG","date":"2015-08-10T22:56:44.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said before I am only testing waters. I didn't exactly need you to believe anything. Im not trying to crete some sort of fantastical tale. It's ok if you dont trust me because most people won't. But hey I can understand your point of view very clearly but there isn't any reason why you need to call me a scammer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Billos","date":"2015-08-11T06:41:53.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you come across as a friendly person the simple fact is that it's a million times easier, safer and more useful for people to simply do as whitehatingcoon said and buy themselves mystery skins from an alternate account.\n\nPlus, this puts you at risk too. All it would take is someone to 'buy' you some RP and then charge it back and your account would be locked until you paid the amount 'owing'.\n\nAll in all, it sounds like your heart is in the right place, but the idea is untenable.","replies":[{"poster":"WokStarMLG","date":"2015-08-11T08:48:43.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for informing me, I never actually knew that such a thing could happen. Its nice to at least see that there are some people that still believe in the goodness of others. In light of this I probably won't take such a thing on.","replies":[]}]}]}
