(My rp was over 500 but dropped to 400 rp after that)\r\nAnd that guy played one rank game and won it with Ezreal.\r\nI knew that after 4days. So I changed my password, I verified my email, and I changed my password of email account.\r\n2days ago I received from riot that my account has been permanently suspended for using 3rd programs. Which I never used it.\r\nSo I went to their site (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201898070-My-Account-is-Suspended#h1q2) to recover and to tell them that my account has been hacked last month and that guy did use the 3rd program.\r\nI talked about my payments before cause I live in New Zealand so I always paid with NZD and the guy paid 10$ with AUD.\r\nAnd talked about IP addresses.\r\nI wrote over 1000 words and submitted 2days ago and last night I got a reply which was just a macro reply.\r\nIt just says my account used the program and said it&#039;s my responsible to secure my account.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m very frustrated about this cause I didn&#039;t do anything wrong and my account is banned.\r\nWhat do you guys think about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-13T04:54:11.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess all I can say is that compromised accounts that go on to be banned for 3rd party software offences is a tricky situation (both are taken very seriously). It's made a lot harder when Riot doesn't know that an account has been compromised, as that means they're probably under the impression it was shared intentionally (they can't just take a players word for it, most of the time). I guess the best advice I can give is that it's always best to notify someone (via support) when an account get's compromised (even if you've managed to \"re-secure\" it), that way they can look back and see that the account was compromised during a certain period, which may align with the offences in question (and this doesn't just apply to LoL).","replies":[{"poster":"Storm A Knife","date":"2017-08-13T08:45:18.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't even try to know what's going on. They just ban people's accounts and say they against the rules. I asked them to investigate my account that hacker hacked mine and used 3rd program and they replied this \"We won't be able to go into the specifics of an account's exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations.\"\n\nAnd this as well \"Keep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\"\n\nThey didn't read my emails haha I told them many times that I've never shared my account.\n\nJust a stupid macro reply. \n\nIt is clearly their problem to secure their customers' accounts from hackers not our responsibility to protect our accounts from hackers. \n\nHow the hell can we protect our accounts from hackers? \nI just should've not bought skins and champions.

It will just mean they've got it on record that your account had been compromised over a given period, which can help keep track of punishable offences that weren't performed by the \"owner\" of the account (like I mentioned before). It can even help with other things that may be related to a compromised account. As for \"deleting tickets\", I don't think it's possible, I can't see any way to do it on my end (I could ask someone if you really want to know).","replies":[{"poster":"Storm A Knife","date":"2017-08-14T00:57:27.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yea!
