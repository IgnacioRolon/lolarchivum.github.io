So if thats the theme, i doubt mages will be included.\n\nI also think a Coral/Atlantis would be epic too","replies":[{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-08-01T01:27:54.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like the fire/magma one \n\nand if we are talking about syndra she has a lot of skins, and she got a recent new skin which is snow day Syndra \n\nalso it doesn't matter how many people playing her, I still play her I dotn like W but I can still manage to land 80% of mine at correct places \n\n\nthe only reason people don't play her bcoz they think she is weak, but she need skill to play bcoz her qwe is enough to kill any lane champion \nbut anyways not every 1 can play skill champs though, her snow skin is not really appealing :/ and specially loading screen she look ugly as F -.- I prefer normal face tbh :/","replies":[]}]}]}
