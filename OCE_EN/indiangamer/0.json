Is just that; name calling. Its no different to calling someone an 'ignorant fuckwit' Youre just bringing up their race, instead of their ignorance. \n\nStereotypes exist, it doesn't make them correct, but they exist none the less. The world views Americans as fat slobs who live on  country ranches with a dirty singlet and a shotgun. The world views pacific islanders as large jolly people who live in houses made of palm trees. just like they view aussies as crocodile dundee cowboys who spend their time wrestling snakes and crocs between chugging down boxes of beer.\n\nStereotypes are not racist. (they may not be the kindest thing to say to someone, but they aren't actual HATE.)\n\nForbidding someone from talking shit about someone's race is the true racism, because the act of making a law that prevents you from saying '%%%%%%'. in itself is racism because it Implies that we need to protect black people, from being called '%%%%%%s' because they aren't strong enough to protect themselves.\n\nIm definitely not racist and i try to avoid directly insulting people altogether, let alone insulting peoples race.\n\nBut next time you encounter these 'racists' have a think to yourself:\n\"Is this person a 12 year old who is mad because I killed him, and now wants to make himself feel better by hurting my feelings. OR is he an elitist who sits in his armchair complaining to his wife about how there are dirty black people in his neighbourhood?\"\n\nBecause chances are, its the first option, and not an actual racist.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-07-03T14:22:56.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit the nail on the head.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-07-03T07:06:47.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"gud quality bait with the broken english and user name imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-07-03T21:38:08.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using names like \"Indiangamer\" will attract it, same way i chose my name to attract the idiots to make it easier to ignore them.\n\nSeems like you're fishing for this one. \n\nthis is oceania, probably the most blunt server there is, which can be labeled as racist.\n\nand before you start judging people with your passive aggressive trolling, people may just be culturalist, not racist.\n\nI can say i'm not a fan of Indian males from the homeland that congregate around their own sub-culture within australia, as with middle eastern men, i'm aware of how their views as a vast majority are towards women and the kind of things they do. \n\nSo i'm partial on the side that indian males have something to prove before i respect them fully, however. I won't let my preconceptions affect how i perceive you.\n\nKeep in mind, we don't play in a game where the bigger side of the community is mature adults, we play in a community that is mostly teenagers and early/mid 20's. Alot of which, are as immature and \"smart arses\" as much as they can be thinking trash talking is a sign of cool behavior because its funny when it happens to others. \n\nI don't condone their actions, but i'm aware you're hunting these sorts of negative responses. There is a report button at the end of every game which can be used for racism. I don't know why you brought it here, other than once again.

He also called people the \"n\" word multiple times. As you can tell I had pretty much censored his statements beyond recognition.","replies":[]}]}
