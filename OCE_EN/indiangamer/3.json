Or Need Skill to play ?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"****Sorry For Bad English in Advance** {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\nHi guys I just want to discuss Few issue with this new champion, As I am only playing Taliyah{{champion:163}}.\n\n First of all to be honest I think at the current stage she is quit well as compare to other champions, she is not really strong as other mid lane champions but not really weak either..\n\nSecondly, while I started playing her I did quiet well in my first few matches but later on I die more than any 1 in team and feel bad because its really hard to understand her, and her abilities as the abilities don&#039;t really do that much damage. Later on I started learning how to play this champion all by myself and to be honest what I think is, it is easy and yes what I am going to say is actually true, it is easy to kill any other mid lane champions even including Zed, where as most of mid lane champions struggles against zed. \n\nAs far as I know {{item:3116}}  is very and I mean very important item and always should be 1st item of her no matter what.\nMay be few of you guys will think I am stupid and just making things up, as I am just level 18 and new to this game, But I can tell in 1.5weeks of time I achieve lvl7 Masteries on her &quot;Not actually as I still need 400 more essence I only have 200 for now&quot;\n\nI will mention how it is actually easy to get items/kills as Taliyah and her Strength and Weakness ( Feel Free to ignore this thread from here If you feel like, as an opinion coming from unranked player)\n\n**Strength**\n1. Her Q with {{item:3116}} If you hit one, there is 100% chances you will hit all 5 of them until enemy flash or dash this ability (Leblanc)\n\n2. Her E, does 2times damage one when you activate and then it blow up automatically &quot; I am assuming at this point people will be like its nearly impossible for an enemy to stay in E range once you activate, as they will try to go out well yes you are right my friend, but when I cast E 65-68% of chances of my enemy will take 2nd E damage. to do this you need to make sure 2 things first you must have {{item:3116}} and then You must use your W wisely, if you miss any of this its hard, as I tried and its not easy. \n\n3. Her R is I of the best thing I like, as it prevent enemy to come inside of wall or go out until they flash or dash. If I see bot is getting gank I can use my R to make sure enemy will  be on other side of wall *Example* Bot lane got gank by JG so When you R you need to make sure you don&#039;t include all 3 of then under your side, Try to get at least 2 of them .\n\n4. With just 1 Q you can clear the minion wave, very easy with cs you can easily get minimum 70cs in 10min, until you are really struggling against your opposition \n\n5. Very easy to kite and kill, unless an enemy champ flash towards you if he did flash backwards or front depend on situation. \n\n**Weakness**\n1. Her Q, Once it hit an enemy from then onwards it will deal 50% less damage on 2,3,4,5 hit as it says in her Q description which case us to do less damage, and reduce Kill potential.\n2. Her E, According to me there are 2 things is weird about her E, timing of blowing up once you cast and second is Area of E is very short, ( What I would like to see a change/buff is if we can Cast our own E on our Will, Just like Lux E as well as levelling up E will increase her range in a better way so more and more enemy can come in the Area.\n\n3. R doesn&#039;t even fkin do any damage and sometimes I think WTFish if only my R does damage I woud won that 1v1 {{summoner:14}} as well as epic long CR on R compare to {{champion:30}} R \n\nAnd Of course{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}  her Ap ratio \n\nHer Play Style {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n\n**Runes**\nBlues 9x AP\nYellows 9x Armor\nRed 9x Magic Pen\nQuintessence 3x AP\nhttp://mullinator.com/tools/runepage/1prx91qax91pQx91qPx3\n\n\n**Masteries**\n18/12/0\nhttp://www.teemo.ro/masteries-sezonul-6/#KxKxK2vKxKxyY\n\n**Build**\n\nAgainst  Ap Team\n{{item:3116}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3151}}  ( {{item:3157}} Or {{item:3165}}  Depends) \n\nAgainst AD+tank team\n{{item:3116}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} Liandry&#039;s Sorcerer&#039;s shoes and Void Staff is really Important as AD+tank team get lots of MR , Building will shred their MR as you getting  50% Magic Pen from your Masteries +Runes + Items Also getting Extra 30 Magic Pen From your shoes and Liandry&#039;s  Trust me their MR items are useless \n\nSuper late game \nSold {{item:3020}} Shoes for {{item:3285}}  As of you guys now thinking selling shoes will be Disadvantage &quot; Well actually No all You are loosing is 15 Magic Pen and -12 Movement Speed But gaining extra (100Ap and with Hat 30% on top of it)\n\nStyle of playing \n\nI will just mention about 1 simple trick As I believe every 1 should know how to use certain champion skill and game style/play style\n\nWhile casting E make sure Enemy always Hit on either last row or 2nd last row,   (Best Spot) Once its been hit 70% chances for you that your W will hit them and make sure you push enemy towers you &quot; Which means more deep into your E this will allow enemy to run backwards or move left or right because he knows about your E. In doing so make sure you activate your Q at that time when you w pull towards you Or **Once you cast E use w and q at the same time Quick hands** its not really easy for me as well but if you hit, its like hitting a jackpot. and in the meantime you E will blow off and hit enemy champ, and he loses 3/4 of his health over there already at level 3.\n\nThis trick even works level6+ One more thing When you use combo of EWQ, make sure While caste Q you go a bit backwards &quot;Depend on enemy champ if he agro If not then stay near him as while Casting your Q, you can also auto attack them, yes you can auto while casting Q if you don&#039;t realize it\n\n\nI have no problem playing Taliyah vs {{champion:157}}  or {{champion:238}} \n\nalso I believe there is only 1 champion till now I struggle with is {{champion:134}} Specially if you die early against this champion, Be very and I mean very passive and just focus on Farm, wait for JG to Gank, Do not try 1v1 and once hit level 6 Gank bot or top than fighting her at level 6 as she got better range and burst Damage. Last but not the least I Prefer to build {{item:3157}} 1st item against her to counter her R.\n \nSo I would say She needs skills to play and she is not weak\n\nThank You {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-06-18T06:49:53.182+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI'm no expert at Taliyah.

As a taliyah main I am offended\n\nhere are some of points though\n\nTop taliyah is strong, you will 90% of the time be put up against melees: PERFECT, these tanks are usually heavy CC oriented sticky tanks, and that's also perfect for you since you use your E right before their engage with their dash, this usually chips a lot of their HP Down since they will trigger Atleast 3 mines. If they trigger less, you can simply W them back in and get the max amount\n\nThe instant HP loss will make them reconsider their poor decision, and this is where you shine and Harrass Q them the entire way during their escape back into their turret.\n\nIf you get a riven or the occasional vayne top, these are highly versatile targets with an insane amount of DASH type abilities, even better for you, and if you manage to master your W timing you will 90% of the time get them off you, whilst bursting them from afar\n\nAnd also, Taliyah is NOT a traditional Mage, and that is why I don't build her like one. Death cap is a highly situational item for me, and I avoid it 90% of the time and instead put in more magic penetration and tank type items, trust me you will still do alot of damage.\n\nA standard top build (in order of purchase) is ROA, Rylai, Sorceror boots,(magic pen is your friend, your Q is already 3.2 second CD at max lvl, CDR will Barely affect it) Liandry torment, Zhonya, Void staff\n\nThis build still 1 shots carries with a full combo, whilst being tanky enough to not be 1 shot and still do 1/5 of a tank's HP bar per Q, and also being able to sustain in a prolonged fight with the ROA, I have a great winrate with this build.\n\nYour ult is a great tool, make sure to roam as much as possible after you hit 6 if you are either doing average or great, don't waste this time in lane,your mid and not will appreciate any help(unless you wall them off)\n\nand now, for my secret jg build, I call it the Blue taliyah(works great for me)\n\nbuild path - Blue smite with runeglaive or whatever it's called now, Rylai, Sorceror boots, Liandry, Zhonya, Void staff\n\nWe simply replace ROA with runeglaive in this case, since it is probably the least important item in my Taliyah builds.\n\nHave fun mastering her, since I managed to catch quite a few people off guard with her at top and dominate","replies":[{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-06-19T05:31:57.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this blasphemy you spout!

However the single q is quite strong it's pretty much free harass if you can land it and also allows for some easy cs\n\nW - Very versatile and a neat spell. if you're quick you can knock enemies away, over your R, over other walls etc. It's really good and has a lot of use. \n\nE - Possibly one of her stronger spells. You can combo it with W and you can use it to counter dashes if you're quick enough. It can also be combo'd with Q ( I usually do E > Q and try W mid cast to hit a full combo). Late Game this can do absurd amounts of damage. \n\nR - Powerful utility like you mention. While it does do damage you can use it to get into a good position to land a full combo. \n\nSome tips for laning \n\nLvl 1 use your Q to clear the 3 melee minions and then try clear the caster minions with it. YOu can push your enemy laner under turret early and get some free harass - most JGs wont gank early just be sure to keep a ward near the side of JG you expected them to start. \n\nThunderlords is a must on Taliyah I feel - Not only are a lot of the masteries in the CUnning tree strong (I'm looking at you CDR) but it allows her to burst and win trades with just q. \n\n\nTry use q on your worked ground, while keeping a few areas around to use to MS to dodge skill shots. Worked ground is so underrated I guess because people don't like the damage reduction but don't see the other benefits to it. \n\nShove your lane and try gank \"immobile\" lanes. You often will either burn summs or get a kill/assist. \n\nAs you transition to mid late game, you can effectively splitpush and enter fights using your R it covers a huge distance and can potentially split a fight up to your favour. \n\nWhen you use R it's also worth noting if you press R, youll jump off to your cursor. \n\nMy standard Build is:\n\n{{item:1056}}  and 2 pots. My first B is {{item:3802}} , after that I'll go Rylais or AS. Once one of those are completed go Morellos and then the one of the ones I didn't take. Finishing up with either deathcap/liandrys etc. I don't really use zhonya's against standard comps. \n\nSituational items I feel are: RoA (if team needs me to be more tanky). Liandry, Void Staff or Ludens. \n\nMy runes are 9x MPen, 9 SCaling HP, 9 flat CDR and  1 CDR quint (to get 10%) and 2 AP quints :) \n\nHope this helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-18T08:09:36.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taliyah really confuses me because her kit screams Jungle, but her base damage and scaling is more like a Support.\n\nWhat do?","replies":[{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-06-18T15:11:56.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok So here is my Score as Sup 2/12/5 I did bad very bad after long time I can say, I cant help it due to Top & jg feed then afk early game\n\nhere stats for Mid game against Syndra, as I believe she is hardest counter to Taliyah 15/8/15 38:20 Min game and 224 cs ( as I mention earlier it is really easy to get cs from her while Syndra was 3/167\n\nIts really hard to win against syndra, as you need to be patience else you will lose\n\nFor top game, I might play later and will update you{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-06-18T13:28:42.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can play her as a Support, But after level 7 I think she wont be helpful in team as her cc will not help in team fight as much as regular Sup for Example Squishy Support that is Morgana, Lux these champions may squishy but can control crowd or save your adc with stun, If you think about it Taliyah can use her W and enemies comes from other direction in team fights, Activating Morgana R that time is what make enemy go backwards + her q to stop an Assain champ, as well as lux can easily stun 2 people while Activate r on same time, during this time Your adc got enough time to get double kill.\n\nSo to be Honest what you can do for this moment is Try to Play top In normal, as top lane is more safe in terms of farming and ganking can only be done from 1 side, unlike Mid lane where you can get gank from 4 different place.\n\nJust an advise while playing top If you are against Renekton/Fiora Make sure you don't fight him and I mean it, as he has to much burst damage, and facing against Garen make sure you use your q when Garen use it, else you can use q but don't be agro till your Q comes back , as both of your and Garen Q give movement speed+ Garen Movement Speed is more then Taliyah\n\nuntil you got your 1st item as I mention before don't really try to fight in top lane, until you are facing any squishy champion or all damage champion and not tank enough \n\n\nHope this help, as I haven't face top champs a lot as Taliyah, but as you mention this I might try to face it against top champion to see how it works :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-17T19:54:51.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q is fine could work better with:\n\nW Seismic Shove (should be called Seismic Toss haha) does need Rylai's + Q to land effectively, maybe just make the first Q slow on un-worked ground (the 5 hit one) slow for 30-40% for like 1 second without Rylai's. That would make the combo a bit easier, sightly more reliable.\n\nE Unraveled Earth should let her move though walls:\nyou cast into a wall then as long as there is boulders on either side, she can move to the other side. Also would be very useful if she wants to get from one side of her ultimate after riding it half way down, and some one flashes over to the other side of the wall and you remain stuck, this might help. The ridiculous 90-110 mana cost on this ability does seem like a punch in the gut, it has to give something more than some tiny damage and an AP scaling slow. Think of Fizz's E Trickster: 90-130 for a lot of mana makes him invincible and able to move over walls, it also provides a slow.\n\nR Weaver's Wall needs maybe some damage with a very small AP ratio, like 100/150/200 (+30% AP)","replies":[]}]}
