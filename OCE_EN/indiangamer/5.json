Ever since that new trinity force change she's even harder to stop her snowball. The least they could do is reduce the amount of stun time considering she gets 40% more attack speed making her able to deal even more damage while you're stunned by the longest(also undodgeable) stun in the game excluding a few, and every other stun in the game is gated by requiring specific conditions that aren't as easy as \"Have less or as much % HP as your enemy\". TF is the only other one with as long and as easy a stun as Irelia's, but he can't actually chase you down after he's used his abilities either giving you a chance of survival and he has to put himself in a bad position usually to do so. I'd be happy if her stun was just 1.25 seconds or 1.5 seconds even. 2 seconds allows her to half health you in that time unless you're Malphite or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-07-11T08:19:10.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atrushan2,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=62dRENHx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-09T08:19:06.775+0000)\n>\n> They need to gut her.

If you've noticed, she's only got one gapcloser, which is refreshed only if she kills something with it. She's got no other CC, and considering 99% of her damage is from autoattacks, it'd be kinda bad for her if she couldn't even hit anyone. At least it's not an AoE stun like Jax. Speaking of which, Jax, since the beginning of time, makes Irelia's day especially hard. At every point of the game (except maybe level 2), Jax is stronger than Irelia; at least a Jax who understands the basics of dueling is (I've fought a lot of shitty Jaxes).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-09T08:34:40.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Atrushan2,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=62dRENHx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-09T08:19:06.775+0000)\n>\n> They need to gut her.
