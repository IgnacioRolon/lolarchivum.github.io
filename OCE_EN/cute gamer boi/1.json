They like to randomly remind you of posts that you made, some years back. Today I was shown an idea I had for a &quot;Puppet Master&quot; character concept I wrote 5 years ago, and I figured it was pretty interesting so I&#039;d share it here and see what everyone else thinks of it. \nP.s Considering how old this is I have absolutely no real idea how I came up with the statistics or if it would be even remotely balanced in today&#039;s version of League.\n\n\"Yarble the Puppet Master\"\n\nInnate: Old Friend: Yarble controls Strings, his trusty puppet. They share stats, but Yarble cannot attack while Strings is active. Strings is controlled by using Shift + Click and may attack while he is active, but is tethered to Yarble and may only move a set distance (1000/1250/1500 units) from him before being forcibly teleported back to him. If Yarble is killed, Strings is also killed.\n\nQ: Forceful Collision: Strings dashes a short distance in a chosen direction, inflicting 80/110/140/170/200 (+.4 AP) (+1.0 Bonus AD) damage upon those in his path and briefly knocking them aside. (6 second CD) This ability is inactive while Strings is dead.\n\nW: Symbiotic Repair: While Strings is alive, activating this ability will cause both Yarble and strings to channel for 2 seconds, healing both for 60/80/100/120/140 (+1.0 AP) per second. While Strings is dead, activating this ability will cause Yarble to channel for 5/4.5/4/3.5/3 seconds, after which he will summon Strings with full health at target location within half of Strings&#039; tether range. The cool down of this ability is doubled if Strings is revived in this way. (10/9/8/7/6 second CD) After channeling this ability Strings gains 20/30/40/50/60% attack speed for 3 seconds.\n\nE: Forceful Repulsion: Yarble immediately pushes back all enemies who are close to him and transfers all crowd control effects and debuffs (including Suppression, but excluding Knock-ups and Knock Backs) currently active on him (including their remaining active times) to Strings. (15 second CD)\n\nR: The Prestige (available from the start of the game and does not require an initial skill point): Yarble and Strings immediately switch places, with each taking on the visual appearance of the other in all enemies&#039; eyes for 2 seconds. 10/7.5/5/3.5 second CD.\n\nHe&#039;s intended to be a Top/ADC champion (range = 500 or 550)","replies":[]}
