In Jungle this becomes out of combat movespeed. As represented by the three pages. No out of combat movement speed, one tier, and tier 2 with celerity. The higher the tier, the more ganking and roam-map distance you need to cover. The closer you are in Elo distribution to your teams average, the more out of combat movespeed you will need as the game will be highly relativistically stabalised. If there are huge discrepencies and you are in a 1v9, the most effecitve thing you can do is basically camp a lane and farm at the same time, thus hedging the damage most effectively if at a double lane, but can still run an intermittant gank on the others. Page 3 will give you a free tiamats by 15 minutes and you'll use that to further compound farm difference whilst simultaneously hard camping a lane, maybe turning a 1v9 into a 3v7 chance {{summoner:4}}  {{champion:80}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-12T06:28:04.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've outpaced the growth of this game since 2014. So it can be done ~inhouseish and solo Q, but you still want outside or other influences to overtrain creativity and hardline testosterone mindsets basically (420 blaze it combined /w jim wendler 5/3/1->this is the archaic solution to your usebases 'problem'). You are seeking strategic excellence over the loosest association I've ever used of this word: contemporaries. The key is to not placate to a lower Elo. Take the kids farm. Lock in double jungle, hard engage open anyway even if its suicide but wouldn't otherwise had been if your solo q buddies weren't temporarily in your life monkeying it up. Run interpolative feedback, extrapolative, thought experiment & theory crafting apriori and a posteriori You owe these people nothing, Take your own gains for yourself and leave the rest behind. 100% aggression is the key. Better to lose a hundred games hard that you were going to lose anyway and learn more from it then lose one game soft that was lost anyway. From those 100 games you might actually turn 3 of them in the beginning, and thats 3 more % of unwinnable games now winnable that the soft loss was never possible or capable of achieving. So it's infinitely worth. Just rearrange your mental and psychological aptitude to disengage from opted in co-investment with solo q randos. Closer to NPC's then personhood. This will bring about the long term and long-position stock rise of your own Elo growth and likewise transferable strategic skill into life. Not coddling to a flaming pile of dung that is casual normy solo q \"experience\" of 99.99% of anyone in this game from a lvl 1 bot game to the next 'worlds'. This title as an 'esport' is relativisitically weighted in terms of skill particuarly strategic requirement in the bottom 3 of titles (fortnight, overwatch) in esports. 3000 LoL MMR is about 1300 SC2 for example. Placating to an average or majority as a sense of authority will only send you in one direction -> a lowering average, you with it.\n\nit wont always be your responsibility to engage but if no one else will ur just facing a -1 trade deficiet from what you would have otherwise had but it will still be a positive on no trade - just dont voluntarily ever queue with garbage","replies":[{"poster":"666mage","date":"2019-02-13T09:31:28.217+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"blacklist riot and tencent while they hold it \n\nDCLXVI","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-12T11:07:16.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.imgur.com/Pztbx8P.png[/img]\n\ngold difference between me and jungler, diamond game. klepto generates my gold minus its gold x game time = 17,196-16,338 *34:59 = 30,015.7 positive effecitve use of gold, or goldminutes, over my opposite number.\nme 17,196 gold x 34:59 =\nits 16,338 gold x 34:59 = (its)=\npercentage difference over its = 30,015.7/(its)*100=5% more effective gold then its rune setup into game conversion (nocturne precision jungle =typically highest gold generation from this position in game), so at worse ur still doing 5% more effectively then the next best option, but ive seen this blow to 50%.
