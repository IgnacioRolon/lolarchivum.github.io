They can turn a fight in your favour if you get them (and remember to use them) keeping on with the illaoi theme, if you take the Elixir of Speed Rune, you can actually chase and dive freely if you get an elixir mid fight.","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-06T04:18:00.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u have 6 items the wards drop at ur feet which is what u want, later game u might not have room to even buy a ward","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-11T01:04:40.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i ran the calculations on the drop value by frequency and got an aggregate and its 50 gold per item","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-05T20:24:10.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also why does it remove wards from loot table post 20 minutes? thats when you want them the most sigh\n\nalso bring back sword of the occult","replies":[]}]}
