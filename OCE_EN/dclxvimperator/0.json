75g of your next item, do not buy a red ward, you will get more gold worth by the time you buy the next item after the original one you were within range of\nexample, your next item is a long sword and you have 300gold, do not buy the ward, by the time you buy this sword +1 more item, you will have more gold then the ward would produce in value\n&gt;when you are within 2 wards of the next item, the choice is yours, it is a 50-50 coin flip, and equal worth\nexample, you are at 200gold, and longsword is your next item (at 350), you can either buy the ward or not, it is the same worth of value\n&gt;when you are more then 2 wards away from next item, always buy a ward, any position on map\n\nnote nothing is obviously an absolute in rts\nexample you might have some unnatural gold rates\neg funnelling strategies\npyke &amp; cull &amp; relic shield strategies, klepto etc\n&gt;eg you are laning with a pyke who has relic shield and you have cull, shield stacks cull for you as well so you are boosted at an accelerated gold rate, thus the numbers will contract, and you may not want a ward at any gold, you might also be ez with klepto and triumph, this is the fastest adc gold rate in game, and you should buy a zeal item with your excess gold, either pd to hedge or a kirschis shard, ez is not a caster, it is an adc, and all other moba understand this, and league relatively is extremely low mmr to other mobas and this is just one example. ez needs a zeal item, and the perfect setup is this for it. rapid fire cannon synergises perfectly to its entire kit. ez is an adc. adc's need autos. if u look at where ur damage comes from, its majority aa\nside note, static shiv is best for higher skill tier cap players, as you get burst, more farm-> turnover for strategy, and range on bounce, more magic damage/hybrid output, and its just a more nasty item in general. korean style teams might opt rfc over ss though, however white teams are better suited to ss. not that anyone actually white plays this game, soyboys dont count. u have trannnys and shit on ur broardcast team. ur disgusting and societally degenerate, an enemy of civilisation. you use mental illness and placate to decay anosognosiadly or not, one of ur mods is about to get blacklisted for touching this post too, enjoy ur fate\n\nfrom an elite gamer, ur product is viewed as the joke cesspool of the lowest of the low, regardless ur appeal to majority, unweighted, egalitarian and schizophrenic as such. lmfao\n\nso here, have this strategy free, on the house house. for a bot lane\n\nalso, if you are within a double back of the next item, wait. a double back is back to fountain then teleport on fountain to fountain again to hit gold threshold for item, anything much longer then that, buy a blade instead of sword or just go etc, buy a ward if u want, see above guide to such\n\n\nalso,\nwards need to be 50gp and 2 health\nor invis wards need to be reintroduced to game\nlikewise sword of the occult must come back or take mejais out\nalso mana potions must be reintroduced or take out health potions\n\nur killing ur game by having orientated the item meta to health based mages like literally insane\noh yeah your vlad rework was also garbage\nthe irony\nso bad\nyou rely on aposteriori data from a userbase you dont realise is weightedly in the bottom bottom BOTTOM percentile of skill and potential in terms of human worth and attraction of a player base. intelligent people dont play this game. its that simple. im the only one\n\nur game is not in the same classification of esports, u dont deserve the paper money you think you hold or have. you know nothing about economics or geopolitics or your right to life. you are a retard containment board. i a retard wrangler.\n\ncs is an esport\nsf is an esport\nmk is an esport\nsc is an esport\naoe is an esport\ndow is an esport\n\na THIRD iteration custom scenario STOLEN from blizzard content and ported as a stand alone product (The worst variant of them all) from a real time strategy game that came out over 13 years ago is not a real game. you are human garbage, waste, filth. you are a bloated exacerbated microcosm of cancer that is unrequired like others of such in this world in other fields. you also stole money personally from me, quite a lot, quite a heinous and serious offence. not even mentioning your illegal data mining, a threat to international security. a terrorist organisation enabling likewise such, a serious data security breach, i only here in containment of something worse being dealt with thus temporary requirement.  your product is illegal and you will suffer the fate of Justice and be removed from History as dictated by both of such\n\nbye","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-02-07T07:07:48.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This thread started off with bronze advice then developed into a whine

whenever you can spare 75g after an item powerspike and can make use of the control ward. \n\nIf you are losing lane but your jungler will be pressuring your mapside by the time you reach lane in their rotation, and you can use this to hold a freeze, you won't need a control ward, since you won't be pushing up.\n\nYou buy a control ward when you are winning lane and can afford to defend a control ward in exchange for the map vision and pressure it gives you, i.e. a midlaner getting control wards in river bush or the bush on topside of red in order to control the middle paths of the map, or as a jungler who needs information on enemy jungler rotations for an objective play or dive you might ward a bush near a camp or for a longer term investment, the bush opposite the redbuff gives alot of information and is rarely checked.\n\nAs a support in a winning botlane with jungle pressure, who wants to amp up their ward efficiency and expand their warding range to protect from long range roams from mid or tps and wants to make it easier for their jungler to threaten a gank through denial of vision. If you can defend them properly through good recall timing, the opposing river or tribush in botlane is a great investment that will surely give your opposing botlane anxiety. \n\nthere are just a few examples. It's not really about how much gold you have or gold efficiency, it's more how much opportunity and safety the control ward gives you for the low low price of 75g.\n\nAlso as a jungler, the 75g control ward can work as an excellent substitute for a red trinket if you're like me and forget to upgrade or accidentally waste the cd sweeping a lane bush, and now have to take an objective like dragon or baron.","replies":[]}]}
