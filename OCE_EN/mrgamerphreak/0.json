Which is insane because on an average you earn 100 IP per game (definitly way less) but it would take 120 more games for me to earn that IP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-11-27T14:56:00.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and this is why i dont buy skins, i keep pooling my shards and rerolling them or giving myself just enough blue dust to outright buy who i land on,  i havent bought a champ for full IP since march and that was when i as grinding my account back up pretty much and just getting 15-20champs i really like in general, now i just got mostly an aram pool of 55 champs im good with, wish i could give riot back 5 champs or so from rerolls... \n\nbut yeah even skins, ive spent about $120 on rp this year, i have 5 legendaries, an ultimate, and just about a skin for every champ but a few, i wont take a skin just to get a skin, ill just reroll it, got my battlecast cho, dunkmaster darius, dj sona, omega squad teemo, zombie brand and a couple of legacy epics that way also... riot cut itself shrt a couple of hundred on my acc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-11-26T20:16:53.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeap that's correct.
