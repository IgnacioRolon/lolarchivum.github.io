Then they just play like it never happened and continue to do it. Where is the fairness in teams losing their LP because of one troublemaker that decides he would rather what us lose then help because he can and there are no real punishments. \n\nLosses being prevented from this kind of thing and very strict ban consequences should be put through, ban them for a year, ban ranked games permanently. For a company with such a high player base and hold such high standards when it comes to ranked, you do very little to actually help the people playing to win, who want to be a team and have good games. \n\nI played with Lee sin Summer name *name removed* . He is plat and can and I quote &quot;I can easily climb, so I dont care if we lose this&quot; \nThe Fact it takes everyone in a game to report to make riot even consider banning him is dumb, people just win and leave. The Lee didn&#039;t effect them so who cares.\n\nAll this leads to me thinking, maybe loss prevented should be a thing when people intentionally make you lose games.\n\nNo hate Rito just pissed at Lee dim sim{{champion:64}}","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2017-04-28T07:49:08.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've stopped playing ranked. It is too toxic to be fun. You feel pressured to win yet so many team mates cost you the game. On top of that the match making is awful\nReally enjoying normals right now, not sure if i will go back to ranked again","replies":[{"poster":"MrGamerPhreak","date":"2017-04-28T07:51:23.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea man, fair enough if they are doing bad but still trying...
