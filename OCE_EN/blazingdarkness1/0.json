After a short delay (affected by attack speed), the projectile will seek out the closest enemy and fire as a skill shot in their direction. If it hits, it will deal physical damage and reset to its seeking phase, with double the delay. If it doesn&rsquo;t hit it will reset with no increase to the delay. It may reset up to twice, doubling the previous delay on every attempt that hits.\nThis ability has charges which refill faster whenever Urgot applies his passive to an enemy. \nUp to 1/2/3 Acid Hunter&rsquo;s may be active at any point in time (Increasing at ability level 2 and 4). The amount of max charges increases at the same rate.\n\nW &ndash; Terror Capacitor\n(Passive) Increases Urgot&rsquo;s armour and magic resist by 0.5/1/1.5/2/2.5 +0.01*AP per enemy unit affected by Augmentor. This amount is tripled for champions. A maximum of 10 non-champion units can be boosting Urgot's defences at any point in time.\n(Active) Reduces all damage by 50% for 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds. At the end of the duration, all the reduced damage is dealt instantly taking into account the resistances at the end of the duration, not at the time recieved.\n\nE &ndash; Shredder\n(Skillshot) Urgot fires a projectile in a target direction which deals a small amount of damage in a line. Upon reaching the destination, the projectile starts spraying blades in all directions, dealing physical damage per second for 3 seconds in its radius.\nShredder&rsquo;s duration is increased by 1 second for every time an Acid Hunter hits an enemy champion, up to a maximum of 3.\nDeals half damage to minions.\n\nR &ndash; Hyperkinetic Reversal\n(Initial Activate) Urgot targets a champion, stealing 25/30/35% of their total Armour and Magic Resist, decaying over 6 seconds.\n(Reactivate) Urgot can reactivate the ability while it is active to swap with the target after a short channel, the channel duration scales off of Urgots bonus armour and magic resist at the time of reactivation.\n\n\n\nFor clarification, the scalars for damage abilities would be very low to account for his free stats.\nAlso, all numbers are clearly subject to balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Divinegoose","date":"2015-12-01T02:34:06.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The three main abilities are very much fire and forget as you have them right now.  The idea seems to be just spam out all your abilities in the general direction of the enemy.  It does allow you to be more focused on positioning and auto attacking afterwards though so if you are still intending him to be an adc that would kind of make sense.  The only other big issue I see is that you have a pull that isn't a skillshot.  That seems kinda not fun to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazingDarkness1","date":"2015-12-01T02:37:28.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Divinegoose,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=AEIUQplL,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-01T02:34:06.079+0000)\n>\n> The three main abilities are very much fire and forget as you have them right now.
