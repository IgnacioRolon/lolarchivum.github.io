I wanna use this discussion as a suggestion box as to how Championship Riven should be released in 2016. \r\nIf you don&#039;t know about the release check out the link.\r\n\r\nComment in this discussion what your suggestions are.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is releasing her as part of a championship bundle. you could have championship thresh, championship shyvana, championship kalista and championship riven all in the one bundle (with of course the champion). I reckon this will make previous owners to acknowledge the fact that the skin is still hard to acquire as it would cost a lot of money and it would allow new owners to have a way to purchase the skin. Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-29T13:04:01.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, because people who have it like it been rare. This isn't rare, this just costs 3 times the money.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-29T22:29:41.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haunting Nocturne, Zombie Brand and a few others, were once limited like Riven, then riot was like \"they're back, heres loading screen shit and an icon.

Gg Bruh you paid $400 for a fancy banner. \n\nWhat I think would be a good idea is give Championship Riven owners a unique in game emote for it maybe? Not sure of the logistics but if you use the mastery emote when using Championship Riven (purchased in s2) you get a banner similar in design to the Valour particle? \n\nGives them something to show with it? No champion mastery needed but still a nice touch to those who want to say I got this skin as a limited edition?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-06-29T14:12:39.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give everyone who owned it b4 a thing on their loading slice like the other skins that re released, also give them there RP back and an icon of a snowflake","replies":[]}]}
