I sent in a ticket in and got an automatic response from riot, the hacker also responded to the ticket which means he can see all the information I used to verify it was my account. I&#039;ve been playing this game for years and have thoroughly enjoyed it, I&#039;m really concerned I won&#039;t be able to get my account back. Is there anyone who is able to help me with this?\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\n\r\npsbSMurf","replies":[{"poster":"psbCYan","date":"2016-11-04T00:47:26.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except I have done neither... soooooooo....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2016-11-03T09:59:23.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moral of the story, don't share accounts and don't visit cheat sites.","replies":[]},{"poster":"psbCYan","date":"2016-11-03T04:36:20.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much Gehirn, I have now reset my password.

Email verification has been completed and a password reset enforced. If email verification has been completed then as long as your email address is secure no one else will be able to change your password unless they also have access to your email account - so make sure your email account is secure as well.\nYou should be able to log in to OCE now with no problems, if you haven't completed the password reset then it may request that you do so.","replies":[{"poster":"psbSMurf","date":"2016-11-03T04:30:14.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the quick response, the only issue I have is that I never received the email to reset my password on my account. I have however changed my password for my email account so this should now be secure (don't think they had access to my email but this was a safety measure). I did receive an email verification from riot (though I though I already verified my email for the 4 game IP boost a long time ago).","replies":[]}]}]}
