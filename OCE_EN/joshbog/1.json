Having the different game modes meant that queue times in all game modes would be longer to the point where you would have to wait too long to get into a game.\n\nRiot in the past has experimented with fixing this though, with making it so that only during 3pm to 1am on certain days you could queue up for it. This was a good fix as during these times was when the peak amount of players on the server were playing and queue times weren't effected that much by having the amount of options that they did for game modes to choose from.\n\nHopefully they can figure out a solution similar to this or enable the game mode fully. Let me know if you need any clarification or questions and if you are curious you can find the link to the post where they talked about having the game mode up for a limited amount of time [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/HAK2vcae-twisted-treeline-team-builder-and-ranked-sr-schedule)\n\nAll up though I am very excited for the possibility of ranked 3s on OCE and I am very keen to play some 3s again with both friends and just generally these are just some things to keep in mind in case they have to implement things to make sure it works.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
