It&#039;s an online tournament where you can sign up solo/duo only and they will place you into a team. You can read more about it via the page. \r\n\r\nIt is free to enter, Im not too sure if a reward is up for grabs but I thought it would be a lot of fun for us GDers to all get together in an event and slug it out. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like the tournament should be somewhat balanced, and even if it isn&#039;t you should come and have some fun! :) see you there maybe!","replies":[]}
