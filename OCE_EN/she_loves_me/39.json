So i recently started to pick up aurelion sol, i play him in normals and because im diamond 5 and go 1/16 i get called a boosted bonobo and it is very unpleasant.. I go to flex and get called a troll? how am i meant to win. how to learn new champs if all i am is apparently is troll or a boosted bonobo?\r\n\r\nif you suggest i play with friends i have no friends. \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-12T22:59:09.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nBefore I say anything, I checked your OP.GG and I am *very* confuddled. You are either something like a Challenger smurf (who is trolling is Normals), or there is a bug in OP.GG. That's the only way I can explain why you play poorly in Normals, yet have a 100% win-rate in Ranked.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/s8NFB\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnyway, into the helpful stuff. Looking at your Kayn game, you actually played quite well. You had a good KDA, high CS, and a decent build. Sure, there was a 3/6 game, but that's bound to happen eventually. I reckon you you should not listen to those people and just play him.\n\nHowever, I would suggest (when playing a new champion) to play a few Normals (since you would be facing Silver-Plat level players), then move onto FlexQ (where you would be against mid-Plat players), before finally playing against the Diamond players in SoloQ. That way you can work up in skill instead of plonking your Silver-Plat level Kayn (based on Normals) into a Diamond game, especially since Normals aren't really \"try-hard\" so the lower level play in FlexQ will help adapt you Normals Kayn into a Ranked Kayn.\n\nAs for your ASol games, it's only natural you play poorly on a champion you've never before played, especially since he has unusual mechanics thanks to his passive. It would be like if I played Lee Sin for the first time. I've never played Lee, so naturally I would be utter garbage.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, when in doubt, just */mute all* and keep playing your best.\n\nHope this helps :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-13T01:38:37.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh boy what's this, another boards mod wannabe?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RazorScythe188","date":"2017-08-16T11:31:56.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"op.gg  is broken, it's also a 100% win rate for me.\nAnd you cannot have 200+ wins at a 100% winstreak without getting challenger, that MMR will make you jump divisions, if not ranks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-12T22:40:03.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, the toxic community in ranked is starting to really annoy the shit out of me.\n\nI started playing League in season five, but when i hit level 11 I got bored and stopped playing.\nAt the start of season six I got back into and played it a lot ever since. I got level thirty and I thought \"oh maybe I shouldn't play ranked until I'm pretty good at a few champions.\" I sort of have gotten better, but it's weird because I can't seem to get better at the game. Anyways, I go into ranked for the first time and the whole team feeds, and I get blamed because I get autofilled for jungle, and I'm not that good at jungle. I get flamed half to death and I'm just not going to play ranked until I win almost every normal game i play.\n\n:/ sorry mate, ranked is toxic and Oceania is even worse.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-13T02:11:24.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, if you want to improve i suggest you play only ranked, forget the normals, normal mechanics and ranked mechanics are 2 diff things its like apples to oranges.. arams to rifts.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-08-14T04:34:19.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill probably only play em on my smurf until im somewhat gooder","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-13T04:41:23.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with Little Witch Eve here, and just say \"don't listen to the nay-sayers\". There will probably always be someone in ranked who will look for any excuse to call someone a \"troll\" or \"boosted\". They, generally, can't accept that they themselves may be at fault in some instances and just want someone else to blame. The best advice I can give is to report (probably for \"negative attitude\") and move on.","replies":[]}]}
