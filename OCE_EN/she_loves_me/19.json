And i will only be using them for the following example, your last 2 items are situational.\n\nYou get 80AP from RoA, 60AP directly from Seraphs, 30AP from Iceborn Gauntlet, 100AP indirectly from Seraphs due to mana (3% of 3334 mana is 100). Then you get 5AP from Quint of AP, 16AP from Mental Force Mastery, 6AP from Arcane Mastery Mastery, for a total of ~297 AP.\n\nWith this you get 147 Armour from items, 207 Armour when Molten Shield is up, 90 MR when Molten Shield is up. \n\nWith CDR Boots, Scaling CDR Glyphs and 10% from Gauntlet you get 38% CDR. This means that Your Molten Shield is up every 6.2 Seconds which leaves 1.2 seconds of not having an extra 60 Armour/MR since Molten Shield lasts 5 seconds.\n\n650 HP from RoA and 175 from Seals for 825 HP for a total of 2629HP. \n\nWith 207Armour, AD damage is modified by 0.325.\nAlso with 207 Armour, this gives Annie 5258 effective HP from her 2629 HP Pool against AD damage giving her a total of 7887 TOTAL Effective HP from AD Damage.\n\nWith 90 MR, AP Damage is modified by 0.526.\nWith 90 MR, this gives Annie 2366 effective HP from her 2629 HP Pool against AP damage giving her a total of 4995 TOTAL Effective HP from AP Damage.\n\nAnnies Molten Shield also does Magic Return Damage On-AD-Hit equivalent to 60 + 20%AP or 60+59.4, (119.5 total AP return per On-AD-Hit) regardless of actual AD damage taken. This means that a champ with 30 MR attacking Annie for any amount of AD damage will take ~36 Magic Damage per Hit. So a Champ with 30MR doing 500 AD Damage before resists will do 162.5 AD damage (WITHOUT THORNMAIL ARMOUR) to Annie and receive 36 Magic Damage back, for a total of 126.5 HP Swing. IFF Thornmail is purchased for the extra 100 Armour alone, the total armour should reach 307 and give 0.245 multiplier. Meaning that 500AD damage would be mitigated to only 122.5 AD. This means the Swing of HP would be 122.5 - 36 for 86.5 Total AD Damage.\n\nIf we were to throw Thornmail into the mix, the AD Champ will receive 30% of their AD Damage BEFORE Resists are calculated, back in AP damage. This means that a Champ doing 500AD damage will take 150 Magic Damage back before 30MR reduction, which is 150-45=105 AP damage Total return off thornmail alone. Now if we subtract 86.5 (HP swing from Annies Molten Shield return with Thornmail) by 105 (Thornmail Return after MR reduction) we get a total of -18.5 Total HP Swing. Meaning for every bit of damage the AD Champ Does to Annie, they take 18.5 HP of damage more than Annie.\n\nIf you can see where this is going, essentially Annie with 5 items, including Thornmail and Molten Shield up will take ~18.5 Damage less than her attacker if dealing AD on Hit Damage. This means that a Champ doing 500AD damage with 1912 HP vs Annie Dealing 0 Damage except through return damage off of Thornmail and Molten Shield with the Same HP of 1912, the AD Champ will die to an Annie doing nothing.\n\nIll just add that with the AP in this build, Annies max R+Q+W Burst sits around 1500AP damage. With a Flat 12.9 MagPen from runes and 6% from masteries, for a total of ~13 Mag Pen. Subtract 13 from 30 we get 17 MR which is roughly an 0.85 damage modifier for AP meaning that Annies Full Burst  of roughly 1500 AP will be mitigated to roughly 1275 AP Damage. Depending on enemy comp, if they are all AD, a DFG could be bought which could multiply 1275 AP by 20% for a total of 1530AP Damage, disregarding the 15% HP damage DFG does on Hit plus the 120 AP damage it also gives.\nIf we added those two additional bits of info we would change the AP damage TOTAL to roughly 1900AP of Burst from R>Q>W, mitigated to 1615 TOTAL Burst after reduction. For an Champ with 1912 HP and 30 MR (reduced to 17MR of course), DFG active would do 286.8 HP reducing the HP of the 1912 HP champ to 1625.5. With Annies TOTAL Burst after mitigation equal to 1615 AP Damage, this would leave the champ with 1912 Base HP with just 10.5 HP left. A simple AA or Thormail/Molten Shield return damage could finish them off.\n\nWith this Build, you can still 99-0 Squishy Carries. Out of all the Main Meta Marksmen (excluding Jayce[2101]/Urgot[2100]/Teemo[1910]/Azir[1884]/Gnar[1645]/Kennen[1879]), 2025 is the highest Base HP held by KogMaw.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-30T13:25:22.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then you have Twisted Fate lol {{champion:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-30T15:33:56.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a less damage less reliable CC champ :^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-28T21:49:38.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"annie has a hard time locking down LB if played right.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-30T15:30:23.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am mainly talking Annie in botlane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2014-12-29T01:02:16.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's already been nerfed.
