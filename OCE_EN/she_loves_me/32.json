Why would someone change their name, with the other person paying for it, just cause someone else wants it? that's like having someone build a house as long as you pay for the building supplies only.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-07T05:11:56.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes which is debatable to whether or not it's allowed.\n\nFact is i would say riot would be against this sort of a thing just by principle.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-07T03:44:54.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say this is a bit of an ambiguous topic. On one hand your summoner name is, technically, not owned by Riot but on the other it's one of the key identifying aspects of your account.
