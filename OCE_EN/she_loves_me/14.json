Jealousy hits you on the daily and you accuse him of being unfaithful because you know in your right mind that he is too good for you? He puts in way more effort than any previous boyfriend and actually makes you feel special and wanted. You sit around all day and wonder why he is still there by your side not leaving you for other girls who you think are better. He tries to reassure you that he ONLY likes you and ONLY wants to be with YOU and can&#039;t think of any other girl in the same way. Do you fellow boys and girls ever feel like this? \r\n\r\nBecause I don&#039;t. I&#039;m way too good for my boyfriend and I settled for him so I would know he is always going to be faithful because he could never do better.  I also learned that he is actually a good guy and because I gave him this chance I love him equally. Sure I am banging hot and he is so banging not but it&#039;s really fine :) \r\n\r\nPlease share your relationships and how bad they are compared to mine.
