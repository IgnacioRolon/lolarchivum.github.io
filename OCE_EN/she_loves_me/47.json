Aurelion sol however... Close to no wave clear, his orbs do no damage ever, and his ult is garbage too. \r\n\r\nAs these are all valid points so far I haven&#039;t even begun what has made me make this post to begin with... \r\n\r\nHis Q, much alike to the Anivia Q. CANNOT be instantly re-cast to burst and stun enemies in the radius, A champion who can stick to you or even just run in line with you CANNOT be stunned? Aurelion sol is meant to run away or run into champions/kiting them? how can this be done if something like Ekko can just blink on his face and be IMPOSSIBLE to get off? Why nerf Aurelion Sol? he has NEVER been meta and has never fit in to the game properly... ?? make his Q instant recast a thing to get  sticky champs off his behind...","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-08-12T14:11:28.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disliked because this is very biased and untrue. Learn the champion, i've got almost 30 games with around 70% win rate. His laning phase is really strong. It's comparable to karthus hitting every q level 1. corupting with his w and autos hurt a ton you just need to learn the champion to understand how to win early.
