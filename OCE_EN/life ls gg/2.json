Would like to climb through the ranks with them hopefully reaching that gold position again and maybe even beyond that. Hit me up if your Keen IGN is BloodNgutz if you wanna look me up on op.gg or w/e. I&#039;m also fine with having any other people not just support but that&#039;s my preference.","replies":[{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-11T06:53:51.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sent request","replies":[]}]}
