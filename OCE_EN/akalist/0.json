How can I improve in my carrying? Although I have a positive winrate for ranked, most of the games that I get matched recently has been involving me trying to carry the team as other lanes have lost. Even in defeats my kda and kill participation are still positive and decent. My creep score is ok, and my vision score is improving. Most of my defeats I lose because I couldn&rsquo;t carry the team. What&rsquo;s the problem? How can I get better at carrying and supporting other fallen behind lanes? Is it because of the role I play or the champion? If yes then which champions will be the best for my current elo?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-12T01:32:56.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In Bronze, I would argue the two most important things are comfort picks and consistency.\n\nComfort picks will always be better than counter picks, because in Bronze game knowledge is relatively low, which means you have a bigger advantage playing a champion you know inside and out, than one that you've only played a couple times just because it's a counter. The player you are versing is just as likely to not know how to play against your comfort pick than a counter pick, so which one *you* play better is the way to go.\n\nYou don't have to carry to climb. I know it can really feel like you have to in Bronze, but consider this. If you are consistently playing averagely for your tier (not winning lanes/fights but not behind either) then you only have 4 players on your team who can play bad that game, where the enemy has 5. In the short term that can seem fairly meaningless, but earning that consistency means you're improving and adapting better, and *climbing* isn't about winning individual games, it's about improving overall.\n\nIMO by far the biggest thing holding most Bronze (and plenty of Silver) players back is consistency. Players will often carry one game and feed the next, so the best thing you can do to climb out of Bronze is eliminate that from your play as best you can, whether that's by learning to play from behind, or remembering to ward that spot you always get ganked from, or remembering to check your map more often is up to you and your individual strengths. \n\nGo into games with the mindset that you can't (and don't have to) win every game to climb. Even if you're losing, you can learn valuable lessons from that game so focus instead on playing the best you can for as long as you've got instead of giving up because it's a lost game (I don't mean don't surrender if the vote starts and you believe the game is over, I just mean don't waste time messing around when you could be learning from mistakes).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-02-11T21:04:42.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a higher winrate then me at the moment. Im at 54% you are at 58%. I have bronze 1 mmr and you are still on bronze 3 mmr. (Im bronze 3 btw). I don't get it. By no means am i trying to give you advice, rather just passing info on. Try staying with one role and twi champs as you will master them and climb. Thats what i got told. Also bronze is a luck based teir system. It depends on your mix of trolls vs good players and not so good players. You can get out on mechanics alone if your good enough..  but thats high elo talk. For us ita a wait and play hard all the time and u will get there.. quicker with a very small champ pool. I play ad trist and sivir. Spt leo and rammus jungle. Thats pretty much it. Im getting there slowly, but am climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-12T01:20:46.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR seen on sites like op.gg should really only be used as a guide at best. They use their own calculations (Riot's are hidden) so it's really just a best guess and they can be wildly inaccurate at times.","replies":[]}]}]}
