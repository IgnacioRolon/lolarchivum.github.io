A system that allows players to earn achievement, and even on specific champions, that they can then use to show off their prowess. It sounds great, in theory. Then someone along the line decides to monetise the crap out of it, like most everything else in LoL these days, and, as a result, the entire concept becomes disgusting...\n\nPersonally, I'd *love* to see a good achievement system in-game, and I'm sure most of the community would too, but this is just the wrong way to do it. There is no need, at all, for something like this to cost actual money, and the fact that Riot have said \"We took a look at how other games have tackled similar systems\" in the [Dev Post Exploring Eternals](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2019/08/dev-exploring-eternals/), and then decided to package them with RP purchases, just shows how out of touch they are, since putting achievement systems behind a paywall is something that any decent game isn't likely to do (in fact, many of them will provide small amounts of \"premium currency\" to the player for acquiring certain achievements).\n\nAs a personal recommendation, I'd suggest that no one bother to use the system at all. We need to show Riot that we don't like it, and that's not going to work if people are still buying into it (even if you're getting the RP for free from things like competitions or giveaways). Please, don't condone this from Riot...","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2019-08-14T03:50:50.943+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with this","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn","date":"2019-08-14T21:15:17.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly if i had the communication skills of heartvine i would have made this post looks more legit instead of a shitty complaint i just want the rest of the community to know this is a massive step backward for league and riot especially because its such a MASSIVE add on to mastery","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ornn","date":"2019-08-14T21:13:49.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yay people agree with me thank you as soon as i get unbanned on NA boards ill post this there try to get a bigger crowd to notice","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-14T01:42:40.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're ugly, cheap, low effort looking things.
