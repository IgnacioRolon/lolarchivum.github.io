If we consider it to be true that people have dropped 1 or 2 tiers down from their previous rank based on good placement, it&#039;s also reasonable to assume that people who did worse in placement matches dropped further. If its the case (I&#039;m not sure whether it is) that riot has &quot;squashed&quot; the higher end of the rank system down, that means there will be a large number of people in lower tiers who are perceived by people who were previously in that tier to be much better players. For example, a gold II in s5 drops to bronze I and then plays with other bronze players where it isn&#039;t uncommon to have matches consisting on B1,B2,B3 and even B4 and B5. To those people in bronze, these s5 high gold players would feel like a nightmare in terms of difficultly and skill level. This makes the overall learning curve to ranked much more difficult and could deter new players. To those who have been playing ranked in bronze/silver do you feel as though the competition has become much more difficult?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-23T14:53:06.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">For example, a gold II in s5 drops to bronze I and then plays with other bronze players where it isn't uncommon to have matches consisting on B1,B2,B3 and even B4 and B5.\n\n1. If a gold 2 player manages to drop down to bronze 1, i'd be questioning if they were actually a proper gold.\n2. Honestly, it may be that games get mismatched in low elo because of this, but realistically speaking, everyone got reset the same amount downwards, meaning that you should still get the same level players that have fell down just as far.","replies":[]}]}
