I&#039;ll go through each one.  I played jungle for all of them.  \n\n1st game:  fair match, we won\n\n2nd game:  ALL three lanes die once while I do my first clear.  Then die again as soon as they go back to lane.  Mid, sup, and adc rage quit.  It was 2v5 from 5 minutes onward.  Lost, and still managed to go 1-0-1 and outfarm/outlevel enemy jungler.\n\n3rd game: Our support taric is afk 1/4 of the time and when he is not afk is doing absolutely nothing productive.  Even with  three perfect 5 man sejuani ults my team can&#039;t do anything and we lose.\n\n4th game:  Enemy sona goes afk at lvl 12.  We win.\n\n5th game:  fair match, we win.\n\n6th game:  Fair match, we lose.\n\n7th game:  Our zed says nothing during champion select.  First pick is annie and calls mid.  Zed goes mid and flames annie for taking his \"spot\".  He goes top and purposely feeds the enemy riven.  Trolls the entire game.  After almost 40min we lose.  \n\nSo that&#039;s 7 games riot.  How many where actually fair????????  THREE.  ONLY 3 games out of 7 were fair.  That&#039;s less than 50%.  How do you expect people to climb when this happens.  You have to implement a better system that takes AFKs and feeders/highly reported players into account.  It&#039;s simply ridiculous.  I don&#039;t want to hear about statistically speaking the other team has the same chances of getting someone like that.  It should not be happening that often.  IN MORE THAN HALF THE GAMES YOU WILL GET SCREWED OVER, BUT IT&#039;S OK BECAUSE WHEN EVERYONE GETS SCREWED OVER NO ONE GETS SCREWED OVER.  Is that your company motto?  It should be if it isn&#039;t.  Seriously work out a solution already, do you not see how ridiculous it is that in more than half of the games that are played it&#039;s either a free win or a guaranteed lost because of an afk or another unhappy player that just wants to troll.  Put a little less effort on coming up with a new champion every 2 months and put some effort into fixing this glaring issue.  There are no excuses for this.  You are a large corporation with paying customers.  If you do not cater to their needs they WILL leave.  People have been complaining about this sort of stuff since I very first started league over a year ago.  The fact that nothing has changed shows that you have terrible customer service.  Do your job.\n\nMy recommendations:  \n\nMake all ranked games team builder style.  Most flamers/trolls start becoming toxic if they don't get the spot they want.  \n\nAllow the team to quit the game during champion select AND report people.  Have it so you need 3/5 people on your team to vote dodge game (with no penalties on those who vote to dodge) and/or ban player from playing for the next 1hour  (increasing in increments each time he/she gets reported within a certain time frame).  I hate dodging and wasting my time as well as LP only because two people start arguing during champion select or someone is hell bent on just trolling right from the start. \n \nHave a system that also keeps track of a player's \"gameplay reliance/respect\".  People with similar numbers get matched together.  The extra wait will definitely be worth it.  That way competitive respectful players get matched together while other toxic players can still play, but get stuck with other disrespectful players.

And then there are the people who are BAD but positive(like me). I do agree with your suggestions but putting disrespectful players together isn't really a good idea...personally, I think its better to balance out those players and put 1 \"bad guy\" in every team of 4 \"good guys\"","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-27T08:44:46.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i wouldn't assume anyone in Bronze, Silver or Gold is good, that's low elo for a reason lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-27T00:05:24.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We had perfectly fine start to game (lb got triple kill at 4 min, their invade went bad) so we are all good laning and all. annie decides to try kill me doing blue low hp yeah fine and all. I would of got the kill fine but sona flashed and q, she got the kill. Then she goes back to lane tells jinx she is going to b because she is oom. So jinx tries to 2v1 (annie tp tp to lane). Sona decides she better help because she has enough mana for a spell. So of course she uses the spell and surprise surprise her q does about 200 damage and gets a kill. I ping out the enemy jg coming bot they are both low hp to the 3/4 hp supp. Sona also pings to be careful and back off. Jinx still chases annie, even though their jg is coming she is low health and sona has no way to help. Jinx dies then starts flaming so much because sona took her \"2 kills\" (annie in the jg, their adc) then also flames about letting her die. SO for the rest of the game she feeds and feeds. I would **LEGIT RATHER** a 4v5 over a feeding person. People who feed make it even worse than just leaving because then the enemies have more gold and xp because of the kills. And seeing as their jg got majority of the kills on her and was stacking devourer and had about 2.00 attackspeed it really hurts. 34x2+(25+29)x2.00= 244 damage per sec from stacks alone. On top of that he had bork and trinity, his base AD (no bonus) was about 90 so that resulted in 270 damage from aa and sheen effect, + 8% of our current hp, on average we have about 2000 hp and with his q bonus damage on top it was approx. 850+ per sec just from using only q and aa in 1 sec. Just because jinx couldn't deal with her own mistake.\n\nalso.\n\nI asked when they would implement in team builder, they said they are working on it, when they get a \"fill\" role selection they will put it in.

A lot of the time it does just feel like League of Afks/trolls/flamers, I've been in Silver for a few months now but I just don't want to play ranked just because I nearly always have an awful time in it. A lot of people I think are in a similar situation in that they've been stuck at their current elo for a long time and so don't try as hard in ranked as they should. The lower the elo you get the worse it gets because people know they can't drop much lower so they just give up over nothing. Unfortunately Riot can't have employees coaching the players in-game and telling them to calm down and not troll, if players are going to do it, they're going to do it, they know punishment won't be instantaneous so they can keep trolling for a few hours or longer before they get banned or punished. \nOne of the other things you mentioned about being able to dodge in champion select if there' s a majority vote because you have a troll, it is a good idea but like so many other good ideas to do with trying to solve the damage that trolls cause for their unfortunate teammates it can be abused easily. For instance if the enemy line-up is looking like it's just packed with faceroll champs or a teamfight combo that is just going to decimate you all then everyone could easily just vote that someone is trolling if he willing to take the bullet. Obviously that is going to be very rare in solo queue but it would happen. On top of that if there's disputes in champ select over anything, such as the highly-debated and century-spanning \"Call or Pick Order\" argument or anything that causes conflict then there is the high potential of three people just all agreeing to veto the lobby and get their victim banned even if it was just because he took mid when he's first pick or picked Urgot. You get what I mean, the system just wouldn't work. In a perfect world you could vote for a sort of pause on the lobby and have a Riot Employee personally join the lobby as a neutral party to review the chat logs, and if there is someone who is just saying they're going to troll and feed then they could cancel the lobby and ban the player right then. \nBut we all know that's never going to happen.\nThe Team Builder style ranked system wouldn't work either. It sort of goes against the grain of the game a bit. Obviously everyone has their preferred roles but League is a \"team game\", apparently, so they want you to coordinate with your team and make sacrifices. But with what you said about people not as likely to troll or be toxic if they get the role they want, that's sort of a contributing factor to the problem,  if someone is forced into a role they don't want to play then they're often quick to complain and moan as they're always the first to second guess a decision that a teammate had a second to decide upon. \nIt's always a good idea to go into ranked with a decent grasp on every role so regardless of what position you're forced into if you're last pick (support) or low in pick order then you still stand a decent chance of winning. Unfortunately most people go in to ranked with the stubborn mindset of \"I'm playing Yi Jungle\" or something like that, and trying to change their mind or reason with them is futile . The percentage rate wouldn't work either, as everyone is just gonna queue up and pick mid.\nObviously I can't solve this problem for you, I'm just trying to sort of explain why some people \"play\" the way they do in ranked and try and help you understand why implementing a system to deal with this massive problem with the Oce community is so difficult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-26T20:07:42.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are already looking into that.\nBut there are a few problems.\n\nSuch as In lower ELO's No one wants to support (Almost)\nand you get the same problem in our current team builder.\n\nWaiting 5-15 mins for that 1 guy you need.\nAnd even if you do fill out all 5 roles, people are still gonna rage and flame.\nAnd troll on purpose.\n\nThe best thing Riot can do at this moment is work on tougher bans and stuff.","replies":[]}]}
