I just looked it up on my atlas and geographically, it should be connecting to OCE servers in preference of NA, meaning you should have never gotten this problem in the first place.\n\nI do know that you can't redeem RP if it was made for another region. You should have redeemed it before the transfer. Exactly how much RP did you purchase?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-02-06T22:31:11.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Jasper705,\n\nI am sorry to hear you are having issues with your RP.
