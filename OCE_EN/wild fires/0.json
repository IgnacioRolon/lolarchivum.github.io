I played ONE match and was immediately demoted to Bronze 1 upon my first loss! Is this intended? The VERY first game you play will decide your rank between Bronze and Silver etc?? Seems a little ridiculous and not in line with how ranked demotion has been in the past. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re going to play ranked in this off season, be very careful. As it is entirely likely that you will lose LP AND be demoted an entire division upon your first loss.","replies":[{"poster":"ShYm√¢s","date":"2018-12-06T04:19:04.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, same problem.. I lost ma first game and got demoted to Bronze 1 (80Lp)  from Silver 4... Now i have a 4 wins streak and nothing changed?\n\n{{item:3520}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Fires","date":"2018-12-06T10:14:15.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice is to not play ranked right now at all until this is fixed (seems Riot is aware of the problem). As well as the immediate demotion problem, LP gains are completely messed up right now. Eg. 1 win = 12 LP gained. 1 loss = 23 LP lost.","replies":[]}]}]}
