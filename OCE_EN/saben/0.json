I am starting to get pretty annoyed at this interaction as the indicator still shows and it has the potential to ruin fights. I  just wanted to point this out and see if anyone agrees with me on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Fl√∫ffy","date":"2018-06-15T08:42:26.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand the confusion here that is what should happen why would he get a reset if he dosn't kill anyone and only proc a passive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-15T08:58:17.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the requirement of the reset is that an enemy champion *dies* within the marker, whereas resurrect effects will prevent champions from dying, thus negating the possibility of the reset for Pyke. That said, there is no reason that the \"insta-kill\" indicator for Pyke's ult should appear on any champion with an active resurrect effect, even though they might be below the threshold.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T10:24:50.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the indicator still shows because it still functions as an execute when they are in that threshold. I don't believe the \"ignores resistances\" part of his ult applies if they aren't in that threshold (but I could well be wrong about that).\n\nGiven that there is also an on healthbar indicator that shows active resurrection effects, if there is still the extra execute effect on Pyke's ult, I feel that is why it was left as is.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-15T10:49:11.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been thinking about it a bit since I posted, had the idea of making some kind of simple change so that it's still obvious the target is below the threshold but has an active resurrect effect, such as making it turn yellow instead of red in that situation. Would address the base issue of \"the indicator told me I could kill them but I didn't\" kind of thing.\n\nOn the note of the resurrect effect indicator itself, I've, personally, never been able to reliably see the indicator in-game, even when it's on me and there's nothing happening. It's just too bland and doesn't stand out that well, especially in intense fights, which is (arguably) one of the main situations that Pyke would be using his ult (in order to get the consecutive ult resets).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T11:05:06.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True enough. I think it'd be a good middle ground, and could easily be used as a new standard as well for anyone else who has an execute indicator.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
