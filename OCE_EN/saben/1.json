I have added in a character/skin of my own that fits in with the Dark Star theme. Please tell me about anything wrong with this story (I think the last part needs some touchups and maybe I should include oranges into the story).

He had a few seconds rest, before he was forced into a kneeling position. Seeing the dark figure silhouetted against the shining backdrop of his home made him cry out desperately. \n\n&ldquo;Please, kill me, but let my people live! I&rsquo;m begging you!&rdquo;\n\nHis breath caught in his throat as the ominous figure rose from his dark throne and turned. He could see the man&rsquo;s boots as the pirate strode towards him, heralded by the frozen footfalls he left in his wake. \n\n&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; Rakter whimpered to the approaching menace. For a second the echoes in the room were silenced as the captain halted his thudding strides, before a cold hand shoved Rakter up by his throat. As he struggled to breath, Rakter found himself staring directly into the gleaming eye of his oppressor. As the pirate&rdquo;s cruel features became clearer, Rakter's terror increased. The pirate's artificial arm became apparent as a dull red glow began to form around the edges of an attached blade. \n\n&ldquo;I despise coward scum like you,&rdquo; hissed the captain, &ldquo;and that is why you can burn with your planet.&rdquo;\n\nThe blade slid into his stomach and Rakter wailed as his insides seared. As his vision began to fade, he witnessed a rain of red fire obliterating his planet and he was left with nothing to live for as he died.\n\n_&ldquo;Master, why have you summoned me?&rdquo; \n&ldquo;I have found another entity that may prove valuable in saturating my desire, you must go and collect him.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Will I finally have the sweet release of obliteration?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I acknowledge your suffering Thresh, but I still require more samples.&rdquo;_\n\nAs Gangplank navigated through the scorched remains of Vuluir he eyed the empty space in front of him, still savouring the screams of his last victim. His bionic eye buzzed in his skull as it displayed information that his ship&rsquo;s sensors brought up. Then a lone cargo ship appeared in the list of possible targets. His crew would easily crush an unarmed carrier. He roared his orders into the speaker system and he steered the Dreadnova onto a direct route to its next victim.\n\nAfter less than half an hour of flying, the Dreadnova was within firing range of the defenseless carrier. Gangplank noticed the courier insignia through the porthole of the bridge and hissed in disgust, there was no loot aboard this vessel, just a load of pompous politicians. They thought that their status would protect them from his rage. They would have to endure his full fury to compensate for their lack of bounty.\n\n&ldquo;ATTACK!&rdquo; he screamed into the system. \n\nHis crew leapt off the deck of the Dreadnova and hurtled into space, before igniting their jetpacks and blasting towards the vessel. As they boarded the ship, they drew their dull blades and ran into the depths of the carrier looking for targets. Gangplank stood at the bridge, observing the courier ship and waiting for the rage soothing screams of his victims. They didn&rsquo;t come. Instead he heard an ominous  flickering as the edges of the vessel faded. Suddenly the apparition dissolved and revealed a dark vortex of destruction. The cries of his crew as they were sucked into the black hole did nothing to calm Gangplank&rsquo;s fury and instead made him more enraged. Suddenly a golden chain of light tore through the dark orb and slammed into the Dreadnova, hooking into it. Gangplank was knocked to the ground as the hook jerked his ship into the void of the dark star. As his ship was sucked into the swirling black tendrils, he looked back to take a final glimpse at the galaxy he lived in; and he didn&rsquo;t give a shit that he wasn&rsquo;t going to see it again. Then he passed into the black hole and he saw no more.\n\nGangplank awoke to the eerie screeching in the pulsing world around him. Streaks of purple twisted throughout the throbbing sphere around him, all eventually ending up at a giant orb. Gangplank tried to move closer, but found his feet held by two purple talons. He desperately tried to shake them off but they just dug in deeper, eliciting a small cry from him. Before he could attempt any further action, a sinister voice dug into his mind.\n\n_&ldquo;Gangplank, captain of the Dreadnova, I am eager to discover more about you&rdquo;_\n\n&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Gangplank shouted at the invasive voice. Just as the words left his mouth the orb before him slid open revealing a swirling galaxy focused around a black point in the middle. Gangplank gasped as he realised a massive eye.\n\n_&ldquo;I am Vel&rsquo;Koz, The Eye Of The Dark Star, and I require your assistance.&rdquo;_\n\n&ldquo;Why does a big space monster need a mercenary?&rdquo; replied Gangplank, desperately trying to retain his composure.\n\n_&ldquo;I need you to aid my servant in the destruction of the universe, so that I may gain their knowledge and rebuild the universe using it.&rdquo;_\n\nAs the edges of Gangplank&rsquo;s prison shifted, a giant being walked through the barriers. He too, like the eye, was encompassed by dark energy, that formed twisted reflections of galaxies around his limbs. In his right hand he wielded the same hook that had pulled Gangplank into the black hole. Caught off guard by the cosmic demon, he failed to notice the purple tendrils peeling themselves from the walls of the black sphere. Suddenly Gangplank was forced into the air, and brought in front of Vel&rsquo;Koz&rsquo;s eye. It started flickering dangerously and he realised that he was about to die. As he levitated in front of the eye, a small laser radiating with dark cosmic energy erupted from the eye and burned his forehead. He cried out in pain for a second before the agonizing burning ceased. He collapsed into the floor and rubbed his forehead. He could feel a burning mark engraved into his skin in the shape of a contorted U.\n\n_&ldquo;Now go and feed my need for knowledge&rdquo;_ Vel'Koz spoke through the mark.\n\nGangplank eyed the planet Yokil, and smiled menacingly. The destruction of a planet was a beautiful thing to watch. As the rockets slammed into the planets surface he could almost hear the screaming through the cloak of flame. He could feel Thresh through his mark, sucking the remains of the planet into the black hole for Vel&rsquo;Koz to devour. A lone ship flew out from the destruction and Gangplank grinned, knowing what was to come.\nGangplank watched as the tractor beam pulled in the refugees ship. He boarded the vessel with two thugs at his side, his boots thudding on the wooden planks. He gazed at the terrified expressions of the few survivors and watched them beg for mercy. How he loved the smell of fear. \n\n&ldquo;Enjoy hell&rdquo; he stated, before walking back to his ship. He could hear the hook slamming into the doomed vessel, and absorbed the distressed cries from its passengers. This was where he belonged, at the helm of the Dreadstar.","replies":[{"poster":"The Ravenhawke","date":"2017-03-18T08:00:33.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea, I quite like what you've done with the piece. Good descriptions and story-telling elements, I could visualise what was occurring very well. The only thing that holds it back are the grammar mistakes. Full stops after every sentence of dialogue is very important, and there is no reason as to why you should not have them. I also noticed that within the first paragraph, the quotation mark in \"The pirate's artificial arm\" was missing.\n\nAlso, while for the majority of the story you fixed up this mistake, at the starting introduction it is important to know that whenever a character is initiating dialogue, that sentence of dialogue must start on a new line. The two times I did notice this was not the case was at the end of the introduction paragraph, where Lakter (Or Rakter as you changed it to in other paragraphs, might want to fix that as well.) is begging Gangplank to let his people live, and where Gangplank is commanding the crew of the Dreadnova to attack.\n\nOther than that, I would give it a read-through, analysing it carefully and fixing all of the mistakes you can find. A good starting point is where Gangplank kills Rakter. After \"scum like you\", the comma should be placed within the quotation marks, and after \"captain\", there should be a comma there instead of a full stop, because technically in that sort of situation the sentence hasn't ended.\n\nConcluding, The story is good, it is written well and describes the atmosphere of the world clearly. The only drawback is a few mistakes to grammar and punctuation, but these can be easily fixed and touched upon. A strong piece, nonetheless, one I quite enjoyed reading. Good luck in the contest!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-18T00:52:37.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um Guys name changes from Lakter to Rakter at the start?\n\n>Rakter became more horrified.\n\nI don;t like the way this sounds in general, I suggest \"Rakter's horror increase\" or something along those lines.\n\n> the edges of the attached blade\n\n--> \"the edges of **an** attached blade\" would be better\n\n>as the edges the vessel\n\n--> \"as the edges **of** the vessel\"\n\nI like the last line. The change from dread nova from dread start is cool, even through a nova is a star, the title change is a great reflection of the change in \"administration\" of gangplank, his current goals and management.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sake kid","date":"2017-03-16T23:02:21.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad of a story.\nKeep trying!","replies":[]}]}
