(unless you main zed, those are never good people)\r\n\r\nTOP: OPEN\r\nJG: OPEN\r\nMID: lswagmasterl\r\nADC: swaggy mcfly\r\nSUPP: OPEN\r\n\r\nRoles can change but I like to play LB and shizz, so yeah. I can JG if we have a keen as pie mid laner. \r\nSupport must be kinda good (for a bronzie anyway) so that swaggy's rage is kept to a minimum.\r\nWhen we get to worlds (probs next season) I get to be the captain.\r\n\r\nIf we are good we can probably convince my Korean friend to join, he's a bit like faker but better.\r\n\r\nLeave a comment or add me or however this works.\r\nMuch love brothers.\r\nSWAGMASTER","replies":[{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2014-12-14T01:43:04.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, can I join if I use my bronze accounterino ","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-13T12:47:15.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support mid jungle, i can do em all. added you both.","replies":[]}]}
