This can raise problems when put into a role you are not confident with.\r\n\r\nTo help with this problem i suggest having the client tell you that &quot;You have been auto filled as _ this game, do you accept?&quot; and if the player accepts, everyone is happy, If he does not accept it puts him back in queue and black lists him from being put as that roles for X mins.\r\n\r\nAs a thank you for people being auto filled in a role, and to encourage people to play outside their usual role, there could be a small reward for players who agree to the auto fill constantly.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-12T22:13:10.453+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tend to agree with CHEESYLEEKS on this one, sure autofill is annoying cos you cant play the role you want some of the time, but its really not that hard to learn a couple of champs for every role. \n\nIf you can decline auto-fill, so many people will just decline and not care about any small rewards, (making sure they can be a 1 trick riven is more important to them)\n\njust come to terms with auto-fill. \nA year ago we still had randomised positions when you joined a ranked game and it was first pick first served.  So you needed to know all the positions anyway. The current system is way better than that, so in theory there should be less complaints, not more. \n\nWe are a small server, if we want to play the game we do just need to compromise, its not fair, but its better than being stuck with constant 300 ping in the NA server. \n\nIts a good idea, and I'm all for rewards, but auto-fill is necessary for the health of the queue, and having an option to decline it, (in my view) is the same as not even having it.","replies":[{"poster":"cesuuna","date":"2016-12-13T00:09:05.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> A year ago we still had randomised positions when you joined a ranked game and it was first pick first served.

You still need to have mechanics and a positive attitude though. \nP.S - What do you mean exactly by \n> \"better \"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-13T07:28:42.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prediction, is what I'm talking about. \n\nIf I'm Aurelion Sol, and I'm vs a Kalista. Because I play Kalista, I know what she must be thinking, and because I know what she is thinking, i can predict her movements and manipulate the situation to my advantage. \nThe reverse is also true. if I'm Kalista, I know what the Sol is thinking and how he might react to my movements.\n\nThat can only be a positive thing. I cant think of any way that knowing the enemy movements would disadvantage you. Therefore it can only make your playing \"better\".\n\nA one trick Riven or Vayne etc, might know that champion inside out, but if they cant predict what the opponent is going to do (or can do), then they may find themselves suddenly unable to escape from a trap that they couldn't see coming. \n\nThe same is true of roles, the dynamic of bot lane is incredibly different to the dynamic of mid lane. A mid laner that has no experience of the bot lane dynamic, might roam bot expecting it to pan out like ganks in the mid lane, but suddenly find themselves in hot water because they didn't fully understand the situation. \n\n_____________________\n\nBut really it all boils down to:\nThere are no disadvantages about being able to play all roles. But there are disadvantages in only playing one role.\n\nTherefore, being able to play multiple roles, can only be \"better\" than not being able to play multiple roles.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-12T15:19:54.115+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just learn to play at least 3-4 champs in every role its really not that hard","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-12T23:10:56.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.","replies":[]}]}]}
