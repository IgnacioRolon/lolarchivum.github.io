This maybe is different for other people (wouldn&#039;t know, never experienced this other than now) but when we jump into queue and start the 20 mins I can&#039;t interact with anything in the client other than the &quot;leave queue&quot; button.\r\n\r\nIs this intended? Because I would much rather be able to wait the 20 mins out looking at my runes/masteries, in the store, or just whatever, rather than sitting on an unusable client while I wait.","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-07T18:51:43.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 20 minute low priority queue is punishment for leaving a game in progress/going AFK excessively/dodging too often. The 'can't do shit while I wait' is a big part of that punishment. \n\nIt's not like you have a 20min CD where you can chat to mates, fiddle about with Custom item sets, buy stuff etc... No, that player is being punished for wasting other peoples time and they can just sit on their thumbs and wait it out.\n\nIf it was easy, it wouldn't be a punishment would it...","replies":[{"poster":"Best Teemo","date":"2016-09-12T03:23:26.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe what he is saying is that his friend has the 20 min queue punishment and even he can't move around the interface of league..... \n\nI think its a pretty big issue considering you may want to still change runes / mysteries before you get into champ select and also use the chat and store features :/","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-15T20:21:03.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shit happens. Your mate was a dick and you paid for it too.
