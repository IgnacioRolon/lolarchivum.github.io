I fell in love with morgs kit and play style from the first moment i played her 2 years ago. i have prided myself on getting all her skins but alas everytime i select morgana my pride dims a little for there is one skin i do not have. The 7/8 skins haunts me everytime i visit the skins tab for my collection is incomplete.\r\nMy question for you riot is will i ever have the chance to obtain victoriuous morgana, i was not playing the game during season four and i understand that it was a ranked reward for that season but is there a way you could give new players a chance to obtain it? \r\ni am not the only player hoping to obtain a victorious skin from the earlier seasons, please riot help us out!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-26T13:55:48.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least you didn't main Morg in S4 but miss out cause you weren't good enough then :P\n\nThere's a balance. Obviously Riot want awesome skins to be available to as many people as possible, but they can't undermine the meaning of the skin either. They've made some half exceptions, Championship Riven and PAX Sivir for example that have alternate versions. \n\nFor those skins though, it makes sense to re-release them. They were special because they were rare, not because they were especially earned, so they were good candidates. Those who bought/acquired them back in the day still get the bonus style for having a rare skin, but they are available to others in the spirit of the skin lines. Championship especially evolved into the purchasable season skins, essentially a sister line to the earned Victorious, so it didn't makes sense to have one be unavailable when all the others were just because.\n\nThe Victorious skins are a different beast all together. If they ever become available in some form, I think some variation of BarryButcher's suggestion would be appropriate. Perhaps you receive the Victorious skin for that year, but can purchase a single chroma version of an older Victorious skin each year (maybe for a decent chunk of BE or something) you are eligible (Gold+). Still limits their availability and the value of the original skins, but allows those who have achieved Gold in later season to showcase that with their favourite champs that they might have missed out on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-04-26T07:28:54.970+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always thought you should be able to choose what Victorious skin you get if you end the season Gold or higher.\n\nBut they definitely should not make these skins available for anyone who asks.","replies":[{"poster":"He Is Scripting","date":"2018-05-02T07:58:06.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that was what I was saying towards the end of the post could riot give players a chance to obtain the skin by reaching gold again give players a choice in which skin they obtain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-26T07:57:11.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bottom line is that no one should simply be given a Victorious skin just because they ask. It's one of those things in life that *should* be earned. Just imagine how all the people who've put time and effort into obtaining Gold would feel if Riot simply started giving away Victorious skins like they were worthless (actually, that's pretty much what they'll be if Riot *were* to do that).","replies":[{"poster":"He Is Scripting","date":"2018-05-02T07:56:15.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m not saying give them away or asking for one I’m asking for the chance to earn one.
