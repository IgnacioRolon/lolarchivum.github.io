So two of us are bronze 5, one is unranked and the other is silver 5 how does this equal a fair match up? so i though okay maybe they were duoing with someone so i had a look at there match history and i find out that they were playing with a bronze 3 and a unranked. It&#039;s frustrating because it ruins the game for other low level players.\r\nit makes me question how is matchmaking done? how can it be fair for a bronze to vs a plat? \r\ni understand if it were ranked teams but not in normal&#039;s.\r\ncan anyone answer my question?\r\n\r\nthe mmr&#039;s are:\r\nLadytatiana- 982 mmr\r\nDerpyharpy- 958\r\nriven to madnes- 1048\r\nningart- unranked (lvl 25)\r\nmogolian- unknown\r\n     vs\r\nCactus lord 1631\r\nblackchan69er-1011\r\nGarryn-1050\r\nclueless- 1037\r\nkangaroorida- 1072","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-09-27T04:53:53.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, don't base your MMR off of 3rd party websites. None of them are accurate, and a lot of them do actually fluctuate wildly even if you aren't playing any ranked games. \n\nSecond of all,[ ranked MMR and normal MMR is completely different](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q1). Often lower ranked players will find higher ranked players in their normal games, as people plat+ usually have a steady history of only ranked (hence normal MMR can be pretty low). People also tend to multi-queue leading games to be of \"average\" MMR between the multi queue. \n\nThirdly, our server population is actually pretty small, and while the system does try to match you with people with similar MMR eventually it will branch out as it tries to find you a match in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nLastly, while it does suck to be on the[ disadvantaged end of a matchup](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q5), you have to remain positive :)\nThink of it as an opportunity to better your skills by facing better opponents. Versing opponents of a higher skill level (as opposed to your own) will help you grow as a player more efficiently as you learn to hold your own in a much tougher environment. When you then compare it to a match/lane vs someone your level, it will most likely seem easier.","replies":[{"poster":"He Is Scripting","date":"2016-09-27T05:44:28.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand third party websites can be inaccurate and they do fluctuate i only used a third party website to get a rough example of there mmrs so people have a better understanding of what i was talking about  and so i could have even a rough estimate of there skill level so i could see what i was up against.  i understand ranked mmr's are different from normal's but shouldn't someones rank contribute to there match-ups? im not sure which is why i wrote this post to try and get a better understanding of how matchmaking works. honestly i would rather wait that little bit longer and get a game i enjoy than go up against someone who has a lot more skill than i do. i did try and stay positive during the match but i was also getting abused by one of my teammates for \"feeding the katarina\" even though i was trying to play safe under tower i was getting dived so i couldn't do much. it has given me good practice but its not something i would like to do again soon lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-26T23:09:27.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That 1631 is his ranked MMR not internal Normal MMR. Normal and Ranked MMRs are separate.\nHe is probably very similar to myself, i play alot of norms with randoms and friends and i get placed with an assortment of players from B5-D1 depending on who i play with. Most of the time if i play solo in norm's its golds to bronze. I have a near perfect win loss ratio in norms but i only play for fun. I think its all about how you start as in when you first start playing normal how well do you do, Like ranked mmr they place you till your comfy but if u dont win and win alot to begin with it keeps you down, so its harder to get back up unless you average over 100's of games goes up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-26T21:13:57.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, matchmaking is always an interesting topic. A few things I can think of that could contribute to odd matchups like this-\n\n- I'm pretty sure normal and ranked MMRs are separate, which can lead to some odd discrepancies in the first place.\n- The plat player was grouped with two people around your group's MMR. Do you think it would be fairer for the unranked and bronze 3 player to be put in a game of plats, or to have one plat player in a game with lower MMRs? This is what the system will be trying to balance out.\n- Also, as far as I'm aware there's no way to 100% view your MMR except for with third-party websites, so there could be inaccuracies there too\n\nThe matchmaking system isn't perfect, so strange games with mixes of MMRs do occur - and while it can be unfair to play against, hopefully it's rare enough to not be a big concern. And also, sometimes you're the team with the plat ^_^","replies":[]}]}
