I know some people might say go to the store and click on owned skins but that doesn&#039;t show you all the skins some aren&#039;t in store anymore so you won&#039;t get the full list and it doesn&#039;t tell you how many you got.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion my suggestion is a list of skins you own with the picture and name of them perhaps in order of the champion name or you can choose with a pull down menu in which organization method you want them to be displayed in and also a counter somewhere that says exactly how many skins you own.\r\n\r\nDo you guys agree, because let&#039;s face it RIOT&#039;s revenue is made up mostly from skin customers so I think they deserve this basic but convent and efficient method of being able to view what they own. \r\n\r\nWHY? well there is a list for the champions you own but there isn&#039;t a counter though so why not a list for skins? and a counter to let you know how many you got.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-20T08:05:45.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is currently a \"Collection\" Tab on the Alpha Client.
