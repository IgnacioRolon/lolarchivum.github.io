But for the most part the legit skins from pax and all those events are big popular things and eb games is atleast reputable enough not to scam you, perhaps charge you like double price any other gamer store would but that's another matter. If you're going to get pulled into something that seems a little sketch you can type it into google and see if any other forums have reviewed it or another persons posted about it and yeah just never give out your account info because legit things wouldn't ask for it.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-25T02:37:43.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't it put a bug on my computer next time I went into my bank account stole my account details I didn't even know about the bug for a few weeks after and as foe sketchy all my mates were going on to it you get a link saying you need to send to members and you get points then as you click on the link it downloads a bug that dose what I sed above it gets sent to a lot of people it happiness a lot les now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-24T23:41:45.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you look in the oce forum archives there is a link from a rioter leading to a free tristana and garen skin, that's the only thing your going to get without any doubts","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-24T15:33:02.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um bud all of these free rp and skins are all scams to get into your computer for docs or just some dick making a website saying free rp or skins and next thing you know you got a bug on your computer or lost $200 from your bank account trust me I know","replies":[]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-08-24T15:31:38.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gotta get involved in stuff. Like riot will post about free stuff they offer but it's not really up to them to keep up with free skins from other sources. No single website could do that. You just gotta keep checking things like reddit, go to events like PAX, keep checking things via random google searches and it is a little tough but yeah. Also build a community of friends who also care about these skins and they'll probably let you in on any they become aware of.","replies":[]}]}
