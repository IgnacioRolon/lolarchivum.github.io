Against the soft dusk, a silhouette on the horizon swayed and collapsed into the sand. Out of seemingly nowhere a figure appeared next to the body. The figure bent down and rummaged through the dead man&rsquo;s pockets. A few seconds later he straightened up, a small pouch now bouncing in his palm. Then, with nothing more than a tip of his hat, the man vanished again. The gulls circling in the sky returned to their roosts leaving the beach silent once more. The dead man lay still, the only sign of his killer- a blood splattered playing card.\n\n\nFar away, amidst the maze of back alleys and side streets of Bilgewater, the sound of cats hissing and trash cans crashing to the ground split the evening silence. Out from one of the side streets emerged a tall, lean man. After a quick survey of the scene he patted the dust off his suit, pulled his hat low over his eyes are walked swiftly across the road and through the beaten old door of the Misfortune.\n\nThe Misfortune was a bar, a commonplace for thieves and thugs alike. It wasn't uncommon to see the remains of bar room brawls splashed against the walls in dull red stains and if you saw an unfamiliar face it was probably because he was missing a nose and half his teeth. \nThe door creaked open to allow the tall stranger entrance. As he strode past the splintered tables a blanket of silence slowly descended over the room until there was nothing more than the sound of the stranger&rsquo;s slow, measured foot falls. When he reached the counter he pulled a silver serpent from his pocket and flipped into the air.\n\nIn a flash of movement, a fist snatched the coin from the air. Another appeared under the stranger&rsquo;s chin, this one holding a pistol. The room froze. One second passed. Then another. The tall stranger looked slowly from the bartender to the fist holding his coin. A soft chuckle broke the silence, followed by a hearty laugh,\n\n&ldquo;Hahaha! Has it really been so long that you don&rsquo;t even recognise me anymore?&rdquo;\n\nThe tall stranger reached his hand up to the pistol, paused, then simply took off his hat and placed it on the counter. In the flickering light of the dirty chandelier you could make out the man&rsquo;s thin features, his well-kept beard and sly smirk.\n\n&ldquo;Fate. You know very well that you aren&rsquo;t welcome here. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact that you have a sack of silver in your pockets I would kick you out right now.&rdquo;\n\nThe stranger grinned and slowly pulled the pouch from his pocket, upending it on the counter. When the last of the coins had trickled onto the gleaming heap the stranger reached up and pushed the pistol away.\n\n&ldquo;Drinks are on me tonight!&rdquo; he announced.\n\nThe bar&rsquo;s tension collapsed and the occupants, hearing the news that they would be getting drunk for free, returned to their brawls and gambling. The stranger turned back to the counter,\n\n&ldquo;So what can you get me Miss? Or do you prefer Sarah? As much I love to chat with you I always feel that you give me cold shoulder. Could it be you secretly fancy me? My apologies but my only love is gambling and Lady Luck is my girl.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Beat it Fate. You have your money so you&rsquo;ll get your drink, but don&rsquo;t think for a second I&rsquo;m going to play nice with you. Anyway, there&rsquo;s someone over there who&rsquo;s more worth your time.&rdquo;\n\nThe bartender slid a foaming mug of ale across the counter, pointing towards the far edge of the counter. There sat a short, muscular man, smoke curling upwards from the large cigar between his teeth. Next to him, resting against the counter, was a custom-made shot gun. Just the man the stranger wanted to see.\n\nFate sauntered over to the edge of the counter. The man raised his head, hoisting the shot gun up to meet Fate&rsquo;s face. The cigar in his mouth bent slightly as his teeth clenched.\n\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here for your gold- &ldquo;\n\n&ldquo;Not your heads- &ldquo;\n\n&ldquo;Nobody try to be a hero- &ldquo;\n\n&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to end up dead.&rdquo;\n\nThe two looked each other up and down, sizing the other up. Looking on, Miss Fortune reached a hand over to her pistols in case a serious fight started. To her surprise the two burst out laughing. The stranger shook Fate&rsquo;s hand vigorously and gave him a slap on the back sending him face first into the counter.\n\n&ldquo;How are you doing you river rat?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Haha. Probably better than you slum dog.&rdquo;\n\n\nAfter a couple of hours and twice as many drinks, Fate decided it was time to get down to business. He glanced quickly at the door before looking back to Graves. He leaned forward, lowering his voice,\n\n&ldquo;To tell you the truth partner, those silver serpents on the counter used to belong to an even bigger snake. Let&rsquo;s just say that the man I met on the beach may or may not have belonged to the crew of&hellip; Gangplank.&rdquo;\n\nGraves shook his head in mock disappointment.\n\n&ldquo;You know, why are you always the one that gets us into trouble?&rdquo;\n\nFate grinned.\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not trouble if we can get out of it.&rdquo;\n\nGraves grinned back.\n\n&ldquo;So, how long until he finds you? My trigger&rsquo;s been itching for some real action, ever since that day. I&rsquo;ve been waiting dearly for a chance to put some more holes in that old barnacle.&rdquo;\n\nIn reply, Fate simply held up three fingers.\n\nThree. The bar fell silent at the sound of boots crunching on the stones outside.\n\nTwo. Outside there was a bang on the door followed by a loud thud. The door shook.\n\nOne&hellip;\n\nThe whole bar shook as the door flew off its hinges, crashing to the floor. The occupants of the bar huddled under their tables in fearful silence. The last time Gangplank&rsquo;s crew had come to Bilgewater the streets were flooded not with seawater, but blood.\n\nFrom outside they heard an almighty roar,\n\n&ldquo;Come out here river rat! Show yourself and meet- your- fate!&rdquo;\n\nThe silence inside the bar was broken by Fate&rsquo;s hysterical laughter.\n\n&ldquo;Hahahahahaha! Did you hear that? Meet my fate? &lsquo;Cos I am Fate. Hahahaha.&rdquo;\n\nMiss Fortune and Graves just stared at him. Fate cleared his throat awkwardly. Without another word he reached into his top pocket and pulled out a battered deck of cards. Twirling one between his fingers he readied himself for the fight. Next to him Graves and Miss Fortune hefted their weapons up to eye level, equally eager and ready.\n\n\nOut in the street Gangplank sat on a barrel, peeling an orange with his cutlass. Narrowing his eyes against the gloom he peered through the now doorless entrance to the bar, watching for any sign of movement. Snap. Off to the side he heard a sharp sound followed by the thud of his right hand man onto the stone street. Gangplank whirled around, his eyes searching the darkness.\n\nA flash of gold appeared out of the darkness, whistling past Gangplank&rsquo;s head. Imbedded in the wall next to his head quivered a shining golden card. The sound of another card flying through the air forced Gangplank to dive for cover, only to roll quickly to the side to avoid the gunshots hammering into the cobblestones.\n\nAs the dust and smoke died away Gangplank looked around to see his entire crew decimated. Standing in their place, their guns still smoking, stood Graves and Miss Fortune. Graves swung his shotgun round firing two short bursts at the pirate captain, his custom made twin barrel shooting blasts of shrapnel that shredded through the barrel narrowly missing Gangplank. Graves grinned at the pirate captain and dashed forward loading two new bullets into the shotgun&rsquo;s cartridge for another shot.\n\nOff to the side Miss Fortune lined up the pirate captain for a devastating barrage of fire, shooting continuously with her pistols until she ran out of ammunition. Gangplank ducked and weaved, hiding behind the bodies of his crewmates for cover. When the noise of bullet fire finally died down Gangplank emerged holding his cutlass. Deflecting the shrapnel thrown by Graves with his mechanical arm, Gangplank rushed at Miss Fortune, his cutlass aiming straight for the heart.\n\nInches away from the killing blow, Gangplank saw the flash of gold too late and was sent tumbling to the ground. He put his hand up to his cheek and when he pulled it away again it was painted red. From the side Fate rushed in and kicked him full in the face sending the pirate captain keeling over. When Gangplank finally looked up he was facing the long barrel of his own pistol held firmly in the hands of the man he&rsquo;d come to kill.\n\n&ldquo;Game over.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:58:33.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well paced!
