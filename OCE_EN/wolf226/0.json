(anything funny counts as well) besides feeding and trolling of course.\r\nAs for me i encountered the most weird guy yet, His summoner name was &#039;Exdrelication&#039; (OCE Server) and i met him in 2 consecutive games and he was on the enemy team. To be fair he was quite the good player (he was playing mid against me), He started off by dancing or laughing in lane ever time he won a trade and naturally he started commenting on how bad our team was and was being negative. But here is where the bizarre strikes in, at moments he would talk about the problems in his life as if we were his therapist or something. He would say things like &quot;My mom calls me annoying all the time&quot; and &quot;i have many problems in life&quot; and this went on though out the game (happened in both games). I guess this is horrible but i found it funny at times, i have no idea if he was joking or he was really depressed in life. Anyway it was the weirdest player iv met so far, how about you guys any funny moments regarding players?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-09T16:17:55.558+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never met a weirdo, life was all perfectly normal.\n\nUntil I was introduced to this cursed item called mirror and so I met...\n\nHim.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-09T14:39:14.810+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i met myself.
