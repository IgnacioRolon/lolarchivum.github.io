Due to a combination of high mobility, survivability, wave clear and ways to proc TF on a tower he can be an absolute nuisance. For example, just recently at Worlds we saw TF/tank Ekko suffer in lane (vs Kennen) until he eventually became an unstoppable 1v1 split pusher who not only constantly stuck to the tower and inhib but often threatened to solo kill whoever showed up too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-29T17:02:00.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Ekko main i'd have to say Tank Ekko is still really viable, but generally speaking you have to augment him a little since the nerfs.\n\nPersonally i run him with a Titanic Hydra after i start getting my tank stats as it supplements your tank stats well.\n\nPersonal build;\nSpirit Visage/Sunfire Cape > The other one (Possibly Titanic if your not threatened by the other damage type) > Titanic (the other tank item)\n\nFrom there you want to go situational most times;\nzz'Rot (need to be at a team fight and push at the same time.), Locket (will be being changed so this one will probably not be in the list in Pre-season), Iceborn Gauntlet (great CDR item if you can afford to go it, more ult's more slows), Steraks Gage (best if you have Iceborn as well), Thornmail, GA.\n\nAlso i personally Run 0/12/18, With Meditation over Executioner, for that early game mana regen, and Grasp because your going to be building a lot of health.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-10-29T13:20:29.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently in high elo it seems that Tank is still the way to build Ekko top lane. Building a Trifroce as their main damage source and if they get really fed they can sometimes buy a Protobelt. The rest of the items they buy usually consist of Deadman's plate, Sunfire Cape, Randiun's Omen and Guardian Angel. \n\nTank isn't the only way to build Ekko though you can still go the somewhat older AP build. In my opinion you should go the two different builds depending on what your team comp needs and how well you do in the lane. He can work quite well with both sets of items so it can be quite fun to go into a game and deciding that you can go AP if you get really fed coming out of laning phase or you can go tank if you don't quite reach the mark.\n\nBack to what I was saying with team comps though, this can also effect what build you choose to go. For example if you were playing Ekko top lane and you had an AD mid laner such as a Zed with a tanky jungler that is also majority AD damage, it might be good for you to go a majority AP build to make it so that the enemy team can't just stack armor to counter the champions that your team has picked.\n\nThough the nerfs did very much effect the way that Ekko is played especially in the laning phase he still seems like a strong pick with the amount that people have been picking with the nefs being kept in mind. So all up I think its personal preference for what type of Ekko you play at the moment with how strong they both seem to be. Try both out and see what you like and what you enjoy the most.\n**[\nIf you are interested you can have a look at a website here to see what pro players are currently building on Ekko. With mastery setups and all.\n](http://www.probuilds.net/champions/details/Ekko)**\n\nLet me know how it goes and good luck out there!\n\n~ Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-29T11:20:15.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its still ok. I'd say its more than viable. He does less damage in lane so he isn't just a \"free win\" in lane anymore, but still good.\n\nI'd say a tank item first into triforce with Fervor for battle is a way to go. If you are winning then go Trinity first.","replies":[]}]}
