Maybe your team gives up, or maybe the enemy team just out rotates and out teamfights you once they realise your fed adc isn&#039;t here anymore.

Sure losing 15 lp over 20 would be nice but we already have promo free wins etc... back in the day u got absolutely 0 so i think its easier to climb now than ever (arguably i guess) so yeah. that's another option.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-03-14T11:13:22.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just two thing to add, the system would be good for any elo higher than bronze and silver. Unfortunately you will have alot peoples second accounts in the lower elos as smurfs or new accounts after bans that would abuse anyone who played poorly into leaving the game to minimize lp loss. Riots current ban system doesn't promote reform, it instead threatens in hopes of reform, so alot of these new accounts will be bought or xp boosted and the player will be more toxic than ever (most likely) because they have a clean slate just increasing the chance of my original point. Instead i think a system that would bode well would be a system that looks at kill difference and gold difference. If you are gaining (or closing in) gold/kills, usually (not all the time) your making a comeback or just getting further ahead and a gold/kill score higher than the enemies speaks for itself, usually ur ahead already. Those are the two scenarios i think you should get a lp loss reduction. Another gimmick riot can implement for a system like this is increased lp gain if you win your next game to cover up for the unknown game before hand. Other than that i have been waiting for a system that implements this for yonks and finally after the remake system, we might be getting somewhere, after all afk's *ruin* league of legends.","replies":[]}]}
