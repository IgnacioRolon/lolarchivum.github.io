Turns out ZoneAlarm is a piece of garbage, and no matter how many times I add the League client as a trusted program it still decides to block it now and then.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Riot have several antivirus softwares that will recognise the client and let it through. \r\n\r\nSo I&#039;m ready to tell ZA to gtfo - what else are people using?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-02-01T04:08:58.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe we have an approved list or anything like that. How your AV interacts with LoL could be different on a machine to machine basis.\n\nI'm going to be ripped apart for saying this, but I personally recommend Norton assuming you're willing to pay for AV.\n\nI've probably tried about 10 or more AV's over the years - free stuff, paid stuff, cracked stuff when my computer illiterate family refused to purchase AV, stuff that the Internet hates (Norton), and stuff that the Internet reveres (MBAM, AVG). Norton is the only one that I've had no issues with. No mucking around with config or regular sweeps, no infections, no slowdown of my machine (though older versions were bloated)\n\nI might not agree with some of their business practices, but their software has been improving drastically since the disaster that was Norton AV 2006.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-01T00:05:11.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\\>needing antivirus software\nlmao how about you don't download shit that are viruses.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-01T02:54:22.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A steezy Scizor,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dlKsZ8UQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-01T00:05:11.879+0000)\n>\n> \\&gt;needing antivirus software\n> lmao how about you don&#x27;t download shit that are viruses.\n\nVirus can come to you even if you don't actively go visit their hunting grounds. \n\nAnti-virus is essential just as a door lock is to your home.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-02-01T02:13:20.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also firewall etc. Feel free to roll your opinion up into a little ball and give yourself an enema with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-01T03:36:06.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My protection involves Avast antivirus, Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner (Adware cleaner). The first 2 have pretty self-contained and more or less complete free versions, which I use; and the last one is completely free (separate from but associated with Malwarebyte).\n\nThough the latter 2 is just for enhancing the first one, which is the Avast antivirus.\n\nAvast antivirus should by default let League through, at least I don't remember setting exception for League in its settings. It also comes with a gaming mode that can be toggled on and off, so that it consumes less resources during your game time (or whenever you're doing resource hugging things) too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-02-01T01:25:11.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I use Kaspersky (paid) as my main antivirus, and occasionally run scans using Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (free). Kaspersky does the job on keeping things running without any problems, and the Malwarebytes scans will pick up anything that gets through Kaspersky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-01T00:01:58.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going with avast, it's free, decently effective and it doesn't interfere with League or other games. It's also around average in resource consumption as antivirus goes, though the ads you get sometimes where they try to coerce you into going premium is annoying.","replies":[]}]}
