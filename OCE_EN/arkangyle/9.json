It's sheer coincidence. No game has any connection with another except for your presence, to which you've already pointed out you can improve on the game which is totally in your hands and that is totally fine. However, the fact that you are playing support for a ton of these games is a major factor. Sometimes I'm in games that are going badly as support hoping I could've played a more carrying role than supporting role seeing the mistakes others make. I would say to try stop playing support unless your team absolutely needs you, and even then you need to ask yourself, are you really better at carrying or offensive roles rather than defensive.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-09-13T07:00:58.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was sort of going for the more traditional definition of luck - \"success or failure apparently brought by chance rather than through one's own actions\".

Otherwise by playing support your team as a whole is wasting potential; your skill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
