In my ARAMs I'm being matched with teams that are mostly gold, despite being unranked, and recently in a ranked game I was supporting a platinum Ezreal on a team of golds. \nThe mid laners hit level 15 when I was level 9. I didn't belong in that game and I just got abused for about half an hour.\nI'm happy to just play with bronze players, ty xD\n\nAlso, fun fact. Platinum Ezreals can flame WHILE they cs.

I'm only Gold 3, but clearly these guys were way in above their head.\n\nFor example. I had an unranked lvl 30 player, fresh account, didn't play last season. Had lost 6 of their past 7 games (all provisional) yet was still paired against high golds and a couple of plats from memory. And my MMR for soloQ is normal.\n\nI really don't think it's fair on the ranked and also the unranked players doing their provisionals chucking them in the deep end and seeing if they sink or swim. These guys were clearly playing in games well above what they should be in and it reflected in a loss for the teams. I'm not blaming them purely, but it's hard to play with people still learning the basic fundamentals of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-06T23:55:57.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you could either have high personal mmr or they have low personal mmr. both very likely at this point in the season. what the system cares about is team average mmr anyway","replies":[]}]}
