I&#039;d go so far as to say you&#039;re not even giving us a fighting chance.\r\n\r\nI got placed B5 this season. Fair enough. Climbed out to B4, got demoted, and about 7 promo attempts later was back in B4.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had a grand total of 5 games in B4. Won the first, lost the second, won the third, lost the next two.\r\n\r\nAnd now I&#039;m back in B5.\r\n\r\nI get that the way it works is that if you win more games, you get better MMR. But surely you should be given more than 3 losses before getting booted back down again?\r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-06-13T09:07:44.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it seems frustrating, and that it's riots fault, or your teams fault. or whatever.\n\nBut sometimes you can't climb for another reason.... Yourself.\n\nThis isn't an attack solely on you, i think a lotttt of bronze-gold players are exactly the same when it comes to trying to climb, they believe they're better than everyone else and that they're in \"Elo-hell\".\n\nfrom just a quick little look at your games, i can tell there are a few issues with the way you play. \n\njust some quick tips that will help you climb a lottttt faster.\n\n1. Farm... you should be aiming for 7cs/min, but having 6ish isn't so bad if you're doing well and ahead. \n2. don't ignore every other lane. if you're going 10-0 in lane, but your other lanes are losing, actively see what you can do to help.\n3. learn objective taking vs chasing for kills, sometimes it's soo easy to get 1 kill, on the enemy support, that's 0-5-5, but taking dragon would help a lottt more.\n4. Just play... \n\nno matter what you do, you will be in your current rank, until you improve your play. i'm saying this as a Gold5 that is struggling to climb. i play, figure out all the things that I did wrong, and i try and fix them. \n\ni had 150 farm by 20 minutes? oh cool, thats amazing. but by 30 i only had 160... that needs to stop\n\ni went 8-0 and had 7cs/min, but my team lost every lane, and i had tp as a toplaner.. i could have easily helped the game\n\ni went for top turret instead of tp'ing to dragon and following my laner. they received dragon and 4 kills out of my mistake. \n\nthe enemy ADC was fed, and i went to 1v1 her as a midlaner and died... i should probably check her score before i go in again.\n\nevery single game, think about what you could have done differently. change that in the upcoming games, and you'll see yourself getting a lot better..\n\nwhile you may think you're good enough to be *Insert rank here*, until you achieve that, you have 0 clue whether or not you can be that good. Lanes are different the higher you rank up, team fights are different, objective taking. everything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaMaLiCkR","date":"2017-06-24T21:03:05.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"of course not. 50% of the community use to be in silver 1 and below... its now closer to 80%\n\nto much trolling. not enough punishment for intentionally feeding\n\nwhy is it a option to report someone for it. if no one EVER gets punished for it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Goose One","date":"2017-06-14T12:53:58.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud and carry hard","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stemix","date":"2017-06-14T02:45:56.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in same boat too...

Just play jax/tryndamere and even if you lose lane just push constantly and you've won the match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-13T05:38:20.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel. The exact same thing is happening to me. I get to B4 90 LP them BOOM! 4 losses later I'm in Bronze 5...\n\nIf I stayed in Bronze 4, that would be good because I am actually noticing a large skill difference between Bronze 5 0 LP and Bronze 4 0 LP. But instead I'm demoted to B5, carry the next few games because they're easy, back to B4, lose a game because suddenly the opponents are better, down to B5, etc.","replies":[]}]}
