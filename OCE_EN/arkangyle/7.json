If you&#039;re not sure you want to play, just don&#039;t get in the fking queue in the first place. Go take a walk, read a book, have a shower, fap, I don&#039;t really care what else you do. Just stop ruining it for the rest of us.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-03-27T05:38:28.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least you get some in game time with people that play for a few minutes. I had a game last night where my first ban (jungler) banned our first picks zed, I banned renek and last ban bans our junglers yi.\n\nSuffice to say our mid laner was AFK for nearly half the entire 40 minute match and our \"jungler\" didn't actually jungle at all, just roamed lanes giving out free kills as twitch.\n\nI know these kinds of games suck but honestly looking at it from my personal perspective these are the games you should be trying to keep alive/win for as long as you can. These kinds of games can show you exactly how good the correct decisions can be.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am just silver trash lmao but if I was able to keep the game afloat for sub 40 minutes because the enemy team were too brain dead to end it correctly (and I am pretty sure one wrong decision at the end of the game is what gave it away (from me)) there is a lot to be taken from them.\n\nIf you are focusing on improving yourself it doesn't matter how much feeding and afking is on your team there is always something to learn.\n\nOn the flip side people that surrender (you would be one of those in this case) are the bane of my existence. I do not care how bad you are, I do not care how much time you think I am wasting on your behalf. You better not press that surrender button just because you arbitrarily decided the game was over.\n\nThe game is never over, not until the last blow to the nexus is drawn.\n\nGood luck next time haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-03-27T06:32:27.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can handle that logic in a solo lane. Kind of tricky as a support when your ADC runs off to try and gank other lanes as a lvl 2 Jinx to do much other than pick up a little bit of farm and try not to die.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-03-27T09:27:27.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to ranked, where dreams and ambitions die :3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
