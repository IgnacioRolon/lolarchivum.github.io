They should probably be punished. Good job Riot. \r\n\r\nHere&#039;s what I don&#039;t get - someone can&#039;t connect to the game at all - not that they choose to leave, but they spend 10 minutes trying to connect, team remakes. No harm done. \r\n\r\nExcept to the poor bastard stuck trying to connect for 10 minutes only to then cop a 10 minute penalty for &quot;leaving&quot;. \r\n\r\nSurely the frustration involved is penalty enough, why punish them further?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-15T00:59:08.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing, though. The Leavebuster system wont punish someone for a first offence, except (perhaps) in the most extreme cases. A single AFK for 5-10 minutes should *never* result in punishment, unless there were *recent prior* AFKs/DCs and/or it occurred in a ranked game. Another thing to note is that the Leavebuster will not dish out a 10 minute LPQ (2nd tier punishment) as a \"first resort\" punishment, except where the offending player has already demonstrated a serious lack of consideration for the rules.\n\nQuite simply, an error occurring due to ISP/Computer/WIFI/Client issues should *never* result in the kind of situation where the player would be punished. That is, of course, assuming that error is the *only* factor. With other factors to consider there will, of course, be a significantly increased chance of a punishment being handed out.\n\nMoral of the story: Never leave between being matched with a team and the end of the game and always ensure you address any issues as soon as they occur *before* queuing for another game.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-11-15T05:47:41.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Quite simply, an error occurring due to ISP/Computer/WIFI/Client issues should never result in the kind of situation where the player would be punished.\n\nExcept that is the only situation I'm speaking about here. I've never left mid-game, never AFKd during a match. My entire \"history\" stems from being unable to connect to matches - whether that's considered a client issue, connection issue or shitty computer issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-15T07:16:47.352+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then that suggests that you're not living up to your agreements (TOU and EULA) with Riot, since the only way that would be happening is if these issues were occurring far too frequently to be considered \"out of your control\". Fact is, *you* have agreed that you will ensure your connection and computer meet the requirements of the game, and that includes making sure that any issues that would otherwise affect your ability to connect to a given match are negligible which would, as a result, make it effectively impossible for you to be punished by the Leavebuster system.\n\nIf what you say is true, then you have some serious problem finding to do so you can figure out what is causing these issue to occur so frequently.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-11-15T11:57:42.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If what you say is true, then you have some serious problem finding to do so you can figure out what is causing these issue to occur so frequently.\n\nYou got me thinking - maybe it's more frequent than I believe. So I did a look through my entire match history since I created this account in April. The **total** number of games where I've been the at-fault person in a remake? \n\nFour.\n\n4 times in 7 months. One of those was in ranked, three in norms.  \n\nI've played over 400 games in that time period, so we're talking about less than 1% of the time here.\n\nRito pls.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-15T12:57:45.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously struggle to believe it's only occurred 4 times for you, considering your situation. That said, it's more difficult than you might think to accurately determine how often you've actually been picked up by Leavebuster and the report system. Without the information directly relating to your account on the Riot servers (some of which is completely unavailable to players) you can't truly determine the actual occurrence of DCs, AFKs and the like throughout your match history.\n\nOf course, if you truly believe you've been falsely punished you can bring the situation to the attention of Riot by submitting a support ticket [[link](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)] and they will be able to manually check the case and determine whether there was a false positive or, in the case there wasn't, explain more thoroughly what caused the punishment you received.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-11-15T14:01:49.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's 4 legitimate remakes because I couldn't join in time.\n\nIf it takes into accounts games I joined after it had started (but before remake was available), then it'd be dozens.

It doesn't matter if you're AFK for one minute or ten, the effect can be just as disastrous and detrimental to the game either way. Less time spent out of game doesn't mean it shouldn't be counted.\n\n> Considered submitting a ticket, but Riot support site is pretty clearcut in saying that LQ penalties won&#x27;t be overturned under any circumstances.\n\nAnd yet, it could very well help them identify issues that cause false positives so that they occur less frequently, assuming of course that it is indeed a false positive.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-11-16T03:24:17.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First minute, nothing is happening.
