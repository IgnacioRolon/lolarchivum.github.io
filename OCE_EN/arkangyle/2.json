Bad players exist at all ages. It's their inability to have a grown up conversation without resorting to swearing, name calling and caps that shits me.\n\nYeah, I can mute them.

OCE is an interesting server though in which I believe is because the Australian society is much different to other countries where offensive language is becoming more acceptable these days when compared to other countries. So, I think that might be a factor of the OCE toxicness. But I think it is good to still play and develop resilience towards negative players who may or may not be high schoolers.
