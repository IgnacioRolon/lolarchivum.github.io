How does it happen?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See title.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t me being salty, this is me being genuinely curious. As a bronze 5, you get used to playing with and against some truly awful players. Hell, I&#039;m awful on my day. \r\n\r\nSo when you get players who are so very obviously in the wrong elo, it stands out. Had a ranked game yesterday where the opposition bot lane was a smurf duo who normally play Gold 1/Plat 5 and went 24/0/29 as a duo. They were tilted in their elo, so wanted to unwind by beating up some scrubs. Can&#039;t fault them for that.\r\n\r\nBut I can&#039;t help but wonder how on earth they end up in a low bronze elo to begin with. Like isn&#039;t the point of placement games to see where you approximate skill level is relative to those around you? So unless these guys threw games just to get low elo, wouldn&#039;t their MMR put them into at least low silver?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-22T05:52:57.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually, the player has 2 accounts, the 'main' account, and the 'smurf' account.\n\nThe main account of course is where they are truly at in terms of skill level, and this account will have all their skins and IP etc. and the smurf account is a separate account that they purposefully put in lower elo (by playing bad in placements). \n\nBut if you know that the exact accounts you vsed were gold 1 and plat 5, then perhaps it was their 'main' accounts that you happened to vsed, and there is a couple of possibilities as to why you vsed them.\n\n1. They might have been queueing with one or more bronze 5's on the enemy team. Assuming this wasn't ranked, having a pre-made team with three bronze 5's and two high elo players, will cause the gold players to be placed against people with lower skill level then them.\n\n2. An account has two sets of MMR, one is for ranked, the other is for normals. If you reach gold in ranked, your Ranked MMR is gold. But that has no effect on your normal MMR. A challenger player can still be placed in a bronze-level normal game, if they have haven't played normals much and so have bad MMR in that game mode. So it is a possibility that these two players ONLY play ranked, and then for some reason they decided to play normals, (but hadn't played normals since they reached lvl 30) and so still had lvl 30 MMR for normal games.\n\nThose are possibilities for why these players could have been in your game (if it was normals). If it was ranked, then I'm afraid I have no idea why they would be placed with you, (and they shouldn't have been)!\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"A is for Atlas","date":"2016-12-22T08:30:46.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They also could tank their MMR on the smurf accounts by throwing games on purpose.  Given enough time, that would put them in a Bronze V game, and no matter how hard they stomp they're only an intentional loss or two away from staying in that Elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-12-22T06:29:26.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the response. It was ranked. I only know they were smurfs because they fessed up to it when I called them out for obviously being in the wrong elo and provided me with their main names. \n\nI often queue in norms in premades featuring higher elo players - I like to practice against better opponents so it feels less bad when I get stomped. Not in ranked though, I'd rather actually play against my own elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-22T07:06:49.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh ok I see, If it was ranked, its quite likely they could be boosting a member of their team, perhaps letting their friend (or a paying customer) use them to get a good score out of provisionals. \n\nThats a common reason for having a smurf account. \n\nThe other reason of course is that they just aren't good enough for their own elo and so need to make themselves feel better by stomping people at low elo.\n\nIt does seem unusual however that they admitted their names at the end of the game, (i believe you can be punished for smurfing like this in ranked, so thats an unnecessary risk they are taking.) So it is a possibility that the names they gave weren't even their accounts and they are trying to get someone else punished. (just a theory of course)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"icefire009","date":"2016-12-22T12:38:21.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me tell you how they matched up with you, those actual account owners (bronzes) paid someone who is beyond low ranks to play their accounts for them, and improve their ranks. \nIt happens in every rank.\n\nI am platinum 3-5 and I had experienced at least 20 games in this season against people who are actually masters or diamonds.","replies":[]}]}
