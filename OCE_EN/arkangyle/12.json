After about 15-30 seconds I get a popup that says &quot;Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.&quot;\r\n\r\nPreviously I&#039;d hit cancel here, it would tell me the game had crashed and would reconnect and that&#039;d be all good. Doesn&#039;t seem to be working anymore - at least not consistently. Sometimes it does it first time, but I&#039;ve had times where I&#039;m sitting there hitting that reconnect button until it finally works, putting me into the game at 2:40, or 7:50, or 9:25. Kinda hard to play catchup when you&#039;re 9 mins behind.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s been happening more often since 6.9 patch was released, but I&#039;ve also &quot;upgraded&quot; to Windows 10 in the meantime (still not sure why). \r\n\r\nSimple fix might be to revert back to older Windows, but would prefer to avoid that if there&#039;s a fix.\r\n\r\n**Side note**\r\nI&#039;ve already gone into my firewall (ZoneAlarm) and added the updated the exceptions to allow LoL full access.\r\nI&#039;ve also already tried running the game in Compatibility Mode for Vista and Windows 7, with no change to the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Vocnsi","date":"2016-05-10T13:01:40.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have the same problem, have not been able to fix. It has been doing it for a week now. I have a MAC and i did something where i allowed file vault or something to allow my keyboard to work, as when i turn my computer on the computer wouldn't allow me to put in my password so i had to continue to restart until it allowed me to do that. \n\nI also have a problem which may be also effecting LOL is that after a while, the internet is connected but it wont actually allow me to open internet programs or search the web, but yet connected to internet. \n\n:( \n\nI have done a file repair but it came up with nothing and am repeating and will try again to see if it worked this time but i am not hopeful.  :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"MJ27","date":"2016-05-09T11:52:22.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.
