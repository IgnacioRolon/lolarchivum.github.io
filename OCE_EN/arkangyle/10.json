My initial feeling is my ISP is throttling my connection to the league server for some reason but idk\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also just upgraded to a brand spanking new PC so that shouldn&#039;t be the issue","replies":[{"poster":"birdistheword","date":"2019-01-03T06:40:17.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly the same here man, please let me know if you find a solution.","replies":[]}]}
