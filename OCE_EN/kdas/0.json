Imo your best bet would be to ignore the Kali completely, mute her, tell the Annie what's really up and to mute her as well. \n\nYou can say things like \"don't worry about it\" \"you gotta start somewhere\" or \"everyone has to learn at some point\" and help her out with any mistakes. Like say she doesn't know how to cs under turret, you can tell her that for melee its two turrets hits, and for casters it's one or two autos then a turret hit.\n\nThe important thing is not engaging the Kali, when this kind of behaviour comes up you aren't gonna change their mind with anything you can say, and regardless of how illogical their argument may be, saying anything at all just encourages them to keep talking.

Like Annie said earlier on- calling her trash and constantly pointing out her mistakes isn't going to make her play better. If anything, it sets of the player into a defensive mode and they play worse. \n\nPointing out players mistakes and giving constructive criticism generally only works if you know the person irl, or if you have built a positive rapport throughout the game. \n\nThe other thing is that you are kinda contributing to the toxic environment.

They can't handle constructive criticism. They just rage back at you with abuse because they don't want to admit that they are wrong, even if they continue to feed in game and not apply some of your constructive ideas to stop the bleeding.\n\n\n======================================\n\ne.g. very often the a sample game would go like this:\n\n(Kalista)(Me): Annie a good idea is to build a seekers first and head towards zhonyas hourglass. It's a win win situation: armour and ap. Very good versus that Zed. When you go behind in lane, look to put a stop to it, you don't have to be the carry in every game, you have a team.\n(Annie)(Kid): your mom\n(Kalista)(Me): Just trying to help your lane stop feeding so badly. Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\n(Annie)(Kid): You think you're LCS shit%%%%.\n(Kalista)(Me): Mate, you can abuse me all you like, but you're going to get logic back in return. If you can't handle logic and constructive ideas to **help the team**, you'll keep feeding.\n(Annie)(Kid): Game is over anyways.\n\nA few minutes later Annie is chasing like a noob through the jungle, chasing the Zed who was low after her combo, but because the enemy team are also noobs they send all 5 to bang save Zed and bang her.\n\n(Kalista)(Me): Let's take top tower! Don't go chasing to that fight, she's dead anyways. You'll end up dying also!\n(Trundle)(Another kid): STFU, worry about your own game\n\nBoth die and enemies get Baron right afterwards. Of course being a low elo game, the opposition overstay in our base after taking the inihibitor and get aced, so the game goes on. Our team then all scatter and go to farm in different areas of the jungle.\n\n(Kalista)(Me): Come lets take a tower now!\n(Annie)(Kid): You're a noob, thinking you're LCS\n(Trundle)(Another kid): Fucking idiot Kalista, never in team fight\n(Kalista)(Me): Pushing Lanes and taking towers is what wins, not chasing for 1 kill. Objectives>Kills\n(Lee Sin)(Another Kid): Are you retarded Kalista? Just shut up\n(Blitzcrank)(Another Kid): 300cs get good nub Kalista\n(Kalista)(Me): Kiddies you can abuse me all you like, but unless you work as a team to take OBJECTIVES, you'll lose. Anyone can abuse someone, like wow man, im 10 years old, i can use a keyboard. GET A BRAIN and LEARN SOME BASIC WAR STRATEGY, its got nothing to do with what champion you play or how many kills or how much cs you have!\n(Kalista)(Me): Towers win games. Not kills. You only kill people in this game TO TAKE OBJECTIVES TO WIN THE GAME. Not random chasing for no reason at all. You chase, you lose!\n(Kalista)(Me): 5 guys chase Annie, GOOOOOOD, GET A TOWER WHILE THEY DO THAT!\n\n\nGame finished after we get aced again because some noobs chased another kill into a no vision area. End of game chat screen comes up and everyone abuses me because they are noobs. Lose 8 games in a row because kiddies play at weekends. Nearly lose 9 games in a row, but miraculously in the 9th game after the mid lane \"Annie\" goes 0-20, they finally start to implement some of the ideas that I'm talking about. e.g. \"Don't keep building damage when Diana is wrecking you, try an abyssal scepter!\". Basic gameplay strategy. Opposition throw, we win. End of game screen our jungler says \"I dunno how we won that game\".\n\n\nSummary: OCE kids have hardly any basic strategy whatsoever, and don't admit when they are wrong. Always find an excuse to justify their fuckups but never take responsibility for them. \"I have lag\" \"WTF I thought my Q was up!\" \"1 more second he was dead\" - even though they just chased halfway across the map and even if they got the kill, they were dead. In the meantime they lost 30cs and two towers doing it.\n\n======================================\n\n\nTLDR; what the Kalista in the OPs game said could be absolutely right, but they could have offered constructive ideas to **HELP** the Annie, not just abuse them. However the Annie would probably just ignore the ideas and do the same thing unless a miracle happened. OCE lol in a nutshell. Give me Korean bronze league anyday, i'm sick of noobs with no gameplay skills.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-27T23:25:20.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, please with your last section of your comment, i think is absolutely wrong, on so many levels, yea Kalista did tell annie to get a zyonha's, but annie couldn't have done a single thing, couldn't farm, couldn't do anything, so buy the time she did get zyonhas, zed was to point where he need like 4 people to kill him, the annie didn't ignore him, but he still continued to give annie crap, for something she couldn't do because she got so far behind, so to go on, if you are sick of bronze league with no gameplay skill, then don't play ranked, and congrats on getting out of bronze, you are in sliver 5 with 0 lp and a 37% win ratio in ranked, good job ! i don't think you have the right to say you are sick of other people being bad at this game, when you have a 37% win ratio, you have good kda's no doubt there, but if you are consistently losing because of other team mates, how about you roam and help them, instead of complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-02-28T22:46:18.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PROJECT CDogz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=riXkjmbb,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-02-27T23:25:20.004+0000)\n>\n> Bro, please with your last section of your comment, i think is absolutely wrong, on so many levels\n\nPlease explain?

And my free speech says that OCE players in general are VERY BAD at this game. Even in the games i win, people have no idea of WAR STRATEGY. It's like the game is a lottery.

I said \"**...they could have offered constructive ideas to HELP the Annie, not just abuse them.**\"\n\nOk i'll explain, you can't simply come on to forums, and complain about people being bad at the game, it just like when i play yas, im horrible at him but still no one lifts a lift to help me understand why im bad at him and how i can improve, i was bloody told to kill myself because i went 1/9/7 as yas. But back to the original comment, \"No, don't carry on like a pork chop\" what is this suppose to imply ???, the fact that you out right said that everyone in bronze is just horrible at this game, well mate from what i have been told sliver is just the same expect people ward and such, and we did, she did listen but it to much into late game for it to have an effect on the game as it was.\n\n>\"But there's nothing annie could do!!!!!!!!\" BULLSHIT.\n\nIt was true though, as i just said it was to late into the game for it have an impact on the outcome of the game. Plus don't edit the quote, goes to prove that you are more of a lying low life.\n\n>Don't play ranked? Because people are noobs? How about people improve instead. And btw I wasn't in bronze.\n\nWell yea, it's clear to say that you are almost outright salty because you are solely complaining about how bad people in bronze are, but not once have you mentioned that you have tried to help others out, but to be completely honest, focus on your own game then you won't have to care about how others are playing and if you see someone getting fed, you can just easily go and kill them with your team. So if you are straight out in silver, then how come you get paired with people from bronze ? That doesn't make much sense to be honest, besides your attitude towards other players is exactly why i thought you were in bronze, no offence.\n\n>I do have the right to free speech actually thank you very much.

It can be a lot of things that people can improve on. I also don't think it acceptable for you to say that this game is like a lottery, because if it was, winning lotto would be easy as fuck, but it's not, that is down to true chance. League is not a game of chance, it a team game where if you work together to achieve victory then you will straight up work better as a team hands down and improve your chances of winning. And what's Sun Tzu's Book? , never heard of it before. \n\nOne last question, If you think that other people need to improve on their game and they have no knowledge of 'war tactics', then what makes you say, that your so good ?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-03-01T10:02:10.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Not carrying on like a pork chop = don't talk about irrelevant things. Stick to the topic.\n\n2. I'm not editing quotes, i'm shortening the jist of the argument. Don't talk semantics, again stick to the topic. The point is even if Annie is 0-20, she can still do something for her team. The game is not over. And if Kalista was nice, she could give Annie some constructive ideas to help her situation. That's the point.\n\n3. Assuming i'm salty? Focus on your own game? This whole paragraph is a load of babble. We are not talking about me.\n\n4. \"Yea while you do, you don't have a right to say almost anything you said in your original post because you striaght outright said that others need to improve yes ?\" \n\nThe point of this discussion is not to make a point that the person who says the last thing wins the argument and get a bunch of brownie points.

I just said it, you can't take it back. I don't need to be good to say that.  I don't need to be challenger to say that. I could be WOOD 5 division and still what I just said is true. I could be toxic. I could be a retard. I could be god. It does not matter. \n\nThey could start by reading Sun Tzu's book. Or watching youtube. **OR ACCEPTING IDEAS FROM OTHER PLAYERS IN THEIR TEAM INSTEAD OF DOING THE SAME STUPID FEEDING STUFF OVER AND OVER LIKE AN IMBECILE AND NOT HELPING THEIR TEAM**. Granted, Kalista did not do this. But in some games, other players will offer advice, and they should take it, not disregard it because they have a bronze ego.\n\nWhen CLG thought they were a good team in NA, their new coach (Montecristo, fyi) came in and told them they were bunch of noobs compared to Koreans. Why? Because they had little macro understanding of simple gameplay. He made them read this book of Sun Tzu's. It was written before electricity was invented, but the principles are the same.\nWhy are Korean's so good? Because they understand simple war strategy. 5 pebbles vs 5 pebbles on summoners rift, and all you can buy are four items, dorans blade or ring, and cloth armour, null magic mantle. Who wins the game? At the moment, Koreans win the game. How would you play the game if you were Annie and you were 0-2 against Zed early on in game? Change the items, change the champions, it doesn't make a shred of difference. What you do in terms of STRATEGY impacts the most on the game.\n\nAnnie could look up youtube \"how to play when behind - 30 tips\". There are many videos on this topic. Very helpful. If all players under platinum in OCE watched that video, the level of skill in the region would be far greater.\n\nLastly I did not say that i'm \"so good\"? Where do you get these assumptions from?\n\nI'm finished talking on this subject. Players with a brain won't bother to read the babble, they will just take the points of the argument and implement them in their own gameplay. Have a good day.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-03-01T10:58:38.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok cool, i'm glad we are done with this, because i was getting to the point where reading your bunch of bull shit was giving me a headache, have a nice day too :)","replies":[{"poster":"Munterizer","date":"2016-03-02T10:55:22.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PROJECT CDogz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=riXkjmbb,comment-id=000400000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-03-01T10:58:38.381+0000)\n>\n> Ok cool, i'm glad we are done with this, because i was getting to the point where reading your bunch of bull shit was giving me a headache, have a nice day too :)\n\nLOL you must be a bronze, the guy explained it in detail and because you couldn't win the argument, you just write that.

Rudely pointing them out consistently when it's not warranted in an abusive manner is being toxic.\n\nAlso, Kalista quotes you multiple times but your lines don't show up in your post, which seems like you've tried to take out where you've been extra abusive (although he could just be pulling stuff out of his anal region). All in all, Kalista was clearly toxic, Annie was a little rude in response but I wouldn't call it toxic, and from the lines you've showed you didn't respond the way you should have (by Riot's standards) but you weren't exactly toxic either.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-25T09:26:48.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kylar Alice,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=riXkjmbb,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-02-25T03:41:27.833+0000)\n\n> Kalista quotes you multiple times but your lines don't show up in your post\n\nThis is probably because it was never said, again this a post game chat after, yes stuff was said in game but never had anything to record it","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-25T09:57:45.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PROJECT CDogz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=riXkjmbb,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-02-25T09:26:48.625+0000)\n>\n> This is probably because it was never said, again this a post game chat after, yes stuff was said in game but never had anything to record it\n\nAh, I thought this was during the game, which raised many questions lol.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-26T04:38:33.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, allg bro :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-18T00:30:30.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gotta remove those summoner names friend.
