I mainly wanna gain new experience outta this so im down to learn anything. \r\nMainly play Top - Illaoi, Kayle, (looking for a 3rd top atm seems to be like Warwick might move on to renekton or a tank)\r\nSecondary Role - can almost play anything, i&#039;ll need to brush up a bit on support if thats the role im gonna play. \r\nIGN is the same as this one. Looking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nPS. Im already apart of one team, however sometimes we don&#039;t play every night, so in those nights i would like to be apart of a different team gaining experience there. I have TS3, Discord and Skype.\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[]}
