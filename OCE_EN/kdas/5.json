But it's important to note that his autos scale off both crit and attack speed. The more crit you build, the more mobility you get off your autoattacks (since if you proc a crit, you get a short speed buff). Attack speed increases the strength of that speed buff, and also contributes some damage to his autos. \n\nI think he'll be fine if you build him with the standard crit build, but let us know if you find anything more potent ;)","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-02T00:40:19.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what i have been doing, building IE, Lord Dominks, 2 PD's, Statikk, and attack speed boots = 100% crit with 90% move speed from the passive on every hit, and 1k crit dmg, but it still doesn't feel right because it takes so long to get the build done :/ i'll keep going with it for now, i'm currently rank 3 atm\n\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-02T03:15:54.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PROJECT CDogz,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=UdIbIXdI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-02T00:40:19.444+0000)\n>\n> That's what i have been doing, building IE, Lord Dominks, 2 PD's, Statikk, and attack speed boots = 100% crit with 90% move speed from the passive on every hit, and 1k crit dmg, but it still doesn't feel right because it takes so long to get the build done :/ i'll keep going with it for now, i'm currently rank 3 atm\n> \n> Thanks :)\n\nI'm not sure if you meant in that order, but Last Whisper and its further items aren't worth it unless they have a ton of armour or healing. Also 2 Phantom Dancers is really gold inefficient, take Rapidfire Cannon or some other AD item like Bloodthirster or Essence Reaver.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-02T04:28:01.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i thought about the build, so i changed my build to, IE, BT, ER, PD x2, RFC, so yea i haven't tried it yet but hopefully it would work :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dextr0us","date":"2016-02-02T05:43:14.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont need the two pd's honestly man. from what I learnt on pbe - Essence Reaver, Ionian Boots, Rapidfire cannon, IE, BT if they're squishy, Lord dominiks if they're building armour. you'll get both anyway and then grab GA or even merc scim.\nWith 40% cdr you'll always have consistent DPS even when you're reloading and being able to throw his Q and snare out constantly in fights especially seeing as allies can mark for you, it's crucial on him","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-02-03T07:52:33.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin is the AD version of Xerath","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-02T07:17:47.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IE IE IE IE IE BT\n\naa give perma speed boost, sustain, massive massive massive damage and if you get a supp like janna... especially with a {{item:3504}}  and {{item:3050}} even more fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"frickenate","date":"2016-02-02T06:29:33.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You absolutely need the Essence Reaver for the 30% total CDR with the crit chance items - the spammable Q is a must. You also want the 100% crit chance build to get the max 40% AD boost and massive movement speed boost on hit. I've been doing Rapid Firecannon, Essence Reaver, Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer. Experimenting with BORK or BloodThirster 5th item, not sure what else to replace it with at the moment. Maybe a Last Whisper upgrade, or Youmuu's Ghostblade for the final 10% CDR and armor pen? Death's Dance a possibility if you have a decent shielder/healer on your team.\n\nI've been filling 6th slot with Swiftness boots (Alacrity if behind, Furor if snowballing), as this bastard is way too slow and squishy in team fights not to build it. The guaranteed movement speed on hit with the 100% crit chance build is great, but there are times where you need to run in / run away without being in range of an auto attack.\n\nBecause he's so squishy, I'm curious how the general build will evolve to include some health and/or resistances. There's not much room for such items though if you want to get the bonus AD from crit chance and attack speed. If your team is falling behind, building health/armor/mr is going to severely affect your damage output more than other AD champs.","replies":[]}]}
