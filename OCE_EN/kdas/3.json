Let me explain myself as to why i build this on illaoi\n\n{{item:3812}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3006}} \n\nAnd now you are probably thinking that i&#039;m even dumber for buying an item to which the champ has no AP scaling abilities at all\n\nSo let me explain..\n\nSee with the current build it&#039;s the standard {{item:3071}} {{item:3748}} then tank items,\nand as most of you know that Illaoi&#039;s Q heals for 5% of her missing health IF it hits an enemy champ\nSo i just thought i wonder how good spell vamp Illaoi would be ?\nSo for one game i built these items and i have never looked back\n\nNow i know some people don&#039;t like math so let me sum it up for those people\n\nBasically with Death&#039;s Dance, Hextech and Spirit Visage passive&#039;s you get a massive amount of healing from a single q now, instead of getting that weak shit 5% if it hits a champ,\nheal from what ever now and now receive around 400 - 500 per minion in a single q\n\nbut here is the math\n\nLets say i have 2100 HP as my max health and am currently sitting on lets say 500 HP\nand because i have all the items built lets say i do 870 dmg to minions with q\n\nWith the 15% ( +33% of that healing because of AOE )  from Death&#039;s Dance and Hextech Gunblade, this would mean off of 870 dmg  p/m  15% ( 130.5 ) + 33% ( 43.065 ) = 173.565 plus a bonus 20% on top of that because of Spirit Visage's passive, so 173.565 + 20% \n( 34.713 ) = 208.278 in healing just from Death&#039;s Dance, this is would then be doubled because the same effect occurs on Hextech Gunblade therefore is would be 173.565 x 2 \n( 347.13 ) + 20% ( 69.426 ) = 416.556.\nIn one single Q on illaoi, you would heal 416.556 health without her passive on her q and this is applied per minion, because it stacks if you hit 8 minions in a single q ( which is possible as shown in the video ), healing  up to 1000 - 1500 HP ( i did 416.556 x 8 on the calculator and i got 3,332.448, never once have i ever been healed for that amount hense why im saying you can only heal between 1000 - 1500 HP because it is the highest i have seen/recorded at )\n\nNow apply that healing  to her W, E and her Ult. If you were to land a 5 man ult and then continue to fight them you would be granted around 1600 Healing because the passive on illaoi's q give 5% bonus healing for each champ hit,  but the point is that you would be almost be able to heal yourself to max health with 2 rounds of tentacle slaps when you ult.\n\nNow i challenge you to try this build out for fun :D\n\nNo runes or mastery changes are needed but if you tried this and did enjoy it\nand wanna try it with all runes and shit, there are two variations to these runes and masteries\n\nfor Runes you want \n\nSet 1 :\n\n- Attack Damage Marks\n- Armour Per Level Seals\n- Magic Resist Per Level Glyphs \n- Spell Vamp Quints\n\nSet 2 :\n- Attack Damage Marks\n- Armour Per Level Seals\n- Attack Speed Glyphs\n- Spell Vamp Quints\n\nand run 12 - 18 - 0  taking thunderlords as your keystone\nor run 18 - 12 - 0 taking Fevour as your keystone\n\nAlso if you get super fed from your enemies and already have the full build and still want to change some items around\n\nthen sell {{item:3071}} {{item:3006}}  and get {{item:3033}} {{item:3046}} / another attack speed item, preferable is phatom dance because it grants movespeed, crit change, and a big attack speed bonus\n\nReason to why you would get Mortal reminder instead of Lord Dominik's Regards, is because with the full build you have 3K HP, and the change of getting an enemy with less HP then that is pretty slim. \n\nI am willing to prove this via a youtube video if people would prefer it to be seen as proof\nif so i will use instances in a norms match, but only by request\n\nEDIT 1 :\n\n- Math has been changed after being explained that the passive's from death's dance do 15% + 33% of that healing, instead of a flat 33%\n\n- An extra set of runes and masteries has been added\n\n- Added what happens if you get super fed, and want to change items\n\n- General grammer checking\n\nEDIT 2 : Here is the link for the Video : https://youtu.be/jFIE69pXKog\n\nFew things to note :\n\n- I'm not very good at making videos like this, so forgive me for my bad video editing skills\n\n- It's short, plus i tried hard to prolong the norms games so i could get full build, but the game would end before i could, so i VS'ed Bots just so i could quickly get a full build to show you guys, sorry bout that :)\n\n- The quality of the video isn't all that good either, so sorry about it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-02-12T10:38:50.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rofl you're gonna get absolutely blown up with that build","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-12T13:08:53.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"against some enemies yea you do :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-09T08:00:23.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"funny... actually 0% spellvamp in that build XD\n\nyour math is also dodgy as hell.\n\nYou arent healing for 33% of the damage dealt with q, you heal 11% + the tiny (0.022) bit from visage 11.022% isn't actually that much fyi.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-10T06:07:58.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the math ain't dodgy, read the passives then come back to me","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-10T07:09:58.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have... not sure you have...

The 2 hardest matchups for sure in my experience when these two champs are on the same team, this build is just pointless, and those champs are Shen and Rammus, with the two taunts and the high amount of damage from shen's new kit you will receive a heap of damage without you being able to do anything because of their two taunts.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-02-09T09:10:42.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no offence but that's such a retarded build illao has no problem with dmg even full tank sorry mate but no that is such a bad build\n\nI am all for breaking the meta but that build is just dumb imo","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-10T06:16:20.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are all for breaking the meta, here is a good place to start","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T08:40:36.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the name of fun this build sounds fantastic.
