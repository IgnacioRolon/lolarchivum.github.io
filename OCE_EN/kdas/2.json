BUT .... it is only a problem if there about three or four of them with CC, which in today's games are fairly normal. Illaoi beats any melee top except for Riven. She is the only melee top that can beat Illaoi due to her high mobility. This is just how i have seen things over the time i have played illaoi, i recently hit 100K with her. \n\nI also wanna add that Illaoi doesn't counter Shen at all.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-20T13:37:32.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A heavy split pusher does counter shen to an extent.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-06-20T13:41:20.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To an extent, but its not noticed until its 25 min + especially with Illaoi, she can't really do much til 6 its like Swain he is not good until 6","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-21T01:46:23.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze 3, great.

Like say daruis, a daruis who is fed CAN BE unstoppable. It totally depends on TEAM COMPS and what the enemies do, do they relize your carry and respect your damage or not.\n\nThe main reason illaoi is considered junk is because she doesn't do what a top laner does, either peels carries or dives enemies back line. Illaoi against a good team cannot do either, she has no cc, and she cannot dive carries as the enemies will peel her off or just push her away with some cc.","replies":[{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-06-23T13:09:29.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The main reason illaoi is considered junk is because she doesn't do what a top laner does\"\n\nBut see that's the best thing about her, her top lane ways, are really different and it's fuckin beautiful. Standard top laners these days are tank/engage/etc, for me that kind of play style is not something i like, i enjoy fighting 2v1's and coming out victor. And because it's bronze, since some jg's just like farming and not actually helping, i have to sometimes do fights myself. With Illaoi i can do this, and it's great, i wish there were more champs like illaoi to bring in new styles for lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-06-24T08:59:26.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats fine and i totally agree.
