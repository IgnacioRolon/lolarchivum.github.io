He was sent this by a friend and thought that it was a legit sight. Upon arriving at the site it asks for your username, password and what skin you would like and obviously one of the skins they were offering was Pax Tf and at that point i knew it was fake. For all you people that think these sites are real please think again. Pax tf is a rare skin and i doubt anybody would hand it out in a giveaway so please be cautious","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-23T08:19:14.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"yolasite\" didn't give it away?
