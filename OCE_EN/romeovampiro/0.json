It is in defeat/victory screen, hit continue as fast as you can and proceed to exit the game as quickly as you can (I just close my laptop). When I open the game up next time, apparently I was an AFK/leaver and get the 5min delays, I play another game, same deal game ends, I exit it and close my laptop. I get a leavebuster AGAIN?? This time its on the 10min leavebuster. I submitted bug report both times, but my account still flagged as AFK.\r\n\r\nSo I actually had one AFK game after those, where I left for 5 mins due to a spider crawling into the bed and the GF screaming. I come back afterwards and my team is winning, and not even mad as I told them I had to AFK (and im support)... etc. We play out the whole game narrowly losing, but everyone was chill I even got a commendation. But then leavebuster again and its 20min for 5 games because it counted the last 2 bugs as me AFKing!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve reported this bug 4 times now. I keep getting punished for closing my laptop lid, like are you serious riot? \r\n\r\nTo not get leavebusted, I now have to click continue, skip the voting phase, then click &#039;play again&#039; then I exit queue, and exit game. I&#039;m not sure if last patch fixed it, but I really dont feel like testing it and getting hit with another 20min x 5 leavebuster punishment because your goddamn client cant tell that the game was completed.\r\n\r\nAnyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-21T00:50:06.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me (on a different account)\n\nI would think that you (or those affected) who have had AFK behaviours in the past are being flagged, regardless of how long ago, and due to this, the system isn't taking any 'chances' (if it can xd).\n\nSO in short, you will always revert to this 20 lpq, cause you in the beginning had terrible AFK behaviours.\nThere is no changing this, unless, you make a shiny new account.","replies":[{"poster":"RomeoVampiro","date":"2018-10-21T03:06:20.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SamoanHunter,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=F5tXiHxx,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-10-21T00:50:06.699+0000)\n>\n> Same thing happened to me (on a different account)\n> \n> I would think that you (or those affected) who have had AFK behaviours in the past are being flagged, regardless of how long ago, and due to this, the system isn&#x27;t taking any &#x27;chances&#x27; (if it can xd).\n> \n> SO in short, you will always revert to this 20 lpq, cause you in the beginning had terrible AFK behaviours.\n> There is no changing this, unless, you make a shiny new account.\n\nThe 1st 2 client exits (no afk) triggered a 5 and 10 min penalty though thats the problem. I probably shouldnt have mentioned the 1 afk because it looks like everyone is just confused... 2 client exits triggered leavebuster, when it shouldnt have, aka bug.","replies":[{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-21T07:38:07.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the client exits can look like a dodge, regardless of it being a bug, it'll look like a dodge twice in a row.\n\nYou should have gotten a dodge timer (5 minutes long, only occurs once instead of the 5 LPQs).\n\nI don't know about it further beyond, but that's just unlucky.\n\nIt doesn't look like a bug on their side, but if your client has closed on its own, then obviously that needs to be reported.\n\nAs Seras Dragon has mentioned, you should send in a Bug Report, so that Riot can resolve it.
