I&#039;m just wondering if there are any other champions like him and that aren&#039;t ranged. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-18T05:42:01.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are looking for similar champs to Rammus I wouldn't necessarily Jump to Lee Sin. His play-style relies a lot more on mechanical mastery than Rammus, so it may be hard to adapt to. However, Champions like {{champion:223}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:36}} function very similarly and have High DPS for a tank champion. Build paths can be very similar too (along with runes/masteries!) \n\n{{champion:154}} is another champ I'd recommend learning. He's a tank that's versatile enough to fit some good damage builds when snowballing. Also ridiculously fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dream","date":"2016-03-17T22:53:12.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming you are playing jungle? In my opinion Lee sin is the best champion ever to learn, he teaches you a bit of everything skill shots/decision making etc. and can be really strong in the right hands, he also never gets boring in my opinion because he is a champion that has endless possiblity","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheeRash","date":"2016-03-17T14:25:57.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nautilus is good, same with Malphite, Zac and Shen.\n\nShen becomes virtually unkillable if u can lane properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-15T06:55:59.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:111}} . So tanky, so much cc, can do lots of damage without giving away too much tankiness with a ROA in his build.\n\nCheck out some general [Naut builds here](http://probuilds.net/champions/details/Nautilus) or [here](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/nautilus-93).\n\nHe is also a super great choice because you can play him top, mid, support and jungle and destroy people no matter what :D\n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[{"poster":"monkey troll","date":"2016-03-15T23:01:46.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Staldy","date":"2016-03-15T12:24:57.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite.
