Why are they nerfing the lowest winrate champion?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the title says, I&#039;m wondering why they are nerfing Azir again? Hes currently the lowest winrate champion at 44.7%. Compared with a ridiculous number of other champions he just feels flat. Ive played 100-200 games of azir over 3-4 years and he just feels really underpowered compared with other champions and other seasons. I&#039;m honestly just curious as to the thinking behind it.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-19T11:42:46.328+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir has a low win rate because he is so difficult to play.\nThose who main him have a very high win rate on him, while people who try him out have like a 20% win rate _(estimate numbers)_.\nAnd because there are very few true Azir players, his win rate is fairly low because it is brought down by people just trying him out.\n\nThere are many factors behind win rates, they aren't aways a true representation of how strong a champion is. especially with low pickrate champs like Azir.\n\nIve mained Azir since he was released, and even at the deepest of his low points, I still had a 70% win rate on him.  So imo he's never been too weak to play _(or even weak at all)_.","replies":[]}]}
