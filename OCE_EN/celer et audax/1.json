It seems I math better how than you.\n\nAnd considering Riot marketed Azir as a middle laner upon release, I'd say he's not designed to be in the jungle.\n\nBut no. I'm sure taking a champ into the jungle means that they are a jungler, wait there while I go Soraka jungle, or maybe Veigar jungle... or maybe even LUX JUNGLE! OMG YES!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
