This means players who are chat restricted will only be able to interact with their teams through gameplay, pings, and very limited messaging opportunities.\r\n\r\nHow does the system work?\r\n\r\nChat restrictions take multiple reports over a series of games into account. Players with normal behaviour will never be affected, and there are a number of protections in place that sort out false reports, premade abuse, and other potential issues.\r\n\r\nIf a player is continuously displaying negative behaviour they will then receive chat restrictions on that account.\r\n\r\n^^^^\r\n\r\nWild. But you guys don&#039;t do that anymore, you just ban players, good stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-24T07:03:13.423+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm...

If you think this is going to help anything, it's just going to create vindictive players and more accounts. This literally won't change anything, and I can guarantee a lot of players will be making accounts to grief your ass more. You talk about how it's toxic to talk trash, but then look at you on the forums, you are one of the most hypocritical players I have ever seen. You are toxic to others you deem \"toxic\" rather than taking that almighty high road you pretend to drive on. The glory days of toxic behavior will be around forever. Your report will be worth less and less with the automated system, and you're just going to get more toxic players in your games and cry on the forums until rito does another ban wave. Your vindictive little posts filled with baby rage at the fact you're hardstuck is sad. \n\n**Get good, or get out.**\n\nPeace.\n\nSide note; constantly complaining won't help you climb. I climbed from b5 to p4 this season. Don't blame shit on smurfs, you're bad at the game, but feel like you're higher elo because you do well some games, the more you whine the less you climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-24T22:28:10.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's all you can attack. my rank. nothing else. \n\ni maybe silver 4, i maybe hard stuck.\nbut at least i'll do it with no punishments on my account.","replies":[{"poster":"Brutemonkey","date":"2017-09-25T07:35:14.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even attacking your rank, just pointing out you're vindictive and toxic as well.
