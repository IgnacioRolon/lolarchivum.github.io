I know its not my internet or windows because they are working fine, and thanks to the constant game crashing i have lost a bunch of lp and have let my team mates down and cost them their games, I thought i would have atleast got one of those loss prevented things but instead I get 5 low priority matchmade queues. This is very unfair since your servers or client or whatever it is are the ones that prevented me from doing anything and just really screwed me over.
