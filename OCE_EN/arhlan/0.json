This week&#039;s mode (and I assume next week&#039;s) to me is super awful. It&#039;s ARURF without the fun part. I would prefer not to see this game mode again if a majority of others in the community agree. If they don&#039;t, so be it. But please, start asking players what they want, because to me this is not it.","replies":[]}
