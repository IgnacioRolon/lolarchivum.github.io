Before you claim it wasn't.. I got ban for saying to someone \" You said KYS wtf is wrong with you. You cannot say KYS\"\r\n\r\nFunny part about this was.. When I emailed support I was told \" You were neg. Ban stands \" so after this I left for a bit.\r\nSo today I was thinking I wouldn't mind playing this game. But after checking the forums, I am left thinking this game is dead in the water. \r\nPlayer behavior last post was 6 days ago.\r\n\r\nGameplay and strat has one post on the first page almost 6 months ago and so on. \r\nAll I can say to this is \" WAHAHAHAHA \" I am glad league is dead in the water. They did it to them selfs. Banning someone is not the only way to deal with things you greedy fukers. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2019-05-01T10:02:20.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Phantiks once said (in 2016) that the game will last 5 more years in OCE. Since that time let's think about what has and hasn't changed.\n\nDynamic queue fallout is still present - some players climbed without improving their skills and are hanging onto their inflated ranks.\nGame changes over the past 3-4 years have favoured faster gameplay and newbies, so overall player skill has decreased in OCE while playerbase numbers are up.\nMatchmaking is exactly the same as before, and the recent addition of two new tiers was introduced without changing the matchmaking model.\nPlayers are being banned more for what appears to be typing words than actual griefing and ruining games by trolling.\nThe banning system in place relies on AI pruning and player reports, not proactive overseeing of rules.\nCompetitive souls looking to start and compete with their own teams, staff and brand are forbidden to do so.\nThe OPL is now a closed model, with the same faces running things.\nBudget has been cut back in OCE, no more Ocean Week, no more OPL finals with crowds.\nCommunity has been left to outsiders (such as Summoner's Society), who do their best, but without a paid model, its all volunteer stuff.\nBecause of a number of factors (terrible matchmaking, no incentive (e.g. challenger jackets, LUL), no competition at the top end in the OPL) pro players rarely practice in scrims or play soloqueue these days, especially outside of competition time.\nOPL salaries are peanuts, so pro players do not make this a fulltime career job and end up retiring early.\n\nYou can see the fallout from the above factors in the first game at MSI: idiot drafting, no crossmap awareness, macro skills below that of an NA academy team, rusty players.\n\nSo yeah OCE is pretty dead, except for casuals. Makes sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"uNhoLeee","date":"2019-05-01T14:34:49.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure why they are banning players, oce region is practically ded. 100,000 ranked players. lma0ce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2019-05-01T10:39:00.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the players banned that are being banned, its not hard not to get banned. You can rage as much as me and still have max honor, you've only got yourself to blame. Its not dead, you can get a game within 7 mins in draft, ranked, blind and aram any time of day, the flex ranked is the only one that might not pop. Becides Dota 2 you won't find a 'less dead' moba. I mean even Paladins you can't even get a pvp match. I've been playing obsessively since 2014 and besides it being toxic its still a great game, a different plot every time which is what makes it so re-playable, and you won't go against the same group of champs every game cause they have like 140. So besides people crying about bans that they deserved, and the constant rage for people making mistakes its a good game. I wouldn't say its fun, its say its stressful problem solving with some mechanical skill, that looks total awesome. So in true OCE passion please rage at me and tell me why you shouldn't have been banned for telling someone to go kill them selfs, and all the chat leading up to it and after, and how it the lobby after you isulted there mother, and all the other matches you weren't nice so the reports racked up, I guess that just how some people deal with presure in life. They crumble into being the victim of life, instead of owning there own stuff. To be honest, at least they haven't added an auto coms like dota 2, and they really need a mute all button, instead of going to the hard effort of clicking on every player to mute them. I guess if you can't handle stress go play a dating sim or something you win every time is those games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bacard√¨","date":"2019-04-30T02:34:00.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so true fuck riots banning system","replies":[]}]}
