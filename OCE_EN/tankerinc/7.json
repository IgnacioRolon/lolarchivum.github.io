The top two reasons they would be giving you a perm ban is either you continued to be toxic. Judging by the way you speak in your post I'm guessing that's the reason.\n\nOR...\n\nYou've used third party program. Can you perhaps give more details as to what you've done in the past 3 days, weeks or months on LoL?","replies":[{"poster":"TankerInc","date":"2016-05-21T02:18:14.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay. So you are allow to be passive toxic.. Just to make a point about being toxic.. ironic... { See what i did there? }\n\nNo I did not use hacks /3rd party crap on this account. EVER.\nAs for the \" Toxic \"\n\nNo. I wasn't, I would mute everyone in a game soon as I went in. But if you are trying to say with your passive toxic thatI am pissed off right now.\nI AM.. Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-05-21T05:59:21.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"SUCK A FINGER!  lol!\n\nENJOY UR BAN! \n\nGO PLAY DOTA 2 toxic troll/cheater!","replies":[{"poster":"TankerInc","date":"2016-05-23T06:15:37.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".....\nTrolls are real.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-05-21T02:33:07.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They send out an email with the reasons you were banned.
