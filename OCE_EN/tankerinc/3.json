From this time I have seen a lot changes nerfs and just flat out bad things to do to a champion.\r\nBut what has really gotten to me this time is the nerf yet again to illaoi in 6.9\r\n\r\nFrom my time playing this game I have played many champions and during this time I have enjoyed some of them enough to main them.\r\nLike Shaco.. Until we got told. Shaco&#039;s Deceive distance to far and we are making as small as flash now. \r\nThat to me killed shaco and what he could really do when going in and out of a fight. \r\n\r\nSo I stopped playing him. Then I played Hec.. Then same thing happen.. Nerfed to the point he was useless in a team fight...\r\nThen Daruis.. Changed so much he became useless again.. Then buffed then useless then buffed then I stop playing him all together..\r\nKha&#039;zix was the next in line I played.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed his combat style.. It was like Shaco. So I was happy. Until &quot; Change is what Kha&#039;zix should be about. We feel players only have one option for Kha&#039;zix and that is Void Spikes. &quot; \r\nWhat about now? He only has one option.. CLAWS.. You get claws first no matter what.. Same happen with spikes before you nerfed them... What about this &quot; Change &quot; you were talking about with Kha&#039;zix?\r\n\r\nIt is claws first no matter what.. \r\n\r\nNow.. You take away my illaoi. You nerfed her so bad.. I dont even want to play her anymore. Her damage is dead.. Her cool downs are higher.\r\n\r\nWHY? She was not OP. When she could solo a 5 man team she was.. But you had her right. Strong but weak at the same time. NOW SHE IS JUST TRASH!!\r\n\r\nXin is OP.. TRYN IS OP.. BRAND AND HIS AOE IS OP { I know you know that from PBE } but yet you nerf her..\r\nTeemo gets buffed. Xin can still 3 shot people. Vald is just Nas now. Q FARM ALL DAY. Everything else cost is to BS..\r\n\r\nZiggs.. Mana for ziggs is still insane. If you caste 3 spells you are out of mana. Clear a wave.. OOM.\r\nI asked a D1 player I watch on twitch to do a Ziggs for me. So I can see a higher level player play one of my MOST BELOVED CHAMPIONS...\r\n\r\nHe said and I quote &quot; Wow.. Ziggs mana cost vs the damage. Is to high and you are better off playing Lux &quot; \r\n\r\nBut yet you do nothing about that.. But you nerf ILLAOI..\r\nWHY DID YOU NERF HER. TELL ME WHAT WAS SO OP ABOUT HER YOU MAKE HER USELESS NOW!!!\r\n\r\nPatches like this to champions I play.. That are not as OP OR BROKEN LIKE OTHERS.. Makes me leave this game like all the other times.\r\nWhy dont you nerf teemo instead of buffing. Why dont you nerf Xin.. Instead of buffing. Why dont you NERF TRYN.. Instead of buffing?\r\n\r\nXin and Tryn are OP AS ANYTHING WITH THE NEW JUNGLER ITEM.","replies":[{"poster":"619","date":"2016-05-05T06:16:35.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Complains about Xin and Trynd.

If anything his new E is a buff, it allows for 12 seconds of completely oppressive play every time you land it. You can't counter this in any way, regardless of destroying tentacles or respawning. Basically you can zone the shit out of your opponent during this 15 seconds, which is awfully long. By the time it's finished you should soon be able to use it again, so you basically can perma zone them if you have good skill shot accuracy/predictions.\n\nIllaoi is absurdly strong in Bronze-Silver if you aren't brain dead imo. You can 1v2 the jungler and your opponent laner if you land an ult on both 99% of the time as long as you smash w. In lane you are an oppressive brute who can zone the enemy laner from farm with your e, get punished if you miss and heal it back with your Q or W. Once you get a kill you basically snowball like crazy with your E and low cd W, and can 1v2 the jungler and top if you get ganked. Where in the hell do you think Illaoi needs a buff? You're probably maxing Q, and you come here crying saying \"it's the champions fault\" when you just aren't playing to his strength and think you can play him like you'd play Riven.\n\nEdit: And no, Brand is NOT op.

I have copy and paste it for you.\n\nFACT: Overlapping tentacles deal 50% reduced damage. Affects active placed tentacles by her passive and Q as well.\n\nFor example, a tentacle deals 500 damage to a unit. Two tentacles damaging the same unit would then deal 750 and three tentacles would then deal 875 damage to that same unit. Either this is a bug that Riot has overlooked for some time or a tool tip that needs to be stated somewhere in her kit preferably in her passive.

Go test it before showing numbers.\n\n\nYes it did.\n\nQuote for you to make it easier. Quoted from thresholden.\n\nOkay, with the help of /u/ImOnTheBattlefield I set up 2 tentacles in mid lane. No AD runes or masteries on Illaoi. Used W to command attack for 101 damage from the two tentacles. 61 from empowered W auto.\nHe was playing Ahri. No armor or defensive masteries. 20.9 armor at level 1.\nTentacles deal 1.2 total AD at rank 0/1 + 10 per champion level so:\n60*1.2+10= 82 per tentacle *2 = 164\n100/120.9 = 0.827 damage reduction from Ahri's armor.\n164* 0.827 = 135.649\n50% damage reduction on the second tentacle hit translates to 75% damage reduction overall.\n135.649* .75 = 101.736\nSeems like the original poster is correct. Each additional tentacle does seem deal less damage. This is not stated in the tooltip or wiki and it may be by design. If so, then Riot ought to update the tooltip. If its a bug then fixing it would be a huge huge buff for Illaoi.\nPlease reproduce in case I'm wrong, I definitely could have messed up somewhere.\n\nSince this might be a little hard for you to understand I will find a easier one for you.\n\nQuoted from echnolians\n\n\" just did a test with no runes/masteries\n\nlvl 1 Illaoi vs lvl 2 Udyr\n\nIllaoi: 60AD\n\nUdyr: 665 HP, with 28 armor and 22% damage reduction\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n1 Tentacle deals [10+72] damage, W did [15+66] damage.\n\nThis should of resulted with 127 damage. When tested, and it did indeed put his health down to 538.\n\nWhen we tested with 2 tentacles and W, it should have been 474 remaining HP. However, the result was 506hp. The 2nd tentacle did 50% damage. \"\n\nWith both of them.. You should be able to work it out. If not. TRY IT YOUR SELF TO SEE.\n\nQ = 110\nTentacles =  (+ 120 / 130 / 140 / 150 / 160% AD) So if we work out 120% of 110. That means one tentacle will be \n\nWait for the drum roll\n\n\n132 pre hit.\n\n\nNow go to red buff. Put the tentacle on the walls around the entence to red buff. Along the wall to the bottom of red buff. \n\nAlong the wall to the other side of red buff. Now you should be able to hit someone with about 5 or so tentacles.\n\nThen you will see.\n\nHeck message me in game.
