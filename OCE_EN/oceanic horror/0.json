As far as computers are concerned, he was looking at a string of characters that look like this \"['][']t['][']ranny\" (switch \"[']\" with \"*\") which it meant nothing to the computer because to him it looks nothing like the other filtered word he should be watching out for.\n\nIf you instead try to filter out every single possible spelling variation, shortening, and otherwise creative representation and association of a word, the list is simply impossible to be made and managed not to mention many otherwise non-hostile words will also be blocked too. So that's really a no-go.\n\nBut then again, most of the responsibility of not using obviously derogatory terms lie in ourselves and not the law enforcers to begin with. Rules are supposed to keep people in line, but not out to drag people under it. You don't want to be in a place where they put keeping laws in order before their people.\n\nBut hey.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-19T03:52:44.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah and she was an absolute bitch and unpleasant person.\n\nShe wanted Riot to pay her for gracing the game and pro-scene with her presence like LoL.\nAccording to her she was making LoL more popular than it ever should be and thus Riot owed her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-19T04:02:04.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Technically Maria Creveling wasn't even a female, she is marked on the wiki as transsexual, boy-girl, shim, Apache attack helicopter, you choose.\n\nWas looking at her wiki just yesterday, they were a support sub in, dubbed as \"The Queen of Thresh\", probably because \"The King of Thresh\" was already taken by Ducky.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-19T05:08:44.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-19T04:19:00.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And one of the most unpleasant people in E-Sports.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-19T12:49:34.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remi\nSirens.\n\nBoth complete jokes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-19T03:50:32.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Multiple reasons.\n\nSexism could be one, but Riot does well to minimise this within the League community.\nThere are plenty of League Streamers, and a fair few of them are high elo, however they seem completely satisfied with their current position rather than pushing themselves further.\n\nThat leads into competitive drive.\nIt's unfortunate but females naturally have lower competitive drive than males, there are many many reasons for this, but you'll note that a female with high testosterone levels (could be from any reason, genetic or otherwise) are typically more aggressive and competitive.\n\nThere are a lot more reasons I could go into, but I'm not in the mood to debate at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ApolloBrahz","date":"2017-03-25T11:47:19.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/Kj4xpEepRTM You bronze scrub do u even  research on LEAUGE of legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"4 02 2017","date":"2017-03-23T10:15:55.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the answer is simple\n\nWomen can definitely join teams in the pro leagues , there just haven't been any thus far to devote intense amount of hours of the day to attain the levels of skill deemed worthy ie challenger.

And no company wants some obese pimply nerd with 5x magnified glasses (stereotypical gamer), wearing their logo, cos lets be frank... that doesn't sell.\nSo its fair enough that they'll pick someone with slightly less skill, but much better looks _(because after all, they do have to sell their products)_.\n\nAnd because we are exposed to so much feminine beauty on TV and in advertising, we are very accustomed to seeing unnaturally stunning women for everything, and so when you find an actual normal non-supermodel girl, even if she is still good looking, she doesn't work for advertising because she just cant compare to the selectively-picked 1 in a million supermodels that we are accustomed to.\n\nAnd the likelihood of finding a stunningly hot girl at that level of gaming is probably incredibly low. Because chances are, If you're that hot, you'll know it, opportunities will come much easier to you, and before you even reach that level of gaming, you'll realise that there will be far better and far easier paths through life than sitting for 12 hours a day practicing playing champions that aren't even as hot as you, getting that sweet screen tan, just for the chance of going pro someday.\n\nHowever because of how men are portrayed in advertising and on TV (its more about the presence, rather than the visuals), the population is less selective about their looks. So as long as he isn't too bad, you can pull off putting an average/above-average guy in an advertising role.\n\n_______\n\nIm sure its not the only reason, but its bound to be a contributing factor. \n\nAnd I'm not saying its fair! \n\nTBH if you're the best gamer (or best anything) you should be able to be selected no matter how you look. Its a sad thing, but the world just doesn't work like that. Its in our instincts to like the best looking things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lady Darquesse","date":"2017-03-19T10:33:26.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It must be because they get baited and outsmarted too often.","replies":[]}]}
