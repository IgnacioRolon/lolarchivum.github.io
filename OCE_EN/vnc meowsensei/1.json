I&#039;m just wondering if it is possible for you guys to allow us to set 2 profile icons (1 for our profile and 1 for the one that appears to others and on the friend list. This is because that the ultimate skin icons doesn&#039;t look that good, however it does make your profile look so much better with the animated skins and such. I know this may be a bit too much to ask just out of the look of things (countless of programmings that you need to do), but I would really appreciate it if you guys can!!!!!\r\nThank You!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"mulgokizary","date":"2016-11-12T11:21:10.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be nice if instead they would allow us to customise our profile backgrounds. That way we can showcase our favourite champions (and skins). Maybe only allow DJ Sona splashart for people that own DJ Sona.","replies":[]}]}
