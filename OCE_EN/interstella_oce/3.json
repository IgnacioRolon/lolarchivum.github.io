But like I've said on other posts. There is really no such thing as a legitimate site that gives you benefits in League of Legends. Any site that is not directly linked and 'sponsored' by Riot Games should be considered as suspect and not touched. Any site that requires you to provide account details, even if it's just a summoner name should not be touched. \n\nRegards, \nlols =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-18T14:10:52.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't sign in for the time being, scan your comp if you do important sign ins like netbanking or whatever on your computer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-18T13:31:05.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you didn't run anything on the website or sign in there.. nothing.","replies":[]}]}
