When 2 afks in your rank game, of course you can't win that game, 5v3 doesn't work at the start of the game. And why are we loosing our LP points? is it our fault? I hope you will ban them coz it really makes people angry and after no one wants to play your game!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-14T03:35:58.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">When 2 afks in your rank game, of course you can't win that game\n\nNot true. I've lost games to an enemy team where they had four afks, while my team had one. Due to the nature of matchmaking and distribution, and just pure luck, they won. Of course, they were playing Vayne, but the point still remains, you can still win a 3v5. It's just harder.\n\nAnd people will not be banned for leaving one game. It could be authentically because they were disconnected for reasons out of their control. In fact, that's what most DCs are caused by. Of course, if they are repeat offenders, then they are penalised.","replies":[]}]}
