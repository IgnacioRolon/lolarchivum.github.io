Over the past month or so, I have encountered quite a few toxic players. I was actually playing an ARAM with 3 of my friends and a random, anyway please believe me on this one because it&#039;s ridiculous. Basically, the enemy team was poking our team down, and I&#039;m pretty sure that aside from our caitlyn (the random) we were all melee so it&#039;s not like we had massive poke to retaliate. Anyway, caitlyn almost dies because she&#039;s taking all of this damage, and then she starts flaming us in the chat, telling us that we&#039;re useless and that we should afk. We pretty much call her out on how silly she&#039;s being, and then she starts feeding! She runs into the enemy team for a solid 8 minutes before &quot;playing properly&quot; but still feeding obviously because of how behind we were. All 4 of us reported her, and nothing was done about it. No notification to let us know that she had rightfully been punished. I just don&#039;t understand why riot doesn&#039;t do anything about these people who are blatantly breaking the rules, for whatever reason. If you&#039;re having a bad day, please don&#039;t play this game. It doesn&#039;t help you or your team mates. I just don&#039;t even see the point of reporting players any more because out of my 3 years of playing this game only 2 people that I have reported were actually punished. 2, out of literally at least 50 people that I have reported. 50 justifiable and valid reports, and 2 are dealt with. What gives?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-13T05:26:53.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWe're sorry you had to experience that kind of behavior in your game. It's not acceptable and we don't want to see it in League.\n\nAs for your report; I assume by _\"notification\"_ you mean the [report feedback system](http://apollo-na-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438974480/banned.png). \n\n+ The report feedback system is a little weird because it's a left over feature from the tribunal. [Riot Lyte](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134527205570) has said in the past that:\n\n _\"...if you file the report in the final match that triggers a penalty for a negative player, you'll get a message in the client saying \"Thanks for your report and making the community a better place, a player has been punished, etc, etc.\"\"_\n\n Essentially, the report which triggers the ban is the only one that receives a notification.\n\n> So it might be that one of your friends received that notification later on, since it was their report that triggered the punishment. \n> \n> Or it may be that this was a first offense for the **Caitlyn**, which would lead to only a \"strike\" against her name making it easier to be punished the next time.\n\n**Riot** will be implementing a new report feedback system into the new tribunal coming soon. We're hoping this will increase transparency with reports and punishments, while also being aggressive with toxicity in-game. You can read more about that [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132173906626).\n\nI hope this answered your question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-04-13T05:25:22.047+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-29T00:43:37.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what the OP says is pretty right.
