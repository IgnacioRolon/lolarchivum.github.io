Every game I play it has at least one in it, and this isn&#039;t an exaggeration, i can bet my life at least 90% of the games played in Coop Vs Ai has bots in it, so instead of banning people for things like mmr boosting and reworking items that are fine, which are just a minority of people because not everyone has money to do it, why don&#039;t u try and fix the game for newcomers that on get bots in the game, honestly when are you going to step up and start doing something about people using bots to level up their accounts, isnt that basically like mmr boosting somebody playing on your account??????. the amount of players in game that are bots is ridiculous, also before you say why don&#039;t you play normals or aram, the queue times are extremely long, kinda like a diamond or challenger queuing up for a game. So what are you doing to prevent this riot??????","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-11-26T21:07:23.709+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you on this one. It's a little bit sad to think that some of us have just grown accustomed to bots by now :(\n\nThe problem is that this isn't an easy fix at all:\n\n+ Riot's always [making changes](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/KUEAUsV2-tired-of-bots?comment=00000000) to their bot detection systems, the thing is that the botters/scripters are also making changes to avoid the system.\n\n So it becomes what's called an 'arms race'. When Riot updates their detection systems the amount of bots go down for a little while, until the botters/scripters find a workaround and then the amount of bots go back to normal. It's never ending cycle.\n\nThe best way to solve this IMO is an official Riot smurf system. The bots are only there because there's a black market for smurf level 30 accounts. If Riot provides their own smurfs for free then the market will disappear and almost all the bots will be gone.\n\nBut that's the big picture, if you want to lower the amount of bots in the short term then the best thing you can do is report them for cheating, or report 10+ bot summoner names to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly. \n\nDoing this consistently makes Riot's job far easier. One of the reasons that bots are so popular in Co-op. vs AI is that people don't care enough/forget to report.\n\nI hope that gives you a bit of context on this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"drive by dunks","date":"2016-11-28T05:37:20.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been reporting the same bot accounts for weeks and nothing has happened to them... telling me that riot cant keep up is bullshit cos we are telling them who the bots are they are just doing nothing about it... i report for negative attitude, intent feeding and cheating and i write... bot account please ban... a week later same bot account is at it again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Toni Kroos","date":"2016-11-28T04:05:53.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IN ARAM GAMES TOO!!\nEspecially for the low level accounts.\nWhen i play my low level smurf, i want to play aram but I'm the only human, others are bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-11-27T14:24:37.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is pretty much what Blizzard did with the ability to buy gold and trade it for play time, also with its max level heroes and well.... just about every aspect botters could do with a market. \n\nOnly thing now with WoW is the fact PvP / Titles are still a thing so the market is there, but similar you either get carried or someone plays your account. \n\nHonestly, bots in co-op probably isnt the biggest deal in the world, perhaps disappointing for you the poster, but as a whole, its probably why there is only 20second ques for that, try waking up at 5am and logging in for arams and check those timers out, luckily at my age. I have a nice routine of wake up, login, start que, proceed to notice 6-10min que timer, go to loo, put on kettle, feed cat, open balcony door, make my coffee sit down, say hi to club, open my background browsers, check back on my timer and hello there! usually within 2mins. \n\nBut agreed, since OCE isn't linked to NA anymore, our player base is significantly smaller thus timers much worse.\n\nPersonally, its the scripting out there at present that really has me annoyed and i can spot the playstyle (skill shots perfectly cast over your flash location, Ez, Q'd where u r, instantly W's where u flash within .1second of everything, Ez is a great example, you're moving from say point a on the left side of lane, moving to point b on the right side of lane... You don't stop or change direction, pretty much a straight line..... Ez is in the middle of your path so has to cast in a  V style pretty much, as in the left of the V is his Q where you started walking and the W is along the right V path where you are when the script cast it instead. \n\nI use S to stop moving or create jerky movements to psych out player predictions at times, at times i'll not only flash away from the issue but for no reason at all to either side, only to be instantly followed and often told im dead before ive even visually landed my flash. I'm a solid player, i can notice trends, but when i die in 1.2seconds to 4 champs instant casting suddenly, you really have to wonder when you play arams. \n\nranked i haven't seen it but honestly, i found getting into ranked just as toxic on OCE as normal. But mostly ive been doing ARAM and RGM's and creating player mistakes is part of my style, when im getting auto switched, perfectly trained CC that doesn't overlap its duration, when im being chased from enemy turret to my turret and get snared as a tank, usually people either go all out or don't worry knowing you'll sponge it up, but no... i get casually auto'd from 3/5 of the enemy team and casually snared as if im an AI bot on easy mode co-ops. \n\nUsually post game, most of the autopilot scripters leave instantly to reque, i generally wait a couple of minutes to miss their group. But then you get the shit talkers who have to feel like talking trash whilst cheating makes them great, even though... they are playing with diamond 1+ teamwork, skill casts spread out as a team etc etc without an error or wasted CC, but i don't even see a bronze border... after the season has ended...\n\nreally....???\n\nreally??? OCE has all these freakishly amazing response time players and predictions (that either suggest you're on ritalin / meth or both + a ton of energy drinks) with zero mistakes... \n\nand our pro team is the chiefs? with a captain who makes the biggest noob mistakes on pro levels its not funny?! \n\nthe typical \"aww yeah we got this\" aussie attitude, slack off, get slammed for it... try and pull the nice guy card.\n\nno mate, you just aint at the competitive level nor able to withstand the pressure... \n\n(noticed in the worlds, the players were pretty much closed off from the audience... so the point of the worlds was what? sit in a theater and watch a screen, without any real vision of the players?... jeez, if you want to call it a sport, learn to deal with the spectators others, you're just a competitive game with a $ pay out... You know what else does? Monopoly... Checkers... Uno... but are they sports? No... they're games)\n\ni digress...\n\nyes bots ruin the game, especially when i que with friends, get 1-2 randoms and vs 2-3 bots in aram. I just push for a 10min win and ind another 1-2 people to join us and hope we don't vs bots. We've also reached the point we're running a full ARAM/RGM mode's at times as custom games in house rather than take it to the live server just to avoid this.","replies":[]}]}
