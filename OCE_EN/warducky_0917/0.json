Shit happens of course, and everyone is going to dc for one reason or another once in awhile, but once in a while won't get you LeaverBusters. If you're getting LBs it means this is happening pretty consistently, and Riot can't just consider whether you did it on purpose, they also have to consider the 4-9 other players who have had their experience ruined because you couldn't play out a game.\n\nSo the question is then what kind of problems are you having? Sometimes all it takes is a call to your ISP threatening to leave them to get shit fixed. Sometimes it's as simple as switching to a wired connection. If it's an issue you really can't do anything about, like dodgy cables in a country area or something, then you'll have to accept the consequences of playing an online team based game with a compromised connection.","replies":[{"poster":"WarDucky 0917","date":"2018-04-13T11:17:40.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright thank you","replies":[]}]}]}
