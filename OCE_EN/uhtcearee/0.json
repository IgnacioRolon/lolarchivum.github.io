I am a sup player and hard to find a duo on this league as you can imagine most people prefer not sup to get out but I enjoy aggressive sup and looking for a fast reaction adc main players to duoa and rank up etc\r\n\r\nadd me if you interested in game :  UHTCEAREE","replies":[{"poster":"GANDALFderGREEN ","date":"2019-06-05T13:23:34.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I offer you some suggestions. \nIve checked out your profile on op.gg\n\nIm a fellow Sup Main, S4 after placements (Im a Sona OTP in ranked). The first time I was against G4 and G3 summoners I had to Google the border (I thought it was a promo border XD)\n\nLearn about the support 'pyramid'.\nIt goes under many names but a good start is What is the Kill / Poke / Sustain triangle? thread on Reddit. It goes by different names and people have different ideas about it but its essentially Scissors / Paper / Rock. You get the idea.\n\nTheres a Diamond Support Main on Twitch called Bizzleberry. Check him out. His recommendations for Supports are normally Leona / Zyra / Soraka. Its the same theory. Although he is playing a lot of Yuumi at the moment.\n\nYour best results for Sup are with Nautilus / Leona. Both are Hard Engage Supports. But Leona can be screwed when she all ins (if the ADC doesnt follow up) and Naut will get nerfed soon you can count on it.\n\nLearn about win conditions!!!!!!!!\n\nIf your opponents have a kill lane, say Yasuo - Pyke then you dont want hard engage. You want to play a waiting game. Their win condition is to kill you, snowball and roam. So a Caitlyn / Xerath combo will make them want to KYS. Caitlyn can poke down Yasuo's shield at every opportunity and Xerath can use his range advantage to keep Pyke at length and zone Yasuo off the farm. See what Im getting at.\n\nYou are aggresive and you want an aggressive ADC to help you out. If I was a JG on the other team I would camp bot in the early game, you would be constantly overextended and until you had finished your quest you would be having problems with warding and would be vulnerable. 3 - 4 kills in the early game and your playing catchup with the enemy ADC / SUPPORT. Youd lose laning phase 3 outta 4 games.\n\nNever forget LOL is a strategy game not a PvP.\n\nIm not an ADC main but I do play ADC. Ill probably add you tommorrow (only play 1 or 2 days a week). But im up for some theorycrafting. Want to try out a ADC / SUPP combo where an ADC has heavy CC (MF maxing E or Ashe maxing W) and the SUPP is an AP mage that has the capacity to hard carry, say Lux.\n\nWhy? Because if you rush Liandry's Torment and you use a spell after I do. You will proc the full damage on the passive on Liandry's WITHOUT having to get  a Rylai's Sceptre.\n\nADC hits them with CC. Lux drops an E. Thats 7.5% of target health. Then you can Q and E again (once its off Cool Down). You proc Liandry's again\n\nYouve done 15% of your opponents health. Just from the Chain CC. And thats with just 1 items passive regardless of how much AP youve got.\n\nSee what Im getting at","replies":[{"poster":"Uhtcearee","date":"2019-06-07T22:12:17.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great information and definitely will help me. hope to talk to you soon","replies":[]}]}]}
