The thing that really got me, was that me and a friend duo queued, without knowing this would happen. It happened, I Googled, but to no success. after sometime, I restart the client and it tells me that I am in the low priority queue. This is probably the most annoying thing that has happened to me in my league experience, and it wasn't even in game! I know that there's no way of fixing the low priority queue part but maybe instead of punishing people for leaving, have a reward for not leaving, or make the punishment less harsh or something, because I feel that a lot people leave games beyond their control {{champion:32}} .\r\nAnyway, can someone help me with the client problem?\r\nI have tried the sources from here: http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3856920\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-23T02:29:57.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What ISP are you with?\n\nHave a look at the first post in the [sticky thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/WlGElu7g-update-firewall-error-after-champion-select) at the top of this board too, as there are some steps you can take that might help us better identify the causes of this issue.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-22T02:26:14.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has already been discussed. In summary, providing **anticipatable** rewards cause people to behave up until the point where they get the reward, and then resume their bad behaviour, while they still get the benefits of a good behaved player. Additionally, it also forms a sort of bribery for players to behave well, which should not be the way to resolve things.\n\nThe way it currently is is that there are random rewards distributed at random times for behaving appropriately in random areas (not leaving games, not being chat-banned, not queue dodging, etc.). This both encourages good behaviour and deters consistantly toxic players from behaving good for just a brief moment, and instead to behave good always.\n\nAs for your client, you've already tried several things. Unfortunately that link in which you tried solutions from is both **2 years old** and for the patcher not correctly launching, which is not your issue.\n\nCheck your firewall and anti-virus. Make sure they are both up to date and have allowed *all* instances of League (including the game exe itself, not just the launcher!).\n\nThis is a simple procedure just to make sure it isn't something silly like that. Get back to me if this doesn't work.","replies":[]}]}
