Im honestly sick and tired of seeing it. Can we please buff adc and traditional supports magic resist so these reprobated mages can get shat on in lane pls and thank you. Or better yet just delete Zyra and Lux and Veigar and fiddlesticks and brand and any other offender of this god aweful trend.

How much damage you can take - Practice and Experience\n2. How much damage you can do - Practice and Experience\n3. How useful/useless your adc is - Observing their playstyle\n4. The levels of each player involved in a skirmish - Use your eyes, its not that hard\n5. The Mana/Health levels of all involved in the skirmish - Use your eyes, its not that hard\n6. Where the junglers are - USE YOUR EYES AND WARD\n7.

If his adc is NOT WORTH supporting, then he needs to adapt. If they are going to do monkey things, why support them? Better to support the rest of the team.\n\nI can understand your frustration with trash support picks though. Players that are autofilled or copying idiots like Nightblue or some streamer. The issue with support is that they do too much damage in comparison to adc, and this is because of the changes to adc power curves, but mainly also down to itemisation for supports. For example if you have two spellthief supports, then whichever bot lane wins will snowball the game, because the loser will not even get wards.\nThen you get those monkey supports with spellthiefs that try to catch waves in the sidelane, not realising that they are gimping their teams vision by farming (because frostfang will not transform, and of course being selfish they are not upgrading it), not to mention taking the carries xp and farm. Those are the most frustrating players to watch at the moment.\n\nIf we think back to the past when supports were actually supports, they had to buy wards and a sightstone and got no gold to get damage items. I'd prefer it to go back to that meta. Bring back the sightstone and if people are complaining, THEY ARE NOT REAL SUPPORTS, UNLUCKY! All that pandering to reddit and forums in season 6 is the main reason why bot lane was deciding games more often than not. Instead of fine tuning other areas of the map in an attempt to mitigate this, just revert the support item changes. Make supports have to buy wards. Simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-29T01:59:59.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being a ward bot was not a fun time as support. You basically couldn't do anything other than keep vision up. Without items, damage mitigation and sustain was minimal, and the support role often meant not much at all. Instead of being able to hold up your ADC when they aren't doing so hot, support performance was directly tied to ADC performance, they had very little autonomy. Change it back and you'll have even less people playing support, and even more people getting auto fillled into support, which hardly helps the issue.\n\nI don't agree with all the changes to the game, but trinkets and the ward changes I do. It's no fun being pigeonholed into one relatively mundane task all game, especially when your team takes it upon themselves to blame you *and only you* for not having the map lit up like a christmas tree.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-09-10T02:51:33.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The joy of playing support is to enable your teammates to carry. I mean it's all subjective opinion I guess. But that's what I think a real support is. More people autofilled anywhere is just another reason to learn how the game works. The playerbase as a whole would improve quicker and skill level will be higher.\nJust like back in early season 5 when bronze were consistently getting 6cs/min in ranked games. Now you see clowns in gold/platinum struggling with 30cs at the 10 min mark. Overall the playerbase skill level is vastly lower with new players coming into the game just having no clue at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bazikiller","date":"2018-09-05T11:45:19.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly i would only go a not meta sup if the champ has good engage or some sort of sup capability like kyle which works well cuz of the samge the heal and ult kinda like a mini taric but i like to play ammumu or xin (good engame and u can kill the adc quickly or damage him enormously) try off meta sups which have some sort of stun or slow. i kinda want to do camlie sup but havent gone around to play her yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-28T08:59:23.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it's not the support role that's the problem, it's the player and there's nothing you can do about that except flame them, or surrender early on, or feed with them sooner the game ends the better","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-08-28T15:40:42.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is when you see pro players picking these champions and encouraging bad players to do the same when they dont actually understand why they're picking that champion in the first place.

For a while there when bot was filled with bruisers and duellers sure things were different but they've largely settled now.\n\nPersonally I haven't seen a Zyra supp in a very long time, even in normals, and Lux only rarely (more often she's mid), and the only mage support I really struggle against anyway is Brand, who I just hate versing in general. I will admit I've seen more of Fiddlesticks, but he's not exactly the most reliable and he's easy to counter-pick.","replies":[]}]}
