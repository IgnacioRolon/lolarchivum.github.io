[In depth guide]","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hopefully, my title grabbed your attention well enough to begin reading this thread, firstly I want to disclaim the notion that I am a godly player or that I am putting into practice everything I'm about to write. If that's enough of a deterrent for you then feel free to leave, but if you're genuinely looking to climb out from \"Elo hell\" then look no further than a previous hard stuck silver who spent 5 seasons trying to get gold. I'm just going to jump straight into it and assume from getting to level 30 and playing afew normal games that you do understand the fundamentals of the game like how turrets are ouchy and killing the nexus is a quick way to get 50g. \n\nBEFORE GETTING INTO LEAGUE SPECIFIC TIPS HERE ARE SOME QUICK UNIVERSAL ONES:\n1. Don't flame your team. If someone is toxic, mute them.\n2. Don't intentionally feed, afk (including tabbing out during a game), or cheat.\n3. Before playing ranked if you don't want to be placed in bronze then play at least 500 normal games. \n4. Learn how to play support and have a decent pool of support champions in addition to your two main roles, this will help you when you get auto-filled. (I personally got mastery 7 thresh 85k experience just for this purpose, though I do own every champion already)\n5. At least have read every champion ability and every item in the game before you play ranked.\n6. NEVER GIVE UP.\n7. Read patch notes.\n\n===================================================================================================================\n\nBronze MMR - [Explanation on basic game knowledge]\n\n GOLD: If you're in bronze the two biggest factors preventing you from climbing to silver are your basic game knowledge and game mechanics. It is possible to climb out of bronze purely based on raw mechanics which is how I got out of bronze initially and got hard stuck silver 5 for a season. So what is important to know? Arguably the most important thing to know in the league of legends is........ GOLD. And the most important thing to know about gold is that it's useless if you don't spend it correctly. Someone who is behind in gold can easily beat someone ahead in gold if they're buying the right items and their opponent isn't. For example, Darius is ahead in gold and he buys a ravenous hydra and mobility boots as his first items, his opponent is a renekton who buys a chain vest, ninja tabi, and bami's cinder. Even though Renekton hasn't completed his main item yet and is down in gold, he has built to counter his lane and will be able to survive lane and maybe even kill Darius. Had Darius bought a black cleaver instead of a ravenous hydra, Darius would be able to use his lead to easily beat Renekton. A better example however would be nasus against teemo where teemo is ahead in gold, if nasus goes for tri force first item then he will straight up lose lane, however, if he decided to build spirit visage instead then he will definitely survive the lane.\n\nGOLD PT 2: The second most important thing to know about gold is that gold comes from many sources. 16-18 cs usually equals 1 kill, so if you're ahead of your opponent in cs by roughly 32 then you've basically got 2 free kills just by farming better than your opponent. Other ways to get gold are from turrets, assists, gold generating items, runes, clearing wards, champion pets, and epic monsters. All these things contribute directly to the amount of gold you have to spend. If you and your opponent are evenly matched but you clear a ward, tp bot and get some assists when your laner is gone, and your team destroys a turret, then suddenly you are ahead by a fair amount of gold without even outplaying your opponent. \n\nPOWER: But what If I told you that everything I told you about gold just now is wrong? WELL, it's not, BUT, power does not just come from having gold my bronze friend. Looking out for the differences in LEVEL and understanding your opponents abilities will be a sure way win you lanes or stop you from losing. In the top lane, for example, you can win lane just from getting level 2 first which is usually given on the first minion of the second wave (unless you are sharing exp). Getting level 2 before your opponent can sometimes be like being twice as strong since they have 1 ability and you have 2. So what do you do? Sometimes you just have to let it go, if your opponent is able to do a lot of damage to you early then simply back of and wait for the minions to push into your turret so you can get your level 2 safely, there is no need to die over a single minion. Picking your fights carefully can also make a big difference, your opponent can't use the gold they earned if they can't hit you, or, building an advantage before you fight can make a big difference. For example, if you are playing ezreal and you q a minion 5 times in a row, your passive would have given you a large boost in attack speed, meaning if you decide to fight will full stacks then you are fighting as if you had gotten some free kills or minions. Also looking at builds, you may be able to fight someone who's 5/0 easily and win but lose to someone who's 0/5 simply because of their items. Know what you're up against.\n\nDYING: Dying is probably the worst thing you can do in league of legends, not only does it give your opponent gold, it also takes away your potential for gaining gold AND experience by killing minions if you were alive. Not only will they by items, they will be ahead by level, and you wont win lane if they're good without help from your team. Furthermore, if you are 5/0 and you die once, not only did you give the killer and the assisters gold, but you also give the entire enemy team a split of 450 gold, meaning your entire team will be weaker than the enemy team simply because you died. IF YOU DIE ONCE IN LANE THEN DO NOT ATTEMPT TO 1v1 YOUR ENEMY UNTIL YOU KNOW 100% THAT YOU CAN WIN. IF YOU DIE TWICE IN LANE THEN START BUILDING DEFENCE AND PLAYING SAFE (safe means behind your caster minions and near your turret). If you die a third time then you should just sit under turret and wait for help and farm for the mid/late game. There are tips on how to not die in another thread. \n\nDAMAGE: Ok so gold is important, how do I use it properly? Well, my friend, the whole game revolves around DAMAGE. There are many different types of damage. There is magic damage, attack damage, and true damage. Magic damage is reduced by magic resist and attack damage is reduced by armour, while true damage ignores armour and magic resistance. Simple right? So, if you are against someone with LOTS of attack damage then you should probably buy some armour. If you against someone with LOTS of magic damage then you should probably buy some magic resist. If you are against someone with LOTS of true damage, then you should buy health. Adversely, if your champion's abilities utilise attack damage then buy attack damage, if they utilise magic damage then buy ability power. If you are a tanky top lane and you are against a Camille, you are probably going to want a good mix of armour and health when it comes to defence but prioritise health due to her true damage (I.e, picking between a giants belt or chain vest you may want to buy the giants belt.) \n\nTRADING AND FIGHTING: In lane \"trading\" is a common term used to describe the event where you and an enemy damage each other, you 'trade' damage. You 'win' a trade when you successfully do more damage to your opponent then they do to you. Players will often 'trade' in lane all the time. The most important thing to keep in mind when you trade are... MINIONS. When you auto-attack an enemy champion their minions will retaliate and attack you. If you auto attack a champion when there are a lot of minions then you will always lose a trade. For example, a caster minion does 12 damage, a level game basic attack does for example 52. If you auto attack your enemy when they have 3 caster minions, if those 3 caster minions all attack you twice then they will do 72 damage, meaning you lost the trade even though your opponent didn't even do anything. SPELLS, however, do not trigger minion aggro, so if you are playing someone like vladimir, you can freely q your opponent without any backlash from minions. BUT, if you use an ability that acts like an auto attack such as nasus Q or ezreal Q, then you will draw minion aggro. You should NEVER fight your opponent when they have a good amount of minions near them because they will most likely win the fight due to the help of minions. \n\nEDIT: After patch 8.2 targeted spells such as pantheon Q and Vlad Q draw minion aggro, however, spells like nasus E, and morgana w,  still do not. \n\nWARDING: If your trinket stack ever reaches 2 then you should be ashamed of yourself. Always ward, especially when you are behind, this also goes for junglers, if you are behind then you should ward inside your jungle to watch for invaders. If you are pushed, YOU WILL GET GANKED, so made your that you ward areas behind you that you can't see. I suggest looking up warding guides for more in-depth knowledge.\n\nWAVE CONTROL: If the enemy has more minions than you, then they will push towards your turret, if you have more minions than them, your wave will push towards their turret. If you want minions to push to your turret, let your opponent kill your minions and only last hit/don't kill theirs. If you want to push and damage their turret, then hard push and kill all their minions. In order to avoid ganks, you want to avoid pushing your lane into the enemies turret as it will open you up to getting ganked. Therefore you should only last hit minions in the early game (Last hitting is when the only time you damage a minion is to kill it for the gold, if you hit a minion and it doesn't die then you are pushing, not last hitting). Later in the game, you will want minions to slow push. To make a wave slow push all you have to do is kill 2 caster minions, the wave will look frozen for a while and your minions will build up. By doing this you force one of the enemies to clear the wave, and if they don't they will lose a turret to it. It is ideal to contest a dragon, baron, or another lane while you have one of these giant waves otherwise you're just feeding a massive amount of gold to whoever clears the lane. Also don't waste mana on clearing minions early game unless you really need to.\n\nHOW DO I ACTUALLY WIN THO?: Kill the nexus. When your opponent backs, hit the turrets, when they are about to return, back off and reset, you will return stronger than your opponent as they will have missed cs and exp to the turret. If you kill your lane, push the turret, if they back, push the turret, if they roam, push the turret, if your lane is free, push the turret. But always back off if there is danger and back off when your enemy is about to come back to lane. During the mid game, you want to either group with your team or split push. If you split push the aim is to drag the enemy team to you, then you back off. While they're too busy trying to clear the wave you pushed, your team will be free to push their turrets. If all enemies are alive and you have no vision on them, then you should not push or be pushed, you will die. Around the mid game you should start grouping up with your team and taking turrets together and killing enemies together, however you should not over extend or overstay when grouped. (Overstaying is when your initial push has ended but you choose to stick around for god knows what reason.) Make sure you keep farmed up, when you see a big wave you should clear it except when epic monsters are being contested. Essentially mid game is about using your lead to make your team stronger, most players fail because they think that their lead means they should solo carry or solo objectives. If you're very ahead in the mid game it should be easy to take an inhib turret with the team. If your team is not so ahead then farm for late game. When it comes to late game all you have to do is group as 5, get a kill, take baron, end the game. If there is ever a time it is 4v5 and you are grouped then you have a chance at closing out the game. Just remember that it is never ok to turret dive in a game you're not stomping, and you should always preferably fight in your side of the minion wave. If you are behind, try and make the enemy fight you under turrets. Group as a team, take 1 inhib, while that inhib is down, group in another lane, take the next, while that one is down, group in the last or do baron and group in the last, take all the inhibs, then its free from there.\n\n\nTips for each role-\n\nTop: Splitpushing tops aren't as great as they used to be, I suggest picking a tank like maokai, malphite, shen, cho'gath and playing around your team. However other viable picks if you want to carry from top are, darius, fiora, vladimir, wukong, yorick, urgot, gnar. Your main focus as a top laner is to be annoying. You should be that splitpusher that drags 2 top and is no where to be seen, then once they clear the wave you're back at it again. When they leave you alone, punish them by taking turrets, if they go after your team, use tp to win in numbers. As a top laner you are not really going to be carrying, but you are going to help your team to take objectives by being that annoying bully. \n\nMid: Mid is my least played role so I don't know too much about carrying from mid however I would say that winning lane is very important as losing mid can shut down your entire team and map pressure. This is the most important lane not to feed from. If you are strong in the mid lane, the enemy wont be able push unless they are ahead. Always be on the look out for jungle invades as you are responsible for scouting early and can easily help your jungler during the game if he is invaded. If you're winning lane you can always roam top or bottom to help your team if they need it, but don't sacrifice your turret. If your opponent decides to roam, i suggest shoving the lane and try damaging the turret.\n\nJungle: This is my main role, as a jungler you are responsible for pushing the game towards your victory. While clearing camps you should watch your teams lanes and see who is being pushed in, tailor your jungle route to set up for ganks. If everyone on your team are pushing, then slow down your jungle route by clearing all the camps. In the jungle you have a huge variety of junglers, my personal favourites are Warwick, Kayn, Evelyn, Shyvana. Other good picks are amumu, rammus, twitch, udyr, xin zhao, vi, and skarner. Try and coordinate your bot lane so that you can take dragons. After every successful gank if there is no risk of a counter gank you should push the turret until the enemy respawns. Pay attention to enemy movements and make note of wards, always gank outside of enemy vision. Mid lane is my favourite lane to gank because mid laners get over confident by warding the side bushes and push in all the time, making it easy to loop behind them. You should always be on the lookout to take dragons with your team when you're strong enough to solo it, as a kill in mid or bot can easily translate to a dragon. Rift herald is also very over looked and can be solo'd easily, allowing you to use it for a free turret when used correctly, sometimes even 2. Keep in mind that if you are cc'd while summoning rift herald, it will be cancelled. Always check the enemy junglers level when contesting epic monsters, as smite damage is dependent on level, if they are a level higher than you they will be able to outsmite you. \n\nAdc: Your goal as an adc in bronze is to become a farmer. Put your farming hat on and get your hoes because getting to late game is your chance of carrying. If your support is good however and sets up a kill for you dont be afraid to assert your dominance, but again, ward and watch for ganks. The best champions at the time of me writing this to climb are tristana and caitlyn, if your skill level is a bit higher then you can also go for twitch. These champs have good range and will let you bully and exploit the many positional mistakes that bronze players make and will also keep you safe at a distance from them. If you win lane early try and stay with your support, they will prevent you from getting assasinated when pushing. If they decide to go mid then I also suggest that you group with your team to take mid, use your advantage.\n\nSupport: It is possible to carry as a support even if you get auto-filled. In bronze, you don't really have to worry about playing 'real' supports but at least stick to an ap support. My recommended picks to climb bronze are sona, brand, Annie, lux, blitzcrank, zyra. If your mechanics need work however then I wouldn't suggest playing a 'carry' support and instead pick someone tanky like taric, Alistar, or someone passive like soraka, Janna. Your main goal to win as a support is to be an annoying piece of crap for the enemy team, every time they make a mistake, punish them. It shouldn't be too hard in bronze because people are making positional mistakes all the time. My biggest tip when playing support, however, is to position yourself within your adc's attack range, that way if they enemy engages on you, your adc can retaliate and protect you. ALWAYS BUY A GOLD GENERATING ITEM SUCH AS ANCIENT COIN, SPELL THIEF EDGE, OR RELIC SHIELD AND UPGRADE THEM FIRST FOR THEIR WARDS. If your adc is fed and can carry then stay with them, don't leave them at all. \n\n===================================================================================================================\n\nSilver MMR - [The art of throws]\n\nNow there may not be as much to cover in the silver part of the guide as the bronze because from here there are few key things which prevent people from climbing to gold. The main factors which determine victory in silver are:\n\n1. DECISION MAKING: Decision making is everything here. Should you push this wave? Should we contest dragon? Should I face check the brush? Should I stay for one more wave? Should I buy zhonyas against a zed as an adc? (Ignore that last one) But yes, all these decisions from small to big are the main factors which will keep you from winning your games. Assuming you're not feeding your butt off all the time that is, as we previously established, dying is the worst thing you can do in the league of legends. Knowing what decisions to make is something that comes with time and experience. However, I will cover the most common decisions that you should/shouldn't make when climbing to gold. \n\nSHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO?: Backing in league of legends is a very important and overlooked mechanic. Choosing where and when to back is a very important decision both in lane and during the later stages of the game. I'm sure everyone has had a moment where they're backing while window shopping then die in the last second because for some reason they wanted to back inside the brush right in front of the enemy turret. Always back in a safe location such as under your own turret or away from the enemy vision that isn't an obvious backing spot. When to back is another story, sometimes we get completely out traded in lane and risk death if we stay. Don't stress about it, if you know they can easily kill you then just back, there's no need to risk a death. Furthermore, if you kill your opponent and you're low, if you don't know the location of the jungler then you should run back to your turret for protection. \n\nIf you're fairly healthy when you kill them then push the wave under the enemy turret and wait for the enemy to respawn by checking their death timer. When they respawn you have about 15 seconds before they're back (If their champ has mobility it may be shorter). I would suggest backing during this time before they come back to lane as they may coordinate a gank as soon as they're back or return with items that may put them ahead of you. Don't throw away your lead for a little turret damage, just back and return stronger than your opponent. If you're ever in a position where you have to defend a turret against more than 2 people and you don't have good wave clear then let the turret die, there's no reason to die when they're going to take the turret anyway, the exception to this being nexus turrets as with 2 turrets you may be able to fight them. If however, you have your team with you 5v5 for example, you should always attempt to team fight them under your turrets.\n\nDRAGONS: Order of dragon importance may depend on team comp. However you're silver so that doesn't matter. The order of importance for you is Infernal/Mountain Drake/Ocean Drake/Cloud Drake. Never contest a cloud drake if there is a risk of dying, no one knows how to use the movement speed to out rotate you anyway so its the least utilised dragon by far. Ocean drake is a drag you should never attempt to take without vision or knowing where your opponent is, the movement speed debuff that it does will guarantee getting you killed if a fight breaks out while you're doing it. Adversely, if it's an ocean drake I would suggest always having it warded, if the enemy tries to do it then you can catch them out extremely easily provided the team reacts. \n\nLater in the game, however, trying to contest dragon can cost you the game, if you are behind in the late game you should never try to be a hero and steal drag, you will die, your team will not be any better off, and the enemy team has a chance to end the game. Dragons are a reward for good jungling and team work so it should be treated as such. Dragon only gives you 25 gold and barely any experience, clearing a jungle camp would reward you more gold and exp than killing dragon does. So if you think the buff is worth your time, it's not actually always is. In the early/mid try taking drag after a successful gank at mid or bot. Make sure you sweep the area so the enemy jungler doesn't have any vision and can't steal. On the topic of stealing, you should always stand behind the dragon so the enemy can't take it with skill shots, always body block. \n\nRIFT HERALD: Easily solo'd the problem is that you need vision control and map pressure to ensure you have enough time to do the herald. Keep in mind herald also doesn't give that much exp and gold on its own so if you're behind focus on clearing your camps before doing rift. If you're ahead in the top lane and see the enemy jungler bot side you can easily do rift yourself and use it to further your lead and possibly take a t2 turret. Remember that you're better off trying hit behind the rift herald than constantly auto'ing it from the front. If the jungler is top side it's almost always a bad idea to do rift because you can get collapsed on by top and mid if the enemy are ahead, or your laners aren't paying attention. But don't blame them if you get caught, you knew the risk.\n\nBARON NASHOR: Baron should 90% of the time be taken as a team of 4-5 and never less. Remember that baron does a shit tonne of damage if you are standing behind it so only stand to its sides or front. Baron steals are worth even if you die, but dying and not getting the baron steal means the end of the game for your team so I would suggest never risking it. You should attempt to take Baron when the enemy jungler is dead in the late game. HOWEVER Baron is not just useful for its buff, you can easily set up a death bush and bait the enemy into thinking you're doing baron then kill them all when they walk past the bush. You can win games off of baiting baron in silver usually more times than actually taking it. When you're very behind you shouldn't try to contest baron and instead wait it out, if you're not too far behind you should wait for them to do the baron first before fighting. The amour/magic shred and damage baron can do will leave them vulnerable in team fights, so either fight them while they're doing baron, or fight them after they've done it (Before they back). The way you wait out baron when the enemy takes it is to focus on wave clearing and poking, don't even commit to a fight, and never get caught out, you will lose. Instead, you should turtle, meaning behind your turrets, inside your base. Yes they will take t2 turrets, but that's the kind of power baron has, give up your t2 or lose the game. \n\nNEXUS: If you're at the end of a game with your team and you are not hitting the nexus, then why are you even reading my guide? There is no point doing anything at all if you're not going to hit the nexus. When you start, finish. No exceptions. (Unless your team decides they don't want to hit the nexus and dive the fountain instead, then you should probably back before you die and lose the game)\n\nGETTING PICKS: Ask yourself before you try and get a pick, do you know where every enemy is? DO you know how strong the person you're about to kill is? Do you know if they have their summoners up? Do you know their cooldowns? Is my team near me to back me up if something wrong happens? Is my team alive to defend if I mess up? Is the enemy team contesting an objective and do I need to be there? Is our base in danger? These are all the things you should consider before trying to get a pick.  If you have the all clear, go for it. Getting a successful pick can allow you to take key objectives.\n\n2. TEAM FIGHTING: This is the next thing you should learn to do properly if you want to win your games. Team fighting is a marathon, not a sprint. So mr riven full ad top, do not rush in with ult get a kill, get cc'd and died, then flame your team because you were the only one to kill someone. Depending on your role you want to play the team fights differently. \n\nMarksman- As a marksman, your role is to do as much damage in fights as possible, nothing else. However, that doesn't mean you're off the hook for dying, you can't do damage if you're dead. Therefore if you die in a team fight, you're not doing your job, adversely if you focus too much on staying alive and don't do damage then you're also not doing your job. You don't have to worry about targetting as much as other roles do just shoot whatever is in front of you. So if that nasus is looking at you funny don't be afraid to melt his face off and pop that qss when he withers you, tanks are easy to kite and it's your job to shred them to pieces for your team. However, if another enemy that isn't a tank or bruiser is within your range, you should probably kill them before they kill you. Stay alive, do damage, kill everyone. \n\nSupport- Keep everyone alive, you must PEEL, do not chase enemies down with your cc. If an assassin jumps on your marksman or mage, protect them. As a thresh main I usually like to sit next to my adc and flay/hook anyone that goes near them. If the team is winning the team fight, i then use my hook to chase people down, but only if my adc is safe.\n\nTank- Your job isn't to tank damage. WHAT? FOR REAL? Yes. For real. Your job is to protect your team, and disrupt the enemy/make them focus you WHILE your team is damaging the enemy. Just tanking damage is not enough. If you're a malphite get your e down on the adc or fighters, knock up the enemy to engage or knock enemies up that get too close to your carries. Get your cc down on as many people as possible.\n\nAssasin- Blow up the carries/clean up low enemies. Stay out of sight untill they engage and then do your thing. \n\nFighter/Bruiser- \n\nMage-","replies":[{"poster":"Wuinn","date":"2018-01-25T10:17:02.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A usual game consists of me explaining this stuff to my team and why they need to do x, y and z while they charge into the enemy team and die on re-spawn.

Where are the enemy team? Where is their vision (for tp wards)? Are you going to be able to take baron and THEN GET AWAY SAFELY? Do you have map pressure before you attempt the baron? Is it better to take that open inhibitor or the baron? THINK 30 SECONDS AHEAD AND WORK OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTERWARDS.\n\n2) Split pushing. If your fed top laner is split pushing, for gods sake team DON'T GO TO THEIR LANE. Push a DIFFERENT ONE. If you are the split pusher, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE TELEPORT UP WHEN OBJECTIVES ARE AVAILABLE. Split push in the lane FURTHEREST AWAY FROM THE OBJECTIVE.\n\n3) Champion select: Work out what your team composition does and what enemy's does and then PLAY TO YOUR WIN CONDTIONS. Not a clown fiesta. Notice the summoner spells and keystone runes. Junglers consider which lanes are gankable and which are not.\n\n4) Closing the game. Create constant map pressure. DO NOT slack off to farm jungle camps when you can push. I don't care if you have no cs. Pushing wins games only. Nothing else. Especially in clown fiesta oce.  Farm jungle camps only if there is nothing else to do. When you are sieging, WATCH THE MINION WAVES, make them crash at the same time. DO NOT LOSE PATIENCE. WAIT. Create a situation where your ADC can hit towers, that's their job. PROTECT THEM. Don't clown around trying to get penta kills on the fountain, end the game by hitting the nexus.\n\n5) Attitude. You are platinum, you cannot talk, you are trash. When you get to Diamond 2+ in oce, then you can talk. If a teammate makes a mistake, don't flame them, they are platinum like you, nothing special, you make at least 10 mistakes every game. Don't think you are high and mighty. Give them advice along the lines of simple help or don't type at all. Don't spam ping question marks on deaths.
