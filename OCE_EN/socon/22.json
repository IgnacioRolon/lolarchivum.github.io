I&#039;ve made a lot of champion concepts in the past but i don&#039;t think putting so much effort into one champion will ever make it to a real living champion. So i offer thee a simple concept which can be moulded into a fine specimen. \r\n\r\nGeneral Lore: I was thinking this champion could have ties with Zaun as there aren&#039;t many of them. This champion is a cunning individual who relies only on their skills as a thief to get by. \r\n\r\nPlay style: To stick with the theme i was thinking that this champion would have a gold generating passive which grants a certain amount of gold whenever an ability lands on a target much like the mastery &quot;pickpocket&quot;. This champ would offer more utility rather than playing as an assassin as thief&#039;s do not like to get involved in fights and rather do some nasty tricks and slip away. \r\n\r\nHis/Her/It&#039;s abilities would be debuff focussed and he would work to disrupt the enemies and make way for objectives. As a general idea i was thinking his/her/it&#039;s ult could be a massive smoke screen which visually (Not mechanically) blind his opponents like a massive graves smoke grenade except everyone inside it has a limited field of view including his team members (but not him/her/itself). Some repositioning abilities would allow the champion to &quot;Slip away&quot; like a thief playing around with the fog of war or giving stealth. I don&#039;t think it would be appropriate for this champion to be a tank so its means of dealing damage would be auto attack based, the attacks being throwing knives with a mild range between 400-550. A single target silence would help to disable certain champion casts like a katarina ult to assist the team in fights and an aoe slow or snare to help the team slip away. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think of this champion concept. As we can see with bard, riot is not afraid to make utility based champions and i think this concept fits in nicely with the meta. \r\n\r\nAs a support: The adc would have to be slightly independent as this champion cant really offer any sustain. However the snare and silence would assist in minor trades where the opposing adc is forced to only auto attack or it can be mixed up, snaring the adc and silencing the support. I wouldn&#039;t see a harm in an attack damage steroid either &quot;exploiting the enemies weaknesses&quot; to help deal damage in trades along side the adc. At level 6 there is great disengage with the ultimate which will stop auto attacks from being made for a while or allow the adc to reposition and continue the fight. The ult can also help the team secure objectives, if your team is taking baron or dragon the ult would make it nearly impossible for the enemy team to try and steal it.\r\n\r\nAs an anything else: This champ wouldn&#039;t really be that great at jungling, no sustain, no great damage output = slow clear and only one hard cc. As a solo laner the champ would be able to hold its own pretty well but will always be pressured as he/she/it has no real kill potential in lane.","replies":[]}
