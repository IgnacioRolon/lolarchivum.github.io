Assasin: High base damage, focus on burst abilities (scale with lethality or ability power/pen). Escape options, low survivability. Champions that come to mind fitting this description = Zed, Talon, Ahri, Fizz, Katarina, LB, Wukong, J4. Champions that could benefit from buffing base damage following this logic = Kassadin, Shaco(now gutted by this recent patch), Akali, Elise.\r\n\r\n2. Tank: High base Armor, MR, and HP and scaling. Low damage scaling, medium base damage, Good utility, Low mobility. Impactful abilities means high mana costs. Champions that fit this description = Sejuani, Braum, Gragas, Alistar. \r\n\r\n3. Juggernaut: Good base damage, Good damage scaling, High base tank stats, low tank stat scaling. No/little mobility. The potential for burst. Champions= Darius, Garen, Cho&#039;Gath, Mord, Illaoi, Volibear.\r\n\r\n4. Bruiser: Medium tank base stats, decent tank stat scaling. High base damage, low damage scaling. decent mobility. Your jack of all trades type that can change based on items to be more durable or more hurtful. Champions that fit this= Riven, Vi, Hecarim, Olaf, Renekton, Malphite, Thresh, Trundle. \r\n\r\n5. Fighter: Decent base tank stats, low tank scaling. Decent base damage, High damage scaling. Relative mobility. Champions = Fiora, Master yi, Tryndamere, Jax, Graves.\r\n\r\n6. Marksman: Low tank stats, Low tank scaling. Low base damage, Best damage scaling. Mobility dependant on range/reach of marksman. Champions that come to mind = Vayne, Jinx, Jhin, Kai&#039;Sa. Champions that could be changed based on this logic = Mf base damage going down, scale going up, Ashe needs more damage scaling if shes not going to be allowed to kite like she&#039;s meant to. Sivir base damage needs to go down then mana cost can go down. Lucian scaling on passive to go up. Tristana, less base ability damage, more AA base damage, ability damage can scale better. Draven, base damage early to go down, increased damage for catching axes in combat. Twitch, needs a little bit more range or a little bit more MS. Kindred, can keep her damage scaling or even increase, lower base damage from Q and remove synergy with W while reducing its CD to something reasonable, base tank stats need to come down, jungle sustain can go up. Kog&#039;Maw, let his damage scale, lower his base damage, E needs to be more impactful, W cd and duration to go up. Varus, Q base damage buff, E scaling to go up, w proc needs some Ad scaling or increase in base damage. Ezreal, base damage to go down, Q bonus ad ratio to go up, W base damage to go up, R base damage to go down and Ad/Ap ratio to go up.\r\n\r\n7. Enchanters: Low cd, high regens, low tank stats, decent tank stat scaling, low base damage, decent damage scaling. Lower durations, more impactful ability. \r\n\r\n8. Mage: Decent base damage, Good scaling. Low base tank stats, ok tank stat scaling. Sustained ability costs/damage either high mana or low costs. Impactful abilities high CD, main damage low cd. Lissandra, Malz, Brand, Syndra. \r\n\r\nGetting too tired to make this polished so its comin out dirty and raw. With that in mind lemme know what you guys think, wouldn&#039;t it make sense for riot to balance their game to match this reality of what should be?","replies":[]}
