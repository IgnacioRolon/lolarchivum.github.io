Or cannot be viable without being useless*. Design flaw.\r\nBusted: Champions entire kit is bonkers.\r\n\r\n*If you&#039;re asking how this sentence makes sense. It doesn&#039;t, yet it applies to that champion. Ridiculous right?\r\n\r\nNote: This list won&#039;t cover champions that are strong/weak BECAUSE of the current META. In other words, champions that can be balanced through small or simple tweaks. And it also won&#039;t cover champions that get super strong once they&#039;re fed, don&#039;t feed them, duh.&quot;\r\n\r\n1. Shaco -Useless [Attributed by constant changes that have left him this way]\r\n2. Kha&#039;Zix -Garbage [Attributed by constant changes that have left him this way]\r\n3. Graves- Broken [Reworked a good champion into something with a flawed and imbalanced kit.]\r\n4. Vladimir- Broken [Reworked a good champion into something with a flawed and imbalanced kit.]\r\n5. Azir- ????? [You already know]\r\n6. Fiora- Broken [You already know]\r\n7. Gangplank- ????? [His E is stupid. Parts of his kit are unbalanced such as the ultimate upgrades. His kit synergy is flawed and ineffective in pro play]\r\n8. Ryze- ????? [You already know x 5]\r\n9. Nidalee- Broken [Cougar form reliant for damage, cougar form only useful if the burst can kill someone. Tag+Jump= Suicide most of the time. Requires tagging someone with Q to be able to go in with cougar effectively to kill someone meaning by the time they are marked they have probably already counterplayed you. Her human form should be her main form with cougar assisting for cleanup/takedown, not the other way around, AD nidalee proved human form playstyle is a lot more effective until riot made it unviable for some reason.]\r\n10. Jayce- Broken [If he can&#039;t do enough damage he&#039;s useless, wtf is his hammer form w supposed to do, tickle people?]\r\n11. Kalista- ????? [Requires real-time verbal communication to be effective]\r\n12. Maokai- Busted, ????? [His kit has damage, tons of cc, healing, and tankiniess. If he did no damage he&#039;d still be useful for something. His new ult is dumb too.]\r\n13. Mordekaiser- Broken, ?????. [It doesn&#039;t work without him being able to 3-hit people with his Q, apart from drag and getting ultimate kills the rest of his kit is irrelevant.]\r\n14. Kindred- Broken [Do you want a devourer playstyle to be good or not? Make up your mind riot and balance accordingly.]\r\n15. Rek&#039;Sao- Useless [What is this champion even meant to accomplish?]\r\n16. Sona- ????? [You changed her from an AoE backline support into a damage dealing front line support except she&#039;s super squishy? Rather play Raka for the healing and Zyra for the damage/cc. Sona&#039;s kit is too concentrated and is forced to sacrifice viability. She was fine before the rework but you changed her because she was &#039;boring&#039;? Her kit is literally the same except broken.]\r\n17. Zoe- ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????\r\n18. Zac- Busted [Kit is overloaded and ultimately fails at doing his job past engaging.] \r\n19. Wukong- Broken [Kit cannot synergise without being overpowered.]\r\n20. Yorick- Garbage \r\n21. Vi- Garbage [Kit needs help, not damage help, but usefulness help.]\r\n22. Nasus- Garbage\r\n23. Udyr- Broken\r\n24. Trundle- Broken\r\n25. Tryndamere- Broken, Useless [Only as strong as the items he can build. Relies on splitpush META. Doesn&#039;t really offer anything to the team.]\r\n26. Yasuo- Broken\r\n27. Olaf- Broken [Probably the perfect specimen of &#039;Drop off&#039; in league history. Goes from hero to hot garbage as soon as it&#039;s past early game]\r\n28.

Kha'zix is shit now, hes not broken lmao, i wasn't saying pre-nerf kha'zix was balanced, I was saying they changed him so many times for no reason which made him a broken champion which they had to nerf and because they made him broken he's now garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-28T02:28:54.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly it could have been anyone who downvoted - don't just pick someone and blame them for it because they happened to comment.\n\nSecondly there's an edit button on your posts - use that rather than just posting the same thing twice with more on the end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-06-28T05:01:51.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't downvote you, ya gronk :)\n\nLook, they make a lot of changes, and sometimes those changes suck monkey dick, so they need to backpedal.\n\nGive them some slack though. \n\nYou know there are, like, over 30 billion possible champion combinations on Summoners' Rift?\n\nJust try to understand what's strong and what's not. Yes, in a perfect world, it'd have Starcraft levels of balance. However, it's a much more dynamic game, so infinitely harder to achieve perfect balance.\n\nDO NOT USE SONA IN ANY OF MY GAMES.
