Late game an ADC neeko is useless because building AD doesnt scale well with her kit, AP does. Meanwhile you have full AD vayne 3 hitting everyone on the team and shredding tanks like butter. \n\nYou're not a competitive player if you build off meta, full stop. If you're not going to be competitive in ranked that is griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"Streeserz","date":"2019-03-04T07:49:45.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they were actually playing to win, then its fine.

Why intentionally handicap yourself and your team just because you think you're entitled to? I have nothing against giving yourself a challenge like this in non-ranked games. Ranked should only be about playing meta, or if you think you have something that can be a new meta try it. But by no means should a mage ever build as a marksman or vice versa. Even corki and ezreal, marksman that can build hybrid lean more towards their marksman strenths and that is because they are marksman and their builds utilize the hybrid builds. A neeko with IE and Shiv on the other hand is straight trolling. I understand this isn't going to be a popular opinion on forums because most of the people here are casual players but the vast majority of high mmr players agree with this statement which is why im curious as to the reason RIOT doesn't punish these types of players. \n\nIts not a matter of me being toxic to these kinds of players its just a general concern with gameplay, by definition it is griefing.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-04-29T09:11:50.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because this game is not run by a totalitarian regime, people can get creative if they want.

You are correct. Here i thought ranked games was about climbing the ladder but clearly I am so feeble minded as to assume that was the case. Clearly ranked is the game mode we choose  to play to theory craft and have fun with random builds.
