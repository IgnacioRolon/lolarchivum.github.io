Bitter and resentful personality, rather narssacistic and self-centred.\n\nAppearance: A malformed ibis humanoid\n\nKit:\n\nPassive- Jealousy - Killing champions, turrets, and epic monsters grant Ikthar bonus adaptive damage and range on his auto attacks and abilities for a limited amount of time. These bonuses may stack, additive stacks reset the duration.\n\nQ- Pester - Lashes his large beak out for a quick strike that disrupts enemy channels and deals damage in 180-degree radius in front of him.\n\nW- Flightless bird - Spreads his malformed wings and attempts to fly, only being able to push him forward in a small burst of speed, enemies hit are shoved behind his wings. This does little damage, successfully damaging a champion with this ability gives him a spell shield.\n\nE- Beckon - Ikthar jabs his target with the talons of his feet which deals initial damage, if the target runs from ikthar within 1 second of beckon they take bleed damage and are slowed. \n\nR- Fowl Corruption - Releases a large aoe wave of corrupted energy by flapping his wings that reduce the resistance of all enemies caught within it. Allies are given increased tenacity while inside his field of corruption. Ikthar can casts other abilities and move while channelling this ability (similar to swain). When ikthar and allies deal damage to enemies while inside this field of corruption, they gain adaptive damage and a shield based on a % of the damage they deal.","replies":[]}
