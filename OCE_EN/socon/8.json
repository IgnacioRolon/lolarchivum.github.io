However the game also changed in a way so that supports didn&#039;t have to spend so much gold on supporting. \n\nThe biggest offender of this being the changes to warding, how everyone gets a trinket instead of the support spending money on wards. Now they&#039;re getting all this gold that old supports would complain they needed for wards and they can spend it on whatever they like. This is not encouraging actual supporting but rather supports to get expensive damage items when they&#039;re not meant to. \n\nI feel like this has gone unnoticed with only the result being felt, like how players complain supports are too strong.\n\nBasically there was a support gold inflation. Their cost of living went down and their income went up when the income going up was ment to support their cost of living.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-08-29T05:31:59.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally, as a support main, I absolutely completely hate the new ward system, but not for the same reasons you do.\n\nIt isn't that support items offer too much gold that is warping the meta. It's that support items give too much gold for doing nothing but sit in lane, that is the problem. \n\nI know adcs don't want to be abandoned in the scarywary assassin meta, but it was much healthier for the game when the support actually did stuff. Most of the early to early-midgame in the current meta, supports only ward the 2 bushes into their lane, and they just sit there in lane, getting free gold from their support item, and not really doing anything outside of their lane. \n\nHarken back to a few seasons ago, if a Support wanted to carry, they would go aggressive in lane, get a bit of early pressure, and then they would rush a sightstone and they would control the botlane. If something happened on the bottom side of the map, it was support who made the calls. The support would roam mid, ward enemy jungle, pressure botlane, setup a wide net of river vision. They would get a lead on the enemy support and they would be proactive.\n\n The support wasn't necessarily stronger, even when ahead, they even had less gold, but their impact was higher early, and you could definitely see the difference between a good and a bad support. Through rotational knowledge (which is basically dead for botlane), through understanding minion wave control (also mostly dead for botlane), through knowing where and when to setup vision and clearing wards. \n\nMage supports, didn't do that much damage and were mainly poke damage or burst+cc, tank supports were less tanky than bruisers tops, enchanter and shield supports didn't have an early item powerspike and so just rushed a whole lot of different active items with supportive effects (when is the last time you've seen a support use a Mikaels?). \nBut the support was impactful because they had the opportunity to flex how much they understood or didn't understand the game. The average powerlevel was lower, but the support was still relevant, and even with less gold, less items, less stats, they had a major opportunity to snowball a game.\n\nWith the current support items, you can't 'rush' a sightstone, you don't get much from an early kill, the sightstone will take about the same time to complete no matter how you play. You must sit in lane, because a roam mid or invade with the jungler is going set you behind about 2min with your support item, about as bad if not worse than a death with the current death timers. There is very little incentive to try to make plays as a support, and you only risk putting your team's vision behind.\n----\nIn summary, they buffed passive support gold, slowed down sightstone, and discouraged variance between support players. So now supports have a stronger baseline which infuriates other roles, but less opportunity to 'defeat' the enemy support and carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-29T04:41:37.481+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. So do i, there is no incentive to buying damage, unless you're pyke in which its priority because of his kit, i play mages, enchanters and tanks all as supports i even play off meta shit like MF, Kayn, Darius etc, support is deemed by your ability to crowd control and your ability to put your adc ahead items are not part of this (unless you go non-committals like rylais, IBG, etc.) does it matter if the brand builds ap but still ends up with a lower kill count because s/he knows how to let the adc last hit, its on the adc to work with the support, but if your adc is garbage as is the case in low-mid elo, its better to go a secondary carry on the chance that you may not HAVE to carry\n\n2. Enchanters don't sit back, are you ok? enchanters like lulu, like janna are there to keep the adc safe whilst also poking/disengaging the opponents\n\n3. No, i've been playing league since season 3, a sole support main since mid-late season 4, at no point has the cost of support items incentivised the purchase of damage items, the only reason mages exist in bot, is because riot nerfed them in the mid lane making them glorified supports, i still build things like redemption on mage supports even on tanks if the game needs it, and still end with better KP than most other people in my rank atm according to stats everything (excluding damage per minute) is on par with that of plat/dia players, my warding is that of challenger, im a silver 1/gold 5, its not a case of damge vs tanks its a case of you can't play them mid coz they're too shit, may as well take them bot so they can get a helping hand, the minute riot reverts the nerfs mages will leave bot and go back to mid/top lane\n\n4. i wasn't referring to lcs [snip], i was refering to an average game, in lcs games barely last 25 mins if you're lucky, but in solo queue these games can go from 15 mins up to 75 mins+ allowing for full build\n\n5. at what point is this an argument about bad players, it was a comment on the state of playing support, you sometimes have to swap items and that makes the role more expensive since sell value is 3/4 of its orignal price (i think, math was never my strong point)\n\n6. if solo queue is the problem, don't play it, or alternatively find another role, utility mid is basically support just with carry potential. the likes of Oriana, Ziggs, even Brand or Syndra if they're not banned away","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-29T03:39:53.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. If you haven't read/played/watched any support games, you wouldn't understand, however if you have then you'd know that at the early stage of the game (ie. pre 10 mins) trinkets are the only support item you can afford, in past seasons you could get sightstone first back\n2. If you look now, supports get supp item and 2 pots, that's it they have less sustain in lane, and are easily bullied out\n3. Supports items are fucking expensive, if you build right and you're in an average game where you get 10 or less assists in laning, and 10 more throughout the game (THIS IS AN AVERAGE GAME, KILLS/ASSISTS ARE NOT EVERYTHING, SOME GAMES HAVE MORE OTHERS HAVE LESS)\n4. In order of moments you hit 6 items, the roles of adc and support are generally last to hit full build (unless they have a good game)\n5. support items also require you to pay attention to your opponents, your team and yourself, making it harder to itemise appropriately (in low elo anyways). Meaning you could get halfway through a game realise that one of your items in underused and the stats don't seem to be making a difference so you sell and replace, making it arguably more expensive to play the role\n6. this is your  second post hating on supports, needless to say you must be the typical player that blames supports for everything that goes wrong if its such a problem role, go play top lane, where you're not really required for the team and can just afk farm","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-08-29T04:09:06.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. I play support regularly so yes I understand, it is you that doesnt understand what im saying. I don't strictly mean a sightstone, you used to be able to buy wards individually. You have enough gold on your firs back as a support for a longsword or amp tomb at the very least which is a problem when supports are provided with a stable income and will build into damage items later into the game. \n\n2. Thus incentivising poke champions in lane which usually translates to more damage focused champions that can bully out tanks and enchanters that literally sit back and do nothing all game except enable the adc to farm.\n\n3. Which incentivise buying damage items. You THINK support items are expensive but that is only because they are an all in one item, they have ABSURD GOLD VALUE for what you pay for. You don't even need to upgrade the item to the max tier, you can leave it at the second. Again, enabling players to opt into damage focused builds.\n\n4. False statement, go watch lcs. Plus most games don't go past 4 items.\n\n5. An argument based around bad players isn't an argument at all. I can say adc soraka is op because I played it in bronze and got a pentakill (this has happened).\n\n6. Support is my best role LOL.  Im not blaming supports for anything, Im saying riot is turning the role that I love into a secondary carry role. I mean just look at pyke and all the mages in bot lane. I don't hate the support role I hate the support meta in solo q.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lemon Chicken","date":"2018-08-29T23:13:47.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You complain about wards not being bought but I bet you don't have 3 pinks in your inventory every single time you back.\nI probably go through 15+ pinks a game, I'm constantly moving them pending the composition of the enemy team (eg, do they have flanking champions etc). If we are sieging I'll drop pinks, if we move from the siege to baron/rift/dragon I'l l drop a pink. I'll waste a pink in a bush just to stall the enemy team while they clear it.\n\nIf you are simply warding the 2 bushes in lane you aren't playing correctly. You need to be pressuring your lane and warding inside the enemy jungle. If you ward the only 2 entrances to the jungle and pink the tri, there is only 1 viable path for the jungler to gank without being seen and that's straight down the lane. The jungle wards also show your team the current location of the jungler.\n\nA support is \"meant\" to buy whatever items are going to help the team win. People need to stop with this mentality that a support is only there as the teams little bitch. I played a game just yesterday and we absolutely dumpstered the bot lane. So what, I'm not going to waste my gold on an ardent (I'm a Janna main), I'm going to amplify the snowball so that _**I**_ am part of the snowball. So I rushed a seal into sorcery boots into twin shadows. I literally solo ganked the midlane while the enemy ADC was pushing and killed them 1v1. You think I could do that if I just built the items I'm \"meant\" to build. Hell no. I build according to each game. If we really need that big team fight presence you know I'll be rushing redemption, got a jax that's 10/0 and is likely your teams carry, you know I'll go either Mikaels/Athenes or Ardent/Athenes because I look and I recognise the win condition and I build accordingly.\n\nThere is absolutely NOTHING wrong with building damage on a support.\n\nYou should be always on the lookout for rotations. There is not a rule written anywhere that says you have to stay in your lane. If I have a potato ADC I will literally abandon the lane and roam with the jungler ganking lanes. I'm here to win and if my ADC isn't stepping up to the plate, I'm not hanging with that dead weight.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-30T07:11:41.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lemon Chicken,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=7upffPhI,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-08-29T23:13:47.870+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with building damage on a support.\n> \n\nPREACH IT","replies":[]}]}]}
