The sustain it gives is way too high and makes laning too safe to the point its no longer beneficial to trade. \r\n\r\nI feel this can be fixed pretty easily just by shuffling the runes around to this\r\n\r\n1- Demolish, Second wind, Bone plating\r\n2- Iron skin, Mirror Shield, Conditioning, Revitalize\r\n3- Font of life, Unflinching, Overgrowth\r\n\r\nSimple improvement hopefully a rioter sees this and notes it down.","replies":[]}
