Don't buy boots unless you have money to burn and you want to drop 1100 on Ionian boots.\r\n\r\nPlaystyle: Early game you don't want to be attached to your adc the whole time. You actually want to detach to use your passive every time its off cooldown and harass with autos, then when they turn back to attack you jump on your adc to avoid damage and throw a Q. Save your E for when your adc is below 50% during fights.\r\n\r\nTeam Fighting: Depending on how the fight starts you want to play differently. Your Q is good for catching people out of position and also for peeling. Your ult is also best used as peel for your adc but you could always jump on your tank and try to root the whole enemy team. Jump from champ to champ healing the lowest but always end up back with your adc to give them the damage bonus of your W + Ardent\r\n\r\nLevelling: I like to start E for jungler leash, then get Q.

But yeah you'd probably be better off picking up another forbidden idol or fiendish codex at that price.\n\nPersonally I like to play Yuumi as a slightly more co-dependent version of Rakan. \n\nGuardian-demolish-boneplates-revitalise, Transcendance-gathering storm.\nBuilding shields with ancient coin into ardent/redemption/knights vow/athenes/locket\nmax e into w and finally q, like rakan but with more shields and less cc.\nboots are overrated.\n\nalternatively, if you like memes; Glacial full AP Yuumi, start spellthiefs, Rush Gunblade, Sorc boots, Twin Shadows, Zhonias, Morrellos finish with Shurelias. \nmax q into w, focus on jumping around and sticking to the bruiser giving them a bit of ranged catch potential with the glacial slow zones and a bit more stats into their damage. Can make a Darius/Hecarim/Jax/Irelia a whole lot scarier.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-05-17T06:09:55.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i feel like yuumi actually has a lot of options and it depends on the lane. If you're vsing a kill lane guardian is pretty good for shutting that down as well as taking heal and exaughst with the adc taking barrier. In a poke lane you can take arcane comet which is guaranteed on every Q you land with the slow. Aery is a good in between poke and sustain but really you should lean towards one playstyle. If you're vsing a heal lane then it depends on the healer, if you're vsing soraka taking arcane comet is good because you can punish soraka specifically and she cant heal herself, but with sona you kinda just play passive and scale with guardian or aery. \n\nAfter some games i also dont recommend athenes every time, I prefer rushing ardent and going into hextech glp. Its really good when you're ahead. If you're going arcane comet you'd also obviously take Q level 1 instead of E and maybe tank afew hits for your jungler instead of using E.","replies":[]}]}]}
