Currently from what i understand, is your first pick is of the highest priority and you will only be given your second pick based on que time and the popularity of that pick. However people like me don&#039;t really fuss much about what role we get as long as its between our two most practiced roles. As someone who enjoys adc as much as I play jungle from time to time I really can&#039;t choose myself. Someone however who would really like to play adc instead of jungle, would lose adc to me if i was simply in que longer. \r\n\r\nSo my proposition is to choose the % from 50-100 of your preference between the two roles. That way the system will have an easier time pick who gets what role, and people won&#039;t feel as frustrated since they&#039;ll be getting the role they really want more often. \r\n\r\nThere will be 3 choices, 50, 75, and top priority (90-100%). And you&#039;ll only have to pick the priority of your first role, not your second.\r\n\r\nSo yeah just a quick idea, let me know what you guys think.","replies":[]}
