Their changes are to make regular minions worth less gold and cannons worth more. The angle that i see them going for is to make cannons worth more and therefore contested so laners would fight over them. However something like would either warrent an all in or the laner giving up health happily to take the cannon since its the only minion worth trading health for. Every other minion is not worth trading health for. Caster minions especially will be down to 14 gold from 17. This is an extremely bad decision  as the caster minions, in particular, should be INCREASED in gold to make going into the back of the enemy minion wave more appealing, thus putting them into a vulnerable position, thus creating conflict between the laners. Making the normal minions worth less will only promote roaming during the 2 normal waves since the only minion that matters in terms of farming is the cannon (at least consistently). \r\n\r\nThis is another prime example of riot not understanding the inner workings of their own game and how laning interactions work . Ask yourself, why do pro players take minion dematerializer? So they can safely take the gold from caster minions and not fight for it. SO, shouldn&#039;t it make sense to INCREASE the gold of casters? Since those are the minions people need to fight for? Its about the positioning, not the gold itself. So if you don&#039;t at least make the gold reward worth going for, people aren&#039;t going to risk putting themselves into a bad position. Its already bad enough that the new runes make laning so passive and safe, making minions worth less gold just makes no sense, how does that promote staying in lane and playing aggressively? \r\n\r\nMy suggestion? \r\n\r\nThe whole minion wave should be worth more gold, the gold should not just shift to cannons. Melee should be worth 19, and casters should be worth 18, cannons should be worth 45 still (There is no reason to up the gold, its already huge enough).  Now the wave is still worth the same amount of gold BUT you have to fight to get the gold you want. Or even take 6 gold off the cannon and make melee worth 21. \r\n\r\nAs i see it there is literally no point going for caster minions if they&#039;re worth 14 gold. There is no reason to overextend and make trades for casters, there just isnt. You would need 3.5 caster minions to buy 1 potion. One wave? You think people are going to spend their hp to take the back wave when its not even worth 50 gold? Like come on dude. What is this? Heroes of the storm?","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-03-22T04:05:13.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about the minons learning to cs\nive played games where one of my minons is attacking a minon the minon is on 100 hp so i need to hits to kill it thehn the minons that was attacking the minon on 100 hp moves to attack another minon so i attack the minon on 100 hp i hit it once then the minon that was hitting the minon on 100 hp turns around and kills the minon that i was about the kill","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-22T04:31:03.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Casters do 16, melee do 5.

At the moment, 1 kill in lane is about 15 cs. With this change, it will become about 20 cs. It will become much harder to win a lane if you die unless you manage to kill the enemy laner again. \n\nAlso, imagine the gold loss on dying during a cannon wave. Your death already puts you back 20 cs. Now you will lose 6 more cs to tower AND a cannon (which is where the majority of the gold you need to make a comeback will come from). Instead of a deficit of ~23 cs before, it will now be a deficit of ~35-40 cs.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis also means roaming champions like TF, Taliyah, Talon, and ASol will be punished for roaming at a bad time or for their roam being unsuccessful. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnd Bot lane will become even stronger. Not just because of the larger gold advantage on champions that require a lot of gold for their late-game kits, but also because of Supports becoming stronger and getting their items faster. \n\nThink about it. Thanks to their gold items, their income was always a % of the gold taken from minions. With minions being worth less and Supports still getting the same amount of gold, that % effectively increases.

It may make things more snowbally which i guess is what all these kids have been complaining about but i dont know if this is the right way to do it. The real issue is the roaming meta and riot has pointed this out. This won't fix people roaming, it will promote it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-19T00:26:02.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd argue that you're forgetting ranged champion matchups, especially mage mids. For mage mids, the caster minions are super easy to last hit, whereas when you're forced under tower, melee and cannon minions are easy to miss and may force you to expend mana rather judiciously to try to not lose too much gold. \n\nFor melee matchups, caster minions are indeed the hardest to secure. However melee bruisers are most commonly found in toplane, a lane that normally promotes a passive scaling playstyle in the current meta (with the exception of a few bruisers like darius, camille, riven and fiora). Not a push and roam playstyle. Winning toplane atm in low elo tends to be more dependent on which toplaner can setup a freeze and deny.\n\nIt's a very complicated matter, and I doubt riot will consult any high elo coaches about how they'd like to reshape the game, so riot will inevitably get it wrong the first few times.\n\nI'm silver trash so I don't think I have enough knowledge to give any suggestions, but I think it's not as simple as you're suggesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T14:42:39.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pointed out ranged match ups when i said \"why do you think pro players take minion dematerializer\" which refers to the mid lane match ups where no one wants to overextend to take ranged minions.
