While you may not be able to use it on towers, you can cast the spell on minion waves which gives wuk the attack speed which he can then use on towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-10-11T10:42:44.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's decent but i wouldnt say its super strong, only after maybe hydra if you get one that game he becomes good with wave clear buts its not as strong as others","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-08T00:52:39.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll say you still need to add lategame jinx (the minigun +70% atk speed makes her kill towers so fast, then rockets waveclear kiting with the hyper passive which also gives her more atk speed and then kill the next tower with minigun again and if anyone tries to stop you, you can run away or kite them to death, which in turn gives her more atk speed), kayle (stacks atk speed and a rageblade and her e gives her extra free magic damage to towers and the splash damage obliterates minion waves), the old classic Azir (high ap and atk speed from his w and nashors tooth and can setup a tower behind himself and ult you into it for added safety) and of course Ashe and Sivir (because Ashe's q volley melts towers and her w provides waveclear, and sivir because of her w bounces allowing her to focus only the tower and yet still clear the entire minion wave before it can hit her own and it's an aa reset and her q pushes fast too and she has the ult for safety when doing so).\n\nI feel these are all as, if not more potent turret killers than some you've mentioned, especially jinx. Like seriously once jinx gets an item or two, if you leave her alone with a tower, it's going to be dead in a few seconds, her attack speed and raw dps, the waveclear from rockets, her passive giving her even more atk speed stacking infinitely if she kills something, her objective taking speed is insane early game compared to alot of other adcs, it's just her burst is not great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-07T23:45:59.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and trist has strong clear too\n\nvayne q is a \"strong auto attack\" too\n\njax auto reset is w not e\n\nwukong q is a strong auto attack on low cd and resets\n\nxin q is strong auto and resets\n\ntrundle q resets ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-10-04T01:18:38.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Udyr should definitely be here.

It's hard to snowball as a donger but if he gets ahead and sets up camp somewhere, nothing on this earth can move him short of a 5man gank or if he decides to go solo baron whilst you desperately try to resolve the backlog of huge minions waves he's been watching over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-04T01:03:28.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot Nunu (solo or especially with a high damage teammate his atk speed buff makes rushing turrets ridiculous), The Donger (he can siege turrets so hard and splitpush or he can just use all his turrets at once to 1v1 a turret without minions only using a zzrot) and kayle (because she's always been good at this), also you have to consider something like azir (even currently) or Zilean or Zyra are all good at waveclearing and sieging turrets. Depends on how you want to take the turret, is it solo splitpush, with minions, without minions, siege-ing a tower during a teamfight, taking first turret blood ect... Also pretty much any adc can melt a tower if unchecked especially a few with aa enhancements such as Ashe, Sivir and Jinx (god she can kill towers quickly mid-lategame).","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-03T23:42:55.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin or Udyr in my opinion with attack speed OP","replies":[]}]}
