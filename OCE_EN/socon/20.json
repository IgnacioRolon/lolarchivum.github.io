However what is known is that his true identity has been missing from the city of ionia for many years following an accident with a mystical willow tree known as the tree of dreams. A sacred tree rumoured to speak to those who dream at night. Approximately five years ago, a boy was seen sleepwalking towards the tree before setting it on fire and dissapearing completely. Since then people are no longer spoken to in their dreams by the tree. But sometimes instead, sweet dreams turn to horrific nightmares before having memories of such terrors completely wiped from their memories. \r\n\r\nWeapon: I will leave general appearance up to the imagination but as an adc he would need a weapon, well this particular adc fires projectiles of light from his hands. The way I envisioned him, however, was as an ethereal being. \r\n\r\nPassive - Tree of dreams: Gains increased mana regen while out of combat - Lore: While out of combat he closes his eyes and connects to the realm of dreams which invigorates him and fills him with mana.\r\n\r\nQ - Dream essence: Stores five charges, pressing the ability uses a q charge and lobs a projectile that deals small aoe damage. Holding q consumes one charge per .5 seconds and increases the damage and range of his q but loses the aoe portion of the ability and becomes a slow-moving point and click homing ability if it consumes all 5 charges. Charges generate slowly over time, much faster when out of combat. **Enemies hit by this are marked**. - Lore: Expends pure mana and fires it in a volatile fashion, this mana seeps into the enemies body and makes them susceptible to his powers.\r\n\r\nW - Nightmare: Fear all marked enemies and damage them slightly, gain a shield for the same amount of damage dealt. Damage is doubled while &quot;just a dream&quot; is activated. \r\n\r\nE - Dream Eater: Activate to gain a small movement speed and slow enemies that are **marked **on hit. Every consecutive auto attack on marked enemies reduces the cooldown of Ellik&#039;s nightmare and dream essence ability by a fraction of a second. \r\n\r\nR - Just a dream: While activated Ellik&#039;s auto attacks mark enemies, enemies he fears with nightmare have their memory of him erased and making them believe he never existed. This causes them to lose vision of Ellik and those around him (guardian range) for the remainder of his ultimates duration, however, if he attacks an enemy who has had their memory erased they gain vision of him again. \r\n\r\nPlaystyle: A marksman with low mobility but high kiting ability, he&#039;s an ad carry that can peel for himself. In lane, you want to harass your enemy with your q when trading, if they try to trade back or engage you can use nightmare to fear them away, when it comes time to go for the kill, you can pop your e and chase the enemy down. If they run away on low hp and you managed to gain max stacks on q while hitting them, you can hold the charge to gain range beyond your auto range and finish them with a fully charged homing q. In team fights, you will want to use your ultimate to erase the memory of high threat targets while you kill off the rest of the team. Requires great micromanagement and skill for a playstyle like this but rewarding.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-09T16:41:09.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Way too much CC for an ADC to have.\n\nRemember, that Ashe is a CC heavy champion (slow and stun) and is mostly utility, but this is even worse because of how he works having a Slow and a Fear, and then a movement speed increase and the ability to be untargetable by a champ he decides on.\n\nYou just can't have a Marksman that can become invisible to an assassin, that is just too much.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-09T16:52:09.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Removing the slow might make it more balanced. And a good assassin would never be caught by his ultimate since they need to be hit then feared, they should wait until his fear has been used then kill him. But tbh assassins haven't been meta in a long time.","replies":[]}]}]}
