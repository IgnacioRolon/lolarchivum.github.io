As someone who loves creating things I was inspired by the songs to make a new champion to have a warsong theme to him. I know we have Sona and Bard but they don&#039;t really fit the description of a war hardened champion. \n\nSo without further ado I bring you Haneul, The Warsong. \n\n**About:** Haneul is a futuristic bard. In a world where a tyrant reigns over runeterra, weapons are no longer something just anyone can get their hands on. Now a small rebel group called the warsongs fight to bring control back to the people, using technology and music as a means to bring freedom and liberty back to the land. \n\n**Passive - Warsong:** Whenever Haneul lands an ability he and the one ally nearest to the target hit are healed for 10/15/20/25% (increasing with ultimate level) of their missing hp and get a small movement speed buff. 30/25/20/15 second cooldown.\n\n**Q - Shock Therapy:** Haneul sends out a sonic wave from his futuristic gloves, deafening all enemies it hits and distorting their sense. This ability does damage on hit. Targets who are deaf become immune to the primary effect of Haneuls abilities but suffer from a secondary effect instead. Enemies remain deaf for 3 seconds.\n\n**W - Cadence: **Hanuel creates a circular/cylindrical barrier of sound at a target location (1 second delay). Enemies caught within it have their defenses harshly damaged and rapidly deteriorate. Losing a % of their armor and magic resistance and are additionally slowed by 40% which reduces to 0 over 3 seconds. Enemies have their defenses down for 2.5 seconds. \n\n_Down Time: _If a deaf enemy is caught within the sound barrier they are put to sleep for 1/1.5/2/2.5/3 seconds. If a target takes damage from Haneuls next ability while they are still asleep they are Shockley awoken, taking 20% increased damage from that ability. If the target takes damage from another champion, the sleep effect is prematurely ended with no other effects.\n\n\n**E - Shatter Point:** Haneul spends a 1.5 seconds to vibrate a target enemy by creating ripples of sound inside of them. After 2 seconds the vibrations become unstable and they take large amounts of damage. \n\n_Counter Point:_ If the target is deafened they take less damage but their muscles contract and are thrown towards Haneul.\n\n**R - Show Time: **Haneul activates the full power of his suit, coating himself with sound vibrations for 10 seconds. While show time is active, he takes 20/30/40% less damage from abilities and may choose to cast Aria.\n\n_Aria:_ Using this ability ends Show Time. Haneul sends a shockwave from his suit, expending its vibrations in a large radius around him, this deals damage and trances enemies. Its effectiveness is based on how long &#039;&#039;show time&#039;&#039; was active. The longer it is duration was, the weaker the effects. Tranced enemies have 99%-10% reduced attack speed for 3-0.5 seconds and a 3-0.5 second delay on casting abilities.\n\n_Attack Level: 3\nDefense Level: 7\nAbility Level: 7\nDifficulty Level: 10_","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-15T18:47:54.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why are people making creations when he new champ is not out yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-15T23:48:40.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because new interesting idea's such as this spontaneously arise, and whether or not the new champ is out yet has almost no bearing on a new concept what so ever.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-15T23:45:30.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very cool concept!","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-01-16T07:05:45.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}
