They wanted an item to create a unique play style,  but as an item, it was easily abused and built by everyone. So in honour of this great item, why not introduce a champion with the banner of command play style in his kit? I present the Ultra, minion of command. \r\n\r\nAbout Ultra: He was a cannon minion that grew really really big. Then the cannon grew big too. Don&#039;t question it, he&#039;s beautiful. He is taller than a yordle, but shorter than a regular champion. He was a malfunction with the nexus where it accidentally mutated a minion instead of summoning a champion. Or whatever the lore on that is now. He is a medium ranged champion, more than a top laner, less than an adc.\r\n\r\nHe can control waves with his Q to make the wave push towards you by making your minions aggro the enemy. He can make the wave push towards the enemy with his W. He can freeze waves with his e. Though most importantly is his ultimate ability banner of command which allows him to siege the enemy.\r\n\r\nPassive - The Ultra Minion: Ultra is worth half the usual gold of a champion and has lower base stats compared to a usual champion. When he dies he spawns a minion wave worth half his weight in gold. [If he is worth 600 gold he will spawn a minion wave worth 300 gold since he himself is only worth 300. If he is only worth 100 gold then he&#039;ll only spawn 50 gold worth of minions.]\r\n\r\nQ - Fire in the hole: Ultra fires the cannonball from the cannon that&#039;s on his back down the lane and damages all enemy targets it passes through, stopping at the first champion hit. If a champion is hit by fire in the hole all allied minions start focusing them. Deals 30% damage to minions. Scales with AD. \r\n\r\nW - Double time: Active; Ultra and all the allied minions around him gain increased attack speed and movement speed.\r\nPassive; Whenever Ultra kills an enemy minion he steals their power and gains 1 AD capping at 150 AD.\r\n\r\nE - Take Five: All enemies within a radius similar to amumu ult radius are slowed, this ability is toggled and consumes mana every second. Champions are slowed by 5% while inside the field. Enemy minions are slowed by 50%. All minions start to more regenerate health while they are within the field.\r\nPassove; If any minion dies while take five is active, ultra is healed by 20% of that minions max hp.\r\n\r\nR - The Banner Of Command:  Ultra buffs a minion super like the old banner of command. But can store 3 charges. Costs %20/15/10/ max health, and mana to cast.","replies":[]}
