It doesn't reduce magic resist and armour by a larger amount each auto. So its better in some regards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-10T01:12:22.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disrupt cancels channeling abilities. So if you were up against a sion and he was charging his q, if you q'd him it would cancel it. The aoe blind is only for half  second anyway. His w isn't like sion as it doesn't get stronger overtime and he is forced to sit through the whole animation, it doesn't knockup, it knocksback. His e is unique, there are tonnes of champions with dashes with each one doing a different thing, You say disrupting is not a type of cc then you say it is like its a problem. It doesn't sound like you really know what you're talking about. \n\nThe reason there's the stun on his e is because it combos with his w, they get stunned for 1 second while he channels volcano for 1 second. Without landing his stun he wouldn't reliably land his w. \n\nIf you compare this to Ekko, Ekko has a;\n\nAoe slow\nAoe stun\nMove speed buff\nDash\n\nExcept he's a mage and this guy would be a tank or bruiser. Nautalise which is a tank has;\n\nA hook\nA stun on every auto attack\nAn aoe slow\nAn aoe knockup\n\nMalphite has an;\nAoe knockup unstoppable dash\nAoe attack speed debuff\nMove speed syphon\n\nMaokai has;\nAoe root\nSingle target root\nAoe slow on two abilities\n\n\nSo as you can see it depends on the role of the champion. I would personally love playing a champion like this. I suppose the blind could be removed in favour of nearsighted but that would be worse than a blind in my opinion and it'd last longer than half a second or it'd be useless.","replies":[]}]}]}
