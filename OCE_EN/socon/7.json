I&#039;m not gonna waste everyones time and preach reasons as to why you should listen to me so im just going to leave my thoughts in dot points.\r\n\r\n1. Only one jungle item is bad: \r\nLimiting jungle items to simply one jungle item limits diversity and strategy for actually viable junglers who don&#039;t need their hand held.\r\n\r\n2. Junglers reliant on certain jungle items will become horrible: \r\nNo one wants a fiesta of &#039;pick this jungler or suffer&#039; and no one wants to see their old picks being shutdown. For example, leesin will basically become useless without his ward stacks (no one wants to use pink wards to ward hop like that&#039;s just stupid), and duelists who need to be killing tanks and bruisers will suffer without red smite. Thus, we&#039;re only gonna see tank cc junglers back in the meta and no one wants that. . \r\n\r\n3. The new jungle item made to replace the three is actually horrible:\r\nWhat&#039;s the point of giving a reward for counter jungling when that reward does effectively nothing? We can only have 1 pink ward out at a time and our stacks refresh when we go back to base, so whats the point of having over 1 stack of pink wards anyway? No one is going to be using pink wards that fast, not to mention sweeping trinket does the job of controlling vision instead of using pink wards for objectives like dragon and baron anyway. I get that the continuous pinks will help protect your jungle but that&#039;s also a redundant goal. You made it so that it will reward you for counter jungling, but also protects you from it, and since everyone has it, what&#039;s the point?\r\n\r\nThe 10% lifesteal is only useful on champions that utilise auto attacks, making ap junglers like elise, ivern, and evelyn, unable to even utilise this properly. The mana portion of the item is also useless on champions that don&#039;t use mana as their primary resource, and also promotes jungling with off-meta champions who aren&#039;t capable of jungling due to mana costs like most mages. The tooth and nail stat again, is only useful on champions who struggle with clearing the jungle. Thus the only good thing about the new smite is the active portion on champions, which is essentially the active on blue smite...\r\n\r\n4. Already good junglers will be too efficient:\r\nChampions who already are fast at clearing the jungle and staying healthy while utilising mana such as Kayn, will become too efficient at clearing their jungle with the health restoration on smite, the mana regen on the new item, and the damage boost for tooth and nail. Kayn and champions like him will be too efficient at jungle clears and have nowhere to go if all lanes are pushed. Meaning there&#039;s no real reason for junglers to even buy this item if they don&#039;t need the help. I would imagine people buying machete or talisman then not even bother upgrading their jungle item at all because it literally offers them nothing. \r\n\r\n5. There&#039;s nothing wrong with the current jungle items:\r\nIf it ain&#039;t broke, why break it? There is literally NOTHING wrong with jungling at the moment and it is in my opinion one of the most balanced and diverse roles at the moment and the only role I enjoy playing. I really don&#039;t see how a change like this is beneficial in any shape or form. It kind of feels like riot is saying &quot;Well jungle is pretty tough so lets make it easy and forgiving to play whoever you want in the jungle&quot; except forgetting that for BALANCE reasons, some junglers AREN&#039;T MEANT TO.\r\n\r\n6. No such thing as a &quot;good&quot; jungler:\r\nCatch up exp is already so high, having a jungle item like this just makes playing jungle way too forgiving. There is no reward for good jungling and you become reliant on your laners to get anywhere. Back in the day I&#039;d tell people who don&#039;t understand the game to play support and get a feel for the game, now I&#039;d tell them to play jungle because there is literally no such thing as a good or bad jungler. Just junglers who can and can&#039;t smite baron and dragon.\r\n\r\n7. It&#039;s pink:\r\nI want my primary colours.\r\n\r\n8. Mashing in together a bunch of old smite effects doesn&#039;t make it a good item.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Meta will be catagorised into tank junglers and junglers that don&#039;t even need the new item. CC and Gank central. No more counter jungling. Low mmr trolls incoming due to how easy clearing jungle will be, yay swain and malz jungle? I honestly hate how hand holding jungle will become.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-08T04:01:18.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They already took away support items, now they're moving on to jungle items?

Homogenize everything, reducing SKILL in the game, has been happening since the juggernauts updates in season 5. And changing the jungle every year for the sake of it.\n\nRemember when they:\n\n- made it easier for noobs to hear when baron and dragon was taken, so they didn't have to time it or ward it?\n- made it easier for noobs by notifying when buffs are spawning on the mini-map\n\nWhy reduce the skill of the game? Its been disappointing that Riot do this. haven't even talked about how they reduced the skill needed to play certain champions, e.g. Graves, Alistar.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-08T06:11:00.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, I remember back in the day when jungle camps would share exp even if you were on the other side of a wall and the mid laner would leash blue with 2 autos and an ability just to be safe they didn't take it. \n\nAnd yes I used to be a really good at the old graves, my best champ and even outplayed my diamond friends in skirmishes before they reworked him. And I hate how they made combos easy like how ali will just pulverisze at the end of his headbutt if you just mash the buttons, same with kha'zix jump now.

Heaps of insentivize. Over half the junglers don't even use dirk and the good counter junglers like nunu have no reason to even buy it. If they really wanted to reward players with counter jungling they could just make it so early game jungle gold is higher from clearing the enemy jungle.
