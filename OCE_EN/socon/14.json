I&#039;ve never reached the stage of 25 game chat restriction and I&#039;m currently working on reforming my own behavior and so far its going well. Turns out playing easy supports like Janna and raka take a lot off stress off your shoulders :P \r\n\r\nBut this post isn&#039;t about me. It&#039;s about the league community and the game, specifically in Oceania since that is my server. The community here is very broad. There are the quiet types who say nothing throughout the whole game, the extremely toxic type who just flame the whole game, the really positive and supportive types, the pretenders, the instigators, and the leavers. Firstly I&#039;ll talk about the leavers.\r\n\r\nThe leavers are the type to die once to an early gank from an aggressive jungler, blame their jungler for doing their first clear instead of ganking, then proceed to disconnect. This player then reconnects exactly at 20 mins to put up a surrender vote. Now, simply looking at chat logs won&#039;t bring any justice for these type of people. You need to see the game. Riot seems to focus solely on flamers and ignore these type of people. Just because they reconnected, doesn&#039;t mean they had accidentally disconnected. I&#039;d rather have a flamer who is decent and plays the game be on my team than having my mid laner afk at 5 mins in. The remake proposal, while helping some situations, doesn&#039;t do justice for these type of people. Riot needs to take a closer look into afk reports and punish them.\r\n\r\nNext are the instigators. These people are the real problem with the community. They&#039;re the ones who fester and create toxic players. They themselves aren&#039;t toxic, and on the surface seem like the average joe; however the instigator creates situations in which the person they are talking to can respond in a seemingly toxic way. The instigator makes you go from: | to: / in a matter of seconds. To bring what im trying to say into light ill use an example. The mid laner is a yasuo and the jungler is voli bear. Yasuo is doing relatively well in lane and winning in terms of trading, pressuring and cs. Yasuo decides to try and make a play, but unfortunately, he is ganked just as he goes to make it and dies. The volibear then proceeds to type in chat &quot;Why?&quot;. Just typing out this situation tilts me. That &quot;Why?&quot; is what takes the salt and frustration of being ganked at the wrong time to a higher level and multiplies it by 50. The yasuo has a few options to respond, he can either not say anything and mute the volibear and try to recover, he can reply sarcastically, but in most situations, he&#039;s going to just say &quot;Shut the fuck up&quot; or something along those lines. Asking someone &quot;Why?&quot; when they die is one of the biggest scumbag things to do and doesn&#039;t help anyone. Players who are provoked by instigators shouldn&#039;t be punished as long as they don&#039;t intentionally feed or afk. Constantly being questioned about your moves puts you on edge for the rest of the game. Sure the yasuo could have taken the former option of muting the voli, but the voli could have simply not said anything, or, he could have said &quot;bl, ill come for a gank soon&quot;\r\n\r\nThe others I don&#039;t feel like i need to go too in depth into. But now I&#039;ll get to my MAIN point. \r\n\r\nPlayers should be punished in accordance to the offence. If they&#039;re only being toxic by flaming people then instead of permanently ban their account; Completely remove in game chat privileges so that they can no longer send messages. Account bans should only be given to people who intentionally ruin games by feeding the enemy, trolling, game throwing, etc. Players that afk too many times should have lengthy bans from RANKED play, until they sort out their connection issues, or just decide to stop being dicks that don&#039;t want to try and participate in the game or work as a team. Handing out account bans for flaming is in my opinion pretty harsh, especially when it could just be someone with anger issues. Removing their chat ability protects them from them self, and i feel like handing out periodic chat bans was a good step in the right direction and proves effective. So why not keep down that path? If these chat banned players decide to be toxic in other ways like intentionally feeding or afking in ranked matches, then there can be account bans or the aforementioned restrictions. A lot of people spend a lot of money on their account, I&#039;ve personally spent $990 on this game im probably going to spend more money on it in the future. Slowly clipping away at players privileges will send them a big enough message for them to realize that soon enough their account isn&#039;t going to be worth playing on anyway and keep it around to at least have casual games in normal matches. \r\n\r\nYou could argue that an account with its privileges clipped away might as well be banned/deleted and that the player should just make a new account. And for some people that might be the case. But for the majority, they&#039;d rather still have their account, especially their main one still with them, no matter how battered and broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2016-05-12T05:52:29.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too long, didn't care. buy a diary and learn to use the mute button.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-05-14T05:19:16.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wasn't aware this post was made for you","replies":[]}]}]}
