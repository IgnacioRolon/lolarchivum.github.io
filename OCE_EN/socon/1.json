Really I'm surprised you don't have thresh on there, thresh is fine but apparently alistair is too hard. \n\nOn that note too, Bard is easier to play than Nami, since nami's principle cc is really hard to land reliably, and bard is still somewhat functional if you only use bards ult as a zoning tool or an escape, general rule, use only on the enemy team and you'll be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-25T06:02:45.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"WW will stunt your growth as a player. Xin Zhao is trash if you don't use him properly in the early game. Alistar is useless when you don't use his abilities correctly. Simply using your combo into someone late game isn't enough to win a team fight, it should be used as peel and zoning in team fights, which means holding onto it. Nami isn't on the list as her healing makes her great for new players and her q and r is good for teaching you how to team fight and is clear that you fucked up when you missplay, unlike champs like ww and xin. Thresh is a great champion for learning how to play the game since he follows the same rules as nami, as long as you dont take relic shield. As someone who almost plays thresh exclusively when i get filled into support I can comfortably say he is a great champ for low mmr. \n\nBard is horrible, he lacks the reliable healing nami has and his skill shot is less punishing and less reliable than nami's bubble. Low mmr players will just throw out q's getting slows onto people thinking they're doing fine when in reality not getting the stun makes him beyond useless. His eshouldn't be taken lightly and has little use in low mmr, it doesn't even function very well as an escape ability, and if you're using it to chase you're likely about to die to the entire enemy team. I also shouldn't really have to explain why his ultimate is horrible for new/bad players. Even only using his ult on the enemy can turn out horribly, people use zohnyas as a defensive tool to outplay people all the time and you think giving a free one to the enemy without thinking is fine? Just play someone better.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-25T10:49:01.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"whilst I'll admit Warwick definitely may stunt your mechanical growth and even encourages the 'stand still and auto' the jungle camp playstyle since he has so much sustain kiting isn't worth it, the blood scent does help encourage the player to look around the map more for ganks. Xin Zhao is a good champion and earlygame champions do help to teach players to look to create jungle pressure, I'd say someone like shyvanna or fiddles would stunt your growth even more, and being encouraged to gank early is very important to climbing and being successful in low elo.\n\nNami's bubble is very difficult to land, and I'd argue that such precise skillshots that are positional pressure dependant aren't something you should start learning below gold, since it will screw up your dodge reads as you climb and can also make you worse at defensive kiting, not to mention it is not reliable cc and so you'll be a deadweight to your team since nami heal isn't very strong or spammable compared to similar healers.\n\nBard teaches roaming. Sure maybe you don't want to be using bard tunnels in combat as you're beginning to learn him, but they do encourage and facilitate the concept that a support should look for opportunities to impact the map rather than just sit botlane, whilst it isn't their full potential, using them to roam more quickly or escape is a good way to learn the map and helps you grow whilst also not being too much of a drain on your team. Also positioning on bard is much simpler than nami as Bard's q stun is reliable and creates far more reliable zone pressure than nami does. Finally whilsts Bard's ult does create a large degree of potential to screw up, it teaches you to know your limits, and as a low elo bard you'll tend to use it more as a catchout long range stun than as a combat tool. The bard ult teaches you alot about fight and positioning dynamics, and also improves map awareness. So long as the bard learns from his mistakes and doesn't try anything too fancy, it's still a very powerful and effective ult.\n\nAlso thresh in low elo is a nono. Waayyy too hard to use, with his positional pressure dependant hook, his flail which has alot of depth to it, his lantern and his combos. Thresh does way too much to be considered a learning tool or even playable for a less competent player, thresh takes alot of practice, and you're probably still doing it wrong. For instance a tendency you'll see in thresh players is looking to engage with hook. A terrible idea unless you can zone and force their movement. Thresh also has some very low base stats, which makes him very risky to play, since his soul mechanic literally requires him to play aggressive (his armour base stat growth through his soul passive literally requires him to be ahead to keep up with armour per level growth of other melee supports), he has no natural sustain or tankiness, nor does he have any defensive amplifiers like Alistair, Leona, Braum, Tahm, Nautilus, ect... Thresh is very much the Lee Sin of supports, can do alot of everything, and is always viable if you're good enough but way too difficult for anything short of the best, popular in low elo because everyone has a god complex but he's really not a good choice for improving or their team. Thresh barely even lanes if you don't understand minion aggro btw, and a huge part of making thresh work is auto attack harass with his e's passive and then reseting minion aggro whilst being careful during the moveup and poke without getting retaliated by either an engage or spells from the enemy. If you aren't above Gold you really shouldn't be playing Thresh, he's very fun, but you aren't good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-25T12:37:29.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You seem to not understand what is actually good for new payers and what isn't.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T05:02:02.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ww zed leblanc\nmaybe alistar and draven\n\nrest are non picks\n\nthose 5 can carry to gold promos, ww to silver 1-gold5 promos\n\nrest no","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T11:50:03.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This list is missing the three most inting champions that low elo players use: Yasuo, Lee Sin, and Twisted Fate.
