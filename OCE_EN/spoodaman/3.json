By the time i get fed and have a reasonable amount of cs, my team has already fed ( not complaining about elo hell) and i get killed rather easily.\n\nCan you tell me how i can possibly carry my games harder because it just isn&#039;t working and ADC is my favorite role which i don&#039;t want to stop playing because i can&#039;t carry with it. BTW It&#039;s not so much carrying it&#039;s the fact that i feel useless and impact on team fights is mediocre at best. Any help would be appreciated thanks. I also have all the skills i think make me capable of carrying such as kiting and csing.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-29T16:56:12.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC is the worst role to consistently carry games with in bronze imo. Assassins and bruisers are very popular in lower ranks and if one of them is fed it can be tough to have much impact, no matter how fed you are, without help from your team (which you should NEVER expect in bronze).\n\nIf you are intent on playing ADC though, my main tips would be:\n-Focus on being in the right place on the map. This is something lower rated people do very poorly without realising, grouping up aimlessly and wasting time, not grouping up when you should be, letting massive minion waves die to sidelane towers, sending multiple people to catch a wave and losing a fight or objective somewhere else, pushing too far or facechecking when enemies are likely in the area etc. You can have a massive impact on the game, positive or negative, because a decision you made 20 or 30 seconds earlier put you in either the right or wrong place on the map.\n-Constantly assess the situation throughout the game and adjust your play accordingly. Make sure you know who the main threats are on the enemy team. Work out how competent your teammates are and what you can expect from them, if your support is constantly going for bad engages let him die instead of following up and giving away a double kill, if your team are all going balls deep and noones peeling for you you need to take this into account when your positioning before a fight. Identifying how you should play teamfights later in the game is crucial to having a big effect, sometimes you can play extremely aggressively, sometimes you should be waiting to follow up on a teammates engage, and sometimes you're better off playing super pussy and not even getting near the fight til 5 seconds later when the enemy threats have used up their cds, theres much more to it that just knowing how to kite.\n-Your life is worth more than an enemies life. You cant carry when you're dead. Never trade 1 for 1 later in the game, you're almost always better letting that enemy live and staying alive yourself. You are the main source of damage to towers and baron/dragon later in the game so it is paramount that you are alive after teamfights to ensure you can turn the teamfight win into towers or objectives as well.  \n-DONT STAY BOT ALL GAME. So many people seem to do this, they win lane, take tower, then just keep going back bot only to get killed by repeated ganks and lose their advantage. Once you have taken tower you should only really be going back bot to catch waves when they're getting to your tower and spending the rest of your time getting stuff done on the rest of the map","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-11-29T09:32:53.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Csing is important aspect of the game, objective is what win you game though. From what I know , ADC can carry games and that is 100% true since most of the challenger is occupy by ADC mains ( assumption) .  You haven't given the information about what marksman you play so I'm going to presume someone like Trist/Lucian for example, you said you felt useless and have minimal impact on team fight , that is mainly because you prefer dealing dps while people are still alive, in a teamfight your job is to deal the most amount of damage second to only a fed midlaner/jg or top lane carry. With %crit it is now easier to out dps the enemy team if you are on x champion mentioned, You feel mediorce and useless because you refuse to deal dps after someone die (presumption , not enough information given) your job is to deal damage and dieing is a little part that will happend to an ADC unless you are extremly good at the role then from my pov not my issue. \n\nWhen I play , I have a mentality to deal the most possible damage, because that is what usually win me the fight, not my KDA , KDA does make me look good and get me item but in perspective , it will be useless if adc can't deal enough dps , this meta which buff the AD carry item as well make it all the more easy with Rapid Firecannon and %crit buff to kill someone.

By never giving up your position i mean never flash into enemy team for a kill or ignoring other targets which is closer to you because there is a low health target a little far away from your reach. Always try to stay out of enemies vision and only start attacking when the fight has already started. Always stay behind your teammates or your tank line. Other than that move as much as you can between auto attacks so that you can dodge enemy skill shots easier.","replies":[]}]}
