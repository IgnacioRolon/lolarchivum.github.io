Try to farm. You can come back although Ahri can be problematic for people mid-game and a fed Irelia is a bit of a problem. Wukong is tank and gains stats in team fights so try to be aware it's not best to focus all your efforts onto him. You can come back from games like this although Wukong is good at picking people off (It's hard to get away from him because he can usually commit as much as he wants to and he can be kinda sticky with Mercs/Rage passive and his dash. Plus his ulti gives him MS so if you get caught out you can be annihilated. Fed Irelia is really bad news. Not much you can really do, even if you know her Kit and counterplay this is one Champion you do not want to focus on too much because she'll usually be tanky and hard to CC and mobile/sustaining so its best to not let this happen or focus other people and make sure you respect the range on her gap closer, her stun when you're higher health (Flash E W-Q onto an ADC can spell death before you have time to do anything) and be aware of her using the reset on her dash to minions. As for Ahri that's a bit complicated, try not to die - she is usually hyper-aggressive by this point and she can dive your team extremely quickly.\n\nArmor pen can help stop wukong in his tracks because he gets like 40 armor from his passive when there's 5 Enemy Champs nearby, Quicksilver Sash can be great vs Ahri because her Charm is arguably one of the strongest CCs in the game and Quicksilver Sashing it and flashing can stop you eating a 1200 damage burst and let your team wait until her ulti is on CD because it will usually be a flash R or Flash onto you - either of which is worth trading a QSS and flash in exchange for and can give your team a Chance to engage. As for Irelia. Hands down a big problem if she is fed because she can dive the backlines almost to her hearts content. Try to poke people down but a fed Irelia is something that you need to be careful about pushing against because if you go too deep into enemy territory or overextend she is extremely difficult to peel and excellent at flanking or starting or turning team fights plus she is relatively easy to disengage/escape with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fukushu","date":"2016-07-09T06:45:44.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main 3 roles and yeah I guess you can find it hard carrying a feeding team in bronze-silver. It's all about the mindset. If you're toxic etc, you need to force yourself that losing lp doesnt matter or so what if someone is feeding, ignore it and carry on with your lane. When you learn that you'll be finding games a lot easier and your mechanics will improve. Trust me i tilted for at least 1 year and a half, got no where because my mindset of \"I NEED TO WIN\" or \"Omfg why do i always get feeders\"  dragged me down. Play each game with a new mindset.\n\nFor carrying as an adc you would want to know who are your best champions to play. Are you good at this champion more than the other etc. In laning phase you want to abuse the advantages you have. When i sometimes lane i think about what i can do for my team, examples can go from winning lane, pushing it in and rotating mid to get that turret. If you duo with lets say a support, you allow the enemy bot lane to push in as your support roams or at least set up a safety net before leaving lane. \n\nI know it can be hard sometimes to carry a feeding team but eventually you'll get there. Hope it helps ;-;","replies":[]}]}
