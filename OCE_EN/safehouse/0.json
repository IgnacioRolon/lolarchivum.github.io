I love the game and have played over 3000 games in total but those times when you just get that genuine toxic troll you feel so powerless. It just happened to me in a ranked game. After bot lane got double killed within the first 3 minutes of the game they proceeded to intentionally feed 33 kills. Now all we can do is report them and hope they receive a ban (most likely temporary if at all) until they can get back to ruining other peoples games. I have a couple ideas and would like to hear what people think of them along with their own input.\r\n\r\nHave a ban system that prevents people from playing ranked games (for a certain period of time or until their case is reviewed) if they receive a certain amount of reports (20 ish?) over 10 games or more than 5 reports in 1 game. It can be an automated system so upkeep wouldn't be over the top and it would go a long way to cleaning up the ranked scene.\r\n\r\nThis one is probably a bit more risky but selecting players who have been in the community a long time and have a say, top 1% record for least reports, and giving them the power to impose ranked bans of up to a week. Obvious room for abuse with this one and is why it would have to be more regulated than the first option. If these players were active it would also go a long way to getting rid of a lot of the toxic players, even as a deterrent with the possibility of someone having these powers in your game.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts!\r\n\r\nTLDR: Clean up toxic players in ranked, suggestions above.","replies":[{"poster":"catraven","date":"2015-02-22T05:39:14.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> After bot lane got double killed within the first 3 minutes of the game they proceeded to intentionally feed 33 kills. \n\nAwesome.

There will always be toxic players and trolls in league of legends, so rather than just ban the toxic people, we should reward the people that are playing league like it should be. This is what they are doing now, except it has been a while since the last reward (damn you workshop nunu...)","replies":[]}]}
