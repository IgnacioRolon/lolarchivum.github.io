(Can take thousands of games)\nIf you can answer that then you will have a pretty decent champion pool to sort through to find your main.\n\nNow here's the kicker. Its not that great to ONLY play one champion. If your champ gets picked/banned or you're up against a hard counter (lets say you pick Irelia into Olaf) you are going to get destroyed. Of course there's the reasoning that if you master your champion, then hard counters dont mean anything, but since your not even level 30 yet i don't think your at that stage. \n\nIf you take my advice and go for a champion pool instead of only one champion, you might want to sort your %%%% out like I did:\n4 Champs for your main role, focusing on 1 more then the others.\nAt least 2 champs for every other role.\nIf you did go 2 champs for every other role try to do this:\nFor Top take a Tank and an Assassin\nFor mid lane take both an AD and an AP caster\nFor jungle take both a Tank and an Assassin\nFor ADC take a High Mobility/Low damage carry and a Low Mobility/High damage carry\nFor support take a Tank and a Squishy\nFor your main role (we'll use my main role Top as an example) take 2 tanks and two assassins. Make one of each two groups AP and the others AD.\n\nBut that's just like, my opinion man.","replies":[]}]}
