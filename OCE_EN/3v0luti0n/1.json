He can be quite disruptive in teamfights but he's susceptible to high mobility champions and kiting. His Q is not impossible to dodge, his E is totally dodgeable, don't stick near him and get health chunked by his W, his ult is definitely dodgeable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-03-08T01:25:37.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion does not need a nerf.

So lets say Sion's Q does 300 damage at full charge. If he hits all 5 enemy champions with his Q that's 1.5k damage to champions. Then theres his passive, which deals A TON of damage if you let him punch you. Most of the other champs in that game are single target damage on at least 3 spells. But, as JasonWazza says there isn't any proof hes full tank.\n\n~ Edit: I just had a look into your match history. First of all, you are level 7. Unless this is a smurf, don't go pointing the OP finger at champions when you clearly haven't played this game for very long. Second of all, he had a Thornmails and Sunfire, both of which damage quite a lot if stood next to or focused. That's how he did the most damage to champions. Since this is a pre level 10 game I would assume people didn't consider these things, and just stood right next to Sion, autoattacking him or something.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-07T08:02:48.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also as another point, if his leveling faster then everyone else, his damage looks higher regardless.\n\nTank doesn't mean doesn't do damage.","replies":[]}]}]}
