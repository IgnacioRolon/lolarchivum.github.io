It was cold too. She felt the air nip at her exposed skin as she leaned on the balcony of her apartment. The winter had come with a unique ferocity this year and people were saying it would be the coldest in a decade. She could definitely feel it. Cold and bitter, like the world itself was annoyed at its mistreatment. She couldn&rsquo;t help but think about the state of her hometown where the drainage pipes polluted the Gulf with a constant flow of refuse and toxic waste. She shook the thought out of her head. Now was not the time to be thinking of such things.\r\n\r\nSnowdown had come and passed quickly despite the company she kept &ndash; not that she didn&rsquo;t like said company, quite the opposite &ndash; and the snows had blanketed the city streets below in a matter of weeks. Luckily she had stocked up on winter wear and plenty of the instant soups the city of Piltover held in such high esteem. She looked over the railing to see the automated snow ploughers clearing the white from the roads tirelessly like ants. Columns of hextech vehicles followed the ploughs, each one with a different and unique purpose. She could faintly see the yellows of the Land Ferry Service and the blues of the Piltover Police Department among the various greys and blacks of the Gentry vehicles. There were even a few of different colours, no doubt owned by some young success stories  the City of Progress. \r\n\r\nAnother gust blew some loose strands back into her face as the crispness in the air caused her breath to fog as it left her mouth. She turned her back against the vista of the sky scraping, high-rise towers of Piltover and leant on the railing of the balcony. She tilted her head back to watch the falling flakes of ice as they fell around her. She watched them as the field of swirling air surrounding her redirected the delicate snowflakes in mid-air. The sky was bright despite it being overcast and she knew that she needed to treasure the moment while it lasted for the evening would bring yet another tumult of ferocious weather conditions. \r\n\r\n&lsquo;The calm before the storm&rsquo; the old saying went and she chuckled to herself as the thought passed through her mind. Oh how she could relate to that, the weather borne house arrest having kept her from her goals for too long already. It almost felt like the entire city, no, the entire world held its breath for the events of the future to unfold. An infamous cluster of ancient comets had streaked across the sky a few months before, a well known harbinger of calamity. News of the unrest in Bilgewater and the revival of the ancient Shuriman Empire had reached the entire world and the tensions in the Freljord just kept climbing. Along with the increase in the rioting and unrest within her homeland of Zaun, the signs were bad. Change was most definitely on its way. And boy oh boy was it needed.\r\n\r\nThe noise of a sliding door opening brought her attention back to the present. She turned her gaze toward the interior of her apartment, the following footsteps slapping against the wooden floor of her hallway as her company made his way into plain sight. He wore nothing but a towel tucked tightly around his waist and the steam from his recent hot shower coiled in spirals above him before quickly dissipating into invisibility. She watched as his muscular physique rippled with each move he made. Hungry eyes took in the visage of big, toned arms and shoulders, a washboard abdomen and chest, and a strong jaw line.\r\n\r\nHe strode past confidently, sliding her a sly wink as he checked on his enormous weapon, the famous Mercury Hammer, which sat by the front door that was on the opposite side of her residence. After a brief glance at the oversized, propped up &lsquo;mallet&rsquo; &ndash; as she would call it to annoy him &ndash; he turned his full attention to her. He walked over slowly, almost purposefully so and she drank in the sight before he came to stop at the doorway. She came forward to rest her seemingly ice cold fingers on his chest and though he visibly stiffened underneath them, he did not shy away. She then leant into him, resting her head on his shoulder as her body pressed against his allowing her feel him and his warmth through her heavy robe.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Tea?&rdquo; She breathed effortlessly, her voice as light as her fair skin and as free as the blonde hair that still fluttered behind her. The word flitted seductively past his ear as he felt her breath brush past his lobe. He managed to break free of his host&rsquo;s spell within a few seconds but not before he could hide the foolish expression of amazement on his face. Satisfied with her effort she confirmed her success with a single soft yet audible giggle in his ear. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Holy heck it&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; He shivered slightly before trapping her in his arms and dragging her back away from the balcony. The ensuing squeal at the sudden movement caused his heart to twang a touch and he made up for his error with a chain of light kisses starting at her shoulder and ending underneath her jaw. She sighed breathily, snaking her around his chest and feeling the skin on his back ripple with the movement. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Holy heck! You&rsquo;re even colder! You sure you don&rsquo;t need that tea?&rdquo; He added.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment of hesitation, just another moment of holding him close, she pulled away. A mischievous grin spread across her luscious lips as she studied his handsome features briefly. Her stance then changed instantaneously from seductive to commanding as she straightened and looked him dead in the eye.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;If you want to warm me up, I&rsquo;ll be down that hallway and in my room,&rdquo; she said with the clear crispness of the morning air. The words hung as she slipped past him, her feet pitter-pattering down the hall as a cold breeze closed the balcony doors. The noise of the sliding door to her room sliding shut sobered him. She had yet again left him speechless and blown away. He should have expected it though, she was of course infamous for it. It was said to be captivated by her was a curse for she could turn as quickly as the air currents she controlled. \r\n\r\nNevertheless he would overcome the Storm&rsquo;s Fury when it came to it, but for now he was perfectly fine with his current situation. After all, staying with a beautiful woman had its perks. Without wasting another second he turned on his heel and made his way do the hallway with loud purposeful steps to where the beauty known as Janna awaited him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\nOkay so that&#039;s my entry.

I think it's fine in terms of age-appropriateness.
