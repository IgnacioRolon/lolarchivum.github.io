I used to play this game a lot with a few of my mates but they&#039;ve moved on to Counterstrike and we all know how terrifying solo q is. I was wondering if anyone would be up for some casual norm/aram games? I main mid, specifically Annie (trying to get into LeBlanc and Lux mid as well), but I&#039;m also semi-decent at Renekton and Rek&#039;sai top. I can support as well, and I used to main support back in s4 but now I don&#039;t really support unless I&#039;m premade and in skype with the ADC. I&#039;m unranked at the moment and I haven&#039;t played ranked in over a year because my internet was too unpredictable and would cut out for a few minutes randomly but it&#039;s fine now, although I&#039;m not too keen on ranked but when I did play ranked I was B1. This is just a casual team, and I&#039;m up for new things or fun team comps like a Freljord or yordle team. My duo buddy mains jungle but he&#039;s also not bad at top or support although usually if he doesn&#039;t get jungle we&#039;ll just duo bot. If you&#039;d like to play with me feel free to message me! I&#039;m pretty laid back and if you think I&#039;m awful at the game don&#039;t hesitate to tell me, perhaps even give me tips on how to improve. Lemme know if you wanna join and I&#039;ll probably respond within a few minutes because it&#039;s the school holidays and I have no life because it&#039;s either too hot or too cold to actually do anything at all so thank you New Zealand weather.","replies":[{"poster":"Mercilus","date":"2016-01-09T07:52:01.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hEY MAN IM KINDA IN THE SAME BOAT, whoops caps.\nI use to play a while back but now just getting back in.\nLemme know if you wanna play some normal games..\nMercilus\nIn NZ aswell, got some time this weekend for a good smash.","replies":[{"poster":"spicie bean","date":"2016-03-19T10:15:02.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response but yeah man I'd be up for it! Sorry I went on a holiday not too long after posting that and then I kinda just forgot about it but yeah feel free to add me man and if you have skype that'd be pretty helpful too, not too much of a big deal if you don't or if you're too shy though :P","replies":[]}]}]}
