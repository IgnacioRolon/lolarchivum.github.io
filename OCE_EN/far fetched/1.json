Between her immense early damage and her ability to snowball games by just completely disabling and bursting enemy champs is just way too strong. \n\nLet&#039;s have a look at her strengths in her current form. \nHer level two trade (without Runes or masteries or items, this is purely base damage) deals 299 damage. For three basic attacks (one of which was off an attack reset) without any items, that is way too much damage. This isn&#039;t even taking into account the fact that her E is a displacement, and can dash away from someone trying to engage on her, as well as her Q being, not a blind but an ability which makes her entire screen go black. For a bit of context, the champion Caitlyn&#039;s level two trade, is 206 damage, and it is worth noting that Caitlyn&#039;s combo lacks any crowd control effects, unlike Quinn who can displace/black screen/kite and gap close all as part of her combo. Essentially if Quinn plays it right you can&#039;t actually get onto her during her ability rotation, if you dash/flash on top of her she will just kick you away, and if you are already flashing just to win a level two trade, something is seriously wrong.\n\nOn top of that, Quinn&#039;s ability to be really oppressive once she gets ahead is the next issue. Not only is she able to put out ludicrous amounts of damage early, she can, if played properly, never let her lane opponent back into the game. As mentioned above, Quinn&#039;s q ability blocks the targets vision, with the exception of a small radius around them. This lasts for two seconds, which doesn&#039;t sound like much, but in the context of a fast paced, skill based MOBA like League of Legends is actually a really long time. To make a comparison, a lot of people talk about how Morgana&#039;s binding is way too long, and that, in the early levels, has the same duration as Quinn&#039;s &#039;nearsight&#039; effect. The problem with that is that you can still attack and defend yourself whilst snared by Morgana&#039;s binding, whilst you can still move whilst suffering from nearsight, you:\n1. Don&#039;t know who/how many people is /are around you\n2. Can&#039;t see opponents, and as such can&#039;t target them with spells or basic attacks (meaning you can&#039;t defend yourself)\n3. You don&#039;t know what kind of attacks are in coming, and so you don&#039;t have the strategic information as to if you should use Zonya&#039;s hourglass/Quick Silver Sash etc.\nGranted you can still use skill-shots whilst afflicted with nearsight, it still reduces the number off usable abilities by a massive number, and even if the nearsight affected target has one of these abilities they would be firing it blind, and as such the chance of actually connecting is rather slim. Meaning there really isn&#039;t much counterplay at all. Being forced to buy a Quick Silver Sash for that one ability is rather extreme, especially on someone who can just as easily put out sustained damage as up front burst. To cap it off, after trades she has a move speed buff making it that much harder for champions to close in on her (which supposed to be what she is weak to)\n\nBecause of her Q being so hard to counter-play, her opponent doesn&#039;t have many options to retaliate once she has started using her spell rotation. This means if she gets a lead in lane, there isn&#039;t anything her opponents can do to stop her from snowballing, and then, to the second point, winning the game. Unless the opposing team has an equally strong champion who is equally fed, then there isn&#039;t much you can do about Qiunn, she can interrupt channeled spells with her displacement and stop enemies from seeing the game, essentially taking them out of the fight for a whole two seconds (also considering the ability has less than a 4 second cooldown at max rank and full build her target will spend more than half the fight unable to attack back) giving a drastic edge to her team, who already have a massive damage advantage because of Quinn&#039;s high damage combo as well as the fact she is almost certainly strong from her oppressive laning phase.\n\nSo that means that Quinn&#039;s laning phase is way too good, and then her ability to translate that is way too easy. On top of that the fact her ult is only time efficient if she crosses more than around %54 of the map on it&#039;s longest axis before deactivating it. It then deals one basic attacks worth of damage when deactivated, which can happen if hit by almost any attack. This ability feels far too fragile and far too under-powered to be an ultimate. It&#039;s main problem is the fact that it is only useful in certain circumstances, but when it is useful, it is just too hard for the opponents to be able to react to and work around strategically.\n\nSo here are some proposed fixes, but I am sure you, at Riot, have much better ideas than these.\nIf she could attack and retaliate whilst using it, and/or if it dealt more damage, such as an execute or even just a much higher base damage, then it would have more use. As stated, it is one of those abilities where it isn&#039;t useful too often but when it is, there is little you can do to prevent it from having a serious effect. If this ability were to be given a much longer cooldown, and some ability to continue to fight whilst it is active then there would be a lot more strategic value to it. Also if you wanted to fix the problems with her being too oppressive in lane, you should consider taking the &#039;harrier&#039; proc off her blinding strike and making it actually blind. If you feel that is too weak, make it blind everyone in the area. The advantage of the blind, is it still stop basic attack based trading but opponents can still see the world around them and as such can still strategically position and react to whatever happens, without suddenly having four opponents next to them and being outplay simply because they couldn&#039;t see anything on their game. If her trading in lane is found to be too weak still give her more damage on her passive, sure she will only be able to activate it twice now, but it will mean she will have to dump all her damage at once, rather than be able to keep wailing on an opponent for ages. Also the damage, even with a buff to her passive, will not be nearly as strong, and as such not nearly as hard to manage. Her W and her E can both be left untouched as I don&#039;t think there is anything wrong with them. (Afternote: Making Quinn&#039;s Q a blind, much like Teemo&#039;s but a skill-shot, makes her a more specific counter and gives her more identity).\n\nThis entire entry has been nothing but who she is too strong, but to my mind the biggest reason she isn&#039;t a healthy champ is that she just doesn&#039;t have any of her own personalty anymore. It is tragic to say, but Valor no longer really feels like he fights with her, she feels less like &#039;someone who lost her only family and instead raised a bird as her life long companion&#039; and more like someone with a relatively useless bird who tags along and helps her occasionally. At the moment Pix feels way more a part of Lulu&#039;s kit than Valor does to Quinn&#039;s.\n\n> it&#039;s why Valor is part of every skill, so they fight together. It&#039;s not master/servant like a lot of rangers, it&#039;s more like an Elite K-9 unit, where they&#039;re partners working together.\n> -**MorelloRiot ** _Tumblr during the Quinn release AMA _\n\nConsidering Quinn throws out Valor for one attack and asks him to take her places this just doesn&#039;t ring true anymore. Riot, this needs to be addressed if you want to keep making a game in which your characters aren&#039;t just two dimensional chess peices. The other major issue here is that she really just feels like a more mobile, but lower damage Draven. He is the king of hitting a few strong basic attacks, and using abilities in between, but that doesn&#039;t feel like it makes sense with a character who is presented as an &#039;agile scout&#039;.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n1. Quinn can win lane too easily and without much ability to retaliate from her opponent.\n2. Quinn, once ahead can carry extremely easy due to the suppressive nature of her abilities.\n3. Quinn&#039;s ultimate is too low cooldown and has a channel which negates it&#039;s initial strengths anyway.\n4. Quinn&#039;s ultimate is too fragile, and she can&#039;t fight whilst it is active, plus the deactivation doesn&#039;t do nearly enough damage for an ultimate.\n5. Valor doesn&#039;t feel like a part of her kit anymore.\n6. As a character she lacks identity. Her play style doesn&#039;t feel unique, it feels copied and uninteresting.\n7. She can&#039;t be reasonably counter-played, she isn&#039;t fun, she is only strong, and her %54 winrate, as opposed to her old %50ish winrate is too high.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomphlosion","date":"2016-02-18T05:22:55.391+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to disagree, quinn does have an identity, but you seem to have missed it, probably because you were one of 100 people world wide that actually liked old quinn. Disclaimer: I get most of my perspective on her from seeing her in competitive matches\n\nShe now revolves around out of combat mobility with her ultimate, she has lost some of her old identity as an assassin, but that was an awkward identity for her anyway.  Maybe her numbers are a bit high I don't know, but lucians lvl 2 all in is 272, 332 if you take w, so I doubt her numbers are all that problematic. In any case her ultimate is not an in-combat ability anymore so maybe she needs a bit more damage in her main kit to be balanced out. The few times I've played against her her abilities didn't seem especially oppressive, her combo is pretty predicable and can still put her in some very silly situations. \n\nTLDR: you're wrong, see above for why. Stop pining for a champ you fell in love with years ago, you're only making up reasons you want her back, she ain't coming back, she's moved on to a better place and so should you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-18T04:24:54.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:54}}  begs to differ.
