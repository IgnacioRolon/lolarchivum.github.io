Was it to make her more viable as an ADC or as a solo laner? People just interpreted the text along side the patch notes differently and I wanted to see if either was the particular focus.\n\nSecondly, which was the main point of this post, was to give some feedback on the current status of Quinn in the game. I sent a message to Riot support under the feedback section and they politely directed me here. So I wanted to ask, although of course this is just one voice, what the chance of having at least some parts of Quinn&#039;s old kit back. Many people, including myself, found success with her in ranked ques, be it in top lane or directed more in the bot lane. There wasn&#039;t anything wrong with the way her kit worked and now that you have taken off her blind and made her one method for &#039;getting in the face&#039; of enemy ADCs as well as chase down/execute at the end of a fight it just seems like her charm has been seriously diminished. Right now it is hard to differentiate Quinn from Draven, whereas before it was always making a meaningful choice, whether you wanted to ult and try to get the final hit with the edge of your ult&#039;s execute. \n\nIf you want to shift her from being a top laner into more of a bot lane threat, maybe you could give her better teamfight/sieging by increasing her range and maybe even something which synergises with having a lane partner in the same way Kalista does. It just feels tragic that you are changing a champion kit which felt so fun to play. The number of miracle outplays using careful combination of Q/E/R in rapid succession over a wall to escape which we will never see again is somewhat tragic, considering her 3 second channel time. She also looses her potential to re-engage and turn a fight with careful planning/decision making and mechanical prowess.\n\nI beg, you please to at least consider bringing her old charm and play-style back into the game. \n\nKindest Regards,\nK Bell (Quinning Streak)","replies":[{"poster":"fear of Quinn","date":"2015-11-16T04:02:29.758+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear quinn main,\ni am a quinn main too. I gave to this Quinn reworked champion many many games. She sucks in my opinion. She cant stay and do face damage as her range is still the lowest among the adcs even lower than vaynes. Vayne can survive in tfs cause she has stealth and stun at walls which quinn hasnt. Its common sense you want low range for assasin adcs like vayne. But quinn is not more an assasin so why lowest range in game? This new quinn reworked drove me from gold 1 to gold 5. She sucks guys. Riot you did a very bad job here. Not much to say. Ok you gave her one more harrier but you cant use it if you are low ranged like quinn. You just cant approach cause you will be killed. And i noticed you nerfed the width of Q thats for sure. Now it easier can pass between two targets without hitting them. One good thing i can find is Quinn after harrier is taking some speed buff. But you still killed Quinn with this rework. I just unistalled this game as i was a main Quinn and cant play this noob reworked champion anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Far Fetched","date":"2015-11-16T05:52:19.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to be so hard on Riot, they have made an awesome product but I have to admit I uninstalled the game as well, so did another Quinn main friend of mine...\nIt is quite hard to play her now :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-19T21:38:27.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Quinning Streak,\n\n\nAs this is the Help & Support sub-boards, we typically only answer general questions and technical issues related to League of Legends.
