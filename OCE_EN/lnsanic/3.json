I'm looking for a Ranked 5's Team... Main ADC and Mid and Play Support well. Also Decent Jungler and Top... I have reached Platinum 1 in season 4 and quit in season 5... I just started playing last year in December and reached silver 1. My Schedules are flexible so i can join you guys anytime during training and i adapt quicky to any strategy.
