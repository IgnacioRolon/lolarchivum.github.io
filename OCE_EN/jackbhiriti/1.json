Killing not allowed but cc is .only level up one point in each ability. Picks are draft so you can ban hec/rammus/zilean etc. Only allowed to buy boots and potions not elixirs. No flaming. No trolls.(panth tf shen..ults banned its gotta be a race )And lastly have heaps of fun (summoners :ghost and exhaust have proven themselves)\r\n\r\nTL;DR relay race crystal scar sounds pretty cool just dont be troll","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-04T13:27:30.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so no win shit ow most of the time the winner gets a skin or some shit lol","replies":[]}]}
