It always starts off normal but then assets seem to move all around the place and not load properly.\r\n\r\nI have tried everything under the sun, trying every different combination on the graphics slider, reinstalling league, reformatting my hard drive, updating my operating system, restarting, getting a cooling fan... Nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nI've got an example in the bottom right of the screen shot. Zonyas is actually set to 2, not 1, and it keeps changing all over the place making it really difficult to see where my items are at. Also all the health bars are quite difficult to read and keep flickering. It is hard to capture in a single frame as stuff keeps moving, but it is all super distracting and makes it a nightmare to try and play at a higher level if I can't get at all the information that other players have.\r\n\r\nIs it an issue with the fact the the mac client is STILL in Beta or is there something I can do on my end? I'm finding it hard to enjoy the game when my eyes are constantly being assaulted =)\r\n\r\nP.S. Keep in mind that I have tried everything obvious. I am posting because I have literally run out of options.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:10:47.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried turning it off and back on?\n\nlol jk\n\nBut damn, that seems really bothersome.\n\nAlso, it's true that the Mac version is still in beta, but most people don't have issues with it and hence it's generally agreed that it's out of beta.\n\nYou said you tried getting a cooling fan, does that mean you're playing on a Macbook?","replies":[]}]}
