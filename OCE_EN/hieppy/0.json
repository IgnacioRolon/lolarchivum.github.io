She had called him weird and bi-polar because of his tendency to be aggressive and then supportive.\n\n&quot;You&#039;re getting banned&quot; was after he told me to kill myself, whilst I said silver will be silver because he flexed his rank? Personally silver mmr myself, I know how it&#039;ll be but this time it was pretty excessive.\n\nDo you think it was flagging of the words?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-01T13:53:59.868+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"While there was some minor negativity there, without significant negative history I can't see it legitimately resulting in a punishment.\n\nWithout knowing the full backstory I can't guarantee anything for you, but working under the assumption that this was a 14 day or permanent suspension and not a chat restriction it certainly looks like your account was falsely flagged for suicide encouragement (kys). \n\nThe system can struggle with context in some of these cases (and better to come down hard and have a few more false positives to sort through, than allow players to get away with really saying stuff like that). \n\nYour best course of action here is to talk to Player Support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nYou first response may be a personalised macro, sometimes these can miss the mark or not adequately provide context, so if your first answer isn't satisfactory simply reply to the ticket and you'll move through to tier 2 support (custom responses only).\n\nIf you have any dramas you can post your tickets here and someone can usually point you in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Hieppy","date":"2018-11-01T14:09:26.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, Seras! There really is no backstory other than Teemo going from a positive player to the other spectrum of being negative. Simply put, I call for a free infernal dragon whilst he runs off into bottom side jungle (enemy side). He dies as we take the dragon, then he proceeded to blame my dragon call and tell me that it was my fault that we were going to lose. After this, he told me to kill myself in which I retaliated as seen above.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-02T00:48:09.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant the backstory of the account rather than the game. \n\nOn occasion we'll see cases here on boards where the chat logs are negative, but not really *that* bad so everyone sorta things \"why was this punished?\", but then when the rest of the story comes out it's because they're mostly minor toxics in basically all of their games and rack up a boatload of reports.\n\nPoint being, without seeing all that player support/Riot can see in terms of history, reports and report comments etc we can't really make an definitive judgements on boards. I don't believe something like this to be the case here, I just don't like saying anything for sure unless the chat log is super clear cut.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"tangina ako mid","date":"2018-11-01T13:32:42.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"saying kys gets u suspended tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"Hieppy","date":"2018-11-01T13:38:10.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think it was flagging, didn't say it in any malicious intent though.
