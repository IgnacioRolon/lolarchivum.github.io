Try running a custom game; you can't get punished for that, no matter what the warning dialogues say.\n\nIf it's still not working, try [using an alternative DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5). It solves a lot of cases so it's usually worth trying early on.\n\nIf that doesn't work, try everything suggesting in the whole article. That at least makes sure it's not a simple problem. If you need any help with it, or it didn't work, reply to this message and I'll get back to you.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr3aDnAuGhTz","date":"2015-05-08T02:05:00.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice is to try the following.\n\n1. Check your processes tab, ensure nothing that uses the internet is running e.g Spotify, Internet browser with Youtube open or something else that uses embed plugins.\n\n2. Make sure your network is simple. e.g 1 Gateway (decent brand), default configuration with ISP settings & if possible UnPn, make sure your MTU is a size that fits all. Your packets will be split up and rejected if one switch in the link doesn't like your MTU size.\n\n3. Check your ISP plan and see if anything is off with the plan. e.g Slow Speed, Naked DSL (in most cases does not matter), stability issues on DSL line.\n\n4. Restart your modem and kick everyone in your household off of the wireless.\n\n5. Buy a new machine, Move country, change ISP, try a new speaking language.... If all else fails, move on.","replies":[]}]}
