Whether you think a feature should or should not be available, if it's not available and you're using it, it's an unfair advantage.\n\nA program that shortens the amount of work you have to do, or even that moves timers from the tab area to another area, is an unfair advantage. Other players do not have this, and it does infact give you a benefit over others - whether it's as simple as not having to press tab, or as complicated as automatically moving your character - all unfair advantages that interact with the game are just that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-02-10T12:57:18.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lma ur gonna get banned kido.\nrip in peace.","replies":[]}]}
