If you gank a lane early and burn their flash just keep doing laps around the lane.\n\nI think one of the biggest things lower elo players don't try to implement into their game is getting advantages that are not reflected by score, for example burning enemy flashes or crucial ultimates. One example I can think of is lvl 2 invading but instead of trying to get a kill just take the buff, it's a lot easier to just get the buff as you have the element of surprise, and this will slow the jungler down.","replies":[]}]}
