Number 1 being top and number 5 being support. That way it would be 1st to select one of the lane bubbles on the side will get it. This way you&#039;d all know who got their desired lane fair and square and other players wishing to play a lane someone has already called can&#039;t say &quot;no, I called mid first! *copy and pastes the whole champion select chat log to prove something, but they just typed their name above the person who called first*&quot; Yeah, this won&#039;t stop people picking a mid and going mid anyway but hopefully it can reduces players becoming salty and tilted before the game has even started.{{champion:105}} **","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-02-14T20:58:30.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea, but imo it wouldn't solve the problem, as you'd be penalised for simply being last into the room (someone has to be last). Role select like they've got in ranked and draft normals (where available) is the best solution. They've also already got the tech to do it, so it would be the easiest solution to implement too.","replies":[{"poster":"DeIirium","date":"2017-02-14T21:36:25.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A friend of mine did bring that up too, but someone is always going to call last anyway.
