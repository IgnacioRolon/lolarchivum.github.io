If you'd like to help us dig into this:\n\n>1. Please download and install the [Hextech Repair Tool (HRT)](https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/player-support/tools/hextech-repair-tool/latest/Hextech%20Repair%20Tool.msi). (If you've already got the HRT installed, uninstall it and then install this latest version.\n2. Once you've opened the HRT, deselect the \"Automatically Assign\" and \"Add Firewall Exceptions\" options, we won't be needing those.\n3. Click Start.\n4. A .zip file will be created on your desktop called LoL Logs. Attach this file in an email to ocelivereports@riotgames.com\n\n>We will then pass these logs on for investigation.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/ElA0rvVL/d/ki4edZEm?comment=0000","replies":[]}]}
