I am ready to uninstall the game but I would like to give it one last shot. I know we all have bad games from time to time but I am looking for people to duo queue with (using curse as well) \r\n\r\nAdd me in the game - League101\r\n\r\nI am willing to try one last time to get out of bronze. If I play to my ability and play smart, I believe I should be top Silver maybe even lower Gold.\r\n\r\nIf you are a genuine player and learn from mistakes, plus if you are dedicated to getting out of bronze lets achieve that.","replies":[]}
