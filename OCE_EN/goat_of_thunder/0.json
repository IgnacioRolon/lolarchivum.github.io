His Q is bugged and about 90% of the time his Q doesn't knockup the enemies. I played him twice in ranked where I found it out and lost the 2 games because of it as it is very useful such as for Yasuo's ULT. Not sure how I get this directly to riot so they can start fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-02-15T23:40:00.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you added this to the 5.3 bugs megathread at the top of the boards?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-15T12:18:58.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a lot of people have noticed this with Xin.
