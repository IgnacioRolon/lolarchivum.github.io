You have a button in gifting that says trade and you both have to get mystery skin or mystery champion, and you both have to click trade and the function will work. In the feature you can show their rp and you can see their summoner name, and the gift their gifting you. This would be a great feature to stop scammers winning. So please take this advice in ur hands and lets get rid of Scammers!!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-18T10:22:44.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But trading goes against their morals, apparently.\n\nGood idea, though.
