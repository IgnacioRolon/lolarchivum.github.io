(Starting from the highest elo moving down to plat 5) As you cannot duo with a plat five or higher if you are low elo/rank. Why can&#039;t it be mandatory to link an email to an account?\r\n\r\n* Looking at the IP address of where these ranked accounts are being played from.\r\n* Seeing the smurfs mates accounts and comparing his/her solo matches vs the duo one with the smurf. This is a form of boosting if I&#039;m not mistaken. What is the penalty for boosting an account?\r\n\r\nYes there are a lot of ways to get around these suggestions of course, but its the effort involved to get around them, if someone seriously wants to smurf you can&#039;t stop them, but I believe you can deter them a lot more then what is currently set up (If there is any thing in place at all)\r\n\r\nI&#039;v been playing since the beta and are awesome in the sense of not good at all, but would like to have fair games to see if I am improving (Or not). I gave up in season 5 cause I believed I had 3 consecutive games in which certain lanes got steamrolled, by only one individual who managed to take on many 3v1 ganks etc more then once. \r\n\r\nIs this just me being stupid and should I get over myself? Or is this a fair comment?\r\nThanks for reading my vent of frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-16T23:24:51.161+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK (I don't have one as I haven't had a reason to make one) nothing about smurfing is against the Terms of Service and there are plenty of legitimate reasons to do it so Riot has allowed smurfs. \n\nSay you're a lower ELO player but you get stuck in B5. You can create a smurf to reset your mmr to Silver, if you belong in B5 you'll get dropped back there very quickly. Smurfing doesn't affect ranked as much as you might think. It's why sometimes you'll get games with a mid-plat mmr but with gold players in them. Your rank doesn't have to reflect your mmr, and if it doesn't matchmaking will shift your matches till it does.\n\nSay you're a higher elo player but you're bad at a particular role, say you never play ADC. You can make a smurf to play through the levels/ranks as ADC and get better in a competetive environment that isn't way above your skill level, then you simply have a rank reflective of your ADC skill rather than your overall skill.\n\nOf course there are illegitimate reasons as well, like the people who make smurfs, lose games into B5 then just face stomp because it's fun somehow for them, but the negative behaviour there isn't smurfing, it's griefing/trolling/generally being an ass. In which case, ban those accounts sure, but you aren't banning them for smurfing, you're banning them for negative behaviour. I think they could crack down on those smurf trolls a bit but in different ways to what you are suggesting. Something like:\n\nFirst Offense: Warning\nSecond Offense: Smurf banned from ranked\nThird Offense: Smurf banned\nThen if they make a new smurf and continue, start punishing their main account with loss of ranked rewards, then maybe a ranked ban. Believe me when I say Riot knows which accounts are connected.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-11-17T01:27:26.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Say you're a higher elo player but you're bad at a particular role, say you never play ADC.

Riot has stated time and again that they neither condone nor condemn smurfs, and there is nothing in the TOU or EULA that would make smurfs against the rules.\n\n> Seeing the difference of ranked accounts linked to the same email address.\n\nPretty sure you can only link 1 account to a specific email, unless you make an account on another server (I'm pretty sure you can use the same email then, may be mistaken).\n\n> Why can't it be mandatory to link an email to an account?\n\nIt is... You can't create an account without having an email to use for that account, but even so that still doesn't stop people making as many smurfs as they want. It's not hard to make emails, and you can make disposable emails too.\n\n> Looking at the IP address of where these ranked accounts are being played from.\n\nYou could, but then again you have no way of knowing if all accounts on a specific IP are all the same person. Some people share computers or use computers in internet cafes, doesn't mean they created all the accounts that use the same IP. People have often suggested using IP for things (IP bans for example) and Riot has always come out with the same response, they simply wont do it.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-11-17T01:23:41.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why can't it be mandatory to link an email to an account?\n\nIt is...
