I would love some help, prob might be an idea of uploading on you tube and someone laughing, then hopefully giving me some pointers.\n\nI love playing sivir and Trist atm. I play leo, Ali, Nami and sona sup. I like voli and panth top. Also mighty Rammus jungle and top. Xin and nunu Jungle. \n\nThats about it. I don't like mid at all. Is that bad? Also I believe its most popular as well in my elo especially.\n\nCheers in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos11111","date":"2015-10-28T12:17:27.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm not gonna spend too much time on this so I'm just looking at mainly your builds and such in your match history.\n\nThis might be bad and other people may disagree with this, but I think buying wards can actually be a noob trap in low elo. People say wards win games and you need to buy wards bla bla so people buy them without actually thinking about when and where they're needed, and they end up just being a gold sink. Once you're level 9 upgrading your yellow trinket should be enough that you don't need to buy any wards, and before that you can usually survive by warding the river and not over-extending unless you know where the enemy jungler and mid are on the map.\nIf you're placing a pink ward think about where is the best place to put it. It should generally be somewhere where the enemy won't instantly see it and destroy it, but is still useful to your team. Or at drake/baron objectives to clear out enemy wards. Also against a champion like Akali you can use it to nullify her invisibility mid-combat.\n\nIt's not worth getting {{item:2049}} on your jungler unless you're Lee Sin in low elo, vision control is important yes but unless your team is very coordinated (and let's be honest, how often does that happen?) then combat stats are worth more. On Rammus you should get Sunfire Cape (if you went for something other than Cinderhulk like Devourer), otherwise Dead Man's Plate, Iceborne Gauntlet, Frozen Heart, Locket of the Iron Solari are all good on him. And if you have Dead Man's Plate you don't really need Mobility Boots. Merc Treads tend to be better in skirmishes and team fights.\n\nJust from looking at your ADC games I can't see any immediate faults, but I would suggest considering BotRK against tanky comps. It provides great duelling potential early - mid-game, and the active self peel can really save your ass when used correctly. Also, on Sivir the Furor's enchantment can work well because it stacks with her passive bonus MS, but you do need good stutter step mechanics to make it work (and if you don't then that's something definitely worth practicing).","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-29T06:29:26.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow! Thanks for the info. Even though you were not spending too much time on this!\nI'v got a question over the warding though, pink for drag, by this do you mean putting a pink behind the wall of drag (If team on that side), then a normal ward in vicinity of drag? Does this give the pink ward full vision even over the wall (Obviously to the extreme radius of the pink)?\n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Xenos11111","date":"2015-10-29T14:48:20.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, {{item:2043}} only gives you vision the same way a normal ward would (i.e. if you place it outside of a brush it won't see things inside the brush, and it won't see things over walls). And I mean putting the pink inside the pit, and normal wards outside. That way you can clear enemy wards that are inside the pit with the vision from the pink, and see enemies that are over the wall from the pit with the normal stealth ward.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BestPizzaEver","date":"2015-10-28T11:55:51.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to upload videos on youtube. Download a replay program (LSI is the better imho) and watch especially the games where you did bad. You will recognize your errors.

Its tough to have an impact on the game if you're spending 5+ minutes dead and another 5+ minutes walking back onto the map after respawning every game. You're probably picking alot of bad fights or staying around when you shouldn't, or taking uneccessary risks later in the game. Also don't just blindly follow up if a teammate gets caught or makes a poor decision. So often instead of one guy doing something dumb and giving up a kill, everyone nearby goes in regardless of their chances and ends up giving up several kills and towers/inhibs/baron as well. When you die, try to think why you died, and whether you should've even been in that situation to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-29T06:20:12.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thanks for that.
