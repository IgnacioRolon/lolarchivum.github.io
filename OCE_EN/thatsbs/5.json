And even if they did, you have to pay more than the champ itself to actually unlock it.\n\nI chase lvl 7's more than most people _(well... I used to.. before they became ludicrously expense)_. I have 12 total, thats the entire accumulation of the whole time it has been live. That gives me _just_ over **half** the number of champs you need to play ranked. Not to mention 6 of them are mid laners _(and likely the next one will also be a mid laner)_, which leaves me with pretty much 1 champ per other position.\nSo if i get support, and Taric is banned, what should I do? Play Kindred support? I think that'd probably be worse than having a first time champ.\n\nI see where you are coming from, no one likes that 1 guy that picks the new champ, or the champ that wrecked him last game, and has no idea what to do, but to play ranked properly you really need **minimum**  3 champs per position, thats 15 lvl 7's total. which isn't even enough to play ranked anyway.\n\nAgreed, perhaps you should have a requirement of a couple of games played with a champ before playing them in ranked. But lvl 7 _(or even 5)_ is too ambitious I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-27T06:37:03.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, also it can take different people different amounts of time to get mastery 7 on some champions.

This is more intended for the low elo group. As you hear on occasion 'Im playing a new champ iv only played twice'. At low elo everyone usually is selfish and doing that kind of stuff to help out the team is highly rare. So if they had champs they had proven they can play, then it might help the enjoyment overall for everyone....maybe.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-30T08:56:13.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are champs I have at mastery lvl6 that I am more competent on, than mastery lvl 7 champions.\n{{champion:111}} vs {{champion:35}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-26T22:41:44.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people don’t have any level 7 :(","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-27T03:15:14.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=IvHXMgEK,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-12-26T22:41:44.312+0000)\n>\n> Some people don’t have any level 7 :(\n\nHaha and some people dont play ranked as well..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-26T22:19:19.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But people can just ban the champion they're level seven with, but i get the idea that you shouldn't be able to play champions you're not skilled with in ranked","replies":[]}]}
