I thought not all ranked 5 teams were serious. Do you mean going into duo que to learn with a higher elo player who could coach? Or recording my games and being told what I could of done etc to get better?\n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"Cookie","date":"2015-05-06T09:03:33.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The last one is actually the best way to improve.
