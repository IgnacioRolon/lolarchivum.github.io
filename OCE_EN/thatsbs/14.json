I loved playing  sup my self but have goten sick of it. To much to docus on the mind for me. I just wanna farm then kill then take objectives and have a sup telling me where to go next... \r\nIm more of a follower then a alpha dog in this game. So someone with better experience then me would be a bonus. (Not someone who is too good....) Because I wont keep up. My ambition in non real life is to make silver before I retire after playing this game for 10 years (NEXT YEAR IS MY TENTH YEAR OF THIS). Im not kidding.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-03-31T08:25:23.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe ill get there on my own, you never know..","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-03-30T13:27:17.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any one else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jungle1","date":"2018-03-28T13:22:22.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add pakk","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-03-29T09:36:01.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Done thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Taknan Jr","date":"2018-03-28T23:56:05.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aha, add me ill take you to silver - Taknan jr","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-03-29T06:26:54.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha ty will do.","replies":[]}]}]}
