Did riot think of this before re- releasing?\n\nHmm, might need to stop and realize this is only going to become more re ac curing as other skins get re-opened and regurgitated as \nrewards for different events will unfold. I cant wait for them to release King Rammus again...... not.\n\nDoes anyone know of any alternative reward? Dare i ask riot?\n\nOk, So iv found this from link https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148:\n\nI already have Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick skins! What do I get instead?\n\nIf you already have those skins, you’ll still get a chance to pick up some new champions through champion shards in Honor Capsules, with more rewards coming through them over time. Also, Honor-exclusive loading screen flairs let others know when you’ve received honors from teammates and you’ll unlock even more rewards at the end of the season.\n\nDoes this sound fair?
