I would imagine. I joined this game with 3 mates at the time in 2009 and we are still playing. Ik we should give it up because we haven&#039;t got far at all, but the game is still one of my favorites.

Assuming the beta was mostly populated by english speakers and assuming the proportion of ranked players of each region is similar to the amount of beta players of each region gives oce around about 5330 beta players. So anywhere between 6 and 5330 players?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-04-19T06:47:09.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you find out how to get the ID on lolking?","replies":[{"poster":"Rikin","date":"2015-04-19T08:56:47.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the various \"How long have I played?\" threads.
