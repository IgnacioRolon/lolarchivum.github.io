But seeing as my internet keeps cutting out before or mid game I am terrified that if I try again the internet will go out or something and I will get a permanent ban, seeing as I have spent a lot of money ( like everyone who plays league pretty much ) on my account with skins and so on, I don&#039;t want to risk losing that. So my question is, is there a way to get rid of your &#039;bad points&#039; im going to call it. Is there any other way other than playing games and not being a toxic poop or AFKing once more?","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-07-15T00:18:20.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  So my question is, is there a way to get rid of your 'bad points' im going to call it.
