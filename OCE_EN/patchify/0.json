I was looking around and someone said it could be a firewall or something or it could be the recent patch but it only started yesterday so I don&#039;t think thats the case. Anyone got any idea&#039;s how I can fix this issue? \r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-26T03:05:53.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like it could be related to high [Packet Loss](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq6) and/or [Packet Buffering](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7), please attempt the fixes linked under Packet Buffering.\n\nLet me know if the information on either of those links helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Patchify","date":"2016-01-26T10:02:12.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tested some other games out and it's on my end! I disconnect for 20-30 seconds so it's not just league.  Also I can't use the ICSI Netalyzr since i'm using Chrome, so I can't get the java thing needed to use that.
