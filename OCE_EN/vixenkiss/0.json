Have a great day on the rift!\nAnother thing, clash wasn't canceled for everyone, some people manged to get though the scouting phase \nso that's a possibility on how they got the banner, somehow they also managed to get the cup also upon further inspection!!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dMhKsHd\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dCAfNh6\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}\n","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2018-05-27T03:36:48.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think clash didn't crash for the tier1 players since there was so few of them, also unless that dudes challenger in solo/duo im inclined to believe hes d3 at best, since very few actual Challenger players play flex.  your flex rank means nothing, there are player who cant hit challenger in solo/duo that hit it easy in flex since there are way less good players playing flex","replies":[{"poster":"VixenKiss","date":"2018-05-27T07:55:32.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i got informed that tier 1 players were able to play clash thanks for the comment i appreciate it :)\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-05-27T02:10:03.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey uh i think biofrost is that pro support guy","replies":[]}]}
