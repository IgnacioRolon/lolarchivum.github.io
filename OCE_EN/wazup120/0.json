I could play a game and then the next game, I would disconnect every minute where my client would crash. Obviously i got penalised for this. I was put into low priority queue (20mins) and ever since then, OPGG has shown my rank has bronze 1 with 7lp. Has anyone got any idea what this is about? Is this about my MMR. Did riot degrade all my efforts o.o","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-07-03T13:35:23.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's showing me gold 5?
