I rarely ever die to solokills, and usually win lane and yet I always seem to lose more than I win. I was recently at Gold 2 with a winrate of 60% but now its dropped so much because im getting matched with consistently bad players and got demoted to gold 3. Since then, Ive had so much trouble trying to find winning games either because of feeding top or bot lanes. Either way, it seems as though my team is consistently worse than the enemies. I'm also always checking dmg to champ stat at the end game and most games i am either at the top or second most. As a one-trick syndra should i switch to another champ that can hard solo carry or have more impact? Because I'm doubting that Syndra is viable for climbing elo. Here's my op.gg. Note that I have consistently high KDA and rarely feeding in games.\r\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=mandarindubbed","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-02T14:42:25.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot won't do anything unless it makes them $$, I got chat banned for trying to get people to play the game, wasn't even being toxic. just getting fed up with people with 10 deaths at 15 minutes into the game","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-03T03:57:13.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could believe this, had a mate get a chat ban for telling someone to shush and play instead of talking moreso than playing. \nCan confirm rito doesnt care.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-03T05:29:34.990+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exarch Leona,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d1EV9nYh,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-03-03T03:57:13.267+0000)\n>\n> Could believe this, had a mate get a chat ban for telling someone to shush and play instead of talking moreso than playing. \n> Can confirm rito doesnt care.\n\nWas a great game -_- https://gyazo.com/bc025492f2a5c69bd834a3fe49a4b041","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-03T05:54:26.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yall got messed up daaaaaaaaaaamn. \nNami not rushing censor though, that hurts.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-03T18:55:49.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exarch Leona,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d1EV9nYh,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-03T05:54:26.071+0000)\n>\n> Yall got messed up daaaaaaaaaaamn. \n> Nami not rushing censor though, that hurts.\n\nyeah I am having those games every game I am not autofilled, when I get autofilled I just feed and join in on the fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikki","date":"2019-03-03T23:33:58.054+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"why cant i climb gold\"\n\n\"when i get autofilled im just int feeding for fun\"\n\nI think you answered your own question my friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-04T08:20:31.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nikki,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d1EV9nYh,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2019-03-03T23:33:58.054+0000)\n>\n> \"why cant i climb gold\"\n> \n> \"when i get autofilled im just int feeding for fun\"\n> \n> I think you answered your own question my friend.\n\nI end up inting, didn't mean I actually int, always getting auto filled jg, noit a roll I have been doing well in lately","replies":[{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-03-05T10:05:57.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then seriously, learn to dodge when auto-filled.

I really can not figure it out for the life of me. \n\nBut at the moment, ranked is unclimbable because :\n1 - The average game will consist of you, 2 feeders, and 2 afk farmers.\n2 - The game will pair you up with low ranked players with terrible MMR, while placing you against high ranked players.
