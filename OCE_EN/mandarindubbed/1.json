This is to keep you from winning a series, losing a few games and then immediately dropping back to where you were. The shield lasts for 3 games after advancing a division, and 10 games after advancing a tier (3 games for Master tier).\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3q2","replies":[{"poster":"MandarinDubbed","date":"2019-07-17T04:12:44.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has it already expired?

Could you verify this? I have had a bad llose streak and have lost 6 games in a row at 0 lp, so I'm really scared of getting demoted to platinum, because i want to keep diamond rewards :((","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-17T12:06:00.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be that it's 10 games at 0 LP? That sounds like too much but I'm not sure sorry. Player Support might be able to shed some more light but the only info I have is what's in that FAQ that I linked.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
