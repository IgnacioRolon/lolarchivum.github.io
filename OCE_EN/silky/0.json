Once champion select has concluded and the game begins to launch, I am hit with a bug-splat explaining that something is wrong with my installation and will continuously refresh the client while trying to re-load the game and displaying the error multiple times, never making it to the loading screen.\n\nI have attempted to repair my client multiple times, however this does not fix the problem.\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463189539821846540/542520347493400582/unknown.png\n\nThis bug has resulted in two remake games, as shown here.\nhttps://gyazo.com/93c9e18bbf7018a2fba5fd6b24ec26fd\n\nI cannot download and reinstall the game as I am using Optus wireless broadband and lack the data allowance to do so. Is riot aware of the problem? Apparently it&#039;s quite common at the moment. \n\nThanks, \nSilky.","replies":[{"poster":"Iheartchicken2","date":"2019-02-06T03:23:52.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have this as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pronstar","date":"2019-02-06T02:28:59.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue.
