Riot Gehirn has a post with a [detailed explanation here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/dbkjXlyL-known-issue-ranked-lp-gains-not-correct) if you wanna read it.\n\nUnfortunately we're unable to fix the missed LP / promos retroactively.  With the way the LP system works though, it will balance out in the long run as you keep playing :)\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"MrMitchc123","date":"2017-03-02T05:28:36.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Mindstar \n\nI have read the post and i understand i am now in my promos to silver and it seems to getting fixed and i hope something like this doesn't happen again.","replies":[]}]}]}
