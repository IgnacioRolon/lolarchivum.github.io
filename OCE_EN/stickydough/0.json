Happens around 18-22 mins of play, have to reboot. League is the only game this occurs in, no matter graphics setting. Whilst league is frozen, can still hear sounds from other apps, and league voice, just can&#039;t play. I have an SSD, so rebooting doesn&#039;t take long, its just the hassle of doing so, especially in teamfights, or if im split pushing, only to find i&#039;ve been caught. \r\n\r\nI also play Fortnite, PubG, DOTA2 and various other steam games, without issue. \r\nHad faulty ram, that has since been replaced, memcheck comes up clear, and have seen other players report this issue. Someone I duo with has the same problem. \r\n\r\nRunning the program on Windows 10, in Win7 Compatability, as I have had the issue previously and this fixed it. Not the case now, however.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-11T10:44:25.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend updating your graphics card drivers and your DirectX.
