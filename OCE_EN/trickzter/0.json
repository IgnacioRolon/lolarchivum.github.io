You have to remember that any champion can be deemed OP when he or she are fed. In addition, considering she is a new champion, very few players know how to play her and how to counter play her bar the few that already used her during PBE. Every champion has its advantages and its disadvantages. Look for Rek'Sai's disadvantages.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-22T10:46:08.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dw he getting nerfed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abyss of Souls","date":"2014-12-16T07:21:22.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why do people always seem to cry op with new champs, the last 2-3 of them have been buffed the following patch\nits been commented before you just need to let the community get use to her and then see how well she does in a competitive environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2014-12-16T09:17:51.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista hasn't had changes afaik, Azir is incredibly strong, he's just really buggy, Gnar got buffed because people couldn't see how strong he was/his play style was a bit different.
