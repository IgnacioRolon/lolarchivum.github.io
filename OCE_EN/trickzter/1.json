Blaziken is ok but he can ONLY play TOP and Jungle and only three champions which are Nasus,Cho&#039;Gath and Sejuani.I&#039;m not trying to be jealous by saying I deserve silver i know im bad but at least i try.I only mentioned 3 out of 8 people who got straight boosted to Silver after winning like 0-5 games on average in ranked.\r\n\r\nExplanation Please? Ranked is about the climb.Bronze being the foundation and Challenger being the finish line.Everyone is getting thrown into silver like bronze is too full.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-17T11:19:55.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"waa waa bitch bitch how does Ranked work?\"\n\nSeriously can people who make these posts go see how ranked works and then not make these shitty posts?\n\nHint: your friend who won 7/10, was bronze last season after winning 1 game, out of a grand total of 12.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-04-17T10:11:19.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you don't feel bad, bronze 1-2 is essentially silver 5-4, just keep playing with a positive mindset and try your best to perform.
