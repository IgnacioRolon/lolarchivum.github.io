How ever when I then tried to sign up for another game it does not do anything. Tried all the different game modes and it does not start. Tried closing the client and reopening, when it opens it says game already in progress and tries to load the game that I had already finished.\r\n\r\nStill can not join/start a game after over an hour. \r\nAny help please?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T00:11:39.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I didn't get to you when you had the issue, but for a little context you encountered what's known as a ghost game. Basically the server doesn't get the message that the game is over, even though it is. Typically it works itself out within an hour or two, though they can (very rarely) take as long as 5~. It's not something that can really be fixed manually, you just kinda have to wait for the server to catch up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Larry Fisherman","date":"2018-03-06T00:41:51.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AYYEEE MINES FINALLY WORKING AFTER AN HOUR","replies":[{"poster":"Wyldfyre","date":"2018-03-06T04:23:04.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool, yeah mine started working about an hour and a half later.","replies":[]}]}]}
