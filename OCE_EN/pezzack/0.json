The population on here means we can either have one ranked queue type or the other.  \n\nI suspect they might change it to role pick except for the support issue and the fact that no jungler is common in sub lvl 30 games.  \n\nSupports are sucking less to play every year, so that's improving.  When they take the kill/death distinction out I might even want to play them myself on occasions.  The trick about what to do with games below lvl 30 with no jungler might be tricky though (if we only had ranked draft).\n\nWe'd also get complaints from the mains of temporarily overpowered or terribly unfun to face champions that they couldn't play their mains even in normals.","replies":[]}]}
