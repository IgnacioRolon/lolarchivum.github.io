It could be a specific mechanic you like, or their lore, or simply because they're super adorably cute. Honestly, it doesn't matter. Heck, there were Korean Challengers who one-tricked pre-rework Aatrox, or Diamond I's who main AD Soraka Top.\n\nIf you want a strong Jungler... Graves or Rengar. Both really strong atm.\n\nBut if you want to transition more to Mid lane, there are several good picks. Annie, for starters. Orianna is a champion that is always in the meta, and requires little laning skill as she is a very safe champion who excels in teamfights. Aurelian Sol is a champion that, when mastered, can easily carry you to Diamond if you play properly. If you're willing to put in the time and effort (like a lot of it!), then Katarina is fun. Good Kats are honestly amazing. Your name has Zed. What about him?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut to reiterate my point... It doesn't matter which champion you pick. Just as long as you enjoy them (otherwise those 100s or 1,000s of games will be a nightmare).","replies":[{"poster":"SKT Zed","date":"2018-10-23T09:48:36.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps for the advice! i really appreciate it and it changes my aspect of the game alot, your very right.

Is your team.\n\nWhen I was B5 for life. I blame my team. Then wonder why I would never climb. The issue wasn't me and it was always my team.\nThen I started to think \" What does this team need. \" So I played Garen. A tank and damage dealer. Someone that can just get kills easy enough to make my team think \" Yeah we can win \"\n\nThen I started to play Shen { Another team base champion } and really started to carry hard. To end this short or I will behere for ever typing my life story. Champions that can carry.. Are the ones that make your team really think. WE CAN WIN.\nThis is how I did it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-24T10:17:00.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever you find fun since anything can get you to Diamond if you good enough.\n\nIn my first season I mained Nasus to go from Bronze to Silver.\n\nIn my second season I mained Blitzcrank to get to Plat with a Duo ADC.\n\nThe next season I played Graves top/jg and stayed in Gold.\n\nThe last 2 seasons I've played mainly Nasus/Renekton.\nWhen I got tilted this season and couldn't seem to win with Renekton no matter what i did, I decided to play Ziggs/Xerath and managed to get to Plat.\n\nI also got my smurf account to Gold maining Jax JG.\n\nReally doesn't matter who, as long as you get good, you can climb with any champ.\n\nI watched streamers and learnt matchups too.
