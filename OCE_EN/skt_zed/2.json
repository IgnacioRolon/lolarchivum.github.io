Your next 2 games will be with monkeys. Do you best to mute and carry.\n\nOne strategy that I have been trying is that when you lose a game after winning promos, go into ARAM and play. If you lose three games in a row, you are ready to play ranked again (screws up the rito bs matchmaking in your favour). If you don't lose three games in a row, play about 5 games then return to ranked.\n\nIf you get trolls in champ select, dodge. (Use oce.op.gg/multi to check and see what they are typing. If its some BS thats not relevant, they are a monkey). When you are on a 30 min dodge timer, go do some cooking/work/study.\n\nOh, and if you are a support, please note that due to a lack of support players out there, you will be the highest ranked player in the game and have monkeys on your team. Do your best to be a zookeeper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-09T09:11:30.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know. It's a really weird one.

My last couple of games, there was always at least one toxic person :/ \n\nWhen I play support,I tend to get ADC's that get mad because I don't go in (Leona support,but I guess it is my fault that's I'm too passive) and I had ADCs complain about how they could carry if they had an actual support T-T. Speaking from my own experience here, but it feels like some players in low elo focus too much on watching other lanes and spamming the enemy missing ping than actually focusing on themselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-09T15:38:54.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what's happening to me.
