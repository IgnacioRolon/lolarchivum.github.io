Now if you press and hold down a key for an ability and right click whilst it is held down it cancels the key press meaning you have to press the key again to cast the spell. Pre 5.7 you could right click and aim simultaneously.\r\n\r\nWas just after some clarification of this, already tried riot support and they sent me here. Either way its a really annoying change","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:01:28.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't changed. It's always been \"right-click to cancel casting abilities\".\n\nThere was nothing in the notes in regards to this either.\n\nWere you still playing on the same computer using the same OS? Did you change mouse/any control configuration? Sometimes changing a setting somewhere affects another setting in a completely different area.\n\nI tell you, though, if I could get it to behave like that with standard cast (ie. use another button to cancel casting so that you can still move while aiming) then I'd love it.\n\nI hate how they sent you here, though. We have a lot less tools and references at our disposal. It's not like we can implement features like this into the game or anything.","replies":[]}]}
