Yes? No? Sometimes your faced with the prospect that it seems absolutely hopeless to try and fight, or run, because you simply cannot attack them. If you run, you inevitably die.\r\n\r\nFirst, the problem I wish to bring to attention is that ARAM has a few champions, namely Sona, Lux and Xerath, when picked, wreck ABSOLUTE havoc in game, be they behind or ahead. I wish that certain champions will receive a shed of modification so that they don't completely melt your ass in 3 seconds flat, 5 minutes into the game.\r\n\r\nSecond, if one team is ahead in ARAM, it is certainly very difficult if not impossible for the losing team to have a fighting chance. This more or less corresponds to the point above.\r\n\r\nThird, this is a simple method to address all the problems stated above, minus the feeling of complete loss and annihilation and to some short-tempered and toxic players, rage. Adjust the surrender timer from 20 minutes to around 10 minutes to allow the opposition to surrender the game more quickly because dying over and over and over and over again doesn't really help the team's morale.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I know that this argument is not a particularly strong or stable one and that there may be certain details that are exaggerated or wrong in some way, but I wish for you to at least see the problem here.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-08T10:17:34.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although these changes are a bit, outrageous, I do agree with the fact that the champions should be adjusted a bit so that they aren't overpowered on the map.

Being able to surrender at 10 minutes or 15 minutes will solve that. Because some games in ARAM are extremely one sided when you have that one guy catching all of Lux's spells and Blitzcrank's hooks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lost In Time","date":"2014-12-07T07:54:11.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hate how if the enemy team has two tanks and you have none, it's either end by 15 mins or lose.","replies":[{"poster":"ADC or Cry","date":"2014-12-07T08:12:47.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I just hate how if the enemy team has two tanks and you have none, it's either end by 15 mins or lose.\n\nOr you can just build tank,,,,,","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-07T08:57:45.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tank teemo u w0t m8{{champion:17}} {{item:1031}} {{item:3075}} {{item:1011}} {{item:3047}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kalhedra","date":"2015-01-16T12:51:05.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"other than that the other thing has got me pissed is I wasted 2 rerolls just to get warwick evertime I rerolled wtf I thought it was supposed to be random not %%%% like that and to boot our team had no ranged and the other team had 2 and 3 tanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-07T14:11:38.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend has suggested getting rid of all the champions who can do some cray cray heals (Soraka, Sona, Nami, etc).\nI think that'd be good.
