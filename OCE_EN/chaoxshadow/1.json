However, checking my internet status, the cable was connected and the wi-fi signal was strong (I keep both active because my network cable is sort of broken (it doesn't click into the socket and stay). I then decided to disconnect and reconnect to the game however the game client showed the button with the text \"Skip waiting for results\" like the one you receive when the end game results take a longer time to load than usual. I thought this was a bug and 'skipped' however it brought me to the home screen of the client. Puzzled I checked my match history and surprisingly the game was not there, no trace at all. I checked the people I recently played with, no one there. I also restarted the client but, nothing.\n\nThis is the first time I've received this type of problem. However asking some of my friends, none of them have yet to received a 'ghost game' or as I call it but they have said to have sometimes receive a sudden disconnection without any warning prior with their internet still connected without problem.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T03:00:19.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weird. I'd suggest calling it something other than 'Ghost Game', as that's a term used to describe games which persist to continue even though it's ended.\n\nWhat happens is that if everyone in a game disconnects from it (as in, no humans are playing), then the game pauses, waits a moment, then ends. I'm not too sure whether or not it's recorded in anyone's match history (I thought it would just be marked as \"Interrupted\" instead of \"Victory\" or \"Defeat\"), though that's probably what happened. Did you get punished by Leavebuster by any chance?","replies":[]}]}
