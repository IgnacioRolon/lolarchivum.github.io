My question is if im facing gold players in everygame and mainly its all gold but myself being the only silver how do I get placed in silver when I went on a 7 game win streak and ended with 8 wins 2 losses. If I was to que a match right now I will que up against high gold players because my MMR is higher than silver.","replies":[{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2019-02-17T07:09:15.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know its lame, but you finished Silver 1 last season, getting any higher off placements is very unlikely. Still, whilst you are playing against gold 2 thats not necessarily bad. Obviously it's not fun if you cant win but if you stick with it eventually your mmr will move down to around gold 3-4 and you should start winning games and climb. On-top of this if you do win at gold 2 mmr you'll climb quickly.","replies":[{"poster":"Taeke","date":"2019-02-17T07:14:16.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not to do with my loses, the MMR is broken I have seen people who are doing their placements for a new season and they were silver last season and they go 10 - 0 and ended up in plat 5.

I have done that myself I have gone from gold 5 to gold 3 by just doing placements.\n\nSad part about this. When the season started I went ham day 1. Did all my placements and got placed into B2. Silver 4 fighting for silver 3 end of last season. \nSo I was okay B2.. But about 1 week later I got into silver 4 and now trying to get into silver 3. The one thing I have found that has shit the hell out of me about the ranking system on OCE is how MMR DOESNT MATTER ANYMORE.\n\nIn fact I got another account I am about to do rank on. I am going to play support only. I made a post on NA about the issue on OCE and the support role being randomly placed in games with no real care for what tier and mmr it is. Only to get the normal NA idea of it.. Which is sad in it's self as NA popualtion in 5 times the OCE population. \nSo when it comes to OCE the way it seems.. IT IS A FUCKORAMA!\n\nGoing by  the old system before OPGG took it away. I would have been placed into gold 3 at the end of my placements. { Playing as top } But by the new system it is B2. The new system on the other hand is more worried about games and making games and the popaltion of each tier.\nIf there isn't enough people for say Silver 1.. People that are Gold + are now demoted so to speak during placements to make the popaltion of that tier.\n\nIn fact once I finished my placements. I was the only one in B2 for about 2 weeks. Even when I got into promos about a day later for B1.. I was the only one in my tier or anyother teir for that fact. \nSo once someone was added into the tier I was alone in I added them or OPGG them and saw B1 was full of silver 1 players last season. That is a full tier below what they were. They even did the placement matches vsing gold and some how.. BRONZE 1.\n\nI climbed back into silver fast. So I didn't mind being B2 placement. But the fact remains. WHY ADD IRON TO OCE only to say \" We believe this will allow everyone to climb easier \" when it has completely fragged everyone.\n\nhttps://www.unrankedsmurfs.com/blog/how-many-lol-players-are-on-each-server\n\nThis is my point. Then went you take inaccount of rank population \n\nhttps://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution/oce\n\nYou can see it even more. This is why also we dont have role placements. Nothing to do with \" We are testing it \" has everything to do with pop on the server. \n\nSince riot cannot take the time to care about OCE.. I cannot take the time to play more then a few games { Maybe } a week. Climbing the rank ladder on OCE is just a joke. Sure dont get me wrong here. Master tier and Diamond gold and so on will always climb. But others.. Welcome to hard stuck. The poplation cannot handle massive up ranking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Did You Feel It","date":"2019-02-17T07:11:17.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same situation as Taeke, but I ended gold 1 last season, and I went 8-2 this season, but I ended up in silver 3.
