However, during spellcast the passive should work, but on 3 of her abilities (Q, W and E) her passive is disabled. If you look at the video I&#039;ve provided, I used Boots of Mobility as a reference for this. I know it&#039;s minor, but I thought it&#039;d be worth either changing the tooltip or how it works to more accurately reflect how it works.

It's working as intended.\n\nTaliyah's passive is disabled during combat, which is defined as dealing/receiving damage and using abilities. Her passive *should* be disabled when you're using Threaded Volley (Q), Seismic Shift (W) or Unraveled Earth (E).\n\nI don't know where you got the idea that her passive should work on ability casts...","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-02T08:35:03.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Her passive should be disabled when you're using Threaded Volley (Q), Seismic Shift (W) or Unraveled Earth (E).\n\nThe argument is that until you actually do damage with said abilities, you shouldn't lose the passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taerio","date":"2016-06-02T08:58:12.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I used Mobility Boots as a guideline for this before posting :), by that same standard, Mobility Boots _should_ be disabled when you cast an ability too, and it never has, I think that the definition of combat by the computer should be at the same standard if nothing else I guess, but I feel like it may have been an unintentional hindrance to Taliyah (which she **really** doesn't need tbh)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-02T11:21:35.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then the point is moot. If there's nothing around for your abilities to hit, why are you using them? If there is something around for your abilities to hit, then the only reason you'd logically be using them is to initiate combat.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-02T22:45:44.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worked ground for the higher movespeed in that area?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taerio","date":"2016-06-02T13:02:16.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what you're saying, but let's say she misses her spells. Now, if a champion had boots of mobility and missed a spell, they'd not be punished for it, just have a little less mana. But because of the way Taliyah works, if she misses, she no longer gains her movespeed buff, and can be more easily punished for it. Additionally, I've found that setting up Q fields on the way to a fight is really helpful, especially as a support so I can reposition more easily. It's minor, but I feel like Taliyah could use any little buff she can get her hands on. But if Riot wish to keep it working the same way, I feel like they should possibly change the tooltip to more accurately reflect how it works.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
