Anyway when we get into game he buys no items then goes top and waits for Yi to kill her and says nothing. I then asked him why he did it and he said nothing, so I say I'm reporting him for win trading and he stops to type whilst walking mid with no items still. He typed, \"I have wireless mouse and it is on LSD,\" to everyone in the game it was extremely obvious what he was doing and once he finished typing in all chat he continued walking mid to feed mid and then dc's right afterwards. On my placements too :(.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/76598469/200094566?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-01-24T03:24:40.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job on the 4v5 win :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"BfM DevOuR","date":"2015-01-23T13:52:54.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nut up and shut up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Armpitpleasures","date":"2015-01-24T20:27:41.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He or she obviously didn't try trolling hard enough.
