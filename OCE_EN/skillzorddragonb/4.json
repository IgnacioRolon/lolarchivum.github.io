I am hoping for Gnar to be deleted and Liss aint really broken just really annoying. I think ranged top laners are just getting out of control.\r\nGnar is a resourceless range poke champ with an escape/gap closer that is good in teamfights NOT JUST not bad he IS FUCKING GOOD, I understand some champions can beat him top but I find it very annoying to lane vs him then have the little cunt build full tank and out scale me whilst still doing damage. I have beaten Gnars but it relies completely on them getting too close to me.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot delete Gnar from League of Legions.\r\n*signed sincerely, **The King of Swing***","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Strawberry","date":"2015-01-23T01:03:04.255+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do have weaknesses - just not terribly obvious ones.\n\nIn Lissandra's case, I can vouch for her epic poke, but for a mage it's quite short ranged and pushes the wave. Lissandra hates all-in champs that can CC her out of using E and don't care about her W (Jax, Fiora, Riven if you're good) She has excellent escape, but that escape is on a 10 (W) or 20-ish (E) second cooldown. Once she uses those spells she has nothing left to defend herself, and is easily shredded by the likes of the above.\n\nI don't play Gnar, but have played against a few as Riven. His E is on a 20-second CD aswell, so when he uses it, you have control of the lane if he's using it to escape. The best solution to a Gnar is all-inning him when he is in Mega form and is about to go little. He's slow enough to catch up with in Mega form, and when he switches to Mini use your CC to keep him there. Mini Gnar is squishy as hell so managing to catch him spells his death, much like Teemo. Also TBH his boomerang doesn't do a whole lot of damage, his W is what hurts the most for me.\n\nTLDR: Long Cooldowns need to be exploited more - learn your enemy and keep a mental check on their abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-01-23T08:15:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, that will help alot.

Depending on the champ they should change something like there damage, resistances, power curve or mana costs etc cuz ofc what works for one ranged top isn't the solution for all.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-22T15:55:50.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Riot defiantly needs to do something.\n\nRiot determines the meta now?\n\nFact is range top laners work, learn to either play against them, or choose a different champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-22T15:59:11.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3qLRKR7j,comment-id=000400000000,timestamp=2015-01-22T15:55:50.876+0000)\n>\n> Riot determines the meta now?\n> \n> Fact is range top laners work, learn to either play against them, or choose a different champ.\n\nI myself don't have many issues with ranged tops (except Quinn seriously %%%% that %%%%%) but the general consensus seems to be that they are oppressive (not necessarily OP) so I came to the conclusion that Riot could tone them down a bit in the annoying areas to leave them viable but a little less pull your hair out, if you know what I mean.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-22T16:06:37.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they get toned down though, they lose their pocket pick potential in their actual lanes (hell Quinn is like never an ADC)\n\nYes they are oppressive, but you have to learn to play against it.\n\nHell i had a Nasus thank me for going Quinn top at the end of the game, because he knew he had to learn to farm against Oppression and asked me for tips (12 stacks at 10 minutes is oppressive)\n\n(Also just as a note, editing this in and all, Gnar isn't even on a 50% win rate, and yet his OP?)","replies":[{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-01-23T07:48:12.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not saying he is op im saying he encourages a boring easy, safe playstyle that fcuks over champions that take skill and knowledge of matchups to win.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-01-22T14:52:40.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just beat gnar with shaco top.

Pretty easy matchup after you get better.\n\nAs for gnar, free farm all day because ALL GNAR DOES is use that bounce thing to run away so just shield his boomerang with ur E and farm all day.
