Besides that they were a reasonably good team and grouped, tried to win and most importantly of all they listened to everything I said as if it was gospel. The only reason I ever get toxic is when people get caught or don't listen to my great insight on league of legends. Besides their feeding they were actually a very good easy team to work with considering. But please Riot fix matchmaking so I don't have to endure this every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-21T05:13:53.063+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://backtothethames.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/inigomontoya.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oho","date":"2015-01-21T05:22:14.477+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously carried but I don't think your team fed..
