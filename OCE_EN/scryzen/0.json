However, when I started playing on the second day and onwards, the ping was at a consistent 220-230 ms. This got me really annoyed since the ping is even higher than on NA servers after the transfer. If anyone knows how to help or has an idea of what&#039;s causing the ping to increase by 100 please let me know. I&#039;m playing from Hong Kong.","replies":[{"poster":"Silver Scrub","date":"2015-10-07T12:29:28.598+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my god someone else is having this problem as well! When i swapped it was all fine and dandy, then all of a sudden i was getting more and more frequent solid 222 ping games. It's hindered my play so much and frustrates me so much... If i wanted 222+ ping i'd have saved my 2k rp and stayed on na instead of swapping over. I doubt i'll be able to get back to silver like i was on na now. There goes my end of season rewards T{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bibsdaboss","date":"2015-10-11T08:10:36.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That really clears things up. I'm another HK player that is getting absolutely shafted by the 100 ping increase (extra salty because I spent 2k RP to transfer from NA to OCE). Server change first demoted me from S3 to B2 and then the ping increased to exactly 222 so that carrying myself out of bronze again is impossible. Check my match history and you will see exactly how many {{item:3070}} have been shed. Is there anything riot can do to help out besides asking us to wait for the cable to be fixed (approx. mid october) and then grind it out for end of season rewards (2 weeks later)?","replies":[{"poster":"Silver Scrub","date":"2015-10-12T04:56:55.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY SHIT DITTO AS FUCK DUDE.

It looks like your network traffic is travelling from Hong Kong to Sydney via the USA, which explains the high ping.  There are many reasons why this might occur - ISPs do switch up their routes from time to time (as they add and remove capacity), or if they think they see a better path for traffic.\n\nI'm not sure if there is anything we can do to influence this, but I've passed it on to our network team to find out if there is something we can do to help out.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-08T01:42:49.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Update:** It looks like there has been a cut to one of the major undersea cables that connects Australia to Singapore, and this is disrupting traffic throughout southeast asia.

If you can update me on when it'll be fixed, that would be awesome. I don't mind the disruption in service too much seeing as I recently made the account but I'm glad that the trace route managed to help identify the problem quickly.
