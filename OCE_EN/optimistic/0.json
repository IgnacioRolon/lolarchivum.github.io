Ive got 2 accs in plat now and 2 in gold. got over 3k hours ingame easy. - IGN Caelus - Gotten to Plat 1 in a ranked 5s team off here and played in many 5 person queues. Why i should be picked: i Have good map knowledge and focused on objectives and can help with peoples builds, likable person with good mechanics and understands the game well. Strengths would be play making and game knowledge and who to focus in fights and how to win games. Weaknesses: overextending for that last wave so u get a good buy back but get caught xD Goals. to find a team i enjoy playing with and the members excite me when i play with them by the level they know the game and there skills.
