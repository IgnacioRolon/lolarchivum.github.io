Devoting their lives to the study of the Lightless Pact, Archeon was an exceptional student. He began his studying at the age of 9, after his father was discharged due to a rare sickness, spread by the Black mist in times of great darkness. Archeon, named after the first Inquisitor, joined the Inquisition to find a cure for this sickness and protect the people of his homeland. In the weeks leading up to his Graduation from the Academy of the Inquisitors, his young sister had fallen victim to the same disease of his deceased father. With his research of the disease not yet complete, he became desperate. Turning to the dark arts, he summoned Natu'La, the primordial god of sickness and begged him for a cure. The demonic god scoffed at the young Inquisitors request and ordered him to return him to the Voodoo lands. Filled with rage, Archeon threatened to destroy the god if he would not cure his sister. Amused by the young inquisitors outburst of rage, he agreed to cure his young sister, but Archeon would have to bear the Dark mark for the rest of his days. Archeon agreed. The next day, Archeon's sister was cured, but his mentor sensed a change in Archeons behavior. He became more agitated, snapping at the old inquisitor. He removed Archeons hood, and discovered the shifting mark of the dark god. Archeon told his mentor what had happened, and begged for forgiveness. When his mentor told him that he must kill his own sister to repent for his actions, Archeon refused, and in an outburst of rage, tore the old man apart with an explosion of holy light. Forced into self exile, Archeon wishes to forge a new inquisition as a balance between light and dark magics. But before he does that, he must prove himself as a warrior on the Fields of Justice.\r\n\r\nAppearance:   Archeon wears a red cloak, belted at the waist. Metal flaps (sorta like a kilt. You know the thing I'm talking about) cover his thighs. His hood is up, and blond locks protrude from his hood. He wears simple black metal pauldrons  and leather gloves and boots, with simple black cloth pants. his weapons are black steel blades with inscriptions in a demonic language on them. A tome hangs from a chain at his belt with a pentagram on the leather cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nLore's pretty shoddy, and even I've gotta admit, he's sorta broken, but his numbers can be tweeked.\r\nHope you enjoy :DD","replies":[{"poster":"SnowingGnat","date":"2015-01-03T10:06:19.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously put alot of time into this and I commend you for it.
