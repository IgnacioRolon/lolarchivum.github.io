The remake system only works if a player who has failed to connect at the start of the game does not return. At the three minute mark players can type /remake to end the game and restart it without penalties except for the AFK who is penalized. However, in one of my games, the adc failed to connect at the start of the game, reconnected and then disconnected shortly after.  At the three minute mark we could not remake the game because the player had reconnected before disconnecting again.\r\n\r\nI feel like this should be changed? Regardless of whether a player has reconnected or not, if there&#039;s a disconnected player at all before 5 minutes into the game we should be allowed to remake the game. \r\n\r\nLost my promos because of this and I&#039;m intrigued to see if Riot would like to change this.","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-08T14:47:22.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Wolfcchi,\n\nFirstly it sucks that you lost your promos! Honestly that is a terrible feeling. I believe you'll get back in them and win the next one. I had to do my diamond promos 4 times. :(\n\nThe remake idea that riot implemented isn't perfect, but it is really good. \n\nCurrently the remake option allows a remake if:\n\na) A player is afk/dc for more than 90 seconds at the 3 minute mark. \nb) First blood hasn't been shed prior to the DC. It may have been possible that FB went to the enemy team before your Ezreal disconnected a second time? \n\nExtending the AFK time to 5 minutes could lead to people abusing the system. Any kind of system Riot implements that alters LP gain/loss needs to be regulated really carefully.","replies":[]}]}
