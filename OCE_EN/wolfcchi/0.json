If there was a counter next to the champion in the profile so other people can see how many S&#039;s you get after you reach mastery 7 this would be super awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-05T06:30:33.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about % S, just for personal satisfaction","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfcchi","date":"2016-12-08T11:26:45.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want anything to be honest.. just something that marks how good you are at a champion despite getting mastery 7. Because you could have lucked out and gotten a team that carried you to an S. But to constantly get S's and to have a profile that shows it, that's a different story.","replies":[]}]}]}
