It is placed by clicking on a spot on the ground, and makes the champion spend 4 seconds channeling to construct it. When it is placed, any ally can click on it to enter. 2 players can fit inside. The hut has three windows and a door. When inside, mouse movement will grant vision out of one of the three windows, in a cone for about 1500 range. \n\nThe hut has 400-1800 hp (based on level) and takes half damage from ranged attacks. \n\nIf the champion is ranged, they can auto-attack, or cast spells through the windows at their normal range.\n\nAny champion inside the hut is invulnerable.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-03-16T09:01:56.288+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL i thought it was gonna be a joke about junglers camping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-16T10:51:06.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wait, you're... serious? or....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-03-16T07:47:09.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummmmm what?","replies":[]}]}
