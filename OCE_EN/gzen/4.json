I'm sorry, I don't really understand this\n\n>W no longer has an AD ratio.\n\nMost mages don't have AD scalings and  hybrid itemisation is pretty lame (especially since changes to triforce). [Here is an in-depth discussion about the balancing issues around hybrid damage.](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2013/05/xypherous-talks-hybrid-itemization-and.html)\n\n>Charm now has 200 less range.\nNow to get a pick, I literally have to be in the enemies face.\n\nYou don't have to be that close,  it's still pretty easy to land and get a combo off safely. Ahri is a really mobile champion, with her ult and the move speed buff from her Q making it really easy to position well and play safely while dishing out tonnes of damage.","replies":[]}]}
