The system used to grade people is the same on all servers, it just that you get compared to a different pool of players. \n\nFrom Riot:\n\n> It’s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\n**Riot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade* ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-03T14:27:52.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what Yaiamone said. \n\nAlso well said!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T08:50:27.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's mostly about your kda, kill participation, cs and towers taken numbers. I've done some experimenting but it seems these are the metrics that are most valued if you want to get an S. These are the numbers with greatest significance and the game doesn't really consider kill streaks, damage dealt, how much you actually did or how badly your team is going outside of kill participation. You tend to get a bit of an advantage in games with a dc on your team as compensation. But it's not random, it's graded by these standards against the rest of the games where people played your champion in your role.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T08:51:43.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also ksing compared to earned kills in the kda part doesn't seem to matter, since damage to enemy champions isn't really relevant to calculating your grade.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-02T05:29:09.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes its completely random","replies":[]}]}
