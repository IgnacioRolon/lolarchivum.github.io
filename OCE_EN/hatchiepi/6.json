And believe me, it can get *really* confusing at times, especially if you're not using a mainstream OS or if you're more than one version behind (which will most definitely regularly happen to some players). How would you be able to anticipate all the files that a person may have missing from their installation from not patching for a while?","replies":[{"poster":"HATCHIEPI","date":"2015-06-11T06:24:37.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good point xD\nthanks for the information","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-06-10T22:25:10.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish it was that simple.

When the download speed goes to 0kbps, the files are usually installing themselves (e.g. at 32mb left). Just leave it for a while and then it will usually finish downloading and updating. You can tell it's doing this by the percentage increasing from time to time. It's rather common, just give it a little time. The worst thing you could do is close the window.\n2. This is most likely of you closing the patcher when Issue 1 comes up. The patcher has more files to scan that you've previously downloaded. so to avoid this, don't close the window when patching. The best thing to do to fix this issue (and prevent lots of files being scanned) is to uninstall and reinstall LoL on your computer.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-15T13:32:15.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1.

The patcher has a clear phase where it says \"Applying patches...\" If there was any point in which a file has to 'install' itself, then it should be done while this message is displayed, lest confused users close the patcher because they think it's become unresponsive. The least that should be done is to activate this message if a file download ever stops because of this reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ahmed basheer","date":"2015-06-10T20:20:47.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i think he is right,isn't he?","replies":[]}]}
