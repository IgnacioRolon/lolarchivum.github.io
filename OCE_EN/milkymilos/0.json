The game&#039;s more fun with skype/teamspeak/curse &amp; a team full of like-minded players.\r\nI play mostly botlane, either support (preferred) or adc. I can play mid and top when needed but not really all that comfortable in the jungle. I love the odd ARAM to keep things interesting. I ranked Silver on NA, havent played ranked on Oceania yet and I&#039;m not sure if I will or not.\r\nI&#039;m online most weeknights 6pm onwards (NZ time).\r\nSo yeah. Add me. Or don&#039;t! {{champion:267}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tirolei","date":"2015-09-07T01:41:27.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added you too if you're looking for casual people, my schedule is kinda here and there but i'm up for some norms with fun people when I'm around","replies":[]},{"poster":"ColdBlood","date":"2015-09-05T12:33:58.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im keen to play norms","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cardew","date":"2015-09-02T11:34:04.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added you, my friends have stopped playing as much and having a premade with chat is better than solo queue. Used to play top lane but moved away from it, just got bored of it.
