It's graded on a bell curve, with that curve representing all scores on that champ in that position. \n\nSo for example, the top score in the region for Rek'sai Bot might be 5/5/5 with 100CS and a 15 vision score. Because it's the best score in the region for Rek Bot it will by default be an S+ (S ranks account for about the top 2% of scores) despite not being all that great of a score.\n\nMeanwhile the top score for Rengar Jng might be 25/0/15 with 200CS and a 40 vision score. Since only the top 2% of scores will get the S rank, a perfectly respectable 15/0/5 might still fall into an A rank.\n\n(All example numbers, none of the specifics are actually published to stop people mastery farming)\n\nCS also plays a big part in grading. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it's something like 13 farm to a kill. CS is a huge factor in games, and that is reflected in grading. You could be 30/0, but if you have 10CS as an ADC, your grade isn't going to look so hot. If you're looking for S ranks, you need to be aiming for that 10CS per minute (naturally that excludes support).\n\nVision score, while not as large a factor, does also play a role. If you've used your yellow trinket twice in a whole game, you're putting yourself at an unnecessary disadvantage, not just for grading but also in the winning department.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not Free","date":"2019-04-19T05:20:48.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You!","replies":[]}]}
