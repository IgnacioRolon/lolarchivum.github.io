I played a game and dced and thought alright I&#039;ll leave it for a few hours and hope it stops. Low and behold, it happens again. Out of rage I stop playing for a few days then come back, and manage to play a game without dcing. This is when I think maybe my internet is back to normal. Oh no, I was wrong. I dced again and again until I got this awesome new 20 minute wait que. I stopped playing for literally a good month due to that really cool feature. I decided enough was enough and pushed through the cancerous 5 game 20 minute wait. So just today I was playing with my two mates and whats that? I can&#039;t see the load screen. Ok I&#039;ll restart the pc. I go to log in and reconnect but wait I can&#039;t. After 2 minutes of trying I get back in right as the minions spawn. Walk into lane poke my enemy down to half health and go in for the first blood, too easy. &quot;why can&#039;t I move?&quot;. I now have dced yet again. So in a massive rage I try and join back as fast as possible and dc again. After maybe 4 attempts I give up and play another game. \r\n\r\nAfter getting home from work I felt like playing a game or two of league. I see the message about low priority que. &quot;F##k&quot;. SO YET AGAIN I have to wait 20 minutes for 5 games due to telstra being sh#t. I would be extremely happy if this que could be removed or at least my timer set to maybe 5 minutes?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T10:56:42.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Under no circumstances will we remove any low priority queues from your account.\n\nNot a direct quote but that's how I remember it.
