Hope it's helpful for you. For me it helped a lot since I removed the chat, atleast.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfY8VInkk4","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CwfY8VInkk4/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"tl;dr This is a link on how to remove chat from League, found it helped with me focusing. Wall of text below is a rant about broken system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI know this will not do much, but I feel like I need to say something as I am really over this system that is currently being used to punish people. \r\n\r\nSee, Riot acts like toxicity is the primary reason for teams breaking down in League.. what they seem to completely ignore is the symptom of said toxicity. \r\n\r\nI am not going to get into a drawn out debate about this, I have my stance, and many will disagree. I am fine with this.\r\n\r\nI just want to highlight that the majority of people now being deemed &quot;toxic&quot; and punished wouldn&#039;t act that way if they were not locked into a 20-40 minute game with one or two individuals that are not here to play with a team, and not here to climb, but are just on for &quot;Shits &amp; Giggles&quot; or they don&#039;t get what they want, so they troll.\r\n\r\nGoing after one facet of this broken game is hardly a solution, solely punishing the people that are easy to catch is something i expect from the NZ Police department, not from a game with such a massive and what used to be a relatively happy player-base. Saying you are fixing the problem by going after people who react badly to trolls or people who are not willing to co-operate is a pretty shoddy move.\r\n\r\nI really hope there is something done to actually solve the root cause, because what is currently in place hardly helps.\r\n\r\nP.S. I followed this guide and sometimes get reported for Offensive Language straight after... people are learning that reporting with that category most likely employs a level of automatic punishment. I am not the only one who has experienced this either.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-01-02T09:22:26.684+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not reading anyones walls of text here but I have to say one issue with chat system is the fact that if you get reported for no reason (aka you didn't actually say anything against anyone) for example if you say \"god fucking damn it I died\" and get reported you can get punishment because the system just autoscans for cuss words. Some people might argue that \"you shouldn't swear at all even if its towards yourself\" I'd argue those people who are offended need to grow up if you get offended by swearing (that isn't even towards anyone) on the internet you shouldn't be playing this game.\n\nOne example is I remember an Akali player got banned for spamming \"this fucking shitty Akali\" \"Holy shit you are bad Akali\" and stuff like that about herself, I think she got unbanned after having to prove it was towards herself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-02T02:26:23.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"> P.S.

Shaclone's guide?\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter because the current system automatic we have in place, is actually very good at picking up on chat toxicity. If you think you were unfairly banned, send Riot a request for the chat logs that got you banned [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). The system **NEVER** bans because someone reported you, it needs evidence before anything happens. \n\nWhat you may have experienced was a warning card or behaviour alert like [this](http://forums.euw.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=138751&d=1377184393) one. This will not get you banned, but they are issued if you're reported enough times, even if there's no evidence.\n\nJust to be clear though, you can never be punished without evidence.","replies":[{"poster":"Omegalucky","date":"2016-01-02T02:40:35.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not entirely sure I believe that the system is not automated to some degree, and if not then the standards that qualify you  for punishment have really degraded.\n\nI had never said I was banned, I was chat restricted. \n\nThis is less about the consequences I have experienced myself, and more about how I saw why I had became so angry at a game i never used to be angry in.\n\nThings like changing the way we match-make will have an immense effect on player's happiness, and will most likely result in a sharp decrease of anger and bitterness, what Riot so eagerly calls \"Toxicity\". \n\nCoining a term for a bunch of angry people and punishing them only gives people the impression that that is the only problem with league.. and its SOOO not.\n\nI guess I just hope they will stop this way of punishment or at least augment it with something meaningful for the people who ruin the game in other ways.\n\nMANY people know they can get away will trolling or performing actions that are in-game and not contained in a chat log, like ability abuse and frequently cause people to get angry and curse, which results in the person reacting to the cause being punished and not the root, that is not how a problem should be solved, nor will it work effectively in my opinion.\n\nBear with me here.. hypothetically having something like the ability to call in rep (with a system similar to the surrender vote system) and have them see the person actively ruining a game poses  a very real consequence to playing up in game, which I think would keep people in like and prevent the harsh text reactions.\n\nThink about it... the current method is only putting out the fire after its done damage, PREVENTION should be the priority over REACTION.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-02T03:22:46.835+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"One thing you are correct on, we do a need a better system to pick up on in-game toxic behavior. Our chat system is almost flawless though.\n\nI've seen your argument many times; _I was aggravated by his behavior and was only responding, he was toxic first._\n\n+ That's not how this works, if you're being harassed through chat, mute them as soon as this becomes apparent, and report them after the game. \n\n+ If you're encountering, trolls or feeders that are creating a negative experience through their gameplay, report them after the game, or better still, send a support ticket with video evidence. \n\n Just because you're the victim, doesn't mean you have the right to break any of the rules. If you get into a toxic argument with a troll, you will be reported as well. \n\n _You don't get to steal someones car because they stole yours. _\n\nPeople have to learn to control themselves and sort their issues out properly through the tribunal, but they end up taking matters into their own hands and become a troll themselves.\n\n> Think about it... the current method is only putting out the fire after its done damage, PREVENTION should be the priority over REACTION.\n\nI'm sorry to inform you, but Riot Games does not have a time machine. Which means this is impossible. \n\nNot even the NSA could stop Edward Snowden from giving away classified information, so what makes you think Riot can stop the next toxic kid in chat from insulting you?\n\nWe do have forms of prevention anyway:\n\n1. **Censored chat.** The default chat setting will censor most offensive words. You can turn this back on by clicking on the gear when you're logged into the client.\n\n2. **Chat restriction.** Prevents toxic players from harassing as much, and attempts to reform them.\n3. **/ALL chat disabled.** This is now disabled by default as it's really only used for BMing, you can turn it of in the in-game settings.\n\nIf you're having trouble controlling yourself, I suggest following Shaclone's advice. Otherwise, please make sure not to feed the trolls and just report them after game.","replies":[{"poster":"Omegalucky","date":"2016-01-02T04:35:53.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I'm sorry to inform you, but Riot Games does not have a time machine. Which means this is impossible. \n\nVery funny. Not about undoing the effect, but preventing it happening in the first place. The threat of real action against players who are acting up in game would be prevention, your sarcasm is not appreciated.\n\nThe three forms of prevention stated do not remove the user's ability to communicate with a team mate who is trolling or is the cause of an issue. When I get angry, I flare up and quickly write an aggressive comment at someone in chat when they flash to ks, or rotate mid to take my cs. There ISN'T any repercussions for that person doing that, all they need to  do is stay silent or act innocent and they get away with it, and they know it.\n\nDo you know why people get angry? It is generally when they feel they have been done an injustice and the anger is a reaction to that. I do believe people have to filter what they say to the best of their abilities, but I refuse to subscribe to the theory that getting angry due to someone wanting to get you angry or doing things not conducive to a team playing game is toxic.\n\n> Just because you're the victim, doesn't mean you have the right to break any of the rules. If you get into a toxic argument with a troll, you will be reported as well.\n\nClearly.. That's why we are here now. Yet the root cause is being actively ignored/not addressed (which is effectively the same thing).\n\nThis is a massive chunk of the issue, the stated reaction is the ONLY thing measurable by Riot therefore seems to the be only thing being tended to! Congratulations... you are able to get one of the types of abuse, yet ignore all the other types. I do not have video software capable of recording League, and why should I go and have to manually add said tools? You act like its my job to go and retrieve the evidence for you, yet the game is Riot's creation, they should be able to have the tools necessary to circumvent players that are toxic both over chat AND in game, why is one the exception? \n\nWhat you are saying is, I have to mute them? So I need to \"mute\" the players who troll pick in lobby? How does this help when Riot does not seem to record lobby conversations, where they have stated they will troll as they didn't get the lane they wanted. Or when support gets annoyed with the ADC's abuse and leaves to mid and takes their CS, is that as readily available to these 'people' that apparently review the logs?\n\nPlease.. spare me the attempt at trying to say you guys have a good system for Trolls. You don't. You never really have. LeaverBuster has been the closest thing to catching people not doing what they should be in game, and that is easy to circumvent.. all they need to do is walk around the map not helping. I wouldn't be surprised if that feature mainly caught out people with connectivity issues.\n\nI don't know what I expect to get from replying to you, you probably have a series of documents or a script given to you that you follow. You are not responding in a fashion that makes this productive, you are merely spouting known and ineffective methods that have been around for quite some time and clearly do not meaningfully help the issues described.\n\n>People have to learn to control themselves and sort their issues out properly through the tribunal, but they end up taking matters into their own hands and become a troll themselves.\n\nI didn't notice this... this is a dangerous form of thinking, don't you think?  \n\nIn essence.. \"People have to deal with it and wait for it to be reviewed by an ineffective system which will not assist them in any meaningful way, they will encounter this again, and most likely very soon, if they react in the way we can easily measure, we will treat them worse than the people who began to ruin the game the game itself\"\n\nI may also need to create a script to grab the input of my Enter key while League is loaded.. I just don't trust people who think like this, how can you actually think that? You are highlighting one section of the problem and rabidly attacking that section, then reporting it to the players in some skewed statistic in the loading screen. Yet for the actual trolls that CAUSE the issues I need to setup my own tools and catch them in the act WHILE IM PLAYING, then send it to support? \n\nWow. Just wow.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-02T06:30:30.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> I do not have video software capable of recording League, and why should I go and have to manually add said tools?\n\nEveryone has access to their own online recording software [here](http://www.replay.gg/). If you still feel that you don't like this method, then rely on a normal report. The automatic system for game-play might not be as effective as it should be, but it still works in the long run.\n\n> I flare up and quickly write an aggressive comment at someone in chat when they flash to ks, or rotate mid to take my cs.\n\nOk, this isn't even reportable, you're clearly over-reacting. This is on the scale of flaming because some one didn't pass you the ball. \n\nOn the bright side, since this is such a small insignificant offence, feel free to get them back later in that game, chances of being reported are 0.\n\n> How does this help when Riot does not seem to record lobby conversations, where they have stated they will troll as they didn't get the lane they wanted.\n\nActually, they do record pre- and post- game lobbies.

They just don't use them in reform cards, you can still get banned for toxicity there though.\n\n> the game is Riot's creation, they should be able to have the tools necessary to circumvent players that are toxic both over chat AND in game, why is one the exception?\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and say the in-game system is as good as the chat system, it's not, but it does still work. \n\nRiot is working on a solution to this but it's going to take some time. The biggest issue they face is; _how do you know someone is feeding and not just having a very very bad game?_\n\nMy worst KDA ever was support ** {{champion:40}} Janna 0/17/4** I think. \n_How does Riot know I wasn't trolling?_ \nIf you find a solution to this, please tell us on the boards, I'd be very interested to hear it.\n\n> People have to learn to control themselves and sort their issues out properly through the tribunal, but they end up taking matters into their own hands and become a troll themselves.\n\n> _I didn't notice this... this is a dangerous form of thinking, don't you think?_\n\nAre you suggesting we **do** take matters into our own hands? Not trying to get all political here, but that's called anarchy, and it's the worst political philosophy since communist dictatorships.\n\nEven if you weren't banned for toxic behavior, and you flamed at trolls. It doesn't fix anything, the troll will continue to troll in the next game, and you'll flame at him again. Just report and ignore, it will work in the long run even for game-play offences.","replies":[{"poster":"Omegalucky","date":"2016-01-02T14:52:06.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A few of your points I can certainly agree with, however I find your overall stance on this very disappointing as disheartening, I hope no-one at Riot NA (The one that actually causes major changes) shares these points. I can understand sticking up for the system as it is Riot's, but supporting it in its current form Riot needs to employ people with psychology degrees to reduce toxicity (in my opinion, a resultant of a poorly regulated matchmaking system) instead of actually looking at solving a root cause of why people would want to just give up and troll.\n\nI DO NOT condone people who troll because they get what they want, but they now more or less feel like a force of nature in this game, which is inherently a very bad thing. I do believe that reforms of the system are necessary, more specifically how trolls of a non talking nature are detected and addressed, and not just allowed to continue being toxic in a way that will not warrant punishment, compared  to the system where people reacting truthfully to trolls and getting smited for it whilst said trolls get little to no repercussions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-02T20:58:12.878+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> Riot needs to employ people with psychology degrees to reduce toxicity\n\nThey already do, Riot doesn't hire nobodies for this stuff.

It's not just league where small scale trolls get their way. The most dangerous form of bullying in schools ATM is the passive-aggressive kind, where bullies will wind people up until they get a reaction with small things, like stealing pens, ruining work, making fun of them and, knocking their stuff over \"accidentally\".\n\nThis has been a problem since the beginning of the human race, and we've been trying to fix it in schools since 1980's.

While passive aggressive are hard to detect and probably never going to be able to be detected well, I was referring to the clear trolling that occurs when someone does not get their way in lobby and says they will feed. I remember a number of months ago me and both teams reporting the guy who trolled when he didn't get jungle (even said it in chat too!) and I saw him again a few days later, with him triumphantly saying to me that hell never get banned and will do it again if he didn't get his lane. And the worst thing was that he got it and was rewarded for his bad behavior too, which probably justifies it in his head. This is the kind of issue I have been trying to highlight, not the Riven jungle that doesn't share blue with a mana dependent champion even though she doesn't need it, just wants to play a power game, or someone using ability abuse, or abuse of their role. I am fully aware that people acting like that are not going to be caught.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-03T04:14:12.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I stated that in its current state, Riot has to employ people with those types of qualifications DUE to issues with the system of matchmaking they currently have.

A large amount of effort is being put into finding out **why players with a good standing report history will flame out some games to extreme levels.**\n\nA lot of their research does find, that these players are set off by feeders or people stealing lanes, and they want to try and prevent both, the victim flaming and the feeder/troll.\n\nThis isn't solved overnight.
