You build her AD for DPS or AP for Burst damage with her Ult. Going AD also helps you with your jungle clear more.\n\nAfter the nerf the build was Lizard Elder - Phage - 1 or 2 tank items - finish triforce.\nHaven't seen many people play her in the new jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2014-12-28T01:31:58.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3715}} if ur looking to be an assassin or {{item:3706}} for a more tanky build usually {{item:3153}} {{item:3078}} also make sure to rush {{item:3047}} after finishing your jungle item, try to gank as much as possible after your first clear because you really need a early kill/ assists to become useful, also get the warrior enchantment always{{item:3714}} {{item:3707}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-27T09:09:51.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"triforce tank. same as almost always. any jungle item works (the smites) but slowing is possibly the better option.\n\nstart gromp into blue into wolves-smiteless/raptors-with smite. if decently healthy try for a gank after raptors. otherwise head back and get your jungle item and a pink if you can. then its clearing time! red krugs wraith(smite if possible) potential gank time or gromp then wolves. go back and forth in this manner until you have your jungle item gold OR if you see a gank opportunity. a smart jungler will pink the riven brush at about 5-9 minutes and bot lane might pink their brush (tri or river) depending on how smart they are vs an eve. but i would suggest lane ganks on bot lane, trying to get to the 2nd brush undetected. red trinket after 1st or 2nd back would be advised. camp mid over top lane, as eve is DPS and not great vs bruisers. but if you see free kills top lane, they almost 100% dont ward their lane brushes, so free lane ganks there. also, if coming from behind tri brush as a blue side team, try not to get spotted by the turret...\n\nbuild path is pretty standard. jungle item of choice into phage into whats needed. sheen when possible. and finish triforce as soon as VIABLE. that doesnt mean rush TF if your team is 0-20....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-27T10:25:40.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"pretty sure eve is trash now","replies":[]}]}
