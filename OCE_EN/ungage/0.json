Lost LP for nothing.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently, I was queuing for a ranked game and when the match was found, I clicked ' Accept ' and it was on the loading screen for at least 5 minutes. and then it went blank for the next 5 minutes. Later on I was back to the main page and I was penalized for 'not selecting a champion'. How can I possibly select a champion with a blank page staring at me? Please do something about this. I lost LP in the process which was not my fault at all.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T07:44:07.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Riot can't foresee all technical issues that one could have which would reasonably prevent them from selecting a champion while also not giving trolls/toxic players a tool to exploit.\n\nThis is something you should solve before entering ranked. Fair enough that you didn't know it would happen and that you were punished for something you didn't do, but I guess that's the risk you take whenever you click that \"Match me with players\" button.\n\nAre you still getting this issue?","replies":[]}]}
