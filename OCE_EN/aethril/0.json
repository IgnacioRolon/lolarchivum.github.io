She looks worse than the default Sona. ðŸ˜‘\r\nI think Riot should at least change the colour of the spells if they don&#039;t want to compliment sounds to the skin ðŸ˜§\r\n\r\nThe skin has so much potential. It&#039;s such a good idea but they haven&#039;t done it justice. It&#039;s just plain horrible.

Skin prices maintain their release value as to keep their original purchases value. As another user posted Gentlemen Cho'gath also has a similar issue. In addition to this Riot finds RP refunds messy for some reason. \n\nThe video you provided was a texture update last year and was never meant to alter anything but the 5 year old textures so they matched the new updated summoners rift. Her Etwahl has always had mismatched sounds on most of her skins.\n\nDon't expect Riot to reduce the price or update the skin until they do a champion Visual Update. While you wait for that to happen why not listen to some  [Smite And Ignite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUiOylPbfV0&list=PLbAFXJC0J5Gb9hzEYU5buZd4udIuIUheP) in the background.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-12-26T03:22:08.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gentleman Cho'Gath.
