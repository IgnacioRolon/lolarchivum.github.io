The champion would be a primary: mage and secondary: fighter/marksman. This ranged champion would have two personalities (playing choices): Fire and Ice. \r\n\r\nThe &quot;Passive&quot; is something on which I can&#039;t decide so please shape it to your heart&#039;s content.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Q&quot; would send out a fireball/snowball which deals x magic damage and has an additional effect. It would cost around 60 mana and have around a 7 second cooldown (when fully upgraded).\r\n**_Fire Mode:_** Explode for a small area and burn everyone hit\r\n**_Ice Mode: _** Hit and stun on target for x seconds\r\n\r\nThe &quot;W&quot; would switch between fire mode or ice mode and apply a passive for basic attacks and spells according to the mode. This attack would cost no mana but would have (when fully upgraded) around a 2 second cooldown.\r\n**_Fire mode:_** Deal x magic damage over x  seconds. \r\n**_Ice Mode:_** Slow for x% over x seconds\r\n\r\n\r\nThe &quot;E&quot; would be an area of effect where a meteor/frozen rock falls out of the sky and deals x magic damage to multiple enemies and applies an additional effect depending on the mode. It would be a relatively small circle.\r\n**_Fire Mode:_** Burns all the targets hit\r\n**_Ice Mode:_** Slows all the targets hit\r\n\r\nThe &quot;R&quot; would be a buff which allows you to apply both fire and ice effects on basic attacks and also spells and would last for x. \r\n\r\nThe character should be reliant on his W and I think this is altogether a pretty cool idea. Please change it to fit as you like so he won&#039;t be underpowered nor broken. If you could, please notify me if you apply any of the features I have thought because I would love to buy a champion with such features. And it would also be great if you could give me credit in some way if you implement this.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long post, here&#039;s a potato: O","replies":[{"poster":"HellDown","date":"2016-06-25T04:47:42.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just like jayce","replies":[]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-06-23T00:54:39.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while reading this I had a thought about giving this champ for example like 2 default skins, one in which is the fire and the other is based off the ice version. and give the each skin their corresponding abilities.

Obviously needs some fleshing out but it is a really good idea, it is refreshingly unique (sort of). Would like Riot to pick it up and see what they can do with it","replies":[]}]}
