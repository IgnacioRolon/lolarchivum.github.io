The champion would be a primary: mage and secondary: fighter/marksman. This ranged champion would have two personalities (playing choices): Fire and Ice. \n\nThe &quot;Passive&quot; is something on which I can't decide so please shape it to your heart's content.\n\nThe &quot;Q&quot; would send out a fireball/snowball which deals x magic damage and has an additional effect. It would cost around 60 mana and have around a 7 second cooldown (when fully upgraded).\n**_Fire Mode:_** Explode for a small area and burn everyone hit\n**_Ice Mode: _** Hit and stun on target for x seconds\n\nThe &quot;W&quot; would switch between fire mode or ice mode and apply a passive for basic attacks and spells according to the mode. This attack would cost no mana but would have (when fully upgraded) around a 2 second cooldown.\n**_Fire mode:_** Deal x magic damage over x  seconds. \n**_Ice Mode:_** Slow for x% over x seconds\n\n\nThe &quot;E&quot; would be an area of effect where a meteor/frozen rock falls out of the sky and deals x magic damage to multiple enemies and applies an additional effect depending on the mode. It would be a relatively small circle.\n**_Fire Mode:_** Burns all the targets hit\n**_Ice Mode:_** Slows all the targets hit\n\nThe &quot;R&quot; would be a buff which allows you to apply both fire and ice effects on basic attacks and also spells and would last for x. \n\nThe character should be reliant on his W and I think this is altogether a pretty cool idea. Please change it to fit as you like so he won&#039;t be underpowered nor broken. If you could, please notify me if you apply any of the features I have thought because I would love to buy a champion with such features. And it would also be great if you could give me credit in some way if you implement this.\n\nSorry for the long post, here&#039;s a potato: O","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-22T11:07:23.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations (:","replies":[{"poster":"GalW101","date":"2016-06-22T21:40:28.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[]}]}]}
