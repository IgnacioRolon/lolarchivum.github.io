I'd recommend just keeping an eye on the emote tab in your collection and see if they appear. If they still haven't appeared tomorrow, it might be a good idea to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (you'd probably want the \"I am having technical issues.\" option, or the \"Pool Party issue - Map accents, missions, rewards, etc.\" if it's a Pool Party event issue).","replies":[{"poster":"Triplea657","date":"2018-08-06T22:13:07.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks.
