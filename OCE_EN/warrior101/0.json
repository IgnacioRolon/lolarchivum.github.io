Note, I only have 400rp and probably will only get more rp once a year. I mean should I get a champion 3150ip on sale.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-15T11:01:37.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IP boosts are only worth if you are going for runes. Per win boosts will get you roughly 100-200 extra IP per win. So not really worth unless you want runes.\n\nIf you're only buying RP once a year, you should do so in a couple weeks when you get double the bonus RP.\n\nI'm assuming you are a newer player and I understand the temptation to try want to spend RP on new champions. But I will suggest if you do so, try looking into bundles or waiting for a champ to be discounted. Bundles are usually pretty worth if you like 80% of the things in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-15T00:27:52.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you desperately want IP for runes, just save it for getting a champion or skin, you will get alot more value out of it that way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-14T23:20:37.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well each win with the IP boost is about a bonus 200-300 IP/(how many games you bought)\n\nI think that's what it is anyway","replies":[]}]}
