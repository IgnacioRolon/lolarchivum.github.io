They will all give you some better ganking since you can last longer and have better utility, but less damage straight up. Given the better utility, they can hold an enemy in lane longer and therefore be better at ganking.\n\nReally, unless you can hit hard enough to kill someone before they run away, I would look at these in this order on how easy they are:\nVoli - Flip/throw\nNasus - Slow\nJax - Stun\nOlaf - Slow (can pick up his axe to lower his CD)\nSkarner - Stun\nUdyr - Stun","replies":[{"poster":"Warrior101","date":"2015-11-14T03:10:43.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about j4.
