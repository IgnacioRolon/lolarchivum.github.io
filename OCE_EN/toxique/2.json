I thought it only happened then but yesterday when i tried using Yasuo again, this time normal, the results were exactly the same! Um is it just me or does it happen to others? I'm not really angry but it did leave me saying \"ummmmm... YasuWOT?\"\r\nIs there any solutions or is it a game bug that can be fixed by riot?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-04T11:14:49.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a known bug, choosing Yasuo will crash your game as it begins, on some particular setups.\n\nA quick fix is to force close League when it crashes and then to just reconnect. Seems to work fine, and gets you in game before a minute's up, if you have decent loading times.","replies":[]}]}
