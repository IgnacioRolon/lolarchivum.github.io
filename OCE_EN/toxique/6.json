There's no system in the client that allows you to view your own ribbons, but you can view the amount of honours you have accumulated over your account lifetime. Not really useful information but at least it's something.\n\nAlso, use the \"Reply\" feature to reply to me, otherwise I won't get notification of it. As you can see, your reply appears *above* my comment.\n\nBut then again, you could have different settings. Or not.\n\nMan I hate the boards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-04T07:58:06.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the most prominent ribbon you own displays, unless you are fulfilling the requirements for all three ribbons at once; you then get the yellow ribbon.\n\nBy that logic, you should have the yellow ribbon right now. In all senses, yes, but what may have happened is that you lost one of those ribbons during the time you already had another ribbon and thus, you aren't fulfilling the requirements for all three ribbons at once.\n\nIt's quite satisfying to have a yellow ribbon, but so hard to maintain and keep for a reasonable amount of time. I wish you best luck in getting the yellow one, if that's what you're after.","replies":[]}]}
