I seriously don&#039;t get this priority queue system, and this is not my first time this has happened.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T08:52:34.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">doesn't it matter if you comeback or not you still get it\n\nTrue. Though, it's a bit weird.\n\nYou see, the way Leaverbuster works is that whenever it detects you as \"left game\", then it adds a 'leaver marker' on your account. Once certain conditions are met, this counter is added; there are no ways to remove counters. If the server detects no input from you for five minutes in a row, then it considers you \"left\". It's very strict and I think it should be reviewed, but that's how it works.\n\nNow, the way low priority queues are distributed are different. At the end of every game your account is checked. If you have multiple leaver counters on your account that you've accumulated before the cooldown of the other counters have expired (the math for that is even more complicated, so I won't explain here) then the system will administer you a low priority queue penalty. So, in essence, you should not be punished if you just had a random disconnection because of your internet. It punished you because you've left games before. If those were also because of internet disconnection, well you should really just make sure your internet is fully functional before playing another game.\n\nThe more times in the past that you get punished, the more likely the next punishment will be more severe. Would you like to try and troubleshoot your connection?","replies":[]}]}
