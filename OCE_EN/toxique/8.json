As such, I’d like to direct you to the [General Discussion Boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion) and the [Miscellaneous Boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) for posting your League of Legends related suggestions. You’ll find there are a lot more community members in those two sub-boards for bouncing your ideas around and gathering support! \n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
