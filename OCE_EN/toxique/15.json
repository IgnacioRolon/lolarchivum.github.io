They are not in any way obliged to give it you.\n2. For under 50 RP USUALLY they will give it to you if you submit to them something like a poem or a drawing or the like (something you created that's league related basically)\n3. This is a one time deal. Once you get the RP once, you'll never get it again, regardless if it's 49 or 1 RP.\n\nSo there you go! That's the best way to go about it, just don't expect it to be guaranteed, because it really isn't and you'll have to put in a bit of work to get them something you've made :) Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
