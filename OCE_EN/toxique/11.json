Yes like a normal human i get shiz games which frustrates me causing me to do all kinds of things. But Riot as you might already know i have spent a heck a lot of money on that account and i really do not want to lose the money so instead of a perma ban can you give me something like a perma speech restriction or anything else but a perma ban? Pretty please Riot i promise i won&#039;t be a dickhead anymore and if i am to do it again then you can perma ban me and no one can deny it. But just this one please Riot Games I have spent a lot of money for skins and that and i really don&#039;t want to lose it. Or can you transfer the skins and champs if i were to make another account? And same thing for the new account i might make, if i do ANYTHING which harasses anyone you can then BAM perma ban me forever but Riot just this once i beg you i really do not want the money to go to a waste.\r\n\r\nThank you,","replies":[{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-03T00:15:02.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they made an exception for you, they would have to make it for everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-02T23:41:26.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bye ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-06-02T05:22:56.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol rip its gone for good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-02T05:19:08.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You broke the rules, these are the consequences.\n\nDeal with it.","replies":[]}]}
