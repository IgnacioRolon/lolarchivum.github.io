{"poster":"Toxique","date":"2016-06-03T13:02:00.788+0000","title":"Dear Riot Games","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Riot Games,\r\n\r\nI have recently received a perma ban and I fully understand why and I would like to sincerely apologize for being a salty, toxic jerk. I know you guys tried to warn me about this with previous punishments and I am sorry for being an ignorant fool and ignoring your warnings and continuing to be toxic. But as you know, I have spent hundreds of dollars of my pocket money on this game and I really do not want to go to a waste. Everyday I saved my pocket money to buy a LoL card and I do not want all the time and effort and money to go to a waste.\r\nBut on a more serious reason, this game is very special to me. When I began playing this game, I instantly fell in love with it, and as I continued to play this game more and more I felt more and more passionate about this game (not a serious addict though!).  I would play all night, whenever I could, and follow up on every news and patch notes. Then I decided I want to be a pro gamer or a youtuber (hey, I&#039;m only 14 I still have time to get to challenger). That&#039;s how much I felt passionate for this game. Why you may ask, it&#039;s mainly because I don&#039;t live a very good life, I always get bullied at school and have family problems and due to this I suffer from depression, but when it comes to the saddest times, this game always keeps my spirits up, and just because of my foolish mistakes which again I would like to apologize for, I do not want to lose the only thing that is holding my sanity and keeping me happy. I also do not want this to crush my hopes and dreams. So please Riot Games, I am not asking for you to un-punish me, but I am begging you to change the punishment to a permanent restricted chat. \r\nI know I am toxic but this time I promise you, I have learnt my lesson which I should have learnt a long time ago and I would like to say sorry once again. The reason for this ban wasn&#039;t because of my gameplay (because I dislike trolls and trolling), I was banned for my toxic content, so instead of blocking me out, block out my freedom of speech because clearly it&#039;s my toxicity which always seem to ruin the games for others not my gameplay. So I once again beg you Riot Games, this is all I have, this is the only silver lining behind the dark clouds, so please change my punishment anything ELSE than a perma ban. I cannot live without this game.\r\nAnd if I was to be racist or toxic EVER again then you can BOOM! perma ban me for good and I won&#039;t be able to say anything because you have already given me my last chance. So just this once please Riot Games, I really beg of you, change my punishment. I am not asking for you to not punish me, I&#039;m only requesting for a different consequence. And if you have mercy on me and decide to give me my final shot I will buy Dark Star Thresh and do something special for you like write a poem or draw a cool splash art.\r\nOnce again, I am so sorry for being a useless salty jerk and sorry for ignoring the warnings but please I beg of you with all my might, change my punishment. LoL is all I have, and if this is taken away, how am I going to survive this world? So please Riot, I know it sounds dramatic and cringy, but from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry but please do not take me from this game.\r\n\r\nThank You, :D","replies":[]}
