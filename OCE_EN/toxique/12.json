This includes if you have a bad connection, because ultimately that still brings a worse experience for yourself and your team-mates. You are advised to sort out your connection issues before playing match-made games.\n\nIf Spark is as terrible an ISP as you describe, why continue using their services? If you're 100% that the fault is on their end, and that they won't agree to fix it, you should bring your business to another ISP.","replies":[]}]}
