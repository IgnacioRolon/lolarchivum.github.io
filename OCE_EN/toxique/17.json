When the loading finished as the game started the game just froze. First i thought it was a lag but i wasted 15 mins waiting for it and it didn't work. So i used CTRL+ALT+DELETE and restarted. And then i turned lol on again to play. And it seems like i was the only one who lagged out like that. I was way behind, while others were lvl 9, i was lvl 1. and so frustratingly i finished the game with barely no kills so everyone called me noob. Then when i clicked home it says that i am in the low priority queue and so i was like WTF IT WASN'T EVEN ME INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO QUIT WTF. Can Riot games please fix this because this is not the first time it has happened and i am quite p***ed off. So please fix this stupid bug in the next patch thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-28T00:46:00.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. This is a known bug. Read the bug report board.\n2. This is not the bug report board.\n3. That title is very undescriptive, even for the Help and Support board.\n\nThe issue can be resolved a lot quicker than what you described. The moment you get into game, click on the screen repeatedly until the error message comes up saying \"This program has stopped responding.\" You should be able to close it with that, and then rejoin using the League client. Should get you back in game before the first minute is up.","replies":[]}]}
