For all you know, that warning could have come from ten matches ago where you were toxic to your team, or something.\n\nAnd this kind of discussion doesn't really belong in the Help & Support boards. You can simply repost this in the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) boards, or, if you put in some time and think of a system/coding that could prevent this, post it in the [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations) board.","replies":[]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T01:02:17.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BaLlSyUnIcOrN101,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=AQZWbQMZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-10T08:09:26.333+0000)\n>\n> So I was playing a match today, and our opponents were all at mid so I thought they must be grouping in the start.

As Horse mentioned it could be from you playing for weeks of game, and those report accumulate over time. I received several of those warning even without being toxic. I got a green badge, so yeah, it does not make sense at all.\n\nJust ignore and keep playing mate :)","replies":[]}]}
