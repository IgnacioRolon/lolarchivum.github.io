Now I'm not saying 'TAKE PRIORITY QUEUES DOWN', because priority queue is actually a good idea to teach people, who leave and AFK, a lesson. BUT once you get priority queue, it is a waste of time waiting 5, 10, 20 minutes just to play a single match and it annoys me and a lot of other people too. So my idea on priority queue is that at the end of a match, if there is a summoner who left, there should be a vote on if the person should be punished. If a summoner has AFK but came back again, at the end of a match, there should be a vote on whether this summoner should be punished. Also for the AFK one, it should show at the end how long the summoner has AFK for. But if the summoner had to be put in a vote for more than 3 times, then the priority queue comes in.\r\n\r\nSo Riot, please take notice of this suggestion and if you can, put it into action.\r\n\r\nYours, BaLlSyUnIcOrN101","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-22T05:40:33.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">BUT once you get priority queue, it is a waste of time\n\nThat's the point. You waste other people's time, so your time is wasted. Pretty good cycle of punishment, I think.\n\nYour idea, though, is amazing. I think having people vote on whether or not, the people being the ones who just had the game with them, the person in question should be punished is millions of times better than having a computer decide. There could be cases of where the person genuinely disconnected and reconnected to the game later on due to technical difficulties, whereupon they would vote the person not to get punished, and that person will be able to fix their problem *without* also being punished for it!\n\nAnd it'll improve the swiftness of punishments for people who leave games on purpose too. This idea is brilliant.\n\nShame it won't be implemented.","replies":[]}]}
