I would also recommend that you use an email address *not* connected to your League of Legends account as you likely don't know how access was gained to your account, and it may have been through email.\n\nYour account will likely be permanently suspended during this process. This a security ban to prevent any further action on the account while ownership is verified, and will be removed once the account is secure with the original owner.\n\nAny suspensions applied while the account was under compromise will be revoked, and usually any content purchased/currency used/etc. will be reversed (there are some things they can't reverse like LP gains and such).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Find Me In UNSW","date":"2018-11-12T06:40:41.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because i have not played game from 8/11/2018, the last game is Draven, Sion and LeBlanc is not my game","replies":[]}]}
