Play most supports well, with Morgana, Thresh, Sona and Leona being some of my favs. Getting more Tahm time in atm for the meta. Also play a decent adc as well as a few jungle champs. Looking for chilled peeps, mature, who play regular. No ragers, kids etc. On every day, especially next 3 weeks.\n\nAdd: Coszack\n\nPeace","replies":[]}
