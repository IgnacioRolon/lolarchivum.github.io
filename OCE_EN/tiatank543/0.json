I just played a game and was not able to replicate the issue you are mentioning, and I can't seem to find reference to and issue like this in our system (though I could be wrong).\n\nAre you 100% sure the damage shown is not correct?\nCould you provide me with some screenshots/video so I can confirm and send it through to the relevant team.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T10:09:57.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Formatting op.\n\nThese are just a few of the many.

There's times where it's like \"You dealt 127 true damage TO YOURSELF :D\" and other times were Jarvan IV's passive (strangely named \"odin_passive\") was apparently a minion (\"spell not found\" is its description). The only time I use death recap is for when I need a giggle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Argonian","date":"2015-02-09T10:24:44.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed problems with the Death Recap aswell. For some odd reason when you are killed by one of Baron's attacks it's named \"baroncorruption\" and has the description \"Minion baroncorruption\"\nSurely Riot could have put effort in naming all his attacks, Lol.\n\nA Screenshot of what i stated above is seen in this screenshot: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357428164","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T08:36:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I have seen some errors,like you mentioned but (unless I'm misunderstanding), the error Tiatank543 is talking about shows the correct information EXCEPT the damage values are incorrectly calculated.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong, and if so Ill look further into what we are doing.","replies":[]}]}
