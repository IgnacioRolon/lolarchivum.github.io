Isn&#039;t over-played, isn&#039;t under-played, can still hold her lane while simultaneously having weaknesses to exploit.\nA 500 base damage and 75% ap scaling ULTIMATE ability does not need this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-23T04:53:50.017+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow....\n\nI...\n\nThere are no words for this....\n\nWho the hell is in charge of this patch?\n\nIs this an april fools?\nIm starting to think this is for april fools....\n\n___________\n\nThey're acting like Lux doesn't ALWAYS get the kill with her ult, it literally half-healths squishies even without her passive.\nLux is in a fairly good position already, she isn't a plague like Lee and Cait, and she isn't a \"if you play her properly, you win.\" champ like Vayne or Hecarim.\nShe's already strong, yes its true she cant make many 'cool' or 'interesting' plays because her kit is simple, but the trade off is: She isn't very difficult to play or master.\n\nNow, I'm no gameplay science professor from Cambridge, but it seems to me that making easy champs stronger.. is a bad idea.\n\nI know its not as profound as E=MC2 or anything, but my calculation is: \nEasy champs are easy to play _(pro)_, but they shouldn't affect the outcome of the game as strongly _(con)_, while difficult champs are very hard to play _(con)_, but if you master them, theres more options they have to help win, _(pro)_.\n\nIf both sets of champs (easy and hard) can affect the outcome equally. Why would anyone ever play difficult champions? There needs to be a reason for people to sit there for hours practicing Kalista or Anivia, otherwise they'll just sit there collecting dust while everyone plays Lux/Garen/Ezreal etc etc.\n\nI feel like that should be common sense? maybe not...\n\nand not just lux either, Kat with a 15 sec cooldown?\nShe's supposed to have a 15 sec cooldown AFTER getting a triple kill... not before...\nSure they're nerfing her early game potential, but it isn't her ult that makes her scary in lane. But it IS what makes her scary later on in the game.\n\nNot to mention Jinx and Alistar are pretty strong too.

Don't get me wrong I'm not always happy about the changes they make based on the pro scene, I still miss old Quinn. But at least it's a relatively stable point of reference. \n\nSome of the \"OP\" champs are considered op because people at lower elos don't know how to play against them. It would be nigh impossible to balance on the assumption that the players won't be able to use the champion to full efficiency or to exploit there weaknesses.

Trying to balance around the low elos, which the majority of the players are would cause utter havoc with the pro scene. \n\nAzir is a good example. Was considered pretty average in the lower teirs but if you knew what you were doing he was terrifying. After he became an almost 100% pick ban he was nerfed. But if you balance on the lower elos he never gets nerfed. Which would negatively effect the pro scene. \n\nMaybe the answer is to keep balancing on the pro scene. It pay more attention to the lower levels. I for one would welcome an in depth series that explores the op champs and shows lower elo players there weaknesses.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-24T06:02:30.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of the skill difference between all the different devisions, havoc will always be caused somewhere, no matter what you do. The point is:  \nIs it better to cause havoc in the pro-scene (less than 0.03% of all players)\nOr to have havoc in low elo (91.54% of all players.)?\n\nAzir is a good example of what should be done tbh.\nSome champs who are on the extreme ends of the skill level (Azir, Kalista, Garen, Yi etc.) will always be problems somewhere. Hard champs are too strong in high elo because they have so much potential, and are weak in low elo, because people don't have the mechanics for them. While easy champs are too weak in high elo because they can be outplayed too easily, but they are overbearing in low elo because they are piss easy to use, and shit over everyone who is actually trying.\n\nSo when you nerf the hard champs in high elo, they become unplayable in low elo, and when you nerf the easy champs in low elo, they become even less playable in high elo.\n\nThe problem is, that Riot doesn't want to make any champions 'unplayable' In any elo. So they try to balance the champions globally. Which means the hard champs end up being slightly too hard for low elo but have not quite enough power for pro-play. And the easy champions become way too strong for low elo, but not have enough playmaking potential for high elo.\n\nSo in the end, no one wins. _(except maybe mid plat players?)_\n\nAzir was a 'unwanted' solution in Riot's eyes. They tried to balance him globally, failed, then gave up, and through a whole season of Riot negligence, he became a monster. Then when everyone was fed up and complaining, and worlds was fast approaching, Riot had their backs to the wall and the only thing they could do was nerf him in pro-play and make him 'unplayable' in low elo.\n\nAnd tbh, thats what they should do for all extreme cases, Riot just needs to accept that Azir, Kalista, Sol etc etc. as they are today, will never be huge in low elo. So they shouldn't try, and they should just focus their efforts on making them less fucked-up in worlds, and let low elo have a few less champs.\nMeanwhile, they need to accept that Garen, Master Yi and Tryndamere etc. are just too simple for pro-play and are likely not going to be key players in worlds anyway. So they need to nerf them in low elo, and accept that they will make even less of an appearance in pro-play. \n\nPeople in low elo who absolutely love Azir and Sol etc _(myself)_ will still be able to play them, _(its just how much effort you put in)_. Im high-bronze/low-silver, and I have had 70+ winrates on both of them, despite them being 'unplayable' at the time, in low elo. \n\nMeanwhile in pro-play it doesn't mater who you play, because its just all about winning, so no one plays champs they like the look of, or the playstyle of, they just play the statistically strongest champs in that specific patch. So Garen and Yi etc wont be missed at all.\n\nAnd its not like _\"Oh you're letting the retards in bronze balance the game? thats stupid, they all have an IQ of 6, what do you expect them to do?\"_\nThere are people in bronze silver and gold, that know the game inside out, but just lack the mechanics/reflexes, or are not good under pressure, and so they don't climb well.\nIf you're in low elo, it doesn't _necessarily_ mean you're a complete retard and don't know shit about whats good for the game.\n\nThats my take on it anyway.\n\n_______\n\nI think your idea about a series that looks at the OP champs would be a great! It would have to be generalised a bit, so that changes from patch to patch didn't make some videos redundant, but I think it would be really helpful to all low elo players who really want to improve, but feel they are stuck against a wall of certain champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-24T21:29:46.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really disagree with anything you said there. Just want to point out that a lot of the op champions at low level are feast or famine. Everyone remembers the time that riven got fed and spent 20 minutes 1v5ing you. Not many people remember that time riven did poorly and was useless the entire game. You'd have to be extremely extremely careful with any potential nerfs based on there opness in low teirs. Other wise they will become useless at any tier like akali after her nerfs. \n\nI think you can't put it all on the balance team. Even in low elo if there's a champ that just keeps annihilating you, go learn why. I used to hate yasuo top and riven and think they were the most op bullshit ever but I went out and picked up a few champs I felt comfortable on and learned some of there weaknesses. \n\nWith a game as complex as league there's only going to be so much you can do a once wise. Especially when comparitivley little changes can make such huge differences. But I think they could do a better job of communication. Explaining why they aren't nerfing the champions that are op at low tier. \n\nYeah that's the idea. Just the little stuff that you don't really think about before someone points it out. Like waiting until zed uses his shadow before going in. Even explaining the little niches like rivens animation cancelling will help people understand why they can put out so much damage. Which in turn will make them easier to play against","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-24T22:24:31.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree there, a lot of them are feast or famine, Riven/Yi/Trynd/Draven etc.\nSome aren't, like Zed/Darius/Hecarim/Garen, who tend to still be fairly useful even when behind.\nBut most are like you say.\n\nAnd I totally agree with you there about some of the responsibility falling to you to go an learn the champs to find their weaknesses. Back when I was a filthy Yasuo main :P I just for the life of me couldn't play against Karthus, so I started played Karthus to learn how to kill him, and ended up liking him more than Yasuo xD\nAnd now I struggle with Karthus against good Yasuo's :p\n\nBut while a lot of it does come down to experience with champions, some champs just blatantly have less moments of weakness than others. Tryndamere for example is much harder to deal with than Aurelion Sol, even if you are familiar with him. Thats where the balance team needs to come in.\n\nYea, Thats something that has always bugged me a little, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought it.\nIts nice when they do buff/nerf champions and explain it. But it would be equally as nice to know why they aren't nerfing/buffing other champions. Like when Azir was so strong a couple of seasons ago, and when Yasuo was getting on everyones nerves last year, it was radio silence from Riot about them for a whole season, until the patch when they suddenly nerfed them.\nAdmittedly they are getting better though, explaining things in advance.\nGotta give credit where its due.\n\nYea if the videos explained the little things that you generally only know by playing that champion. \nFor example, in lane, most people are terrified of Azir, because he constantly pokes you with W/Q and it seems to have no counterplay, but in reality, when you actually play Azir, when you use Q, you are terrified yourself, because if they decide to jump on you while its down and your soldier is too far away, you're screwed. Your example about Riven is perfect, most people know she can animation cancel, but a lot don't really realise what it means or how she does it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-24T23:40:25.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":O you were a filthy yasuo main I feel betrayed. \n\nAt least you've been rehabilitated. On to better and brighter things :P. \n\nI think we're pretty much on the same page. I think the real problem with champions like trynd is you HAVE to have hard Cc to deal with them. If you don't your boned. Which comes down to team comp. Which ya bronzes aren't the best at. God forbid you get him in normals when you haven't taken any cc. \n\nYeah. Cause I know what animation cancelling is and I understand the theory of why it means for damage. But I personally can't do it and I don't see a ton of players who a good at it.  The difference between a riven who can animation cancel and one that can't is huge. Which makes judging trading pretty ducking hard sometimes. \n\nIn the end I think there doing a better job now than they have.

Maybe this is part of a plan to turn her into a late game Mage?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-23T05:16:01.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mozzie25,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6k8UX1Yk,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2017-03-22T23:41:12.771+0000)\n>\n> True it will make the Lux&#x27;s who actually hit there combo a lot more scary. \n\nHow do you miss a Lux combo?\n\nYou throw out your Q. if it lands, use your spells and AA's on them while they are immobile and cant do shit.\nIf your Q misses, wait a few seconds and try again.\n\nShe's not like champs like Taliyah or Vel'Koz where its all or nothing; You either land everything all at once and watch them evaporate, or you run like the wind in the opposite direction. \n\nLux has the leniency of only needing to waste 1 spell, instead of all of them, if she misses.\nTo me that seems like the trade off she has of being so squishy, sure she dies quickly if she misses, but she only needs to land 1 spell in order for a free kill set-up.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-23T06:28:08.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your telling me you've never seen a Lux wiff everything? \n\nI'm debating it's gonna make her strong.
