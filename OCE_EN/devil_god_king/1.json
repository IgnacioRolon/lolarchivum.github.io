My personal play style for support is very aggressive. In all honesty, when I have an pre made ADC that I have developed a play style and strategic plans with I tend to play supports that have heavy poke and damage output. To put it in simple terms. I'm the one making all the plays and dealing all the damage. So that my ADC can focus on csing at a god like level and all he has to do is last hit the enemy champion. That's why I main champs like Thresh, Karma and Zyra. \n\nI honestly think Support is the most dynamic role in the game and that's why I love it. \n\nSupports for the win. &lt; I'm sure Mirkinen will agree!\nRegards,\nlols =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-11-26T10:46:08.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> THE point to playing support is to relativisticly get your \"carry\"/lane partner gold/ more gold then what the other \"support\" is getting their lane partner.
