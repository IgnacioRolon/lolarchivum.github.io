What would be better is something like Zed's Death mark shuriken effect that tells you when the mark detonation damage will be fatal to help deal with multiple speared targets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-02-22T12:14:04.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically her rend does have a cap, at 256, so there isn't actually infinite tons of damage. I think an indicator showing when your rend has enough damage to kill a target would be super handy, like Cho'gaths indicator for his ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-22T12:32:30.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even without a cap on how many stacks can be applied by Rend it is still limited by attack speed. In fact, with an attack speed of 2.5, you can only get 10-11 stacks on any one enemy. You could say it is effectively capped at 11.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-23T06:52:23.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Baron says hi.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-22T06:13:32.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I would like it if Kalista's [E] had a counter on it telling you how many rend stacks are in the target\n\nEver tryed actually clicking on your target?","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-22T10:42:26.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=75XsToPl,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-22T06:13:32.316+0000)\n>\n> Ever tryed actually clicking on your target?\n\n^","replies":[]}]}]}
