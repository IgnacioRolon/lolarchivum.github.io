As this email came as a surprise to me.\nOnly playing two or three games yesterday.\nI sent a ticket to Riot Games telling them as much as I could and even suggesting that someone might have played my account via hack or something.\nAs nobody i know has access to my account except me, I have no reason to believe its anything else.\nSure enough I get the obligatory email saying that Riot Games is going to process my request, which is comforting.\nTo get an email saying what I have done is against League of legends ToS, when I havent done anything, as I am being WRONGLY ACCUSED of something i have no FREAKING KNOWLEDGE OF?!\nI could completely understand a warning/permaban if i was guilty, but a permaban for something i literally didnt do is a bit out of hand.\n\nI am confused to the point of anger, and rightfully so.\nIf any RIOT Team can help i dont understand how i can use third party content when i live by the idea of not cheating, as i have a sense of pride in my League of Legends account regardless of my crappy B5 rank.","replies":[{"poster":"OfficialHitman","date":"2016-08-14T11:52:02.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing is happening to me!
