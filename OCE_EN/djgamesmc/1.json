There is nothing i can do at this moment but i plan to fix it, I have purchased a a new cooler that \"should\" be cooling it a major amount but in fact isn't. Sometimes It overheats in league games and won't start for a while and sometimes i can be playing Call of duty: Advanced warfare and it would be below 60, but over 70 for league.

If so, I'd suggest changing that. The stock AMD coolers are absolute rubbish.\n\nIs your CPU or GPU overheating.. because league shouldn't be causing that either way.\nDefinitely need to look into a better cooling solution.\n\nAlso saying that any leaves in the next month or unintentional doesn't matter.

Is your computer clean as in not extremely dusty if it is use a compressed air from a can or a compressor would do even if it is a bit dusty just clean it anyways.. Just use short bursts at a time. If still having unsatisfactory temps take off the side panel and stick a fan blowing air into it which should decrease temps a fair bit. Dear god you should not be even hitting those temps especially League of Legends the recommended temp of an FX processor should be 62 Celsius. I have a AMD FX6300 @ 4.6 Ghz and during League it never got above 45 depending on the day. By the way I have a Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO fantastic cooler.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADC or Cry","date":"2014-12-07T11:40:50.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can control whether you play or not.....","replies":[]}]}
