Our team ended up losing this game yet it said loss prevented so i was happy. In fact the loss prevented game still counted as a loss and due to that loss i feel it has altered my real deserved rank for the season, i feel that i played at at-least a silver standard but yet it put me in bronze III with the loss prevented acting as a loss still. Can someone please explain this to me because i'm sure the meaning of \"Loss Prevented\" would refer to the loss not actually being a loss.\r\n\r\nPls Rito {{item:3070}} {{item:2050}}","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-23T09:42:10.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like an account issue, I would recommend contacting player support ASAP.\n\n-SumCoolAid","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:54:08.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other people have also been getting this.
