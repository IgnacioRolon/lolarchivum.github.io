I am kind of sick of playing her as a support so i tryed her in other lanes and she is good but i think she could go with a little bit of a buff. For example why not make it that she can trigger her own passive by using another spell while sunlight is on them (from another spell) or buffing her ap ratios like her q why not make it match up with her w and e (40%) or higher like 50%. These are just some examples on how to buff her so please think about it thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"TinyHobo","date":"2015-06-12T01:49:23.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like tanks to have more incentive for health items, or some good health items.

Their kits naturally lend to bonuses from building things like health, armour and magic resist (for Leona, is her W in this case), and they typically have some sort of engage to start fights (so her E and her R).\n\nA supports role is to help their team mates. They tend to have crowd control or healing effects (in Leo's case she has 3 forms of crowd control). This is used to again set up enemies for their team mates to finish off. They set up for kills, but get assists (unless their teammate is dead or close to dying). They again typically don't deal a lot of damage with their kit as a result.\n\nLeo does not need a buff, nor will she get one. You can currently build Leo as a top lane tank to incredible results if you build her right. Sure her passive is a bit lost when she's laning alone, but that's what you get for taking a champ whose role is TANK SUPPORT up to top lane.\n\nWhat you are heading towards is a tank mage like Cho'Gath. Mage's have high magic scales on their abilities and as a result can deal lots of damage if built for it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-06-06T01:11:02.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona is very balanced compared to the other supports.\n\n3 CC skills, short cd ult, strong defence, great engaging skill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xoxHoneyBadgerxx","date":"2015-06-05T11:13:55.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona is a support. Her job is to work with your adc to do tons of damage at level 3, get your adc kills and gold then laugh at their turret. She does this very well, with a definite counterplay route as well. She can be taken into the jungle or the other lanes, sure, but her first and foremost role is support. the \"buffs\" your suggesting sound like you just want her to do tons of damage by herself, on top of the crazy cc and tankiness.{{champion:89}} {{item:3073}} {{item:3073}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kazaragho","date":"2015-06-05T11:28:55.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i hear you but its a very small change and if its to much than maybe be herself her passive only deals half the damage and with others the full.","replies":[]}]}]}
