Then once I finally get on, I go to play a game and sometimes I can play a few in a row, and other times I can only play one till the crash happens. It's fine till I start loading into the game and it just black screens and pops up with a firewall problem. I had allowed it through my firewall multiple times and checked all that up but it still seems to happen. I then have to log out of LoL because I've accepted the fact it's not going to work sadly (while I'm in a middle of a game!!).. and then have the log in problems more and more. I don't know what to do. I've copped leave buster so many times for this stupid problem. I'm up to 20 minutes, so I sit around for 23 minutes to get into a ranked game to finish all my promos but get kicked and can't join back in, I've now had 3 loses/leaves because of this. I'm hoping someone can help me..
