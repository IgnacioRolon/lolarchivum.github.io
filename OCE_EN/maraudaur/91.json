That hidden sense you get when trading damage, trying to work out the 'feel' of who is stronger, who can win trades/engages/poke etc. and when one of you thinks it is in your favour, you engage.\n\nIn mid lane, the 'feel' of the lane is always very clear to both participants. Through trading of just a few skillshots, you can get a very accurate idea of who deals more damage more reliably. _(if Xerath halves your HP with his Q, you realise very quickly that the ball is in his court)_ And in mid the balance shifts often, even with very small item purchases or skill levels, and both players are always aware of the sudden changes.\n\nIn jungle the feel is more tactical, how many camps has he cleared, how fast does he clear, where is he, what buffs does he have, how confident is he in his counterjungling? all these subconscious numbers you take in, helps you fairly accurately assess the power situation. Shifts of power in jungle don't happen very abruptly unless there is a very successful gank.\n\nIn bot lane, the first little skirmish decides the 'feel' for the rest of the lane. full stop.\nYou have one small skirmish with Blitz/Draven, and then you sit under your tower for the rest of the lane phase being their bitches. Once the other side is ahead in bot _(or gives the pressure of being ahead)_, it is very difficult to pull it back without help or a really lucky break. So the balance of power hardly ever shifts, and both sides have a pretty good idea of it.\n\nBut in top lane, unless you're getting stomped on, or are stomping them, you have virtually no idea who is more powerful until seconds before the fight ends _(and then it's too late to escape)_. You can have amazing pressure, constantly keep them on 200 HP, deny them farm, have a couple of kills under your belt, and it feels like you're so far ahead, then they jump on you and you die instantly! It feels weird to mid laners.\n\nTop is like sumo wrestlers, to the audience it looks like 2 men hugging for 10 minutes, and then randomly one falls over without warning. \nThis feels so alien to mid laners, who are used to knowing the exact power difference between them and the enemy, so it catches them off guard. \nMid lane is more like a Kung Fu fight, everyone is jumping around smacking each other constantly until one of them collapses or makes a mistake.\n\n_(Bot lane is like a bar fight when one of the combatants pulls a gun.)_\n\nThats why _(at least to me)_ top lane was a struggle to learn.\nthe 'feel' is very different.\n\nThats my observation anyway xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-27T06:19:06.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma, Renekton, Pantheon, Lucian.
