If you don't, everyone's kicked back to position select and you'll face queue dodge penalties\n\nEspecially because the process itself has a few extra steps like pick intent, 1 ban from 3 diferent players, and players pick 1 at a time. Once everyone gets used to it the champ select process will be a lot quicker and smoother than it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-01-20T06:46:01.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a great system man. It may have taken me 90 minutes to get in to a game this morning, but I see the merit in the system. Perhaps the UI could have been designed to be a bit more idiot proof (have a voice saying lock in choice now at 10 seconds remaining or something) as I imagine most people would just click the \"never show again\" box for initial warning.\n\nLoving the pick intent, loving having to lock in for bans....overall I'm psyched for this season. And finally I don't have to draw straws when I'm playing with two or more friends :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-20T05:36:40.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is bullshit, so people need to wait an extra 10 seconds, is making them wait really something so bad that you should kick all 10 people over?\n\nwhat happens to those people who change champions at the last second? do they get penalised because they couldn't lock in their second choice as well in that last 1 second?\nmaking people lose their promos just because they forgot to press 'lock in' (when every single other queue does it for you) is complete BS\ni actually feel like waiting the full timer and only locking in at the last second now just to make a point.\n\nbut apart from that single pointless factor, the champion select looks pretty good, it will get rid of that one last pick guy who suddenly somehow doesn't know how to play any other position but top and even when he doesn't get it the only champion he has is Nasus...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-01-20T05:08:04.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its easy.\nI like it.\nRecording my provisional games too.\nJust becuase I wanna see my end score.\nRight now Im 3 wins, 1 Loss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2016-01-20T09:29:56.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand people that don't get this. You click a button, how hard is that? How is that 2 extra seconds of effort a gamechanger?\nIf I had to take a stab at why this was implemented, I'd say it's to stop people from selecting their champ then buggering off to make a sandwich or something. And I'm totally fine with that. If you can't put in the effort to spend 3 minutes watching your screen, clicking the required buttons, and actually communicating with your teammates, then you shouldn't be in the Ranked queue in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-01-20T06:00:17.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PSA: Ban people who don't check their ping before joining a Ranked game or have something in the client that checks players' internet connections and disables ranked if they don't meet certain criteria.\n\nI used to literally only play Ranked during the middle of week days on my days off from uni because I KNEW that I would be the only one at home and my net would be stable. Or I would stay up incredibly late until every had gone to sleep.\n\nI just had a 13 minute loss because some jackass Irelia never connected to the game.
