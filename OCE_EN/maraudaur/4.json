(congrats you did it!)","subforum":"Announcements","up_votes":237,"down_votes":151,"body":"~~~~~~~~~~~~\nVoting has **closed**\nUpdate: Naut won! With a huge 50.7% of votes!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5uAH3eQ.png\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nWell Oceania you did it! And in record time! Congratulations!\n\nSo, the major challenge. A  champion-themed artificial reef of Fizz, Nami or Nautilus will be placed in the ocean along with the names of each and every Summoner who participated and made Ocean Week great.\n\nNow this won't be something that happens over night. Once you pick the champion themed artificial reef we'll have it designed and created so that it's awesome. Once that's done we'll need to find a place for him/her. Finding a location could take a while, because like you we want to make sure Fizz/Nami/Nautilus ends up in a location where he/she will have a positive impact on the environment. But don't worry, it's going to happen!\n\nSO, now the important question Oceania. Who do you want placed in the Ocean to represent you and your accomplishments? You have Fizz, Nami or Nautilus. \n\nThe voting will be open from now until the 30th of Jan 2015. So take your time and think it over. Who represents us? Who will look the coolest? Who will make the best reef?\n\nOnce again a massive thanks to you. We issued a challenge and you didn't just achieve it, you smashed it. Together. As a community. As Oceania.\n\nGGWP!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Q1EAPih.png","replies":[{"poster":"syther6768","date":"2015-01-25T16:00:23.939+0000","up_votes":192,"down_votes":25,"body":"Im picking Nautilus.\nMainly because to none lol players it will kinda make sense \nand also want to see a picture of fish swiming inside of nautalis while im assuming nami and fizz will be solid status\n\nGJ EVERY ONE!\nAnd Happy Australia Day","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silverking512","date":"2015-01-25T15:44:07.587+0000","up_votes":26,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hey Riot Maraudaur what does all the rioters want for the statute\n\nJust asking \nI voted for {{champion:111}} \n\nI linked this too the Perth facebook pages\n\nPerth Rep","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-01-26T00:28:13.207+0000","up_votes":23,"down_votes":4,"body":"I'm so torn between {{champion:267}}  and {{champion:111}}  D:","replies":[{"poster":"Frostbutt","date":"2015-01-26T00:55:56.928+0000","up_votes":108,"down_votes":6,"body":"I'd love to see a mermaid in the sea ... but ... nautilus is just too cool D:\n\nCan't you just... use all threeeeeeeee?

It also contains depths varying between 2 metres deep and the rare 30 metre trench (but mostly 2.5 - 7 metres of flat bottom until you're most of the way over to Moreton Island). The bay itself, once you venture more than a few metres offshore (bar a few select locations), is primarily a sandy, structureless bottom with the rare gravel patch, and occasional weedy area.\n\nA reef or several linking the famous reefs of Moreton Island (such as Curtin Artificial Reef) to the mainland would assist in creating a fish 'highway' to the mainland, and could be protected as a Yellow Zone under state or federal law, preserving the reef and making sure people are careful with how it is treated and fished.\n\nThis could also promote diving at the area. The swell in Moreton Bay near Redcliffe is primarily 1.4m or less, with the water being nice and clear when it dips below 1.2 - 1.1m, even allowing people to reasonably clearly through 3+ metres of water. Structure such as a themed artificial reef in this area would compliment the already-popular significantly sized artificial reefs over at Moreton Island, but would be accessible to almost everyone rather than only people with boats.\n\nIf you have any more questions about this area, I can help you out. I can also point you to the professionals who know the area, patrol the area, and work and live in the area, because they are the best people to ask - those who make the ocean their livelihood and their life (as I do, as a kayak fisherman who only fishes for fun and only takes enough for dinner).\n\nKind regards,\n~Lors\n\n(Vorseth aka \"Loren York\" RL).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mecher11","date":"2015-01-25T23:34:43.561+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":39,"body":"happy australia day!! i voted for fizz because he is one of the most fun champions to play.{{champion:105}}","replies":[{"poster":"HNFOIClBr","date":"2015-01-25T23:45:18.625+0000","up_votes":53,"down_votes":5,"body":"And also one of the most broken champions too, {{champion:111}} Vote naut, do it for Australia","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vladex Striker","date":"2015-01-25T22:21:54.888+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":9,"body":"Should probably have made this more visible to people.","replies":[{"poster":"A roaming minion","date":"2015-01-26T00:28:09.623+0000","up_votes":38,"down_votes":3,"body":"Define 'this' please. \nBut, if you mean the voting, it's been on the top of the Ocean Week page since the start.\nOr if you mean Ocean Week, it's been plastered across our clients since it started.\nAnd if you mean all of the above, then you need to upgrade your situational awareness, it was hard to miss unless your eyes are closed.\n\nSidenote: I really hope you don't main support or jungle...","replies":[{"poster":"JesusRisesAgain","date":"2015-01-26T10:00:12.430+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"He didn't have wards...{{item:2044}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Robin Song Robin","date":"2015-01-25T15:12:25.760+0000","up_votes":28,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nautilus would be such a cool statue","replies":[{"poster":"ZykIon","date":"2015-01-26T03:20:29.875+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And it'd make sense too because in his lore he get sunk the the bottom of the ocean, too :O","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Libbsaurus","date":"2015-01-25T16:20:28.634+0000","up_votes":24,"down_votes":1,"body":"You cant not vote {{champion:111}} he'll be the biggest and probably the most cool looking for a reef.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bolix","date":"2015-01-25T19:07:15.517+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we have a skin for whichever champion wins?
