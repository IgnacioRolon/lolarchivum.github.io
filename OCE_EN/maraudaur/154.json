In the wake of our [big announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2i6RDmbNc) about changes to IP, rewards, and leveling, we&#039;ve seen lots of questions popping up in the community. These are big, complicated changes, so we figured we&#039;d walk through some of the most common questions we&#039;ve seen and give y&#039;all clear answers.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s jump in!\r\n\r\n##Are players who level from 1 to 30 in the new system going to get exclusive stuff that I&#039;m missing out on?##\r\nNope. New players going from 1&ndash;30 won&#039;t get ANY exclusive content. That said, we will use the new leveling system do a little more handholding for new players. Instead of dumping random champion shards on them, they&#039;ll get accessible champs like Garen and Ashe. We&#039;re thinking of letting noobs unlock a couple of random (but not exclusive) cosmetic things like ward skins as they level up, but that stuff will be available to everyone who levels up past level 30 as well.\r\n\r\n##What about the 30 capsules new players get when leveling from 1 to 30? Aren&#039;t we missing out on those?##\r\nNo, because it will still take new players a long time to climb to level 30 and get the 30 capsules along the way. If you spend that time instead on your level 30 account, you&#039;ll get a bunch of capsules as well and you&#039;ll be well on your way toward unlocking one of the exclusive cosmetic rewards at the milestone levels.\r\n\r\nAlso, remember that the new leveling system will be a replacement for the IP you get after games now. You already got rewarded for all the games you played when you leveled from 1&ndash;30, but it was just in the form of IP. So new players aren&#039;t going to get anything you didn&#039;t already get for playing the game.\r\n\r\n##What exactly will I get for leveling up past level 30?##\r\nBeyond level 30, you&#039;ll almost exclusively get unlocked chests with champion shards inside whenever leveling up. The only real exceptions to this will be on certain &quot;milestone&quot; levels like 50, 75, 100, etc. When these levels are reached, you&#039;ll get exclusive rewards that you can use to show off your status in-game. One of these rewards is a special emote which you can evolve using blue essence.\r\n\r\n##Will leveling in the new system get slower the higher you climb?##\r\nYes, but it won&#039;t ever get much slower than it is now. The leveling curve will get slightly harder and slower as you go, but it stops getting tougher once you reach level 150. Basically, the climb from levels 151 to 175 will take exactly as long as the climb from levels 176 through 200. Even at this highest, toughest level (like the jump from level 199 to 200), the average number of games you&#039;ll have to play between levels will be somewhere between 15 and 25 games. It varies depending on how many games you&#039;ve won with the First Win of the Day (which will soon give bonus XP) active.\r\n\r\nOne nuance to understand with this is that the difficulty won&#039;t increase in a straight line. Leveling will get a little bit tougher as you approach each milestone level (every 25 levels) and then it&#039;ll speed up again until you get closer to the next one.\r\n\r\n##When you introduce uncapped leveling, why we don&#039;t start current players past level 30?##\r\nThe new, uncapped leveling system is primarily aimed at giving you more goals to shoot for (and rewards for hitting them). With that in mind, we didn&#039;t think it made sense to start so many of you at a very high level. That would take the goals away from the very people this system is intended to support.\r\n\r\nThat said, we&#039;ve been paying attention to your feedback on this point. A lot of you have pointed out that folks who&#039;ve been playing since the earliest seasons don&#039;t have a good way to express that&mdash;that seems to be a big part of the reason that some of you are asking for a head start in the leveling system. So we&#039;re looking into work on the profile page that&#039;ll let you show other players when you started playing League (including all your previous ranked badges). We&#039;re hoping to ship that by the end of this year or the beginning of early next year.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;re also planning to give out exclusive emotes based on how many hours you&#039;ve put into since the beginning of League. Playing 500 hours gets you the Defender of the League emote, 1,500 hours gets you the Champion of the League emote, and 2,500 hours gets you the ultra-rare Conqueror of the League emote.\r\n\r\n##What else are you doing for players who&#039;ll have tons of BE with nothing to spend it on?##\r\nThe biggest thing is the special blue essence store, which is specifically designed to give those of you who&#039;ve already unlocked all the champs (and stored up big piles of IP) tons of cool exclusive content to buy. The highest priced items in the store&mdash;gemstones and URFWick&mdash;are meant for folks who&#039;ve been around earning IP for many seasons. For the first go-round this preseason the store will include:\r\n\r\n1,500 BE - Mystery icon box (guaranteed to be an icon you don&#039;t already own)\r\n2,000 BE - Chromas (includes all chromas that have been available for at least six months)\r\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/misc/forums/2017/Maokai_Meowkai_chromas.jpg\r\n\r\n2,500 BE - &ldquo;Mystery Mini&rdquo; Icons Box (exclusive to the special BE store)\r\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/misc/forums/2017/MysteryMinis.jpg\r\n\r\n3,950 BE - Mystery Champions (guaranteed to be a champion you don&#039;t already own)\r\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/misc/forums/2017/MysteryChamp-2.jpg\r\n\r\n4,900 BE - Mystery ward skin box (guaranteed to be a ward skin you don&#039;t already own)\r\n6,000 BE - Rune ward skin (exclusive to the special BE store)\r\n50,000 BE - &quot;Make it Rain&quot; emote (exclusive to the special BE store)\r\n50,000 BE and up - Gemstones (First one costs 50,000, second costs 75,000, third costs 100,000. Limited to three per account during the special BE store sale)\r\n150,000 BE - URFWick skin (now exclusive to the special BE store)\r\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/misc/forums/2017/Urfwick.jpg\r\n\r\n##Will the special BE store ever come back?##\r\nRight now we&#039;re thinking we&#039;ll bring back the special blue essence store at least once a year. We&#039;re not sure what it will include when it returns, but when we bring it back we&#039;ll be sure to include the unique stuff like the rune ward skins and the &quot;make it rain&quot; emote.\r\n\r\n##Is the URFWick in the special BE store different than the original URFWick?##\r\nThe URFWick skin we release with the blue essence store will be a 2017 edition, similar to what we did with Championship Riven. Original owners of URFwick will automatically receive a special limited edition upgrade of the original skin, a loading screen border, AND the new URFwick.\r\n\r\n##Will we receive blue essence after every game?##\r\nNo, the new rewards system is all designed around champion shards (which can be turned into blue essence) dropping whenever you level up.\r\n\r\n##Mystery Hextech coins are going away. Why?##\r\nMystery hextech coins were added so you&#039;d have a path to upgrade your mastery tokens with IP. Since IP and BE will soon be combined, they&#039;ve become less necessary. Plus, if you were really into the random champion shards, you&rsquo;ll be getting those a lot more frequently anyway from the leveling capsules.\r\n\r\n##I noticed that champ shard re-rolling is going away. What about skin shard re-rolling?##\r\nYou&#039;ll still be able to re-roll skin shards just like before!\r\n\r\n##Should I do anything with my existing champ shards?##\r\nIt really just depends on what you want to do. If you want a bunch of extra BE, you should probably disenchant them now since they&#039;ll give out relatively less blue essence after preseason hits. That said, you&#039;re free to hang onto them if you think you might want to use one of the shards to unlock a particular champion.\r\n\r\n##Will upgrading to Champion Mastery 6 &amp; 7 still cost the same amount of Blue Essence?##\r\nThe cost will be scaled up in the same amount as your IP to Blue Essence conversion, so it will &quot;cost&quot; the same in the new system, but the numbers will be higher across the board.\r\n\r\n##I hate RNG stuff. What if I get a cheap, useless champion shard when I level up?##\r\nYou can actually get multiple champion shards whenever you level up. If you get a low priced champion shard like Ashe, it will come with other shards to bring up the total value of the capsule. The capsules are balanced like this so that everyone will get close to the same value from hitting any given level, so luck won&#039;t make a difference to how quickly you can unlock champions.\r\n\r\n##What is Riot doing for people who had special legacy runes?##\r\nWe&#039;ll introduce an exclusive ward skin (shown below) for anyone who owned any special legacy runes OR who spent at least 125,000 IP on runes before the September 1, 2017 cutoff date. We&#039;ll also give rare rune owners a special commemorative icon.\r\nhttps://news-a.akamaihd.net/public/images/misc/forums/2017/runeward4.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n##We&#039;re giving partial refund to players for buying runes in the past, but it&#039;s not a FULL refund for all runes purchased since the beginning. Why?##\r\nOur business model is to use the money we get from selling optional content to improve the game, esports, our servers, and everything else. Making new runes free for everyone, giving players thousands of BE, and keeping champion earn rates about the same as today means significantly less RP spent on champions, rune pages, and the cosmetics in the blue essence store. It&rsquo;s a big investment that&rsquo;s only possible because of your support over the years.\r\n\r\nWe understand that it can feel bad to have something you paid for suddenly become free for other people, and that&#039;s why we&#039;re giving folks who spent on runes back in the day the blue essence amounts we announced in Riot Pls. But we also have to focus on using our resources to reinvest in the game. We think that giving a little something back (rather than a full refund) strikes the right balance for players today and in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Silent Frank","date":"2017-10-02T03:48:38.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sad enough i'm kinda hoping i die before this game does, sure i'll live long enough to see it disappoint again. but my faith in this game no longer exists","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-09-13T05:18:46.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is SUCH A LONG POST !!!!\n\nAnyways, It does answer the concerns I did have about 'is it better to disenchant champ shards now?'\n\nLooking forward to getting that level 200 soon xD\n\nLevel 200 is the highest right?!?!?","replies":[{"poster":"Aquariuus","date":"2017-09-19T07:51:30.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"When you introduce uncapped leveling, why don't we don't start current players past level 30?\"\n\nKey word: \"Uncapped\"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
