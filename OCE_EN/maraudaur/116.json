(That stage though). Just letting you all know we have put in a few additions to the side bar. The &quot;Dev Corner&quot; and &quot;Report a Bug&quot;\n\n>**What&#039;s a Dev Corner?\n**\nThis is a place where League of Legends developers can share thoughts, questions, and retrospectives on all things to do with the game. Please keep discussions focused on the topics at hand - we&#039;ll be pretty firm about attempts at hijacking top comments with unrelated content. The plan with the Dev Corner is to pilot various types of communication, ranging from open office hours to &#039;state of the game&#039; essays. Every month, we&#039;ll have &#039;open forum&#039; style discussions to talk about future ideas. In the future we&#039;ll have a calendar up!\n\n----\n >**Report a bug** GUIDELINES\n> Culture\nThis is the place to report bugs that you find within League of Legends. Something that occurs within the Client, patching related issues, or anything that involves gameplay (stuns not working, unintended interactions between abilities, vision issues, etc.) should be posted here! Please do NOT post about disconnects or lag. Instead redirect those problems to Help &amp; Support.\n\n>Etiquette\n Basically, follow these steps when reporting an issue and keep the content focused on active bugs in League of Legends (Game or Client).\nWe want to learn about all the bugs you guys discover, but we also want to organize them, track them, and make sure we have the information we need to fix them! Before you post, please consider what kind of a bug you&#039;re posting, and categorize it appropriately using the suggested tags below:\n \n >[Gameplay] - Champions, items, and game systems, etc\n \n> [Client] - The air client, patcher, etc\n \n >[Crash] - Bugsplats\n \n >Thanks in advance for your awesome bug reports!\n \n\nThese are both Sub boards on the NA boards. So when you click through to them you will find your side bar and URL changes to reflect that. To return to the OCE boards after you go to either Dev Corner of Report a bug you will need to change the url from http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/ to  http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/ (Change the NA in the URL to OCE).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-03T09:19:36.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Serious question, why do we need these?\n\nCan't you guys post on our posts?\n\nWhy can't we be reporting bugs on the OCE boards?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-03T10:05:04.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nAll of the development and our game are done from our central office in North America.
