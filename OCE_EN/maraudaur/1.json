If everything goes well, this will then be rolled out to OCE ranked queue in the following days.\n\nYou can read more about the new champ select here - \nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html\n\nOr check out this video from OCE resident Disco Heat on the PBE\nhttps://youtu.be/qZg9wqIeddU","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-07T23:47:42.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we aren't getting Draft Pick Normals for this after all?","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-01-08T00:37:19.107+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"The testing process for the new champ select has gone faster than expected. That means that no regions will be doing an extended beta period like was originally planned. The good news is that means that champ select will be live on NA and TR for Ranked for a 72-hour testing cycle beginning on the 14th. If that goes well it will then be rolled one at a time to the other regions including OCE.\n\nThis means that the plan to have Normal Draft enabled for a short time to test the new champ select is no longer necessary. It is coming to Ranked soon and the plan is for it to replace Blind Pick sometime in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Benri93","date":"2016-01-08T02:03:54.497+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for such a clear and informative responce <3","replies":[{"poster":"Alpha Agent","date":"2016-01-08T08:05:45.541+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Riot For a solid answer{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sýndra","date":"2016-01-08T05:11:14.463+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"we just want draft normals enabled for good in oce, its soo painful to que for normals when you dont have a 5 premade that i dont even do it anymore,","replies":[{"poster":"Dalek","date":"2016-01-10T00:35:41.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's saying this new queue is going to replace Blind Pick for us on OCE.
