The top 8 teams from the Oceanic Open Ladder will play in a best of 3 single elimination tournament over the next three weeks every Tuesday and Wednesday starting at 6pm AEDT. You can find more details [here.](http://oce.lolesports.com/articles/challenger-series-approaches-0)\n\nI want to see who you think will win each round, check out the link below and put in your vote!\nThe tipping form will close at 6 pm AEDT on the 16th of March.\nYou can submit your picks [here](https://www.facebook.com/LeagueOfLegendsOceania/app_36495350702)\n\n___\n**Scoring System**\nEach round 1 will award 10 points for each correct option selected in the bracket. The points will double each round as the number of bracket options is cut in half. This means that each round will be worth the same amount of overall points and gives the later selections a bit more weight for getting them correct. For example in an 8 team bracket. Round 1 would have 4 matches each worth 10 points = 40 points. Round 2 (Semis) would have 2 matches each worth 20 points = 40 points and Round 3 (finals) would have 1 match worth 40 points = 40 points.\n\nThis means the total points available is 120 points.\n___\n**Prizes**\nAny player that can get 100 points or above will receive a **10 win IP boost** AND the **Arclight Vel'koz** skin.\n\nWinners will be announced one day after the tournament is concluded.\n___\n**Teams**\nYou can find the teams below and also check out how they did in the [OOL here.](http://oce.lolesports.com/leagues/oceanic-open-ladder)\nSin Gaming = SG\nEqualizer = EQ\nBest Players Ocean = BP\nRebellion = RB\nKrispy Kreme Crew = KK\nAbsolute = AB\nChaos eSports = CE\nBang eSports = BE","replies":[]}
