(Talon Direction)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nEvery once in awhile I&#039;m going to be highlighting an interesting post from the Dev Corner. If you&#039;re super interested in game design discussion thats the place to be! (You can find a link in the side bar)\n\nThis time I wanted to highlight the recent discussion around Talon&#039;s direction in the assassin update. (I recently started playing him in ranked!)\n\nYou can read the full discussion here - http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/EjFNREfn-assassin-roster-update-talon-direction\n\nI&#039;ve quoted the main post below; interested to hear what you guys think =D  {{champion:91}} \n\n> Hey all!\n> \n> As Statikk explained earlier in the year, Assassins will [finally] take center stage in our next roster update, and I&rsquo;m here to shed some light on the first project we&rsquo;d like to share with you: Talon, the Blade&rsquo;s Shadow.\n> \n> Talon has always been a major missed opportunity -- he promises to be a stealthy-yet-flashy agile rogue, but manifests in game as more of a reckless AoE damage bomb. All of us who&rsquo;ve died to that mobi-boots, ghost-blading Talon that blinked on our face and one-shot us from stealth can probably agree that his kill pattern is not particularly fun to engage with, but I think even Talon could recognize that there&rsquo;s room for more creativity in his kit. We believe that trading in some of that brute force for a more skillful and acrobatic realization of his could-be-cool theme will land the champion in a much better place.\n> \n> Secondarily, Talon suffers some big overlap problems with other Assassins, namely the melee bunch like Kha&rsquo;Zix, Akali, and Zed. They have their differences, to be sure, but we think there&rsquo;s a lot more room there to set them apart. [Quick aside on why this is important: If all Assassins do the same thing, we get two major problems: 1) Staleness: Games with an Assassin, no matter which one, tend to feel very similar, and 2) Dominance: The &lsquo;best&rsquo; Assassin will crowd out the others from being picked coughZedcough]. So, we&rsquo;ll be playing up and adding in some more Talon-esque things to his kit to make him a bit more like the special snowflake that he ought to be and less of a generic Assassin guy.\n> \n> So, in gameplay terms, what does this mean for the update?\n> \n> 1. Leaning into what&rsquo;s already unique -- roaming. Talon is among the most dedicated roamers when it comes to the Assassins, with boots of mobility being one of his core items. We think that this is cool and something to push on. Talon&rsquo;s ability to both traverse the map and approach on his target will be way more awesome, appreciable, and thematic for everyone involved. Instant blink from stealth has its merits, but we could take it much, much farther on pretty much all sides (coolness / uniqueness / fairness / fun).\n> \n> 3. Extending his burst window. It&rsquo;s important for Assassins to have some reliable threat on the enemy backline, but when all their damage comes out before the would-be victims can react, that&rsquo;s a big problem. Try not to worry though, we&rsquo;re not talking about much time here, even half a second could mean a LOT for these guys.\n> \n> 5. Focusing him on his target. Assassins should be empowered to hunt down and kill a particular enemy champion, and while there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having some AoE damage, when you accidentally get a quadrakill by just doing your job and aiming for the fed enemy Twitch, something&rsquo;s not right. Blades-everywhere is an iconic and exciting part of what Talon does, but we&rsquo;d like to siphon some of that ambient damage into more focused assassination power. He&rsquo;ll still be able to get big multikills, he&rsquo;ll just have to be a bit more deliberate.\n> \n> And those are our primary focuses for our boy Talon! Please share any questions / comments / concerns here, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to respond to them when I can.\n> \n> -Stashu\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-05T03:43:08.725+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Sounding good! **\n\nI like the direction he seems to be going in! :)\nAlthough in saying that, Talon is one of the few Assassins that ISNT a huge problem right now. _(mainly because unlike a few other manaless monsters, he isn't in every second game)_ \n\nbut when he is in a game, he is either fed and is the physical incarnation of the God of death, or isn't fed and might as well just AFK.\nSo hopefully he becomes a bit more evened out after this.\n\n_________\n\n**This is my concern however:**\nIn my understanding _(and correct me if I'm wrong)_ Assassins are high-risk high-reward champions. They dive right into the back line, which is very risky, and try to kill off the centrepiece of the enemy team. They can kill the squishies very quickly, but if they make a mistake, or are caught, they also die very quickly. _(something that most other assassins seem to have forgotten)_\n\nThis is something that Talon already does very well, his ult is his best engage, but also his only disengage. His boots' special effect doesn't work after engaging, and he has likely already used his item's MS active to augment his engage. Meaning that he has to make the critical decision of _\"Do I use my escapes to secure the kill, or to secure my own safety.\"_ and that is what makes him a great assassin. He has to choose between, trying to out damage ADC's in a quick skirmish and then using his escapes to get to safety, or he can obliterate the ADC almost instantly, but pretty much sacrifices himself to do it, and relies on his team mates to bail him out of sticky situations. \n\nThis \"Fight or flight\" decision is critical to assassin counterplay, if the assassin decides to go HAM on the ADC, there is almost nothing that can stop them, but after killing the ADC the assassin is a sitting duck. \n\nNow what I'm worried about, is that Talon could lose this critical decision, and become more like Zed who can burst his entire kit (Even summoners) on a kill, and still have an almost guaranteed escape.\n\nTalon is also one of the few assassins that doesn't go bruiser like Zed/Yasuo/Ekko, because in my mind, having a tanky assassin, defeats the whole purpose of \"Fight or flight\" because they can kill the enemy, and still be tanky enough to survive if caught. When you see a 3000+ HP Yasuo closing in on you, you know you don't stand much of a chance, and you know that likely he will get out again before your team can avenge you. But when you see Talon's blades converging on you, you die a little easier clinging to the thought of _\"Well now he has to get out again.. good luck talon ;) hehe, incoming assist for me!\"_\n\n**TL;DR:**\nI am hoping that Talon doesn't lose his _\"Kill or be killed\"_ mentality in favour of Zed's _\"Kill and then go home for tea\"_ mentality, or Yasuo's _\"Kill everything... then wait for their re-spawn and kill again!\"_ mentality.\n_________\n\nWhat i don't think you guys at Riot have realised yet _(or maybe you have but don't know what to do about it)_ Is that damage isn't the problem! The problem is also having utility. Most people i have talked to agree with me on this:\n\n1. No one cares that Zed can target a champion and remove them from the game. They care about the fact that he gets away scot-free afterwards.\n\n2. No one cares that Yasuo has 2x Crit, they care that he can chase you down, kill you and then dash away again while blocking all your spells. \n\n3. No one cares that Shaco can 2 hit you, they care that he pops up behind you with no warning whatsoever.\n\n4. No one cares that Fizz's shark halves your HP, they care that he bounces away immune from danger.\n\n5. No one cares that Ekko can kill you with only his passive, they care that he builds tank and is unkillable while doing so.\n\n6. No one cares that Vayne can 3 hit you, they care that you cant run away from her, she doesn't get pentakills because she out damages everyone, she gets pentakills because no one can escape.\n\nI know that utility and funky mechanics make champions a lot more fun to play, but there is a line, and some champions like Zed and Yasuo, definitely cross it. Talon doesn't! Unlike most of the other assassins, Talon has to choose between 'assured survival' and 'assured kill' \n**Please don't take that away and make him just another utility-heavy bruiser with mega damage.**\n\n_PS. Sorry if this sounds too critical, You guys really do great work, and I cant wait to play the new Talon :)_","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-09T04:54:51.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! \n\nAwesome post. I get your concerns here especially when you mention Leblanc/Zed with their (instant return to where I was ability).\n\nThere are a few things we want to do with assassins.\n\n1) Ensure Assassin gameplay is healthy\nCounter play - Assassin damage needs to not happen literally in the blink of an eye.

My decision making and succeeding on a snowball has always felt very good. Now I might be biased in saying this because I honestly do enjoy playing him but I've felt that he was a more balanced champion than say for example {{champion:238}}  simply because when Talon delivers his burst he is left vulnerable whereas zed does not while having a weaker laning phase it makes when compared to a few other assassins. Despite all this it's very true, Talon does snowball very hard, he is basically a kamikaze styled champion late game who throws himself into the enemy carry and burst them down within an instant but it's difficult to not be punished for that. At the same time though to remove this concept from his play style seems like we won't just be trying to make it harder to burst someone but I feel that it might conflict with the play style that those who love to play Talon not just because he's strong but because he's also very fun to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T10:41:30.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do whatever you want with Talon Riot just make a new skin for him and take my money god damn it.\n\nhttps://www.google.com.au/search?tbs=sbi%3Acs&tbnid=mKGA-lBGcIM5nM%3A&docid=YrAKB8nDmmU6EM&hl=en-au&client=safari&bih=672&biw=1024&dpr=2&ved=0ahUKEwjnsriTi6rOAhXEFpQKHbbLD9IQiBwIBw#imgrc=Df8m71qcPb1NMM%3A","replies":[]}]}
