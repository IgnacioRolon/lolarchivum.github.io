(1 win 10 losses)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone,\n\n**TL:DR** - Check out my 1w/10 loss streak below. I wanted to point out that in each of these games it was easy for me to point and blame team mates for the loss and just leave it at that. But after each game it was possible for me to review and learn something, this meant that even though I was frustrated and tilted and depressed I was still (hopefully) improving and learning after each game. When I go through this I always think about how this is only 11 games out of 524.\n\nHistorically I have talked a lot to players around what kind of mind set you should have when it comes to ranked and why you should always focus on your own play rather than looking to blame others. I was reflecting on my recent terrible streak and thought it would be a good opportunity to show how I deal with games where I feel like I was let down by certain players on my team.\n\nThe first thing to keep in mind is, none of my team mates wanted to lose lane/game. All of them wanted to play well and win just like me. I think this is actually something a lot of players who complain about their team mates seems to over look. No one queues up for Ranked looking to lose, we all want to win. Sometimes people have bad games and that&#039;s okay. Just to add in a note here about these specific 11 games there were multiple times where a player did bad on my team then I played against them and they did well. I&#039;m not going to lie and say these last 11 games were just as good as the games before hand. It&#039;s been a frustrating experience going through games where you felt like you should win but you don&#039;t.\n\nSo through out these 11 games. I really felt like I played relatively well. I don&#039;t think I should have won all the games but there were definitely some games where I felt like I should win but ended up losing (which happens). Its important to keep in mind that I have played 524 Ranked games total this season. There have been games where I do well and lose, and also games where I do bad and win. But once in a while you will come across a streak where nothing goes your way, it happens and it sucks but there is always something you can get out of each game.\n\nWhen I first reviewed these games it was really easy for me to just isolate and blame certain team mates in each game and just write it off as \" oh X Y Z team mates played bad so I lost\". But upon further review there was actually a lot I could have done better in each and every game, it might not have changed the game into a win. But if I made better decisions and less mistakes in these games I could increase my chance of winning.\n\nRead below about each game and I would love to hear what you guys think about my recent loss streak.\nNote - the images are from http://freelo.gg/ the ratings you see is how the website rates each of your games.\n\n**Game 1** - I played Nocturne Jungle. Overall our team did well except for Lux who had a bad game. She ended up afking before the game ended, definitely felt it was winnable regardless. Key Learning - Eve stole 2 Jungle camps from me early game. I need to learn how to play around aggressive junglers better.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ewVTNly.jpg\n\n**Game 2** - I played Diana mid. This was a tough game, I was slightly winning mid but all other roles were losing (especially Jax top). Nidalee was raging hard at Jax which didn&#039;t help. Key Learning - I didn&#039;t do a good job of roaming and trying to pressure other lanes with my lead. I ended up dying a lot due to frustration as well which didn&#039;t help\nhttp://i.imgur.com/GZgz9FD.jpg\n\n**Game 3** - I played terribly. I tilted (Without realizing) and just picked a champion that I wanted to play rather than one I was good at or fit with our team. We actually made a big comeback during this game but we got cocky and threw, rip. Key Learning - If I don&#039;t have a good reason for picking a certain champ, and I play something because I feel like it....I am tilting.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cOJTiDh.jpg\n\n**Game 4** - I didn&#039;t win my lane, I couldn&#039;t build a lead. While in this game it really did feel like Vayne let the team down there was still a lot lacking from my own game play. Nid was raging at Vayne which was pretty unhelpful as well. Key Learning - Morde OP, also be really aware of positioning when behind and split pushing. Got caught out by Morde a few times.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Dh3r2W3.jpg\n\n**Game 5** - Gangplank on our team never connected. Our team was actually pretty good, I made a few errors trying to fight Cho&#039;gath mid game. Key learning - don&#039;t try fight a cho when you are filling mid as jungle. Maybe build tank first when behind\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a33br2L.jpg\n\n**Game 6** - This was an interesting game. I played Diana mid, our team also had an AP Rengar. Their Tyrndamere required 2-3 people top to kill him which meant we lost control of the map. Key Learning - Had a teleport bot that went wrong they had 3 low health but Janna had ult and outplayed me. Need to keep track of key ultimates better.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sTQZ5JO.jpg\n\n**Game 7** - I fell behind early to Pantheon who got FB on brand off an invade and started with an extra long sword. Their Noct mid snowballed hard off Brand. It didn&#039;t help that brand built Mejais first while behind. Key Learning - need to play extremely safe against panth who has an early lead, might need to look to roam or freeze lane\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uav2Hva.jpg\n\n**Game 8** - Yay a win! was skeptical of the twitch jungle especially after 7 losses in a row. But stayed positive and he camped my mid. Every lane won as well which is nice.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ymJDPDS.jpg\n\n**Game 9** - I played bad, their Xin was really good. (note to self - don&#039;t die getting random cs after your ADC just died)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oQEeNam.jpg\n\n**Game 10** - We got 4 kills to start the game!!! then Naut DC and we lost (Note to self - need to practice body slam flash combo)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C9ylPDD.jpg\n\n**Game 11** - Not good enough to carry, had a 30 cs lead at 10 minutes but couldn&#039;t convert the advantage into anything meaningful. Rengar had a bad game (he did 4.4k champ damage in 33 minutes) ( note to self - need to find a way to transfer 20+ minion advantage to map presence)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HZ0fAo9.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-09-11T03:35:14.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I got from this is that you lost some games because people DC'ed.\nYeah being positive is a thing, and trying to stop others from falling apart and raging is something too.\n\nBut can't you guys add a simple 1/0 - Y/N check?\nI do get that the system can be abused, Such as 1-2 people abusing someone until they leave.\nBut isn't the new reporting system coming out?\n\nI just feel like you guys need to sit down in a massive conference room and talk about.\n\"What needs to be done...\" and \"How do we go about doing it...\"\n\nSo, if someone on 1 side DC's goes afk *Because reasons*\nWhy dont you make it so the enemy team earns less LP?\n\nIve had plenty of losses these past few days, and it wasn't due to DC's actually.\nIt was due too the lack of game knowledge.\n\"Why would I buy a sightstone\" - Says the worst support ever.\nAnd the fact that people keep copying what they see on screen without actually practicing anything.\n\nI just think as a community, surely we can find a proper way to bring some balance to unfair situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-11T03:50:25.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really interesting that you say that, very few of the games were lost due to DC (2 out of 11).

Guys that gave up a couple of kills early then lost all will to play. Selfish players that don't think about the team.When I go 0-2 in the first ten minutes I think about defence and not feeding anymore. Thinking about the team, not just my score. However what usually happens is those type of guys rage at the jungler or some other team member (sometimes the ones offering advice) and then they start either trolling, feeding or just plainly disconnect. Very frustrating.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Only Heimer,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Ais2m0qd,comment-id=000a,timestamp=2015-09-11T07:29:09.207+0000)\n>\n> in terms of what system. well i've actually suggested it a number of times. first of all, you need to make games not start if someone fails to load/connect within x amount of time during load screen.\n\nI'll tell you why they won't do this... probably 25% of game will simply not start.

Silver = Bronze atm in OCE. Simply players have no idea about strategy, the main differences in silver and bronze from what I can see is mechanics and csing. I know a player who is gold level most of the time, but has been all the way back to silver 5 then back to gold 3, then back to silver 5. They are very good at mechanics, but their strategy is not up to scratch.\n\nBut what I find interesting is that one week you can be playing in bronze 5 division and your mmr is 600 (according to op.gg). Then you have a bunch of noobs that troll, or feed and you lose 20 games while winning one or two. So you are back to bronze 5 with 0lp. Then, you have a day where you win EVERY SINGLE GAME by stompings. And in most of those games nobody on either team trolled or afked. And you make it back to bronze 4. But then according to op.gg your elo is around 500 MMR. Explain this.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Only Heimer,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Ais2m0qd,comment-id=0010,timestamp=2015-09-12T02:59:40.549+0000)\n>\n> just got demoted to bronze 5. it only took 13 games since coming back. we did it boys. let me guess, im supposed to stay positive and just look at the things i could've improved on, right? let's just totally ignore the culprits that had the biggest impact on most of these losses, right? i think it's safe to say that im done with this game.\n\nSeriously man in the past two weeks there have been absolute bronze NOOBS playing the game. People without balls or resolve. People that quit too easily, and don't think about improving, or teamwork. Guys that are probably level 1, but decided to buy a level 30 account. Dudes that have played in bronze for over 2.5 seasons but never learnt about teamwork and communication. Trolls that do feeding on purpose (perhaps to test out the system, i've seen one guy doing this for more than a week, no names I know no naming and shaming, but ask me and I'll tell you who it is, and they've been on my team and the enemy team, made not difference to them, they just feed every game).

It's a team game, mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-09-13T04:52:44.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bookbash,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Ais2m0qd,comment-id=00000002,timestamp=2015-09-13T03:27:22.088+0000)\n>\n> Yep I agree with this. Recently in the past two weeks I've gone back to bronze 5 0 lp. And in the majority of games I played, this happened. Guys that gave up a couple of kills early then lost all will to play. Selfish players that don't think about the team.When I go 0-2 in the first ten minutes I think about defence and not feeding anymore. Thinking about the team, not just my score. However what usually happens is those type of guys rage at the jungler or some other team member (sometimes the ones offering advice) and then they start either trolling, feeding or just plainly disconnect. Very frustrating.\n\nyep. i've had top laners rage quit after dying once in my recent matches, but what is more common is what you said. people die 1 or 2 times but just don't learn. they don't understand the concept of scaling and that this is a game of maths as much, if not more, than it is a game of skill. they're like \"i'll kill him this time\" and just end up HYPER feeding. i lose lane sometimes, but you'll never see me with more than a few deaths in lane. i'll focus on what i can do for the team (which is not that much in this elo) and usually make a big comeback later in the game.\n\n> I'll tell you why they won't do this... probably 25% of game will simply not start. For those game there is at least one person disconnected at the loading screen, and it takes them about 30 seconds to connect to the game.\n\nto me that doesn't matter. they need to implement this regardless\n\n> I'll have a go at explaining this. Silver = Bronze atm in OCE. Simply players have no idea about strategy, the main differences in silver and bronze from what I can see is mechanics and csing. I know a player who is gold level most of the time, but has been all the way back to silver 5 then back to gold 3, then back to silver 5. They are very good at mechanics, but their strategy is not up to scratch.\n\nyeah you're spot on. there is a noticeable difference between bronze and higher silver in regards to how they play their champions. but that's where it stops.\n\n> But what I find interesting is that one week you can be playing in bronze 5 division and your mmr is 600 (according to op.gg). Then you have a bunch of noobs that troll, or feed and you lose 20 games while winning one or two. So you are back to bronze 5 with 0lp. Then, you have a day where you win EVERY SINGLE GAME by stompings. And in most of those games nobody on either team trolled or afked. And you make it back to bronze 4. But then according to op.gg your elo is around 500 MMR. Explain this.\n\nwell op.gg isn't 100% accurate. it's just an estimate, but my explanation would be because, just like LP gains/losses, you're getting punished for losing more than you're getting rewarded for winning. you lose more MMR for a loss (especially when the system thinks you should be winning) than you gain for a win. basically you need to win a lot more games than you lost to make up for it.\n\n> Seriously man in the past two weeks there have been absolute bronze NOOBS playing the game. People without balls or resolve. People that quit too easily, and don't think about improving, or teamwork. Guys that are probably level 1, but decided to buy a level 30 account. Dudes that have played in bronze for over 2.5 seasons but never learnt about teamwork and communication. Trolls that do feeding on purpose (perhaps to test out the system, i've seen one guy doing this for more than a week, no names I know no naming and shaming, but ask me and I'll tell you who it is, and they've been on my team and the enemy team, made not difference to them, they just feed every game). Hated it.\n\nyep this is what i mean about short term. all it takes is a few days or weeks of these bad streaks and you're screwed. people, riot employees included, keep linking shit about \"oh if that's really the case then you should win more than lose, therefore if you got demoted 3 divisions this week then it must be because you're bad\" but they find it hard to understand that is relevant to the long term. they don't seem to be able to comprehend that it is entirely possible to have a big streak of games where your teammates are bad/afk/dc ESPECIALLY in low elo. they keep sticking to the \"um 56% of the time you should have better teammates and afk/dcs on the enemy team\". they also seem to not realise that 44% is still a lot of games. it's like they just admitted there's a problem but then keep denying it.\n\n> Actually no, his TEAM messed up. And if his TEAM is constantly messing up, then what we have is what he said, a bad system. Check this guy [sunshower](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=sunshower) out, should he be in bronze 5?
