The champion-themed artificial reef stretch goal was unlocked in just three days!\r\n\r\nAfter 46,000 votes the community has chosen Nautlius, The Titan of the Depths, to theme the artificial reef. The names of all of those who earned at least three points before the goal was unlocked will have their Summoner Names recorded on the reef. \r\n\r\nThe exact location of the reef will be determined after the approvals process has been completed. We are working with an artificial reef company and a marine biologist to make the reef.\r\n\r\nUpdates will be provided at [oce.leagueoflegends.com](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/) as progress is made on the reef project!\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iSsfSj2.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Sir Clapton","date":"2015-02-17T05:23:08.339+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anybody else notice the \"Nalphite\"?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corn Wizard","date":"2015-02-17T06:38:20.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can anyone read what champions 18 and 20 are?
