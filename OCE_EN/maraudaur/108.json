We want to hear all of your thoughts on the game and will be checking throughout the day up until the match tonight to hear what you think!\r\nMake sure you&#039;re respectful of eachother&rsquo;s opinions but feel free to state your most outlandish theories for how this is going to go because for this game in particular, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess.\r\n\r\n*drumroll please&hellip;*\r\n\r\n**Avant Garde vs The Direwolves**\r\n\r\nAvant Garde are a team that have been on the rise with recent success against some of the OPL&rsquo;s strongest teams, with some hiccups and signs of weakness spattered in between. This plethora of mixed results has still given us a hint of the true capabilities of this lineup when let off the leash. Still looking to get regain their form of Finals 2014 where they claimed the title of Oceanic Champions, Avant have been climbing back after a rough start to 2015 with a 5th place finish for split 1 of the OPL. After a few more roster shakeups before split 2 the team&rsquo;s mixed results speak more to their potential than their apparent inconsistency.\r\n\r\nAvant&rsquo;s mid laner Kenste is one of the bigger talking points about this exciting lineup, being one of the longstanding veterans and recent strong performer, look to the Avant mid laner to clutch the game on his assassin preference, Leblanc or maybe his signature Twisted Fate. Mid lane aside, Avant have an abundance of options to carry their game through and that is what makes them scary, especially with their new bottom lane of Warble and Destiny opening the map for Chelby with their solid laning phase and Porky&rsquo;s guaranteed effectiveness from the top lane.\r\n\r\nDirewolves are on paper, the team to truly rival the best OCE has to offer. Every lane and every player of this lineup presents stellar results on the fields, coupled with fantastic teamwork and synergy through shot calling. But ultimately when you think of Direwolves, you think of Perfection (the player and almost the noun). This mechanically gifted player excels at all things map rotation and skirmish plays, where he can truly outplay his opponent through superior decision making and mechanical skill. \r\nBacking this near perfect being is an exceptional bot lane and the biggest improvers of the first split, Chuffer and K1ng. This dynamic duo also coined as the super flash bros are fans of aggression, and taking every opportunity to turn a snowball into an avalanche with adventurous plays coupled with synergy and brute force.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the bloodthirsty Direwolves take on the resurgent Avant Garde team, there is sure to be a bloodbath on the rift. The real question we need to ask is which Avant will we see take on the consistent play of the Direwolves. Perfection has already thrown the gauntlet with successful Twisted Fate games and Kenste has shown that he is where Avant look to carry them to victory, will we see Perfection run rampant in this contentious matchup, or will kenste quell the threat and come out in front? \r\n\r\nWith Avant playing twice tonight momentum is a huge factor and with the team coming off an upset loss they really need to rally tonight.\r\n\r\nAre our runners up from split one: The Direwolves, going to take it? Or will Avant Garde find their Finals form and come out on top?
