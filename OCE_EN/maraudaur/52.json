Is it their individual soloq ranking or is it the teams overall ranking in ranked 5's? \n\nCause I'm only in Gold elo for example, but I'm easily a plat player and stomp face most games. I just haven't had the time to hit plat again just yet. If I were to play against silvers in a tournament there would be no contest; I'd annihilate them.

I live in a tiny NSW town in the middle of nowhere but we have a TAFE and because there is LITERALLY nothing to do here most of us play games (and league). We actually have some pretty decent players. I used to go to the TAFE here but for my degree I now do my course Distance Education through the TAFE in the city because Graphic Design is not available here. I have been wanting to run tournaments or an internet cafe or something here for a while now to give the people something to do. My first question is who would I talk to in Riot for help with setting up something regular for us to do. Ok now the hard one, can I start a LoL-Club for two or more schools? Seeing as not a lot is on offer here a lot of us have gone to Distance ED ( online study mainly, we havent moved, go into city occasionally) or moved but we still all want to compete together and have other people join in as well. The schools are kind of close together and none of them have a club from what I can see. Could we do a region one for the bogan TAFE's here?","replies":[{"poster":"Kylo Renekton","date":"2016-03-13T13:38:13.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also all the TAFE's here go under the same name \"Tafe Of New England\" and they are all linked.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-13T23:13:31.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI'm the man you want to talk to about hosting events for your local community!\n\n1)  \"I have been wanting to run tournaments or an internet cafe or something here for a while now to give the people something to do.
