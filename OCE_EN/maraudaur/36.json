The last 3 and a half years have been amazing. I would have never imagined all of this was possible when I hosted my first tournament in Auckland, NZ way back before we even had Oceania servers. It&#039;s been filled with fun times, great people, rewarding work and a solid dose of League of Legends. It&rsquo;s been an honour to work with all the Rioters and amazing players in our community.\n\nThank you University club leaders and community leaders ,shout out to [Summoners Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/), for taking on the work and responsibility that comes with running a community. Throughout the years you have created amazing League of Legends experiences for your members like huge worlds viewing parties, weekly social leagues, regular online tournaments and offline events. I hope you will continue to work together to create amazing experiences that bring League of Legends players together.\n\nThank you artists, cosplayers, writers and other creators out there for being a part of this community. Your amazing creations show the world class talent we have here in Oceania and have helped bring League of Legends to life in many mediums throughout the years. I hope you will continue to improve your craft and produce epic League of Legends creations.\n\nThank you to the amazing boards volunteers. You have helped a lot of players out by answering their questions about the game, player behaviour systems and even walking people through tech support issues. You have helped generate discussion and moderate posts on the boards. But not only have you made the boards a better place for discussion and help, you have even helped us make it look better and ran contests of your own! I hope you can continue to grow and be a part of this amazing community.\n\nI&#039;ll still be playing and around in the community so feel free to reach out, always happy to chat and help out. You can find me in the [Summoners Society ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/)facebook group or through the below channels =D\n\n[https://twitter.com/Maraudaur](https://twitter.com/Maraudaur)\nDiscord: Maraudaur#4751\n\nSee you on the Fields of Justice.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-11-30T08:00:15.230+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woody,\n\nIn two weeks, it'll mark two years since I first messaged you on a whim in the **PlayWithRiot** in-client public chat with big despairs but also big hopes. I remember, almost instantly you responded to my messages and were keen to hear out my visions. Over the following two months, we built a team of some of the most passionate folks that I've ever had the pleasure of working with, but also at the same time, we volunteers had the immense privilege of working with one of the most passionate folks in all of Oceania. It's been a crazy two years, and our team has done some amazing things that we can all be proud of; but beyond that, each of us has taken a piece of your passion and turned it into something that has allowed each of us to grow in substantial ways, from developing our communication skills, coding and development skills, and even careers. \n\nWords cannot begin to describe the gratitude I have that you were willing, even excited, to take a chance on this program and each of us volunteers. Every journey has its end, and while you're moving onward from Riot Games, I know your journey with this community is long from over and you can always count on us to be there to help you grow this incredible community in any way we can. \n\nThank you so much for everything,\nMichael","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-11-30T07:43:52.694+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the great community stuff you've done over the years man.

Thanks for everything!\n\nWe have had many long and philosophical discussions here on the boards, ones that I have always thoroughly enjoyed and learned from, I hope that many more will ensure in future, just without the baggage of a red tag!\n\nYou have had a major presence on the boards, one overflowing with passion, positivity and encouragement, and I don't need to say that we have **all** benefited greatly from that as a community! Everyone's comments here make that even more abundantly clear.\n\nYou will leave a hole in Riot, one that will be very hard _(if even possible at all)_ to fill again!\nFew people in any organisation show as much enthusiasm and feeling with the \ncommunity as you have. \nI, and the rest of the league community salute you for it!\nAnd wish you the absolute best in your future endeavours!\n\nJust like you have always been there for us, we are all here for you, should you ever need us.\n\nAll the best my man!\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-30T09:19:03.234+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Despite appearances, I'm an individual of few words, so I'll just say this:\n\nI'm not the kind of person to look to ice cream in the wake of news that requires processing, but for this I got out the good stuff.\n\nRiot certainly doesn't deserve you, Marauder, so go find someone who does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Galacius","date":"2017-11-30T09:27:04.649+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mara,\n\nI’ve only known you for a short time but I wanted to say thank you. I was a bit afraid of talking to a Rioter directly at times, but you’ve helped me move passed that fear. You’ve been nice and extremely helpful to not only me, but the league of legends community. I appreciated you stopping by and giving players your insight and answering questions. It really helped people see that Riot doesn’t hide being a computer screen and that they’re actually listening. I’m only a volunteer on NA and I didn’t interact with you directly (on OCE), but I did appreciate the time you’ve spent with us and helping us grow. \n\nThanks Mara and you’re always welcome in that discord if you wish to stay and say hello.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-11-30T08:05:13.224+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Marauder can not ruin our number game anymore.\n\nAlso, its sad to see you go, you've been a great experience having you on boards you've been a great help to many players, we all appreciate everything you've done for us\n\nFarewell\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-01T08:24:59.593+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maraudaur thankyou for all your efforts in making the boards a place I and many other enjoy so much.
