In all honesty if it wasn't a popularity contest id be voting for that one instead of having an ego trip and voting for myself. Thats kinda sad cause it  means the best wont win the one who stays up all night harassing everyone they know will win haha! so i'd say internal panel :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Liiamy","date":"2017-02-09T10:31:13.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally think an internal panel would be the most fair for everyone :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"StarzAU","date":"2017-02-08T23:52:25.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad I didn't get shortlisted, but I can see why :p good work everyone these are awesome!!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-02-09T00:07:16.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your entry! which submission was it?
