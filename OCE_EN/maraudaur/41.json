We turned it around.\n\nI see it in high diamond there are lots of games that are lost at that point\nbut given how many mistakes are made in low elo, I imagine its super rare\nfor games not to still have fighting chance.\n\nGames with a troll or inting however are massively slanted against you\nfrom the start of the game, and there's very little chance to win a 4v6.\nThose are the ones I want to have an option to get out of, those\nare the ones that make you hate league.\n\nI think there is some value, but idk give us a /feeder vote option, \nopen to all 10 players that ends the game, with 9 votes.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-02-27T23:17:07.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue (in low elo) isn't the fact that nearly every game you play has the potential to be turned around.

But what about the times when there's 1 person preventing the vote from passing in the case of ff@15? At least with ff@20, it's 2 out of 5 players that may be stopping the team from forfeiting so it's not so bad as it's pretty close to being the \"middle\"; but what about being in the position of that 1 out of 5 person preventing the ff@15?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-23T05:30:31.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\nWHY WOULD ANYONE NEED MORE SURRENDER!?\n\nEW EW EW EW GROSS GET IT OFF!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-23T06:23:48.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=AuVGdnPp,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-02-23T05:30:31.595+0000)\n>\n> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n> \n> WHY WOULD ANYONE NEED MORE SURRENDER!?\n> \n> EW EW EW EW GROSS GET IT OFF!\n\nAccording to the other posts here, early ff@15 atm requires the entire team, ie all 5 people, to agree to the vote before surrendering could happen.\n\nSo if you don't want to, and vote No, there is 0 chance the ff@15 will pass.\n\nBut if you're concerned with the low and perhaps internally hostile team morale issues during the forfeit stages of the game and the negativity that may be directed at those who vote No, then well, it's a different issue to discuss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Meddler","date":"2017-02-23T05:31:48.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't like it, vote no.
