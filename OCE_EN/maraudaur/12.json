The summoners in purple are known as Distinguished Members on the boards. Think of them as positive and helpful members that are on their way to becoming full fledged boards volunteers =D\n---\nEdited in a clearer definition to help avoid confusion\nThese summoners have been recognised as always being helpful, constructive and positive forces on boards. Quality over quantity applies greatly here.\n\nThey are not volunteers in a specific capacity (like the emissaries), but rather the title exists as a recognition of contribution and some visibility to those who strive to create a constructive and friendly environment on boards.\n---\nThey are always floating around chatting and hopefully being helpful =) so make sure to say hi to them and introduce yourself.\n\nCurrent Distinguished Members are;\n[Nijiiyo](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/GLk0EEmq-introducing-the-distinguished-members?comment=000100000000)\n[Lord Sesshomaru](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/oblohAe0-distinguished-member-update?comment=0000)\nHeartvine","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-26T06:37:10.762+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I find it funny how it's always the people that are never seen on the boards that get these positions over others who are present in almost every single board post","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-26T06:43:27.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sometimes its about quality over quantity =)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-26T08:42:01.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I check in every 2-3 minutes every single day (Yes I have no life) and I have never heard of Glow and have maybe seen Nijiyo in about 3 or 4 posts with the last one being maybe around a month ago.
