I&rsquo;d like to introduce the Instructor program.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QneGYw1.png\n\nWe&rsquo;ve set up this group up to allow players we&rsquo;ve identified as deeply knowledgeable about our game play philosophies to reach out to their fellow players, providing information and helping address questions and concerns you guys bring to our attention.\n\nInstructors are volunteers, not Rioters, so there are some things they can&#039;t do (no nerfing champs you want nerfed, sorry!), but they are ready and willing to help you find resources and become a better League of Legends player, the Instructors are here to work with you!\n\nCurrent Instructors are;\nPrincess Yaia\nLGC Elam \n\nQ: I want to help! How can I join the Instructors?\n\nWe&rsquo;re always on the lookout for potential Instructors, but we do so with the mentality that actions speak louder than words. If you&rsquo;d like to wear the badge of an Instructor, show us that you can do it by continuing to help answer the questions of your fellow summoners in a friendly and professional manner.
