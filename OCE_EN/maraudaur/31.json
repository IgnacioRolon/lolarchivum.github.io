What do you think would be the best way to handle this situation and make our community better?**\n\nHey everyone,\n\nThe idea is to discuss which is the best course of action to take when we find ourselves in a game with a behavior issue and &ndash; if necessary - what category of report to use to  precisely identify the negative players.\n\nIf you want to remember the categories of report and their descriptions,[ look here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JCwL8706qZk/ViAdgsIzgoI/AAAAAAAAy20/uibMA7oozLo/s1600/n2BJwC2.png)!\n\nChampion Katarina, on Summoners Rift, using Meijai!\n\nChampions involved: Katarina, Zyra and Draven\n\n**Case:** {{champion:55}} built {{item:3041}} even though she was losing the lane and had died a few times.\n\nEvidence:\n\n**[10:14] Draven**: kat\n\n**[10:19] Draven**: why didnt you leave this s%#$ for me?\n\n**[10:23] Draven**: look the item you made\n\n**[10:24] Draven**: askodkoasdkoasokasd\n\n**[10:34] Zyra**: he has no obligation to leave it for you\n\n**[10:37] Zyra**: he didn&#039;t leave it because he didnt noticed\n\n**[10:41] Draven**: shut up\n\n**[10:44] Draven**: not talking to you wh*#&amp;\n\n**[10:49] Zyra**: what?\n\n**[10:57] Zyra**: wh*#&amp;?

What to do in a case like this?\n\n----------------------------------\nCase closed!! Until next time =)\n\nInvestigation Summary\n\nSeveral players shared their opinions on the case. Overall Draven would be denounced by negative attitude or verbal abuse. Some players said they would use \"mute\" to avoid Draven attacks, which is a good thing and it is even better if you give moral support to the rest of his team not to fall into the negative influence of Draven.\n\n\nSpecial thanks to the following summoners for their sharp reasoning and insightful comments:\nBigRedNZ\nThane\nJewsus\nDeep Terror Nami\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Master Ýeet","date":"2016-02-27T04:19:23.804+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would mute them and continue playing the game\nthen report draven after the game","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-27T04:29:44.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice! \n\nDo you think there is room to encourage Kat a bit? i.e. if she gets a kill or escapes a death.","replies":[{"poster":"Master Ýeet","date":"2016-02-27T14:26:30.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i do.

(I understand why you would say that and the intentions are great, do you think Draven would get tilted even more?)\n\nYes, I think it's beneficial and Draven is more likely to calm down than to tilt further from experience. The way it works is that he knows he's not helping, he just doesn't care and can't be bothered to stop himself from venting verbally. If the team can't see what he's saying, he's not being aggravated further by what we may say in response to him, which makes him calm down over time. Of course, this isn't always what happens, but is what usually happens from the many games I've played.\n\n> Do you think option 2. might not be very good though in the sense that draven sounds pretty tilted already?\n\nOption 2 is a mood where I'm just playing for fun with no care about anything, so him tilting more because of it doesn't bother me. I think a good amount of the time it doesn't actually make the situation worse since it shows you're calm and puts influence (regardless of how little) on the other players. Or it could just piss some people off, but usually it seems fine to me.\n\n> What do you think about encouraging Kat, and continuing to play and ignoring Draven?\n\nWhen you say \"ignoring Draven\", do you mean muting him without saying anything or leaving him open but just not paying any attention to it? I usually just leave people unmuted and ignore them unless it reaches a point where I realise they're not going to stop and a mute is necessary. In regards to Katarina, encouragement is great and should be done. If she seems upset or handles the situation well then by all means I'll say something nice to her and the rest of the team to try and alleviate some of the stress.\n\nFor the past few days I've started trying to be excessively nice while in game to both my team and the enemy to see how people respond and how it influences play. It seems to have been going pretty well, so if people are having issues in that area then I definitely recommend just being as nice as possible, even if it's not sincere. Just as smiling while sad or in pain helps, being extra nice and polite in chat helps with playing better and improving teamwork.\n\nIf you don't mind sharing, what do you plan to do with these responses?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2016-02-27T07:16:46.834+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lol Detective episode 2: \n\nKat is the victim, and she has all our sympathies, most players will report Draven if they remember post game, and encourage Kat throughout.

The frustration of not being able to get stacks on mejais can be pretty demoralizing and it can cause you to try and kill steal your from your alliance in order to stack up.\n\nSolution-\n1.Try to convince the rest of the team\nTop lane, jungle and zyra to focus on the game at hand and make best of the situation as much as possible, which is to help katarina get stacks because from my experience she can snow ball the enemy early game and although she has deaths, she seems to have the basic idea of what the item can do for her. \n\n2.**If the above does not work out **\nTry to assemble the team to help draven because clearly he needs the most attention and seems to be the lowest on confidence, As we all know draven can snowball the enemy late game.\n\n3.**This option is if both draven and katarina fail to co-operate as a team.**\nTry to use the opportunity created by your teammates mistakes into your advantage by using your teammates as bait (this will apply in certain situations)\nIt is basically a 3 v 5 situation but your team members are not afk therefore it is very plausible to make this game go in your favor by making adjustments to your build to help you deal more damage.\n  \nAbuse is part of the game and is understandable to a certain extent but not continuous abuse, if it is continuous the best option is to mute the player and carry on with the game, However if the abuse carry's on after the game has ended the report is justified and should be reported for negative attitude and hate speech.\n\n4. **This option is applicable after the game is over and i have done this myself and was in a similar situation.**\nAfter the game was ended i asked the person in my team if he would like to play with me and promised him a win in the next game if he declined to play with me as an incentive.\n\nReason being it is always good to improve a persons skill and knowledge cap where it is lacking so that person may do the same thing for another person. We won the next game and he thanked me for my support and help.\n\n5. There are some people who are beyond help and intentionally throw games for fun or for reasons beyond my understanding, if you want to avoid being in the same game as these people you played last game then wait for at least 20-25 min for your next game or use oce.gg.op to search the username and check if he is in another game.( i have banned 9 people like this in 1 month for various other reasons)\n\nExtras-\nThese are the options that i know of and would apply if need be. I have been gifted 2 skins because i help people improve and win games. My skill cap is not high at all, neither my knowledge of the game however i do what i can to help others wherever and whenever possible. \n\nBonus Clip - Never give up!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=if43nT2_SX0","replies":[]},{"poster":"lyD","date":"2016-03-17T08:42:09.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd report the Zyra for responding to it too much...
