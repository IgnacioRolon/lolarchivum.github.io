In my mind there are one or two BIG things you did that lead to the loss and many many small things. I would like to see what you think these could be.\n\nOf course everyone made mistakes in the game, but for the purpose of staying productive the focus is going to be on Eonexus.\n\nSo I would like to hear your answers to the below questions, we can discuss and then I will share my thoughts and general observations while watching.\n\nWhen do you feel you were the strongest relative to other champions? Why?\n\nWhen do you feel you were weakest relative to other champions?

Also thunderlords triggers the healing portion of hextech gunblade ( +15% healing from all damage dealt) which gave me an extra heal during battles with riven. Due to the fact that thunderlords gains damage from both AD and AP a hybrid champ gains a decent damage output from it.\n\nI went triforce to counter balance my lack of mobility from taking thunderlords as opposed to stormraiders, it also adds 20% CDR, hp and a bit of damage, which allowed me to trade evenly with Riven until she started getting frequent ganks from every other lane. \n\nMy team were doing poorly in every other lane and when Jhin started ganking there was nothing i could do about him due to having no way of gap closing on a long ranged champ. While this was going on i was spamming pings and advising my team to aggressively shove their lanes to either a) force their laners back into their lanes, or b) to punish them to the point that they stopped roaming. I cant remember when i took the top inhibitor, but this was pretty much a solo effort from my lane, getting ganked continuously. I COULD have fallen back and lost lane pressure, but this wouldnt have allowed my team to do anything in their lanes.\n\nI knew i couldnt teamfight, so made an executive decision to attempt to \"pull aggro\" to allow my team to catch up.  Riven roamed bot and mid and picked up kills, during which i was smashing her lane. \n\n\nI feel i was exceedingly strong in laning phase, making it almost impossible for Riven to duel me in lane solo, requiring her to get ALOT of help from her teammates. I knew that Riven possessed a much stronger late game (with her execute ultimate etc) so was attempting to use my early game pressure to dominate her to the point of uselessness. unfortunately game dragged on too late and Riven became a nuisance to deal with late game.\n\nEnemy teams late game was considerably stronger than mine, and i dropped off accordingly \n\nI think applying pressure aggressively to a single lane and hammering it relentlessly forcing myself to get camped meant that it made openings that werent properly used by my teammates despite my (at times rather aggressive) suggesting.\n\nI suppose i could have roamed more than the few times i went to drag for the free pet, I decided against roaming due to other lanes being too fed and not liking my chances at being able to kill them.\n\nAlso remember this is just the logic of a low elo scrub, and i am open to all criticism that allows me to correct errors ive made and improve myself and my chances of winning (God knows i need all the help i can get)\n\nRegards\n\nEonexus","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-16T10:02:51.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/K6CxRyp.jpg\n\n16 minutes into the game, lane phase well but over. Score 13-14 gold within 500. How can you honestly say that you wouldn't win team fights and your team lost lane phase?\n\nAs for your build choices, its just inefficient. Why would you not take stormraiders then buy one of the most expensive items in the game to make up for it. Getting storm raiders and then going ludens + rylais. Would have been better.\n\nYou pretty much didn't go for drag from what I saw tbh. \n\nGenerally you should follow the build path of the best players and learn from them. You could have easily beat riven in lane (without Thunderlords), as she had no clue what she was doing against you as Morde.\n\nOne final question before I provide my view on this game.\n\nWhat do you feel you accomplished between 14:26 and 23:20?\n\nTake me through your thought process about the actions you took and why.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-03-16T10:14:48.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If thats what your keen eyes percieve, then i guess you should sell me your glasses.

If ANY of the squishies move out of line you immediately flash Q - E (alt W) - R - Ignite them. It is a guaranteed kill. If you get lucky and kill the jhin while he has his forth shot the ghost has the bonus move speed, will always crit and slows from the rylais.\n\nI can't tell you how many games I've played where doing the above wins a fight straight off the bat as you immediately turn it from 5v5 to 6v4.\n\nGood Luck!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-03-16T23:37:25.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check this out to, it will help you playing Mord mechanical wise.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et1UeeBsd7Y","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-03-17T01:28:49.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for the advice and the video, i get ganked quite often as top so trying to find an ap top that can 2 vs 1 relatively safely.

Definitely not fed.\n\nYou didn't fully answer my question. But I'm going to start a new comment chain with my observations and advice =D It's great that you are somewhat open to feedback.\n\nAs for builds. Im no Morde expert. But I would 100% go with what the challenger/master players are doing. (Also most times you killed Riven the extra atk speed was not required she came at you and was behind you most of the deaths haha).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-16T11:54:50.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so here is my analysis. This isn't everything as I don't want to overload but I'm going to provide 3 broad strokes things that REALLY need to be looked into and just a general list of observations I made while watching.\n\n**The three things**\n\n1) This is probably the BIGGEST thing to think about. **Which objectives you go for**\n\nThe reason I asked about that 9 minute period between 14:20 and 23:20 is because that is the time where the following happened;\n\na) You got 2nd turret at 14:20\nb) You got 4 kills and died 4 times\nc) You got 3rd turret at 23:20\nd) During those 9 minutes your team went from 300 gold down to 4.5k gold down\n\nYou invested 9 minutes of time running up top ignoring your team and trying to get a base turret. During this time the enemy took 3 turrets and got lots of team kills. I'm not saying its all on you. But what I am saying is you could have 100% used those 9 minutes WAYYY better.\n\nYour push was stalled multiple times by 1 champion. They then killed your teammates then came for you or killed you and then went for team mates.\n\nThere were other outer turrets to get, which you could have gotten in those 9 minutes. (I reckon you could have got at least 2 more towers during that time). From what I watched, you pretty much kept banging your head into a brick wall for 9 minutes while everything around you fell apart. You could have easily pushed with your team or even alone on other outer turrets and 2nd tier turrets.\n\nYou can't just AFK push one lane and expect to win. Unfortunately LoL requires more strategical thinking than that =P\n\n2) This probably is a smaller thing than 3) but I mention it first because I know you like split pushing. \n\n**When to push and vision control**\n\nI love split pushing, it makes the other teams HAVE to respond and can force errors in rotation and shot calling. But there are two things you need to do before you apply pressure in a side lane.\n\na) Set up vision so you can see when people are coming\nb) Set up your team to group and be ready to apply pressure at the SAME TIME\n\na) You spent majority of the game deep past the enemy red side jungle. You pretty much never warded it up or shifted your pink ward forward. You can't capitalize on bad rotations and shot calling if you cant see anything. You also will have unnecessary deaths because you don't know when to back off.\n\nb) is difficult, but its a crucial part. Otherwise the pressure you apply is wasted because they just come kill you and before you complain about shitty team mates you need to understand. If your team aren't in a position to pressure and you still make the decision to pressure alone that is the incorrect decision.\n\nside note - one of my pet peeves is when players blame their team mates for not being somewhere after they go in. Maybe their team mate should have been there. BUT the fact that they weren't there and you still went in knowing they weren't there is a MISTAKE/MISPLAY.\n\nThe BEST split pushers apply pressure, force a rotation, then BACK OFF without dying so they can keep the pressure up as soon as they leave. You can only do this if you have vision. \n\nThe BEST split pushers apply pressure at the same time their team is applying pressure. This is what forces other teams to choose and cause mistakes. If you're just applying pressure alone they just kill you and reset.\n\nThe biggest example is at 11:40 you used flash ult on riven (with no kill threat). Then you stayed to pressure top turret with no ult or vision or flash. Yasuo casually walks up and you die for no reason really. You could have made Yasuo waste time by making him rotate half way and then back off (with vision) but instead he gets the big payoff and walks back to lane stronger.\n\n3) **Teleport Plays**\n\nI think this comes from once again the fundamental lack of trust in others. But you can't just ignore the optimal play because you don't trust others. There were two teleport ganks you missed that could have snowballed your team at little cost to you.\n\nThe BIGGEST one was at 12:51 you could of at worst got dragon (with ulti btw) and bot tower and at best got double kill and both objectives. These plays are critical in pushing your advantage. (Especially because you were ahead at the time after that Riven literally gave you free kills by trying to fight you and just dying). You had Flash up there was a deep ward, they were over extended. It was the perfect opportunity to kill em, and get dragon and use dragon to get towers in mid and bot.\n\n**General observations**\n\nFirst 2 waves you only got 5 out of 12 cs\nEasy FB cause Riven doesn’t understand Morde dmg output\nOpportunity at 5:44 to TP bot for double kill\nNot a morde main, but probs coulda killed her or staved Riven off with earlier ult and better CD management\nOtherwise probably just needed to clear minion wave and back off tower, you werent going to get it at that point and staying without vision isnt ideal\nRiven just comes at you and gives you another free kill, once again showing the lack of experience against morde\n10 mins spent about 5 seconds watching bot for no reason (you had no TP?)\nNice first turret at 11 minutes\nUsed flash with no kill threat 11:40\nAt second turret with no vision got caught under turret no ult or flash\nAnother kill opportunity bot 12:51 but used tp back to lane. This was a big opportunity to trade top pressure for internal and bot tower\n13:48 Riven Tped bot and got a double kill\n14 minutes you got second turret (didn't get 3rd turret until 23:30! That's 9 minutes of extremely sub optimal contribution from you running top and dying mostly for 9 minutes)\nAnother free kill on Riven 15:46 \n16:11 you’re up to base turret with no vision on red and only Yasuo in vision\nGood assassinate onto karma\nDidn't put vision when you walked through their red side jungle though\nTeam got dragon at 17 minutes\nOpportunity to tp at 17:58 to secure a couple kills bot again.\n18: 39 misplayed 2v1 didnt use 3rd Q!","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-03-17T01:30:39.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for tghe in depth analysis,\n\nWhen you see it listed like that, i did a hell of alot wrong i didnt even realise :O, so thanks for that!,\n\nI think my major fear is trying to work out a team strategy in a 5 vs 5 in solo duo, when i cant gaurantee the team will lsiten, cant guarantee theyll focus the right target, get zoned, get scared and leave me in the front, theres alot more variables in TRUSTING a team, then treating it as a 5 vs 1. \n\nIf you can think of any ways to get past that mental block, id appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-03-17T02:44:24.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you just need to be at the right place at the right time. Don't think too much about it. When you've taken the first or second tower in your lane. It pays a lot to get the other outer turrets first before smashing your head at that base turret over and over.\n\nEach inner tower is easier for the opposing team to defend AND more powerful. So it pays to get some more resources level up a bit before you go that deep.\n\nIt's less about trust and more about adapting. Be in the right place at the right time. If your team screws up adjust accordingly. But them screwing up isn't a foregone conclusion especially when they are literally only 1 kill down (only 1 kill down AFTER Riven TPed to get a double kill). If they screw up you maybe get a kill or two and back off, if they do well you take a turret or dragon and back off. It's all about taking in the information and adjusting how you play based off it. League of Legends is fun because every game is different. You can't just play the same regardless of the situation.\n\nWe released this too it gives you some more to think about when it comes to attributes and skills that are required to be good at league.\n\nhttp://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/03/ask-riot-why-do-i-suck/","replies":[]}]}]}]}
