This post will talk about the voting and sorting features on the Boards.\r\n\r\nFirstly let's talk about the voting system:\r\n\r\nHopefully you have noticed that every discussion and comment now has a small number and a up and down arrow next to it.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5lnY8Hl.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/iIxcKoI.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rFHkAxE.png\r\n\r\nYou can vote on every discussion and comment, vote up if you think the discussion or comment adds value or vote down if you think the discussion or comment does not add value. Every vote up increases the number by one and every vote down decreases the number by one.\r\n\r\nTry and vote on every discussion you comment in or read. There's no science to it. Use your heart! It might be because you agree, or disagree. Maybe it made you laugh. It doesn't really matter why you vote, only that you do. You might be asking, \"why should I vote and what does this do?\" Good question.\r\n\r\nAs you may have noticed there are several ways to sort content. The most common of which are:Best, Hot, New, Recent. Each of these alter your experience by changing what content is displayed.\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FhUxVpy.jpg\r\n\r\n1. Best: Sorts all discussions with the most engagement (votes, views, comments, etc)\r\n\r\n2. Hot: Sorts newer discussions with the most engagement (votes, views, comments, etc)\r\n\r\n3. New: Sorts discussions by creation date\r\n\r\n4. Recent: Sorts discussions by most recent comment\r\n\r\nSo by voting on content you can influence what others see, depending on how they sort content. Please help us make the Boards better by interacting with content. It doesn't matter how you vote, only that you do!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-14T02:23:37.096+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Can we have some tweaks on the \"Hot\" sorting where the posts that get replies will get instantly moved to the very top of the sort? As you can see from the current top Hot post \"Phreaks Guide to Runes for season 5 2015\", while it has many views, the last comment to that thread was 2 hours ago (which isn't exactly \"hot\" anymore if you get what I mean). Well true hot sorting may take views into consideration I would like to see if the view count is placed lower or even at the bottom of the priority when the system is judging on the sorting.\n\n2. Can we also have the ability to attach multiple files and pictures per post, and the ability to place the attached picture anywhere on the post? I get that we can do it with link placing (where you can place the link anywhere you like with picture showing) but that would be absurd to ask picture collector/posters to save not the pictures but the url address of where the pics are found. Also I find it annoying that you can not attach picture in Edit mode which imo should have.\n\n3. Can we also have resizable picture showing instead of small icons? Any picture with words written on it most of the time you need to click to make it tolerable to view, it breaks the immersion of picture viewing and generally the flow of the post.\n\n4. The quote redirection link, sometimes when people quote, you wanna find out why that quote is here and what it stands for. That's where the redirection link/arrow comes in to solve the problem. It's quite useful to have I would say.\n\n5. If you jump between different LoL region (whether board, forum archive, news, etc), the \"region\" that the site was dictated to will sometimes change to your last region visited, which is annoying I would like to see it fixed. For example, I logged in on OCE (English), and later I went to say NA, sometimes it will change my region to \"North America (English)\" upon refreshing or creating a post, which will cause my last post to simply be lost. Of course it is simply solved by changing the region back but I have to do so often it kinda hurts the experience.\n\nHere are most of my feedbacks I have on Board from my quite extensive use lately. I would truly appreciate if these problems I run into can be addressed and hopefully solved or worked around in one way or another.","replies":[{"poster":"Tamat","date":"2015-01-14T05:00:48.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Can we have some tweaks on the \"Hot\" sorting where the posts that get replies will get instantly moved to the very top of the sort?

The algorithm  considers a number of different variables to determine placement as this post points out. It will optimize itself as there is more posting and voting activity; you guys have an impact on how it's optimized over time.\n\n> Can we also have the ability to attach multiple files and pictures per post, and the ability to place the attached picture anywhere on the post? \n\nWe're actually talking about removing attachments altogether. There are so many hosting services for images and video. It probably makes less sense to try and do that well, and more sense to improve the embedly functionality.\n\n> If you jump between different LoL region (whether board, forum archive, news, etc), the \"region\" that the site was dictated to will sometimes change to your last region visited, which is annoying I would like to see it fixed. \n\nWe agree that this is annoying. We're working on improving this as we speak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-14T04:46:55.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\n1. \"Recent: Sorts discussions by most recent comment\" is that what you're after?\n\nas for the rest I will forward on those ideas but IF they are considered it will definitely take time to develop","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2015-01-16T14:21:03.256+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i get lost too easily on the boards i used to be super active on the forums and loved the layout. Now if i post something on here it gets lost because i don't know where i posted it. Bloody hell i probably wont be able to find this comment because i find it so confusing. Also why doesn't the top change at all it's always the same if something new is posted shouldn't it be at the top? and if i do want something at the top why can't i give it x votes to get it up to the top quickly because  it hurts my eyes to actually scroll through the entire page because the writting clashes to much with the background.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-16T23:21:12.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, \n\nI will be creating a different sticky about other Boards features soon but thought I would give you the quick low down on how to do some of the things you mentioned.\n\n**Finding your own comments and posts**: With the boards its actually easier to keep track of your past comments and/or if someone has replied to one of them!\n\nCheck out the picture below; \n\n**A**: If you click your summoner icon (A) it will take you to **your profile** with a list of all past discussions and comments you have created from newest to oldest!
