This was an error on my behalf and I have closed the two voting polls.\n\nI have reached out to the artists and cosplayers to discuss what the best solution might be for this situation. After some discussion we have landed on using an internal panel to judge the winners.\n\nIt seems like player voting in general is not very popular among the content creators and I will take on all the feedback into consideration to make sure future contests are a better experience for everyone =D\n\nApologies for any inconveniences this may have caused and stay tuned to see the winners.\n\nWe will aim to release the winners announcement for both contests on the 13th of February.\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/jOpLbiGmHR9S0/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-09T13:51:51.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol content creators don't want everyone judging their content.","replies":[{"poster":"Beartime234","date":"2017-02-10T00:20:36.867+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that was it. Seemed that people were annoyed cause people were spam voting for certain people as all you had to do was remove your cookies. Which is easily done in incognito mode. It felt like some people had more fake votes then others and I mean that's just not a fair competition. I think the rational content creators want people too see there stuff or else they wouldn't put it out there.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-10T07:34:18.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My issue is more with the fact that riot can't even host a proper survey, not with the fact that it's being abused and whatnot.\n\nI mean if riot leaves open a competition that gives out RP, why the fuck can't they use something that can't be abused to take votes?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyoton","date":"2017-02-10T09:22:47.127+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've used woobox before for contests that gave out even higher prizes ^^ but it only got abused now because people could see the votes and see that incognito was working to get more votes. It was an honest mistake on the host's part(there was an error in configuring the contest), but you cant expect them to have forseen the spam voting that would occur, since it never happened  before when they used the same system for voting before. Its good that they managed to confess that there was an error, and take action and listen to the contestants' pleas at least :).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shiafira","date":"2017-02-10T02:17:13.338+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as one of the shortlisted artists, i can say that i dont mind everyone judging my entry, i myself can see a lot of flaws in my own entry and would gladly receive constructive feedback\ni think the issue is spamvoting and it was quite obvious the most 'popular' entries had a large number of fake votes, mine included\nfrankly this makes the competition very unfair and flawed, it made the polls a question of who had the most people repeatedly voting on incognito, rather than the actual popularity/skill/concept of the entry itself","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lebronze5 James","date":"2017-02-13T10:11:51.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So who won?","replies":[{"poster":"Gabbu","date":"2017-02-13T10:21:18.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've been stressed out all day waiting for the announcement but i dont think it's coming today :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aresdescendant","date":"2017-02-10T09:47:40.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^_^ best gif ever.
