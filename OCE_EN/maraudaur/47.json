I've never been in B5 so I can't speak to the accuracy of the claims there, and I only ever played ranked with a duo. There were games where I encountered toxic behaviour between B3 and G5, but it was maybe 6 or 7 tops out of 100.\n\nI think it largely comes down to where and when you are playing. You are more likely to encounter it on weekends and late afternoons than you are during weekdays for example.\n\nI agree that many of the claims are largely exaggerated, but if you end up playing consistently in those times when toxicity is higher, in a tier where flaming is much more common, it is quite possible you would see toxicity fairly often. 9 out of 10 is most likely a pretty big exaggeration, but I'd believe 1 in 3 some days.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ąngel","date":"2016-03-28T07:00:51.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not necessarily.\nI feel like for the most part that is very true.\nBut I just had a game where 2 players told me to kill myself, and that I was a nub, and the loss was 100% my fault.

We are working on creating a new champion select experience to blind pick as well, but it will take a bit of time.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/Mc1nPqMw-new-champion-select-coming-to-ranked-soon\n> \n> It is coming to Ranked soon and the plan is for it to replace Blind Pick sometime in the future.\n\nJust to add to the behaviour displayed in this game.\n\n1) You should never intentionally feed, it creates a terrible experience for your team and also ruins the game for the other team. Here is how I usually handle situations where the game is a clear loss, or other players are at each others throats. I play to the best of my ability, I practice mechanics, farming, vision control etc I turn the game into a purely learning experience and focus solely on myself. Even when a game is going bad in all the wrong ways, at the end of the day I still enjoy playing LoL, I still enjoy playing the champion I have picked, and this mentality helps me a lot to bring out enjoyment and experience even in extremely frustrating experiences.\n\n2) The behaviour displayed by the others in your team is also not okay, I hope you reported them after game.\n\n3) Please try to keep in mind 2 wrongs do not make a right. Just because others are behaving badly doesn't mean you should as well.
