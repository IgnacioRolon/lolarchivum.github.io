Sorry to hear that you and your friends weren't able to participate in this event, but hopefully we'll be seeing your entries in the upcoming contests!\n\nCheers, \nWuks\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hyojeong","date":"2016-06-22T10:19:11.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"2nd xD","replies":[]}]}
