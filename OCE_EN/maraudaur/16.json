Its a good opportunity to run fun icebreakers/events before and after the show or even during breaks in the night.\r\n\r\nIf you have any other questions make sure to comment below!","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-18T07:46:51.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would do this if I could, but I love in a small town with like 10 people who play league XD.\n\nIf I just buy ALOT of alcohol, can I have this viewing party in my own house? \nRiot members can join me in some lovely beverages.","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2016-03-18T08:09:00.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure those 10 people would love to get together to watch some League!

So any suggestions for events that could be held throughout the year would be ideal.  A lot of it comes down to the timing of the license and the timing of the games, as well as the hours of regular trade for our other customers.","replies":[]}]}
