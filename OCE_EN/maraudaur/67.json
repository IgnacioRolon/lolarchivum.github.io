You)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoners\r\n\r\nThis year, we&#039;re focused on building more stable communications between ~DESIGN TEAMS~ (over in NA) and all you beautiful players out there. This means more iteration and experiments to see what works and what doesn&#039;t, as well as more dedicated feedback sessions to see what you&#039;re interested in as we move along. Today we&#039;re unveiling one such experiment, creatively titled the Live Gameplay Q+A. Let&#039;s get down to bronze tacks.\r\n\r\n**So what is this thing?**\r\nGlad you asked! Simply put, players submit questions in this discussion, after which we gather the Live team, fish a couple of responses out of the ol&#039; mailbag and put together a blog-style response to be posted here for your consumption every few weeks.\r\n\r\n**What kind of questions are we talkin&#039; about here?**\r\nAs our name suggests, we&#039;re only really able to shed light on topics related to Live Gameplay - luckily, that comes with the broad definition of almost everything in the game. Systems, items, and champion balance? You got it! Skins, servers, and player support tickets? not so much.\r\n\r\n**Can i just ask questions at any time?**\r\nDue of the large amount of questions to keep track of, we&#039;re focusing on set collection periods where we&#039;ll actively monitor your submissions. We&#039;ll post in advance when these periods begin and end, as well as keep track on the official page itself.\r\n\r\nThe first collection period runs from May 4th to May 10th - hey, that&#039;s right now!\r\n\r\nPost your questions below and they might be picked to be answered by the Live Gameplay team!","replies":[{"poster":"Aegis","date":"2015-05-05T08:29:38.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering what are the chances of a Galio  rework {{champion:3}} ?\n\nCurrently he does have some underlying problem in his kit, but he isn't played enough to be widely known yet. \n\nFirstly his passive encourages him to be building some sort of MR every game. However if this is blind pick, Galio's passive may not be so useful as AD teams. His passive is one of the major reasons why people pick him against mages just because of how much free stats he can get. However the passive doesn't fit his theme of 'guardian' all too well  and I think it needs to change so Galio players may feel more comfortable picking him into a wider variety of match ups.\n\nSecondly and the most important aspect that needs to change is his Bulwark (W). Galio gets heal _every time_ he is damaged, not _how much_ he was damaged. This causes only a one way interaction in the favour of Galio against mages that utilises DoTs. For example, Brand can't use his abilities on Galio due to Brand's passive letting Galio overheal the damage. Morgana pool turns into a bath for Galio as he can sit in there to heal and this discourages her from using it to clear waves. This lets Galio to shrug off any harass and creates a one way interaction where Galio can be the only one harassing his enemy.\n\nAnother interesting idea would be letting his E slow enemy champions who run _against_ the direction of the wind. It lets Galio help out allies from a distance and it would be a cool idea for enemy champions to feel like they are running against a harsh wind. Perhaps this mechanic could be extended to help slow some skillshots though I think it is extrapolating the idea a bit too far.\n\nWhat do you guys think of my points about for Galio? Does the live team understand some of the problems Galio can pose? Are we going to have some fixes to those?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-05-05T06:58:14.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if this falls under Live Gameplay, or another department ( Development / Design? )\n\nIn late Season 2, we saw a Beta version of League of Legends Replays hit the PBE. After 2 weeks, it was taken down. We've had absolutely nothing since, and it seems Riot won't even acknowledge anyone that asks about it.\n\nIs there ANYTHING at all you can tell us about this. Us content creators are so damn hopeful that it releases soon.\n\nCheers.\n~J","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-05-05T01:46:58.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the latest rework onto Ryze, his win rate has **plummeted** from upwards of 50% down to even 37% in mid lane and 41% in the top lane. \nThat is a massive win rate drop and there is _only so much you can blame on the part of people re learning the hero_. \nIn my experience playing the new Ryze his spell kit, though seemingly interesting and cool by design provides no real easy feeling for using your Overload.\nHis itemisation has been altered due to the ultimate passive providing CDR also. Ryze as a whole just feels too limited by a forced playstyle.\nwhat is the next move with Ryze?\nDo you change the Q, maybe even alter the ultimate to not give CDR?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-05T01:40:13.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the surge in League of tanks and Smite/TP top laners, are we going to be seeing a nerf in the strength of cinderhulk or do you guys think this is healthy to the game?\n\nAlso with the surge in people using Black Cleaver (especially ones that become stupid with it) is there a plan for nerfs on this, and are we getting a brutalizer item to replace the Black Cleaver like path from Brut? (as this has put me off a few of my early rush brut top laners.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ModBrat","date":"2015-05-05T01:37:06.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have really never liked the way that spell shields work with zenith blade and similar spells, I feel that if you black shield or Sivir spell shield it Leona should not fly to you?!\n\n\nSimilar to Nami vs Thresh matchup, if thresh is about to throw his hook and I land a bubble pre-emptively his hook flys out at me from the bubble and hooks me to my death?? Have you ever tried to through a chain in a bubble.... It's really hard..\n\n\nFantastic rework on Ryze!! Best rework yet! ..... Sorry... No Sion was the best but Ryze is definitely the second best (Ashe depending)\n\n\nIs there a possibility of a master skin through the new champion mastery system?? Cause that would be kewl <3\n\n\nIn pre5 there was talk of a rune rework, I really hope that the idea I saw posted by riot during season 4 comes to fruition! Where eg. red = multiplyer blue = utility\n\n\n Will there ever be a league voice chat system or in game voice chat as this is something I direly need :) good way to meet and bond with people, or even a league endorsed preferred third party chat :)\n\n\nSee you at the OPL finals \n\n\nSo long and thanks for all the memories\n\nModbrat","replies":[]},{"poster":"KillerPotato","date":"2015-05-05T00:51:37.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we bound to see some Hecarim and Sejuani nerfs sooner or later?
