We&rsquo;ve gone through scenes of betrayal, redemption, discovery, mystery and much much more. Now we want to see how you&rsquo;ve interpreted the vistas and experiences our champions have gone through. We want you to depict a scene from one of the stories from our recent Shurima lore releases.\n\nHaven&rsquo;t had a chance to read some of the lore yet? Check it out here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/shurima/intro \n\nThere are a lot of cool scenes we want to see illustrated, below are a few examples;\n> \n>  &ldquo;Whispering winds from the heart of the desert speak of mighty cities rising from the earth, of a golden warrior marching at the head of an army of sand.&rdquo;\n>  \n>  &ldquo;Xerath stood in the shadow of the monolithic Sun Disc, knowing that an empire-destroying doom was but seconds away.&rdquo;\n>  \n>  &ldquo;The dawn sun reflected blindingly off Azir&#039;s flawless golden armor. In that instant, he knew that the traitor still lived. He sensed the magus&rsquo;s essence in the air that he breathed.\n>  \n>  Azir lifted a hand, and an army of his elite warriors rose from the sands at the base of the Stairs of Ascension.&rdquo;\n>  \n>  &ldquo;Stars guided the pair&rsquo;s sojourn across the desiccated expanse. The old jackal no longer wore the armor of the Ascended. The golden monuments lay buried with the past. Now a hermit dressed in tattered fabric, Nasus scratched at his matted fur before slowly raising his head to observe the night sky.&rdquo;\n\n**How winners will be selected?**\nWe&rsquo;ll select the shortlist based on the quality of the submission, originality of the piece and whether the entry follows the contest rules! Players will then get to vote and decide who the 10 winners are.\n\n**Dates**\nEntry submissions open now and close 20th of June at 12:30 PM AEST\nThe shortlist will be announced on the 22nd of June and voting will close on the 24th of June with the top 10 winners announced once votes are counted.\n\n**Submission methods**\n[Woobox ](http://woobox.com/3wbdsx)\nPublic Twitter/Facebook/Instagram post with the hashtag &ldquo;#ShurimaArt&rdquo;\n\n**Prizes**\nShortlisted entries will get - 10 Hextech chests and keys\nTop 10 voted will get - Taliyah Skin OR Mystery Skin + 5 more hextech chests and keys \n\nRules\nhttps://woobox.com/offers/rules/3wbdsx\n\nIf you have any questions after reading the rules let me know in the comments below!","replies":[{"poster":"Sarge","date":"2016-05-25T03:40:08.218+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=GV39d3IN,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-24T02:38:59.448+0000)\n\n> \n> If you have any questions after reading the rules let me know in the comments below!\n\nHi Marauder, I've read the rules and looked at the proper channels to submit my work, but I would really appreciate your personal unbias feedback on my work so far.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/5a4b0b24efb2dccc4988923030546507\n\nIts more of a literal interpretation of the lore - let me know your thoughts / constructive critisisms before I submit my final version through Woobox.\n\nCheers\nSarge","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-25T06:26:20.024+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"WOW\n\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/YVOgV17Hqyvte/giphy.gif\n\nI give it a 5/7","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zwby520","date":"2016-05-25T04:45:13.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, I hope you win mate!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Skyrays","date":"2016-06-21T00:26:33.488+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, I just messed up hard. :< More or less devastated.\n\nI didn't realize the deadline was in Austrialian hours (AEST) as opposed to the server I'm on, NA â€” east coast, midwest, or west coast: I thought AEST was short for \"American Eastern Standard Time\" (I know, that was silly on retrospect). All in all, I found out about this contest extremely late, hereby in my company is a work of art without a functional Woobox link for submission.\n\nIs there by any means or measure to still submit my piece?

And also I read that the maximum file size is 5mb... Which is gonna be a problem cause I completely missed that part and rushed to make my entry and so I ended up starting on a really big high res canvas on Photoshop (6gb at the moment) which I'm guessing will probably be 50-100mb when I save the final in .jpeg form and it's kinda too late to restart.
