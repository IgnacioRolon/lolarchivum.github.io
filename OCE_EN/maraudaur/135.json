As a uni student playing in that competition, I found it really enjoyable especially with the team ranked and the feeling that you are vsing other uni students like yourself. One thing which would be cool if these things were more frequent or lasted longer (If I am wrong and there are more competitions like this send me a link). So my idea is that the universities could have their own little LSC style tournament which would last a month or two, maybe even longer. I feel it could be  a bit complicated to do with heaps of teams wanting to enter so maybe limit 1 team per Uni. But I can imagine how cool it would be to play more games against other universities. But it's just an idea. {{summoner:31}}  {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-03T23:46:00.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"More competition within unis and between other unis sounds like a cool idea!
