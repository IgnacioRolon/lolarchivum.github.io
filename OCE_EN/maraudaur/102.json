I hope we can continue to talk about epic plays, gameplay balance and the future of League in 2017.\r\n\r\nI hope you all have a great holiday period filled with family, friends and LoL! Happy Snowdown!\r\n\r\nCheck out this thread if you&#039;re feeling generous this season - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Qd5clEbX-secret-santa\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a throw back to the old days - credit to [DntEatYellwSnw\r\n](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=1638747)\r\n\r\nTwas the night before Snowdown, when all through the land\r\nNot a champion was fighting, though a battle was planned\r\nThe potions were bought by a snowy drift\r\nAs a voice called out, Welcome to Summoner&rsquo;s Rift\r\n\r\nAt bottom went Sona, followed by Vayne\r\nReady to last hit, while causing some pain\r\nThey hid in the jungle, to guard the wraiths\r\nFor, in their jungler, they needed great faith\r\n\r\nBy blue buff there stood, both top and mid\r\nLittle did they know, that&rsquo;s where Shaco hid\r\nBeing sneaky, getting prepared to steal\r\nBlue buff his goal, but ready to kill\r\n\r\nThat voice then called, on minions to spawn\r\nAs the battle commenced, each a summoner pawn\r\nAhri did leash, and Garen helped too\r\nWhile Shaco prepared, to smite steal blue\r\n\r\nHe blinked and he stealthed, at the same time\r\nInvading the camp, being quite sublime\r\nHe laid down his smite, stole the Blue\r\nWhilst back stabbing Riven, getting first blood too\r\n\r\nAs he ran, he cackled out taunts and jeers\r\nSprinting away, as his boxes did fear\r\nTwas not the greatest, of starts for my team\r\nThough this fight was not over, for revenge I did scream\r\n\r\nI respawned and bounded back to the fray\r\nWith ganks, and mias, I redeem myself today\r\nI ran to my red buff, hands sweaty and shaking\r\nDid he steal this as well? Ripe for the taking?\r\n\r\nI breathed a sigh, deep with relief\r\nRed Buff still stood, no sign of the Jester thief\r\nYet, I felt a twinge, a burning intuition\r\nSo I laid down my ward, and got into position\r\n\r\nLo and behold, Shaco came running\r\nStill I did stand, silent and cunning\r\nHe began to steal red buff, quite unawares\r\nAt the right moment, I caught him unprepared\r\n\r\nThus I stole Red back, whilst gaining the Blue\r\nI held my hands high, grabbing gold and xp too\r\nNow it was time to finish my route\r\nFollowed by mid gank, while hopping about\r\n\r\nI helped Ahri, to kill their mid Brand\r\nThis is where it starts, we take our stand\r\nI strolled down to bot lane, and pinged their support\r\nFlashed In and stunned him, their plan I did thwart\r\n\r\nThen came Sona, followed by Vayne\r\nPinning and shooting, Ali&rsquo;s life did drain\r\nAnd Caitlyn tried, her best to survive\r\nBut at full health, we decided to dive\r\n\r\nThis netted, a Vayne double kill\r\nGJ&rsquo;s and TY&rsquo;s, were given as goodwill\r\nAnd so our Vayne, got quite the lead\r\n&ldquo;GG, noob bot&rdquo; their top lane decreed\r\n\r\nAs the game approached 20 minutes\r\nA surrender vote, the enemy submitted\r\nIt passed unanimous, 5 votes to none\r\nThe nexus exploded, we had finally won\r\n\r\nAnd so goes the tale, of a battle before Snowdown\r\nWhere enemies battle, in a final showdown\r\nDon&rsquo;t ever despair, no matter what the odds\r\nAnd pray for victory, to the matchmaking Gods","replies":[{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2016-12-24T09:47:51.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I hope we can continue to talk about epic plays, *gameplay balance* and the future of League in 2017\n\nDelete Syndra R from game,\n\nKind regards, a sad ADC main","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-12-24T15:46:25.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's Christmas (2 hours ago)\n\nIt's 2:47am atm.\nCY@ on d rift boi :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-24T11:20:34.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wheres the tl;dr bro.
