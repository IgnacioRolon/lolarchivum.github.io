Watching League of the big screen is an amazing experience, especially to be in a room filled with like-minded fans. It is a shame about the merch, but it wouldn't be be viable in a logistics sense for Riot to send stuff to each cinema. Hey Maraudaur, instead of that though, any chance Hoyts attendees could get a discount at the Riot merch store (if that's even a possibility)?","replies":[{"poster":"Friezy2402","date":"2015-10-12T23:11:25.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i understand that :/ just got over excited on my part, and yeah im sure i will love it, i will be backing SKT want history to be made, first team to win worlds twice","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-10-08T22:34:30.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the link for the [facebook event ](https://www.facebook.com/events/1001035769907992/)for the Silicon Sports experience. \n\nViewing eSports on the big screen is a pretty fun & comfortable experience.
