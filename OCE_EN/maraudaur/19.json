Woobox was used for all ocean week contests and the opl one but the issue of spam voting has only come to light now, as we are able to see the amount of votes and the drastic numbers and differences. The facebook voting was more effective but it still made the competition a matter of popularity rather than skill. I agree that riot should be the ones choosing the winners from now on, but even so, i have seen people who have been deserving of being in the shortlist, and they didnt get in.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-02-09T09:43:13.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Hyoton, \n\nThanks for providing your feedback. I would be interested to hear about how you and the others feel we should pick winners in the future.\n\nArt is quite subjective and with the awesome varying art styles you all have it is difficult to pin down an objective judging method for all the different styles. This is why in the past we have allowed our players to vote, we try to mitigate the popularity aspect of it by raising awareness in our client (lots of players voting who may not know any artists, vs just the artists friends voting).\n\nWould you all prefer an internal panel? or do you like the voting part and just want something that has no loop holes?","replies":[{"poster":"Khronix","date":"2017-02-09T10:05:22.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I just checked the votes lol thats an insane number even the shurima one which was more popular didnt even get that much people voting.

That said, most of the winners so far I've had no problem with (though just like Hyoton I have noticed 1 or 2 each contest that I feel don't really deserve to be in the top number). Personally, I've enjoyed the Facebook voting system the best. While it's not fool-proof it's mostly fair/transparent, not to mention it's really easy for players to just casually find and browse the artwork, plus I really like that I can vote for other pieces that I think are really good and not just my own.","replies":[{"poster":"Candlestic","date":"2017-02-10T08:49:08.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other thing with an internal panel is it would kind of make the shortlist redundant and in my very biased opinion I would be sad to see that go.","replies":[{"poster":"Khronix","date":"2017-02-11T08:53:59.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how they are trying to get the community involved with the voting but after some thought I feel like maybe an internal panel would be more efficient in judging future comps resulting in quicker contest results. Not to sound like douchebag or anything but I think most of us realize that the top 3-10 or whatever is pretty much decided even before the voting and the shortlist is really just to show recognition and to reward the people who \"tried\" a little bit harder than everyone else who didn't make it... OK maybe there's a better and nicer way to say that but yea thats just my opinion. Like every contest I see I can already make out the winners list before the votes are even cast and yea it is sad and disheartening to see when my work doesn't make it but I guess that's just more motivation for the next comp right? But mostly the reason as to why I think that an internal panel would be the best option is to rid us of that bitter feeling when \"certain\" works make it higher than it really deserves during the voting process which idk makes me feel really bad about myself for being so judgemental.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiafira","date":"2017-02-13T03:15:31.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i cant really say i agree, personally its hard for me to see whose going to win\ntheres always submissions which look absolutely amazing to me but dont get voted in the top 3, and vice versa\ni agree that an internal panel would make the shortlist redundant, i enjoy seeing all the entries anyway since everyone has such different approaches to the same brief/contest \nit is depressing when you dont make it but if you focus on having a more positive mindset, its all a journey of growth & theres always next contest to strive for :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hyoton","date":"2017-02-09T10:05:16.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for being open to feedback, i've seen some good changes to the competitions over the years that have prevented art theft (the competition criterias have become more specific and unique to the oce community since the first ocean week contest) as a result of the surveys that were sent out :). I personally would prefer an internal voting panel for this occasion if the competition is to be recasted, since it would be embarassing for contestants to have to share it again to their friends if a voting was reheld.
