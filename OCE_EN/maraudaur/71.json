Last post, we asked oyu to share their greatest League story, whatever it might be. This time, we&#039;ve narrowed it down to a few types of tales in particular:\r\n \r\nDo you ever fight your inner demons in game, after [missing an easy skillshot](http://imgur.com/gallery/l4hH7oP) or [struggling to keep your ADC safe](http://imgur.com/7HiVka1)? Tell us about how your perspective has changed while playing League.\r\nAs a gamer, how does your League life influence your IRL? (we&rsquo;d love to hear from the ladies here, especially).\r\nSubmissions are welcome from all regions!\r\n \r\nWhatever your story is, tell us why your&rsquo;s is different than any other. We&#039;re looking for only the most unique and extraordinary. Even if you aren&rsquo;t the protagonist, share with us at playerstories-rg@riotgames.com or in the comments below.","replies":[{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-02-09T18:39:24.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had my fair share of struggles in life (they include depression, anxiety, and being a trans woman) so League has always been an escape for me.\nWhen everything seemed like it was crumbling around me League gave me something to focus on and it helped to block everything else out.
