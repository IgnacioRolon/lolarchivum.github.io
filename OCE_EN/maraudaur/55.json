One of the tools that we&#039;ve implemented to facilitate that is voting. Voting is incredibly important for a number of reasons and you should do more of it.\r\n\r\n1. Voting controls how content is sorted in &quot;Best&quot; and &quot;Hot&quot; views. While it&#039;s not the only factor in placement - it&#039;s a significant contributor. When you vote on something you&#039;re validating, (or invalidating), the quality of the content and subsequent discussion - and hopefully increasing the quality of the experience for those who come after you.\r\n\r\n2. Voting tells us what you care about. The goal of the boards is to provide you with the most relevant content. The more rich and robust information we have about voting patterns, the better we&#039;re going to be able to tune the sorting systems.\r\n\r\n**How you should vote:** My view - Vote with your heart. Ultimately knowing the impact of a vote - means when you cast that vote you&#039;re making a claim about whether content is worth seeing or a discussion is worth having. You should not vote based simply on whether you agree or disagree with a point that&#039;s made.\r\n\r\n**Questions to you:** Do you view voting the same way? What are some things that you think we can do to encourage more voting","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-10T01:24:10.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I choose not to vote as I view it in recent, so it's in bump order. voting has no impact on the way I view content.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-11-10T12:12:59.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\nThere's really not that much meaningful content on the OCE Forums anyway. Don't be lazy and just get a Rioter from each department to read through each thread in their relevant Forum Section that has more than 10 or so replies - maybe 5 on a slow day.\n\nNot to mention, I sort by Recent so that the discussions are still somewhat ongoing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-10T04:32:55.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesnt matter what you vote for, if you tread the line of controversy your shit will just get removed. everything else has already been said or banned. i vote for there to be as much leniency on the boards as there is on youtube. maybe less death threats. who'd have thought simply promoting the unified speech of the single main language of this region on the boards and in the game could be considered racism....the PC is strong","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-10T02:43:30.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^ Same with me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-10T00:29:20.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dem Votes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MarcSHOT","date":"2015-11-10T06:13:51.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Voting is a horrible feature - anyone that regulars the boards views it in 'recent' so that you can see whats new. Because people don't vote the hot/new/featured or whatever doesn't work, becuase it doesn't work people don't vote. Vicious cycle, but you were warned changing OCE from forums to Boards would be bad for online discussion. You did it anyway. \n\nif you say anything controversial you get flagged/deleted. So who cares.\n\nYou made your bed, lie in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-10T01:43:54.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I too view the content in recent so I don't see the impact of votes but I still vote if  I feel there's something that needs attention.","replies":[]}]}
