I'm steering towards  Zelda or Star Guardian Janna for a group cosplay for my next convention :) I do hope to do Katarina one day when I'm more comfortable with my body however.\n\nAnd yes! I have thought about doing PP Leona, if I ever have a beach event to go to I'll probably get stuck into making her :)\n\nThanks for the comment!","replies":[{"poster":"KIWl","date":"2017-03-17T08:25:43.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha Zelda sounds awesome, SG Janna might be tricky but should be a bit of fun! Well you're out to have fun, and so are the other cosplayers so I wouldnt worry - besides the cosplays are awesome work so far, you could pull Katarina off if you want to!\n\nA pool party event would be wicked! I'd love to try out PP Draven or Lee Sin if that event ever came around. Probably lee, don't think I could grow the mo.\n\nBest of luck to you!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Debatable Plays","date":"2017-03-14T04:32:09.336+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"cosplay mordekaiser","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miiiiiiiiiiiiing","date":"2017-03-14T12:39:09.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gabbu","date":"2017-03-14T23:00:16.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-16T12:28:06.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your camera angles need work, but well done.","replies":[{"poster":"Gabbu","date":"2017-03-17T01:50:40.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh thanks? why do you think my angles need work lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-17T03:22:30.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gabbu,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=90Thgil5,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2017-03-17T01:50:40.901+0000)\n>\n> uh thanks? why do you think my angles need work lmao\n\nMainly the Nasus one, the angle should have been down so you tower over.
