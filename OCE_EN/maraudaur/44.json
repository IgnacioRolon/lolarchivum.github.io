There are a few reasons why we intentionally did not include any sort of progress indicators:\n1.) As to your point, we didn't want to focus the system on the \"grind\". We want your honor level to improve over the course of the season as you play sportsmanlike games. Giving you a number to anchor on would shift the focus away from just playing good games.\n\n2.) We holistically evaluate behavior over time behind the scenes using some pretty crazy algorithms to determine when a player levels up. It doesn't work super well as a progress indicator that we show to a player, and if we did, it would probably be more confusing than helpful.\n\n3.) We wanted a few discrete levels that have enough space to be meaningful, but over the course of a season, if you had a progress indicator, you might feel that you were making so little progress per game that seeing the progress could actually feel bad. We could inflate the number of levels to counteract this, but that felt really unnecessary.\nHopefully that clarifies it a bit!\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-27T06:12:22.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice work lvl 3 honourees!\nI hope to see you in my games sometime ^^\n\nMy favourite thing about honour _(sarcasm)_ is this:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ae800babae897574cd6362bdbe466477.png\n\n**Hmmmm do I honour my pre-made... or my other pre-made.... _(RIP 3v3)_**\n\nAlso playing games with more than 1 pre-made means that you are almost guaranteed to **never** get the end-game leaf, and also means you get less chance of getting honour In general. Because honours mean absolutely zilch if they are from pre-mades, so honouring your friend _(even if they are actually really positive, which is a lot of the time BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T PLAY WITH THEM OTHERWISE)_ feels shit because you know it doesn't help them at all.\n\nSo my friends and I have a partly unspoken agreement that we just don't honour each other, because it means nothing and feels shit when your honour is wasted.\n\nand because theres usually 2 or 3 of us on at a time, we pretty much end up dictating which of the two randoms gets the leaf, _(which feels wrong)_.\n\n_______\n\nBut to end on a positive note, my favourite thing about honour _(not sarcasm)_ is the feeling you get when you honour someone, and know that in 2 or 3 seconds when it pops up on their screen, that they'll get a nice fuzzy feeling. :P","replies":[{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-07-28T08:50:29.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT HONOUR 3 YET, I'LL KILL YOU.\n\nOUT OF EVERYONE I KNOW, YOU PROBABLY DESERVE IT THE MOST","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-29T01:29:39.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha I play with too many pre-mades to get honours.\n\nso theres only like 1 or 2 people that can honour me, and my friends are really nice people so they get a fair share of the honours haha.\n\nIts weird that the system punishes you for playing with honourable people xD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-27T09:53:45.489+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay I am at Level 3!
