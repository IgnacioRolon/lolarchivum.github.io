We know a lot of players have wanted an alternate normal experience from Blind Pick where it is possible to  select your preferred roles and ban your most hated match ups (bye bye Yasuo, Zed, Blitz, Darius) without having to put your LP on the line or competing in a &ldquo;fastest fingers first&rdquo; duel to secure your role.\n\nTo date, we have held back from enabling Normal Draft on the OCE servers due to our server size and the effects that an additional queue would have on queue times, autofill rates and overall usage. However we think with recent improvements in champ select speed and experience plus matchmaking improvements we can give players an opportunity to test Normal Draft and see if it is a viable option in Oceania.\n\nWe will be running a limited test in Oceania for one month to gauge interest and see how Normal Draft works on our server. We will be keeping an eye on the health of Normal Draft queue as well as how it affects the other queues we already have enabled.\n\nWe will be looking at queue times, auto fill rates, dodge rates and overall usage to determine how viable Normal Draft is for OCE. We will be providing an update half way into the test period and also a recap of how it went at the end of the test period.\n\nWe will be enabling Normal Draft on the OCE server **between 21/09/2017 &ndash; 19/10/2017**. During this period, it will be live from **Thursday to Sunday**, **between 6pm &ndash; 11pm AEST (AEDT from 1st October)**. It will also be the default selected queue (instead of Blind Pick) when it is enabled.\n\nWe hope that you all take this opportunity to experience the queue and also show us which you prefer (by playing Blind or Draft). Thank you for your continued support and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Green Tea","date":"2017-09-18T06:31:54.233+0000","up_votes":33,"down_votes":1,"body":"jim: Top!\ntony: Top\njim: i got top soz m8 \n*tony instalocks jarven  with tp\" \njim: wtf!??!\n\nnever again will he have to deal with this problem :D \n{{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[{"poster":"Brave Shine","date":"2017-09-19T09:49:27.345+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Jim gets queued as top*\nTony: give me top\nJim: I want top soz m8\n*Tony instalocks Yasuo with tp*\nJim: ...\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-09-18T06:08:44.372+0000","up_votes":15,"down_votes":1,"body":"IM SO PROUD TO BE AN OCESTER :D\n\nWE get emotes and honour system first and now we get Normal draft :D\n\nI'm SUPPPER excited !!!\n\nLooking forward to some co-ordinated and toxic free champ selects :P","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-09-19T12:14:21.791+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kind of think he's being sarcastic.

Oh and also the issue that I can no longer transfer regions with IP and I'd have to dish out a real $15 just to move servers.\n\nGetting on to play the game with a hope to play certain characters only to have it all rely on the luck of being able to type a role in chat the fastest is miserable.

OCE had enough players to sustain it here and for a while it did work.\nBut for some reason it saw a continually declining number of players, a decline that showed no signs of stopping. Players in OCE just slowly drifted away from the queue and over to Blind Pick.\n\nWe could have left it on a little bit longer as at the average MMR queue times were acceptable. But outside of that range and surely creeping into that range of average MMR, queue times and matchmaking quality was suffering and getting worse.\nThis was back when we didn't have the ability or resources to confidently make changes to queue times locally and we just weren't confident it was even going to sustain itself as a limited time queue. So rather than move it to a restricted time slot like TT, it was removed.\n\nWe're just as hopeful as most that this test of Normal Draft goes well and we can keep it on a schedule similar to or better than this test.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-09-18T11:48:14.349+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"[It's about fucking time.](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/Ml9uMfoA-can-we-replace-blind-pick-with-no-bans-normal-draft)\n\nI have no idea why we were forced into a position where we had a choice between have games ruined by shitty comps/hard counters/mirror lanes (all of the downsides of Blind Pick), or playing Ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-19T13:00:16.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Cos draft pick totally takes away people's shitty computers?\nAnd draft pick encourages hard counters _(thats the whole point of seeing what the enemy picks)_.\n\nIm afraid I don't understand.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-09-19T14:39:41.147+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Honestly i feel like discord IS the most optimal platform for any gaming community when it comes to enabling fluent and filterable chat rooms. Being able to view everyone's personal and collective opinions, ideas and positive input, as well as being able to filter who is able to participate within the chat room i believe is a HUGE factor in having  positive and constructive feedback.\n\nMy thoughts on having multiple chat rooms including  filterable chat rooms opposed to something like the league forums where everybody can participate.\nOf course i want to bring the community together, but lets be honest, i dont know how many situations ive seen on these forums where a rioter/ member of our community has made a post about a current subject (x) within the game, and the topic has been completely flooded with people who are clearly only here to complain about things that they find irritating about subject (x) rather than reaching out and trying to communicate ideas and functions that could possible benefit both sides of the coin.\n\nTopic at hand - Rooms where everybody in the community can read riot employee proposals as well as where rioters can instantly grasp a large community known problem/topic that is non biased is what we as a community need.\n1. We could have some rooms were Riot gets the floor and simply lays down what you guys have planned or are excited to share with us.\n2. Rooms where ONLY lower tier players can ask for assistance, where they can get feedback from people in order to assist their efforts in a certain area, this also would be a good way to deny people throwing shade towards them, being passionate about the game shouldnt be frowned upon even when that person may be speaking on bias/incorrect terms, simply it means they just need their own designated place to feel like they are not always just complaining without getting anything in return. \n3. Rooms where People of a higher understanding/ tier can reach out to riot, This would provide a place where You guys at riot can reach out and ask some of the people who really put their heart and soul into the game how they feel our recent efforts have been, and what we think could be a good place to start in order to improve/adjust parts of the game/community IF anything needs ot be addressed at the time.\n4. Casual players- This is something i really want to touch base on, we need a place where you guys can talk to people  who dont care about winning or losing, players who dont care about grinding out ranked games and mastering one champion to the max or becoming a 'god' on multiple champs. Casual players can offer a lot of unbiased answers, they don't care about whats hurting them in their non existent ranked games or why said champion is over powered because of reasons A through to Z. Casual players see what they don't like and also what they like, however they dont really mind if it stays the same or not because they're just here to smash out some norms with their squad, and that is awesome.\n\n5.Discords platform for me at least feels a lot more fluent than the LoL Forums, I think it would be a great place to host rooms for players who are seeking another team to go up against, looking for spare players to queue up with or somebody who mains a champion that they want to pick up. Being able to receive/respond to feedback upon instant notification is something that the community would greatly benefit from.\n\n\nWe are the smaller community, but that doesnt mean we cannot make this work. I believe that if we really put in the work and effort to create something where we can all connect easier, we would resolve alot of the problems that come with areas that we feel can only be controlled by chance (ranked 3v3s for example, of course this isn't my main priority though). I dont think our size in comparison to servers like NA or EU should really control what we can or cant do/achieve on our server as a community. \n\nPS.

It happens quite a lot up here. \n\nThings tend to get a bit complicated when there's a bunch of pick / ban tier champions on any given patch (4 S tier mages, 3 S tier supports and 3 S tier carries come to mind immediately). 10 bans would be fantastic but I have no idea how this will affect champ select or even function (who will get more bans if there is 3 people per team?).\n\nI also do believe having a more flexible pool is best in 3v3. Once players get recognized in higher tiers, the target bans flow through and if you're an OTP or similar you have a bad time.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-09-20T00:29:22.204+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem.\n\nIt does appear that our main priority with the ban system in TT was to just move it to be 1 ban per player, rather than increase the amount of bans to be in line with SR.\nYou raise an important point with ban distribution. This and other factors & unknowns about how 10 bans will affect TT makes increasing the ban limit a bit more complicated than just flipping a switch, as I don't think the team is comfortable making that change without a concerted effort to understand the goals of the change and the full scope of the expected impact. As such I don't believe the team managing these systems is keen to prioritize working on this change, when they've got a full backlog of other stuff to work on for the rest of the game.\nProbably not the answer you wanted to hear, but it's the best info I could get.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
