Full article here - http://www.goldper10.com/guide/2400.html\r\n\r\nThe part that really stands out to me is the focus on learning rather than winning. I hope this can help you adjust your mindset and climb the ranked ladder!\r\n\r\n&quot;You see, by treating our game like a sport, we accept that a key area of the sporting experience hinges on the fact that you will always have a winner and a loser. This, then, translates in E-sports into a focus on winning and losing, but that focus can be damaging to your abilities to seek your own growth. This is because instead of having improvement as your goal, you now have &lsquo;not losing&rsquo; as your goal. And that mindset can hinder you, can prevent you from seeing the improvement in a loss, or can stop you from taking a step outside your comfort zone in an effort to find your personality through the game. We talk about different playstyles, and finding your own can be a rewarding pursuit.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;nd perhaps most importantly, by simply having &lsquo;I must win&rsquo; as your sole driving force, you will naturally reflect your anger and resentment unto your teammates, disallowing self-reflection. So the solution has to be a shift in focus, one that takes away from the mentality that states &lsquo;I must perform&rsquo;, and unto a more conductive mentality, one that states &lsquo;I must find my solution through trial and error&rsquo;.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-15T07:30:09.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this, however i think this mentality should translate to champion mastery as well (because champion mastery IS about improving, not winning)\nfor example the picture included, was one game i had, i got S+ and tons of kills, i got lots of objectives and felt like i was instrumental in team fights, anyway i like to think i did well with that champ, however i only got 289 champion points for it because we lost, however you get 1000+ points for a win regardless of your performance, (i have gotten C and won before and received higher scores than when i get S+ and lose)\nso it is my belief that what is posted here is a mentality that should be applied to champion mastery. \n\ni believe that if you do really well with a champ but you lose, you should get more points than doing really badly but get carried by Yi and win.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-09-15T11:30:59.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=YEktjeuh,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-15T07:30:09.679+0000)\n>\n> I agree with this, however i think this mentality should translate to champion mastery as well (because champion mastery IS about improving, not winning)\n> for example the picture included, was one game i had, i got S+ and tons of kills, i got lots of objectives and felt like i was instrumental in team fights, anyway i like to think i did well with that champ, however i only got 289 champion points for it because we lost, however you get 1000+ points for a win regardless of your performance, (i have gotten C and won before and received higher scores than when i get S+ and lose)\n> so it is my belief that what is posted here is a mentality that should be applied to champion mastery. \n> \n> i believe that if you do really well with a champ but you lose, you should get more points than doing really badly but get carried by Yi and win.\n\nChampion mastery is worthless, it just shows if you are competent with a certain list of champions because you played them after like April or something. \n\nWho cares about what score you get?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-15T19:55:15.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People who have all the champions and so IP is worthless and want something to work for?\nalso its fun using the emote","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tirolei","date":"2015-09-15T03:05:34.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good read and something to think on, I feel like it's really important as a player to take a minute after a game, ranked or normal, and think back on what you've done well or poorly. You needn't go over an entire replay of the game, but merely reflect on the memorable mistakes or successes.\n\nEven just doing this, accepting that maybe you were out of position leading into a teamfight, or you shouldn't have been lurking around the enemy jungle with mid missing, will lead to positive growth.\n\nNo you won't instantly make better plays the next game, but you'll have learned, and this learning leads to climbing the ladder in a much more sustainable way than just a lucky winning streak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirSonance","date":"2015-09-15T23:51:48.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this philosophy.
