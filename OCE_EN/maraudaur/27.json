Even if you feel like it your mind is constantly planning responses to something they might say to retaliate back against something you said. I find it annoying aswell when there is some meta breaking dumb as hell thing like jg Ezreal but it's best to just try give them a shot. Also saying it's 'just norms' doesn't mean that you shouldn't give a care in the world ether you win or lose or if you can't be bothered to try anything. The 4 other people in the game are real people like you and me and your family and your friends. Try to imagine saying the stuff your saying of your best friends. I know the summoner is a stranger but they are still a person and we should treat them with respect and give them a chance. However, if people just intentionally feed or be passive-aggressive in chat (all the reportable things) then just mute them if you even have the slightest feeling that if you respond that you will get mad.

Nothing wrong with that, though, and it didn't seem to cause any issues in-game. I'm guessing Ez went AFK once or twice (around the 7 minute mark and maybe the 9 minute mark?).\n\n> [12:00] Fitzky (Jax): this is boring ff at 20\n\nThis is where I see the issues starting. Fact is, by queuing for (and then accepting) the match you've made a commitment to play it out until the end, yet here you are saying that everyone should surrender just because *you* aren't having fun. Sorry but that's not how it works. If you wanted to surrender, it seems it would've been best if you didn't actually say anything in chat given the way you talked about surrendering. All you were doing with that was demoralising the team, which is a likely reason as to why things started (or continued?) going downhill.\n\n> [12:33] Fitzky (Jax): you guys think your good\n\nSo do a lot of people, there's better ways to handle it without stating it so bluntly and (arguably) rudely. I suggest if you don't have anything nice (and/or productive) to say, don't say anything at all.\n\n> [14:24] Fitzky (Jax): if we dont ff im gonna tilt and feed\n\nThis isn't acceptable behaviour. You decide that your time is worth more than the time of the 4 other people on your team and decide that if you're stuck in the game you're going to ruin it for those 4 people? That's ban-worthy, in my opinion. There is never a reason to act like this.\n\n> [21:00] Fitzky (Jax): i might go afk\n\nBetter option than feeding, but still not acceptable. Be the bigger man/woman and see the match through to the end in spite of the fact you find it boring and a \"sure loss\".\n\n> [34:55] Fitzky (Jax): just end this game and say \"report jax\" like everyone other fucking kid says to me because hes \"sick of trolls\"\n\nDo you want to get banned? Cause this is how you get banned. Based on the chat logs it seems like you *did* end up trolling in that game, which means reports against you would've been well founded. If you think getting reported by 9 people rather than 4 is a good idea, think again.\n\n> [36:25] [All] Fitzky (Jax): its norms jeezes christ this game doesnt mean your life WHOOOOOOOOO CARESSS\n\nYour team, apparently. Your team cared, and what did you do? Rubbed it in their face and ruined the game for all 4 of them, more than likely. It doesn't matter that the game is \"insignificant\" (in *your* opinion, I might add), that doesn't give you the right to ruin it for other people just because you're bored.\n\nAs a general note, try to avoid responding to bad situations and toxicity with more toxicity, all it does is make the situation much worse than it needs to be.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Arakkon","date":"2016-04-27T05:17:08.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Give me some tips?\"\nI've noticed that I get really quickly really toxic.

You were there once as well. Playing with people that don't play how you want is frustrating, but it is pretty easy to adjust your own play style to accommodate them. If they are doing something silly like going into a physical damage lane and rushing MR, you can politely tell them an alternate build path or point out that it won't go too wel.

Instead of adjusting yourself and remaining an encouraging force, you decide to mock them. It won't go anywhere good.\n\n**TL;DR** if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it.

Second of all, \"this is why you are silver\", making fun of someone's rank when you were probably in their division at one point is not ok. Also, \"ok I'm feeding then\" is putting yourself right in the spot of being banned because you clearly just declared that you were going to intentionally feed. You made fun of varus as well because I assume he didn't play mid very well, what I recommend you do to better handle this situation is first try \"positive feedback to improve\". If you see someone on your team doing badly watch them constantly to see what they keep doing wrong then help them out by letting them know.

It completely demoralises the team and pretty much assures defeat.

There are certain situations where it's impossible to stop things like this happening, but in this scenario it could have been possible for you to switch to Jungle Jax.

You presumably died in lane here, correct? Why? What could you have done to not die? Sure, the Ez could've been there and you may not have died; but he wasn't. Were you too pushed up? Low but didn't back? Greedy?

Sure we play with people that can be so bad that you want to throw your keyboard out the window, but there is really not need for this. \n\n\n> [17:02] Fitzky (Jax): look at this nid\n> [17:06] Fitzky (Jax): so pro\n> [23:06] Fitzky (Jax): nice supporting sona\n> [12:33] Fitzky (Jax): you guys think your good\n\nSlightly Passive Aggressive? It's a normal; either that person is trying Nid for the first couple of times and is Garen-teed to make mistakes or she could be just having a bad game.

Correct Terminology here. You're having no fun? How about that people that are frustrated with you? Do you think that they're having fun trying to get your to actually play? \n\n\n> [34:55] Fitzky (Jax): just end this game and say \"report jax\" like everyone other fucking kid says to me because hes \"sick of trolls\"\n\nWell, they probably are, that's exactly why they're reporting you. I'm sure you've reported your fair share of people for the exact same reason.\n\n> [37:05] [All] Fitzky (Jax): im being yelled at for crying when the 4 other people on ym team are crying more\n\nCrying? I'm pretty sure they're frustrated at you for your lack of effort. It's a team game whether you like it or not.\n\n\n\"Stay true in the dark and humble in the spotlight\"\n\nSure, you started the game in a positive attitude, yet as soon as you were detecting a slight shift in the teams mood, you couldn't help but have a go at them could you? When you had their attention, would it have been that hard to reinforce positivity instead of negativity? Little things like this win games; 80% of your performance is based off mindset; the second you started flaming the team, you instantly thought, \"Team's fault, I tried\", and that's all you did, you tried for that first little bit of the game. What about the rest? If the game ended when the first person started flaming then we'd all have 5-15 minute games [I speak the truth Rito].  \n\nTo improve all you really need to do is get into your head that no game is over until the nexus is destroyed, ignore the others that are flaming you and concentrate on how you can improve. Don't blame that ADC Fiddlesticks or the JNG Orianna; sure they could've contributed to the loss, but why weren't you fed in lane? Why weren't you the one to one-shot their carries?\n\n\nI really hope this helps, This is just my opinion and if I've missed something, then I apologize,\n\nGood Luck in the Fields of Justice.\n\n\nRiot, Give me some tips please? I'm not the saltiest person out there but I can definitely improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-04-28T19:25:48.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah this sucks.\nThis guy is on my friend list, and I wasn't aware they were chatting like this to this extent. They are struggling in Bronze, like me. \n\nI really think it comes down to mindset, in being able to stay positive and focused in the game and if a game is looking so bad there is absolutely no chance, I can laugh it off as one of \"those games\". I won't laugh it off in chat though.\n\nIf you start blaming others while in game, you instantly start playing worse. Actions that you could have done to press advantages (even something as simple as pushing out top lane so you can teamfight in mid), you don't do because you're too focused on how bad it is that bot lane is feeding yet more kills or something. Instead, just accept it. Just accept that is how your teammates are playing and adapt to it. Encourage your teammates whenever they do something good. A turret (gj), a dragon (gw), a great teamfight (yes! now push), a sick outplay (wow!). Those are just examples. Though high elo players I watch don't do this because they usually know what they are doing, but in low elo, you need any advantage you can get.\n\nI sometimes fall into this trap of blaming your team, and I complain in chat, but what I try to do is not have my complaints directed at a teammate in particular, rather on us as a team, and always focusing on objectives. \"We should have got that inhib\" rather than saying \"look at this nid so pro\"\n\nAlso it is not necessary to carry every game with a stellar KDA. In fact, going into a game with the mindset that \"I must have a good KDA\" has proven detrimental to me in the past. Instead, something like, \"I need to make sure that I keep up my experience and cs throughout the whole game (farm farm farm), and press advantages to get objectives\". This may differ depending on which role you play, but I was playing as jungler yesterday and I was just farming more and at points 2 levels ahead of the enemy jungler, just because I was making sure that I was always finding a way to level up as fast as possible. A level advantage is just super strong. Also I would 'ignore' certain teamfights that would not get us any objectives and instead split push a lane. Sometimes I would get 1, 2 turrets, but even pushing out a lane does heaps. Jax is great at split pushing, you can easily do this while 'ignoring' your team. Also I would not care if I had a mediocre KDA as long as it was getting us objectives. Unless I was dying too much, then there is definitely something I could have improved on. Perhaps this sort of thinking can help steer you away from  the \"omg I can't carry\" (your kills may be high but you could have less deaths), \"mid is 5/10\" (even though their cs is good and are wrecking teamfights), \"This 4/9 Tryn so bad\" (even though he personally downed 3 turrets) train of thought.\n\nAnother thing that has helped me is to take every game you play as a learning experience. Every game is a little step towards the glory of high elo (you can dream, I haven't even got to silver, lol). But that you really have to deserve it to get there. Yes it sucks that some people didn't have to grind to be in gold and they don't deserve to be there. Whatever. Focus on yourself.\n\nSo I've gotten off track a bit. I like to spread my positivity in chat nearly all the time (and sometimes I talk shit to the enemy team when we're winning hehe), but sometimes I get caught in a teammate's negativity, I'd like to see the chat from one of those games where my mindset wasn't as strong and focused. \n\nSo, \"Give me some tips?\"\n\nPS: This is mainly good mindset for ranked. I didn't realise this was for a normal game. In that case you don't have to be super try hard, but you don't have to be toxic anyway because what are you losing? Your normal W/L ratio? Less IP? Meh. \"It's just norms\" is by no means a reason to be toxic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"619","date":"2016-04-28T11:43:44.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question. \nI unlike most of these 12 year old plebs know how to control my emotions and never flame my team in game (Only after game) but sometimes I will purposely say things like \"Trash\" and \"If I was your jungler I would gank for you way more\" in order to create friction between the enemy team in turn leading to them playing badly or in some casing flaming eachother, I never racialy discriminate tell people to kill them selves etc. Just wondering can I be banned?
