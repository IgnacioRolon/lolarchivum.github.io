Tournaments\n2. Leagues\n\nThese can either be online (majority of matches played online) or Live (majority of matches played at a physical venue e.g. net cafe or university).\n\n**Tournaments**\nThese are any competitive events that run over a couple of days like one or two weekends. These events tend to be played over fewer days but with many games in one day.\n\n**Leagues**\nThese are any competitive events that run over multiple weeks. Think your local social sports league where you play a game with your team every week for 5+ weeks. Kind of like a mini LCS experience.\n\nIn the image below you will see the RP values we will provide to support the competitive event you run. Its mainly based on the following factors:\n\n* Type of event (tournament or league)\n* Whether its played online or live\n* Number of teams participating (You provide a estimation in the events form, we also look at previous events you have run if there are any)\n* How often and consistently do you run tournaments\n\n5 v 5 competition\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/0e197335cdd84e2cf7bfcdec9797af24.png\n\n3 v 3 competition\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/47f1859bd41ec707bd641e6261457668.png\n\nRP amounts listed are per **TEAM** not player. We have made this adjustment because a lot of tournaments had varying team sizes (5, 6 or 7 depending on sub rules). By prizing out to a team we can be flexible in how we distribute the amount among teams rather than only providing prizes for 5 players per team.\n\n\nOther prizes:\nWe will also provide a 4 win XP boost for all players in the top 8 teams of all approved tournaments (except for Live tournaments with 64 + teams, they will get a 10 win XP boost)\n\nThe top 8 teams in all approved leagues will get a 10 win XP boost.\n\nAll approved tournaments and leagues will be eligible for Triumphant Ryze for first place in addition to the other prizes stated above if they have 8 or more teams.\n\nThis only applies to 5 v 5 Summoners Rift tournaments. If you are hosting other events like casual play sessions, get togethers, 1v1/2v2/3v3/ ARAM tournaments we are also happy to support that so please do register those on our events portal as well. If your event is approved we will email and let you know what support/prizes we will provide for your event.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know in the comments =D\n\n**FAQ**\n**Q: What determines a new vs veteran organiser?**\nThe general rule here is you are considered a new organiser if you have hosted less than 2 tournaments. If you have hosted more than two tournaments you will be eligible for the veteran organisers prize sets.\n\nHowever there is the possibility of you reverting back to new organiser status if there is a big gap between your last tournament and the next one you are hosting.\n\n**Q: Whats the difference between tournaments and leagues?**\nIf your competition is held over 3 or less weekends then it is considered a tournament. If it is held over 4 or more weeks then it is considered a league.","replies":[{"poster":"cgmfn123","date":"2018-05-27T15:33:53.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when wil the prizes be delivered t our accounts?","replies":[]},{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-06T01:41:50.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Maraudaur,\n\nI am uncertain on how to read this table. I can understand the amount of players, and the prize rewards. But do not understand the Total RP or the 1st Time Organizer parts.

Then the next time you host a tournament it depends on the number of teams you get. \n\nFor Online tournament 1st time organisers we dont provide RP but we do provide Triumphant Ryze and IP boosts","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-06T01:49:10.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see!

The 1st - 8th values show what RP each player gets (5 from each team) the total is what each player gets times 5.","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-06T02:31:16.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too easy mate!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-28T05:12:30.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a minimum on number of teams needed for a riot approved tournament?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-28T05:32:48.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are FAQS on our events page, it should cover everything you need - http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/content/faq","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-04-29T02:07:43.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No real money tournaments..
