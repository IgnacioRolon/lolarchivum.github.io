I’d like to introduce the Emissary program.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xosvzga.png?noredirect\n\nWe’ve set up this group up to allow players we’ve identified as deeply knowledgeable about our behavior systems to reach out to their fellow players, providing information and helping address questions and concerns you guys bring to our attention.\n\nEmissaries are volunteers, not Rioters, so there are some things they can't do (no pulling chat logs or lifting bans, sorry!), but they are ready and willing to help you find resources and become more familiar with Riot's player behavior policies. If you’ve been warned or banned through one of our PB&amp;J systems (LeaverBuster, report frequency warnings, etc.) or just have a question, the Emissaries are here to work with you!\n\nCurrent Emissaries are;\nSera’s Dragon\nTele\nHeartVine\n\n\nQ: I want to help! How can I join the Emissaries?\n\nWe’re always on the lookout for potential Emissaries, but we do so with the mentality that actions speak louder than words. If you’d like to wear the badge of an Emissary, show us that you can do it by continuing to help answer the questions of your fellow summoners in a friendly and professional manner. We’ll be watching!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-11T05:04:57.386+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sera's is definitely a good person to give this to, good job riot.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-02-21T12:39:40.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Feels bad man, i remember when i used to think this too, but damn two years ago...","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-22T08:05:47.670+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah looking back on this now i'm not sure.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2016-07-04T09:04:49.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thumbs up on that one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T04:08:25.909+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2016-02-10T07:28:37.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=Edu7E6Bp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-10T04:08:25.909+0000)\n>\n> Hello everyone!\n\nJust a quick question if you don't mind.

This largely applies to the post-game reporting feature as well.\n\nThe notification that sometimes appears is meant as a bonus feel-good, not a reliable source of information. The notification not appearing, doesn't mean nothing happened. While you can guess at time bans based on match history, there is *no* way to determine if someone has been hit with a chat restriction or other punishment, so just because nothing visible to you happened, doesn't mean they weren't warned/punished.\n\nTwo other important notes:\n\nNo matter how bad the behaviour is, if it's not reported, it won't be actioned. Players ultimately decide (in the long run) what is or isn't okay, so by not reporting a behaviour, you're basically saying you think it was fine. If you forget to report a player in post-game, or couldn't for whatever reason, then you can submit that report via this page: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034625773\n\nWhile no-tolerance behaviour falls into the category of \"can escalate\", it won't always. There is a significant amount of meta-data that goes into when, where, and what kind of punishment a player will receive. Even being in the game itself, we as players will never have the whole story, and so can never make perfect predictions no matter how well we know the system.\n\n___\n\nNow, with all that said, if you feel a post-game report was not actioned appropriately or you'd like a manual review of a particular player, you can do so via a ticket to player support: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAgain, Player Support won't give you *any* information about someone else's account, implicit or explicit, so you'll get a generic \"thanks for the report\" type reply.\n\nReports to player support also take a long time (manual reviews are much slower than what the IFS can accomplish) and they don't inform the IFS for future use, so even if you know you're going to report someone to support, still ensure you are using the post-game reporting feature as well.","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2020-01-31T07:12:48.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Ninox!\n\nI've never expected player information from any of the players, just wanted to make sure i could escalate to make sure it was reviewed manually given the amount of insults, racism, homophobia etc.. you name it, that was on that chat ( although the automated system might have worked).\n\nI always report people when they're toxic to certain levels -  a bit of a friendly banter is ok but when you throw stuff like \"KYS\" or \"I hate Ni*r, go kys\"... well that's crossing a line.\n\nagain, thank you for the help!\n\nCheers, \nTWH","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sir Ganksalot","date":"2017-01-11T02:42:42.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest problem with behaviour in OCE is the lack of a draft norms queue.
