We will also regularly review the queue and make adjustments where required.\n~~~\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/76VyzOP.png\n\nThe Normal Draft test period is coming to a close. During the test period we have tried both very conservative (limited days and times) and very aggressive schedules(open every day, most hours). We&rsquo;ve heard a tonne of positive feedback from you, talking about how you enjoy draft, the bans, role select and lack of mirror match ups. Recently we&rsquo;ve also seen Draft hold ~20% of all normal games played (when both blind and draft are enabled). \n\nWe&rsquo;ve seen queue times and match quality maintain a healthy state. So we are happy to announce that Normal Draft will be staying enabled on our server!\n\nGoing forward Normal Draft will continue on its current schedule, open every day between 11am to 3am AEDT. We will regularly review the state of the queue to see if we need to increase or decrease the time it is available.\n\nWe are committed to providing the best experience we can to OCE players and we hope you all continue to enjoy Normal Draft together.\n\nThank you for your continued support and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-10-19T01:52:22.103+0000","up_votes":32,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yay yasuo is deleted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2017-10-19T04:58:14.928+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since normal draft came back I've been hitting SR about as much as I did ARAM and TT.

You then factor in autofill protection (they shouldn't be kicked back to queue for you; even if you have been there five minutes longer), and a minor to moderate weighting in favour of the autofiller (as a bonus for shortening other queue times, and to \"charge\" for the perma-autofill protection) et. voila! \n\nI don't actually think most people would be willing to sit in a queue for 20 minutes - but I'm also certain that there are people like me who gladly -GLADLY - would; it would give those willing to fill shorter times, reduce dodging (which annoys everyone; who hasn't been angry when they got their role, someone dodged, then they got filled), and reduces toxicity and trolling (the whole 'fuck it, got filled, don't care playing to fuck around' mentality).\n\nYes, I would take a half hour queue over a 10 minute queue and a 20 minute game playing a role I don't want; LoL frustrates me when it's not a game I want - churlish?
