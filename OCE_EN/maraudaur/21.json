Never mind the idiots who want to think cosplay should be restricted to size 8 females. It's almost as if all they want to see cosplay for is a sexual outlet and they have no respect for the people who put the time into perfecting their art. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Grlfriend Potato","date":"2017-03-22T12:08:38.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually supposed to be a Popstar Lulu! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"101Evsey","date":"2017-03-22T12:09:34.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think everyone is forgetting the main point. League of Legends is more than just cosplay or a game, it is basically a community now. It is a way for people to express themselves and to show off their talents with cosplaying and fanart and fanfic about a well-crafted game. Because we are all here because we all love the game.  I think everyone should be allowed to show off their skills and passions. \n\nWe shouldn't be saying fatties stick to fatter champs. We shouldn't be saying Asians stick to Asian champs, or males stick to males and females stick to females. Cosplay is the art of bringing fictional characters to life, and is COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE and in the cosplay regulations to put your own spin on a cosplay.\n\nWe are all human, we all have great minds. Let's use them to be great, not stay in our little bubbles of ignorance.","replies":[{"poster":"Grlfriend Potato","date":"2017-03-22T12:15:11.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beautiful! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Alex Vw","date":"2017-03-23T10:04:44.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that black people should only cosplay Ekko, Lucian and Karma\n\n{{champion:35}} (jk)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slug Christ","date":"2017-03-23T11:58:08.213+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's it like being a literal potato?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kromic","date":"2017-03-22T06:37:03.513+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"cool","replies":[{"poster":"Grlfriend Potato","date":"2017-03-22T12:09:10.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2017-03-22T23:17:43.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job, keep it up!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Grlfriend Potato","date":"2017-03-23T09:44:54.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mônster","date":"2017-03-22T19:46:35.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"dressing up az something you like is all its about Gj lad","replies":[{"poster":"Grlfriend Potato","date":"2017-03-23T09:47:56.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I think too! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"reynad","date":"2017-03-22T12:58:53.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ^.^ you are so cute omg, do you have a fan page facebook page or a public account?
