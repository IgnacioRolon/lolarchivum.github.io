They can help assist you with common technical problems and are recognized as community leaders by Riot Games. Because they are not Riot staff members, Wrenchmen can&#039;t answer all questions, but they can help you find resources and show you how to get in contact with Player Support.\n\nLook for their special orange color and Wrench Icon!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uhyeSmO.png\n\nCurrent Wrenchmen are;\nWuks\nSephirothSG\n\nQ: I want to help! How can I join the Wrenchmen?\n\nWe&rsquo;re always on the lookout for potential Wrenchmen, but we do so with the mentality that actions speak louder than words. If you&rsquo;d like to wear the badge of a Wrenchmen, show us that you can do it by continuing to help answer the questions of your fellow summoners in a friendly and professional manner. We&rsquo;ll be watching!","replies":[{"poster":"UNUSAL","date":"2016-02-10T09:20:08.011+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be cool if more riot people could comment on posts to give players some possible answers to their questions .","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-10T09:31:47.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWe answer questions where we can, check out the \"Red Tracker\" on the left hand Nav bar.

I would hop on the forums/Boards whenever I had some time to kill and just tried to answer peoples' questions as best I could. We keep an active lookout for active posters on both North America and Oceania, so just stay positive and work to help people in areas that you're interested. Thanks for your interest!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheBrizzle","date":"2016-04-20T04:19:02.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Guys question I brought 2 $10 prepaid RP and i entered the codes then it said it was successful so I clicked return to store both times and the RP still hasn't been added to my account.
