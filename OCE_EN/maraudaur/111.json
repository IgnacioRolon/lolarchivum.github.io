We want to continue to share compelling things currently happening in the community, but we need your help.\r\n \r\nBeyond friendships and relationships formed through League, we want to hear about people and events that really inspire us, give us chills, or make us laugh. Beyond that, it&rsquo;s even better if something&rsquo;s happening in the coming months. We&rsquo;re all for campfire stories, but it&rsquo;s even better if we can capture the story as it happens!\r\n \r\nJust some thought starters:\r\nPlaying League from an unsupported territory or under weird, or amazing circumstances?\r\nTurning League-passion into a career or at least some side cash?\r\nUsing League as a tool for education or advocacy?\r\nWe&rsquo;re very open to submissions outside of North America and Europe.\r\n \r\nEven if you aren&rsquo;t the protagonist, go ahead and tell us your favorite story at playerstories-rg@riotgames.com\r\n\r\n** EDIT **\r\nThanks everyone! We&#039;ve really enjoyed reading everyone&#039;s stories and submissions so far, we&#039;re sorting through them and reading every single one. (even the trolls)\r\nWe&#039;re looking especially hard for individuals who anticipate something happening in the next few months or so. Let us know if you&#039;re in the middle of or planning something!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-10-08T04:47:15.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one time, at band camp. ..","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-23T11:39:48.272+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Do a story on how Riot decided to have the best troll of all in the Juggernaut update?
