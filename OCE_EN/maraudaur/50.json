If you&#039;ve got an iOS device, you&#039;ll still be able to get the regular version of the app as soon as it&#039;s available.\n\n**Q: Can I give my invite to a friend?**\nA: No, sharing the link doesn&rsquo;t forward the invite. Only players who received an emailed invite from us will be able to sign into the beta app and participate in the test.\n\n**Q: How long does beta last / when is the live launch?**\nA: We don&rsquo;t have an exact date right now, but if all goes well, we&rsquo;re looking at a few weeks to a month, or so. We&rsquo;ll be squashing bugs, ensuring stability, and listening for beta tester&rsquo;s feedback before we launch. \n\n**Q: Lots of regions will get the app once it&rsquo;s ready for release, right?**\nA: Yep, the League Friends app is launching in all League of Legends regions except for China and Southeast Asia. We&rsquo;ll roll it out to NA and OCE first, followed by the rest of the regions over the following weeks after that if everything goes smooth.\n\n**Q: What OS versions does the app work with?**\nA: The app works with devices using iOS 8.3 or newer or Android 4.1.1 or newer (API 16). \n\n**Q: No Windows Phone version?**\nA: No Windows Phone version. Basically, there just aren&#039;t enough League players with Windows Phones to justify supporting the app on an ongoing basis. \n\n**Q: If I&rsquo;m in the beta, where can I leave feedback and report bugs?**\nA: Bugs reports can be submitted through the app, as can feedback&mdash;go to the settings tab and select &quot;Bugs and Feedback.&quot; Discussions about the beta can be held on the [OCE ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/mobile-app-discussion)mobile app discussion board.","replies":[{"poster":"MrStrange","date":"2016-01-27T09:19:31.167+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Features i think should be added:\n-change summoner icon\n-purchasing summoner icons\n-sorting friends into groups\n-creating groups\n\nAnd it would be cool if we could edit our runes and masteries as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Megalomania","date":"2016-01-27T09:55:36.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be cool to have something like some kinda group chats for people who wanna group with random especially since the 400% experience gain in groups","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wardeninetwo","date":"2016-01-28T00:54:08.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In line with this - the game client has functionality that supports public chat rooms. \nAdding this to the app could be a suggestion for the development pipeline?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Keltaklo","date":"2016-01-22T12:33:13.779+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome; keep us updated :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrStrange","date":"2016-01-28T02:17:58.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i opened the app via clicking on a notification the app crashed","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-28T02:45:39.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure to report it through the app. OR reply here with some uploaded screen shots.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Onie2","date":"2016-01-28T00:58:54.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've experienced a few bugs with the app however when I go into the 'Bugs and Feedback' section there is nothing there for me to report these issues.\n\nSo far the issues I have experienced are constant crashes when attempting to send messages (at one point the only way to fix this was to uninstall and reinstall). Now my biggest problem is that there seems to be a huge delay in the sending and receiving of messages. My friend and I compared screenshots of our messages and there are heaps of messages that haven't gone through and then some that took hours. I'm not sure if this is only an issue from messaging app to app as opposed to client to app or vice versa.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-28T01:48:34.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this report, can you upload some screen shots to Imugur and link them here for me?
