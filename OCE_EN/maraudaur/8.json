After a few seconds, the charge detonates, dealing damage to the target and all nearby enemies. Attacking the target with basic attacks amps the charge up, making it deal extra damage as it explodes. Tristana can also Rocket Jump onto a target with Explosive Charge for extra damage.\r\n\r\n\"Her basic attack speed still increases per level, but the boost is lower than before. This makes Rapid Fire actually important, as she’s not just switching from stupid fast attack speed to soul-crushingly fast attack speed. Her Rocket Jump now deals lower base damage, but can deal way more if she stacks up Explosive Charge on her target before landing on their face.\"\r\n\r\nSource: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-tristana","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-15T10:32:09.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cuter now much better looking, I reckon the new E is neat because it's actually something cool now as opposed to hit E for grievous wounds.

But I still can't believe the developers/whoever-reworks-champions didn't think \"oh, maybe it is a bad idea for an adc to go melee mode on a target.\" After this rework comes out: Tristana: \"I'm GOING IN guys! Sona is low\" *Places e on her* Boom lands on Sona. Sona use ult! It was SUPER EFFECTIVE! The enemy Tristana is stunned. Vayne uses AUTO ATTACK!
