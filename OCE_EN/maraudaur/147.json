You had to pick where the 8 teams would place once the season was over. Players that correctly picked the end of season standing would win a share of 100,000 RP!\r\n\r\nWe had over 2400 entries but only two summoners managed to pick all 8 standing correctly. Congratulations to the two summoners for correctly picking the end of season standings correctly and winning 50,000 RP each! (An email has been sent out to the summoners who won)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**How did the end of season standings work with Rich Gang Disqualified?**\r\n\r\nWe took Rich Gang out of everyone&#039;s submissions. This means that it didn&#039;t matter where you originally put Rich Gang as long as the order of the other 7 teams were correct.\r\n\r\nI.e. Summoner X (with RG) picked - Chiefs, Dire Wolves, Legacy, Rich Gang, Immunity, Avant Garde, Sudden Fear, 4Not\r\n      Summoner X (without RG) picked - Chiefs, Dire Wolves, Legacy, Immunity, Avant Garde, Sudden Fear, 4Not\r\n\r\n      Summoner Y (with RG) picked - Dire Wolves, Chiefs, Legacy, Rich Gang, Immunity, Avant Garde, Sudden Fear, 4Not\r\n      Summoner Y (without RG) picked - Dire Wolves, Chiefs, Legacy, Immunity, Avant Garde, Sudden Fear, 4Not\r\n\r\nSummoner X had the order of the other teams correct where as Summoner Y did not.","replies":[{"poster":"R3m4iningSaiyan","date":"2015-04-10T09:52:04.713+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!!
