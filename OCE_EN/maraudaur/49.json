Was seriously some great entries.  To acknowledge the efforts of the artists, I've tried commenting on each piece I saw in the office...\n\n\nKoonu, your composition and color for mood is spot on.  I also love the use of light for dramatic effect.\n\nCressel, great job on the lighting and warm colors! I can almost feel the warmth of the fireplace in front of them\n\nSix, wanted to acknowledge your lighting!  And the color details in Lux's hair - very subtle, and very effective\n\nVanishment, enjoyed your exploration of medium with pencils and watercolour \n\nCrimsonSeal, you're use of dark and light was very effective in capturing the mood and directing the viewer's eye\n\nRappel, loved you're effort on the ice/snow landscape - the subtle colors add so much more interest than just white snow!\n\nKonoumin, loved your treatment of the character's outline catching a subtle amount of light!\n\nHyoton, love the glowing effect you achieved\n\nEzreai, great job of capturing the terror of Vayne's victim and creating it as a secondary focal point\n\nSpoopychocolet, appreciate the effort you made to provide a background that sets the stage.  The environment is just as important as the characters when telling a story or capturing a moment.\n\nKhronix, enjoyed the 'movie poster' feel you've created for your piece.  the line art and the outline is very effective and compliments Vayne\n\nArchsage, kudos on experimenting with perspective and attempting a \"first-person\" view for your piece!\n\nSomet1mes,  Great effort!\n\nChiefMagic, your effort on Garen's face is worth it - heavily communicates the emotion of your piece\n\nXynn, loved your vivid colors!  Your trees and water were particularly successful\n\nTinKalzetin, Nod to your effort on perspective, particularly your care in depicting Garen's sword\n\nBitr, well done on achieving a sense of motion and movement with your magical elements in your piece\n\nCjjayme, The emotion of your piece is felt immediately.  Well done.\n\nNodametelsa, enjoyed your color choices.  The blues, greys, reds, and purples compliment each other very well.\n\nAlphy, enjoyed the 'comic book' feel of your piece\n\nWacalac,  well done! color, composition, lighting, emotion... you nailed it.\n\nHide, excellent effort on the armour!  The metallic effect you created was very successful, particularly on the hip/leg piece.\n\nBiglittleme, your effort on Galio's texture is so good - unmistakably stone/concrete\n\nAlpacalyn, excellent work on the emotive eyes of Lux in your piece\n\nNatella princess, appreciated your effort in creating a low-lit environment with a sharp light source\n\nCheesewoo, ugh, so good! loved the sky background you created and the effort in the textures of Galio - that metal crown is so good!\n\nLoughlin, a refreshing choice of medium!\n\nKevinsong154, loved your composition and scene choice\n\nTriggR, love the sense of movement your piece has, reminds me of watching dragon ball z :)\n\nCycronebro, good effort challenging yourself\n\nZookie, great effort (and achievement) on the moonlight!\n\nShockal, very much enjoyed the line art showcased here - very clean and purposeful\n\nRobinHoot, excellent shading, and there is something I love about your little Lux :)\n\nHooDingy, interesting art style.  I don't know if the shading complimented your line art.  I'd continue experimenting though!\n\nASCubeY,  love the textures and thatching in this piece\n\nWhizza, just beautiful.  I don't know what else to say :)\n\nSelathiel, really enjoy the fee4l of this.  Could literally be a frame in an A-level animation piece\n\nTimestrike1, interesting angle and perspective you've chosen.  More details on landscape would help the viewer to digest what they are looking at.\n\nDefqor, I enjoyed your take on the speech bubble for Garen - appreciate the extra flavour!\n\n\n\nMuch love guys,  seriously some great work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2017-05-01T07:19:20.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm amazed at how the entries have really brought to life the related lore.
