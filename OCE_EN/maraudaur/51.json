You feel zero improvement if you don't roll dice and don't go on a massive winning streak. \n\nThere's no one that inherently and truly enjoys playing ranked, because the system blames _you_ for your teammates faults. Those faults are easier to fix at Bronze than they are for something much higher. You're either above your tier and can carry hard, or you're above your division and you cannot do anything.\n\nThe worst part is Riot hides your MMR/ELO and covers it LP which is just garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-26T11:25:18.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Physically show ELO again @Riot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-26T10:51:23.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you can't do anything about trolls?

If your team is feeding, or just not very good and losing lanes, i'm sorry but even if I have 10 kills by 10 minutes, I can't fight a 1v5.\n\nAnd it's worse when you're playing against a team that CAN co-ordinate, and your team bumbles around chasing kills. I consider myself a silver player, but while somebody who's good enough to be in challenger can climb out of bronze with ease, it's not that easy for those who aren't that good. I try to co-ordinate teams, take objectives and try to make the best plays I can, but none of this helps if i'm basically playing a 1v5.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-26T06:23:29.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but i can look at your stats and tell you your not a silver player.\n\nnegative K/D on your top 6 champions.\n\npoor farm on all your champs.\n\nmostly negative win rates.\n\nAnd no don't give me all this \"people were feeding\" horse shit.\n\nEarlier this week i went 5/1/4 as shaco jungle with a rage quit Tristana and a 1/11 karma support (yes it's a normal but it's still accurate, not to mention we probably could have carried if we felt like it, but it would have been a chore for a normal.)","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-09-26T07:25:28.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love to know where you're getting your stats from.

I am **definitely** not saying its ALL one players fault. BUT as long as there were mistakes made by you its a good thing.

You have broken mathematics. There is nothing you can do, and you should certainly never play any game that involves rolling a dice.
