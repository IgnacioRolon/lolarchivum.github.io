It feels more like fighting for top 2 spots instead of top 3","replies":[{"poster":"Khronix","date":"2017-07-20T05:32:31.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I kinda miss the top 10 thing idk why they made it top 3. It's kinda discouraging when you spend 35+ hours on something and get placed with... ehh i'm just being salty lmao I guess having it be top 3 now only makes the quality of the artworks higher since everyone's gunning for top 3.
