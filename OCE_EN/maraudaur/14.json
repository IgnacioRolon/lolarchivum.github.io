So far I have won 6-0 and have 4 games left. I am getting put with Bronze 5s even though I am constantly carrying, getting S-, S and S+. I hope this is a bug and don't want my newest account to be placed in this low elo as I've been doing my best to win every game and have done so. Please give me an update as I am scared to do my next 4 games as I don't want to be placed in this low elo.\n\nKind Regards,\nStephanieoHj.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timewiz","date":"2016-11-18T10:37:06.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omfg is happened niceeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!","replies":[]}]}
