I&#039;ll look for that game chat log and post it here for everyone to see. I, probably, will not be able to post the chat logs for everybody, but I will post as much as possible. \r\n\r\nThis is not a topic to bring up negative players and name and shame, we already have enough of that. Let us honor the cool guys here!","replies":[{"poster":"Lusankya","date":"2016-03-25T04:43:32.492+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game with Sudden Fear Chrismistrees the other day and because he was at a cafe and his mic wasn't working he didn't verbally abuse me which was really nice for a change, probably the most fun I have had in a while.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-25T05:07:42.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-03-25T04:56:48.244+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try and be one of those anti-negative players that instantly starts shutting down negative whingers for any reason, \n\n\"OMG YOU SUCK!!! HOW CAN YOU FAIL?!?!?!\n/ all OMG MY TEAM SUCKS HOW CAN THEY BE SO BAD!!! OMG IM PRO AND I LOOK BAD BELIEVE ME IM PRO THEY SUCK!!\"\n\nthat sort of thing, I know alot of you are smurfing, some of you (like myself) are old LoL players that gave their old accounts to friends to use etc etc and when you decided to check if its active years later... Someone claimed it/its been banned etc so you've remade, it puts me in the newer bracket... Some of the champs i dont fully understand till i vs them and have to ask for advice on their abilities. Which can often result in flaming. \n\nFrankly, im only level 19, (only been playing about 10days or so on this account). I've got catching up to do, but i've only met a couple of people actually willing to take a bit of time and notice that a player is trying, and help. The community i fear jumps on the \"BASh A NOOB\" bandwagon too quickly.. especially at low level 1-10 or 11-20 where smurfs wonder how people can be new and 'suck'. Blame their team or just trash talk. What i really don't understand, is why do you feel the need to smurf.... Has your main account been banned / afk/leaver banned (priority qued) and you feel the need to neg bash your team because they're not at the ranked level you are or experience at current situations? Those games where i have huge amount of negative grief that doesn't change, i do enough to not get reported and i report the griefers for unsporsmanlike conduct / negative attitude and move on. Not much else to do. \n\nWhat i find more disappointing is the amount of scripters/bots there are leveling and ruining games, be it vs them or with them. They ruin the human pvp factor and uncertainty of human error/judgement but gain in stacking nukes perfectly and hard switching to priorities in team fights. \n\nBack to the main point... \n\nPositive shout out to the following players (though they're probably all friends on an alt account anyways, im not sure) but here's my list;\n\nKaganz TCB, KEGZ NZL, Koolfkales TCB\n\ni've met cool people that appreciate effort and team work in anyway and even if they've caused a very hard start have listened to advice and tried to help with teamwork when asked etc... \n\nA huge shout out to the people learning who don't get discouraged by the negativity and keep moving forward :) Even though your skill leevels may  not be on par with the smurfs, i enjoy playing with you the most. It leads to more random situations in game than the age old meta strategies.\n\n {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2016-03-26T02:26:19.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a fun game yesterday. I was playing Aurelion Sol and coming off a 4 game losing streak (AND our adc never connected so I was sure it was going to continue) but my team was really friendly and co-operative, and we ended up winning the game. For a match that I expected to be a ff 20 it was really fun (we started roaming together and making dumb plays that usually worked out lol) so shout out to CrtlAltRekt, WhyAlwaysNi and Abysle for the great game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2016-03-25T09:26:25.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played a good game against a rengar, his name is Aralon.
