Did anyone catch last nights match between Legacy and Chiefs?\r\n\r\nThe biggest upset of the week was Sudden Fear vs Immunity with only 10% of players picking Sudden Fear to win!\r\n\r\nIn saying that out of all the players that participated this week there was only 1 winner. Congratulations to Elysium Mons for picking all 8 correctly and winning 250RP.","replies":[]}
