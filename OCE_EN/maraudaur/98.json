There were over 2000 concurrent viewers on the day and we hope everyone enjoyed the matches.\r\n\r\nThe University of Auckland ended up taking out the competition with some insane play from their Top laner Al U. You can check out the final brackets  [here.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/oceanic-university-championship-playoffs)\r\n\r\nSo congratulations to UoA for taking out the competition and we will see you on September the 12th! (Currently creating a plan with [UoALoL club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/UoALoL/) so keep an eye out)\r\n\r\nP.S. Better luck next time UNSW. The match up now between UNSW and UoA is 1 - 1 (UNSW won semester 1 , UoA won semester 2. Both going 3-1 in their victories). Looks like we got a rivalry on our hands =P","replies":[{"poster":"Tomphlosion","date":"2015-08-31T23:51:21.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Raise your Kiwis (gently)","replies":[]}]}
