We have put a short term fix in place that should fix some but not all players MMRs. Unfortunately, to fix all players&#039; MMRs and correct the issue that&#039;s causing players to be seeded incorrectly, we will require some downtime.\n\nWe are working through the best way to roll this fix out and you can expect additional details in the coming week. Thank you for your continued patience!\n\n---\n15/11/2016\n\nA lot of you had to play one placement match today. This was due to a fix going out this morning.\n\nNetwork Operations â€“ 8:14 AM\nWe have rolled out a potential fix for the matchmaking issues in Ranked. If you have already placed into a League, you will need to play one additional placement game to determine your new ranking\n\nYou can now find a more detailed explanation [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks).\n\n---\n\n3:45pm 15/11/2016\n\nLatest update here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks","replies":[{"poster":"sfs","date":"2016-11-13T06:26:03.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've been seeing a few under lvl 30s in Flex queue as well, is this intended or will there be a fix for that as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-13T08:02:27.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that definitely shouldnt be possible.
