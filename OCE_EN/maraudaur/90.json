Let us know =D","subforum":"Community Events","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell us about your event and we’ll see if we can support it with League of Legends swag\n\nWe think it’s awesome that our community hosts events where players get to meet up and enjoy their passion for League of Legends together!\n\nWe provide swag to help make your events more memorable and to thank players that take the time and effort out of their day to attend your event. League swag is there to add to your event, it is a bonus to the overall event experience but by no means should it be the main drawing factor (It’s the cherry on top of the cake, ultimately players would turn up without the extrinsic reward).\n\nIf you or someone you know is going to host an event please direct them to our [events portal](http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/) where you can register your event for visibility and potential swag consideration. Once submitted we will evaluate the event and see if we are able to support your event. Once we know will get in touch through email to communicate what you will be getting and what details we will require. If you need help with the events portal leave a comment below and I will slowly update this post with FAQs as well.\n\nRemember we ask that you do not use the swag as the draw card to your event. Swag should support your event and make it feel even more special. \n\nPlease follow the below guidelines.\n\n**Guidelines**\n\n* Do not sell League swag - It is prohibited to sell League swag under any circumstances. Doing so may see your swag privileges be permanently removed as an event organiser.\n\n* Organisers do not have permission to use the Riot logo.
