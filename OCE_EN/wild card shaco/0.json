I'll be back in 24 hours to see the result.~~\n\nI've chosen Karma, I know technically Yorick won but there's no way in hell I'm playing him. Karma seems like a good champ who i can play top, mid or support.

Revive wise zilean's is superior, but yorick's also fully restore's the champion's mana, albeit for a limited time, thus yorick's ult can be useful on mages as well. It also creates a mirror image of the champ, which is harder to spot than zilean's ult, and can provide additional damage output even if the champion dies not die.\n\nMordekaiser' sand yorick's ult seem similar on first glance, but are actually very different. Mordekaiser' sis arguably much better as it drains a small amount of health, and the ghost scales off the champion itself as well as mordekaiser. Whereas yorick's ult is a defensive skill which scales off a small amount of the ally's stats only. However, mordekaiser's ult is essentially a time limit where you must kill the target, and the target will simply try to escape, while yorick's can be easily cast at any time.","replies":[{"poster":"daveeyx","date":"2015-01-21T11:03:54.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just going to add to this, Yorick's ult is better than both, especially if you have a hyper carry, because it guarantees another 10s of team fight potential. Yorick ults a friendly Vayne and she literally kills the rest of the enemy team before the timer runs out, whereas with the Zilean ult what usually happens is as soon as the champ is revived, they just get focussed again and die instantly. \n\nI actually play Yorick quite a lot and I love the fact he's so rare.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlimyDan","date":"2015-01-20T15:00:28.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=daveeyx,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gREfse3I,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-19T08:43:16.363+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:83}} \n> \n> Dominates top lane, out sustains everyone, kid you not.\n\nI remember facing a Yorick as Shen and I had no idea what he did at the time so I  played how I normally would as Shen but somehow I managed to poke Yorick out of lane, which now that I'm a little more knowledgeable seems like an impossible feat.\n\nAnyway for champions I personally like Wukong. He can go jungle but has to make his first back quite early, he can go top and he can even go mid and do well against a fair few match ups.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-19T09:06:19.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=daveeyx,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gREfse3I,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-19T08:43:16.363+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:83}} \n> \n> Dominates top lane, out sustains everyone, kid you not.\n\nhe is a disgusting champ that needs to be stopped, had the worst game against one and i will never, i mean NEVER forget that game!!","replies":[{"poster":"honk honk","date":"2015-01-19T09:26:17.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's too dirtyyy.

Winning that many games in a row isn't about skill... it's about luck.\n\nUnless you want to risk playing only Yorick for the rest of your life (or backing out of this challenge) you should really lower it to fifteen or even ten. Either that, or say \"win 20 out of 25 games.\" It would still indicate that you're doing consistently well with the champ, without requiring such a crazy lucky streak when it comes to your teammates. Imagine you're at 24 wins then you get queued with a DC.\n\nAs for champ suggestions, {{champion:3}} .
