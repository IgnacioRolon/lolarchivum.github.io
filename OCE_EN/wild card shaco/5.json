This way, people will be punished for a kill steal. Overall the amount of gold earned by the TEAM for a kill is the same, but it is balanced between the killer and person they stole it from differently.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a cool idea to put into the game.\r\nPlease share this if you agree and give me any feedback/constructive criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-03T11:32:54.317+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically:\n- If a team mate of mine engages an enemy but fails to kill them, leaving them with less than 25% health, and I **SECURE THE KILL** for my team, I'm punished?\n- If I engage an enemy with an ally but my ally deals 3 times as much damage as I do and I happen to deal the killing blow, I'm punished?\n- If a team mate of mine engages an enemy but ends up needing to retreat, but has also left the enemy with less than 25% health, and I **SAVE THEM**, I'm punished?\n- And, to top it all off, the announce names and shames me?\n\n***HELL NO!***\n\nPS: Poll is biased, no option for \"Hell no!\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-04T01:10:53.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"NO SUCH THING AS KILL STEALING!
