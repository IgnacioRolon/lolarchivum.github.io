So I looked on the numbers:\n10 MINUTES +8 AP or 5 AD\n20 MINUTES +24 AP or 14 AD\n30 MINUTES +48 AP or 29 AD\n40 MINUTES +80 AP or 48 AD\n50 MINUTES +120 AP or 72 AD\n60 MINUTES +168 AP or 101 AD\netc.\nI noticed that if I look on the AP numbers, they can all be divided by 8. This led to this:\n1,3,6,10,15,21\nLuckily, I know what this is. This is what is called \"Triangular number\" and the formula for it is: \nT =n(n+1)  / 2.\nwhich leads to the final formula for AP(Ap):\nAp=T×8\n**Ap=((n×(n+10))/200)*8**\nex: 10 mins\n((10×(10+10))/200)×8=8\n_Where \"n\" are the minutes, but please realize it can be only in a form of 10, 20, 30, etc. simply because of how Gathering itself works._\nAD formula is nearly the same:\n**((n×(n+10))/200)×4.8**\n(It's also important to note that the values for AD above are already rounded.)\n\nFor those who would want to know more about Triangular number, here's the link:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number","replies":[{"poster":"MyLoveIsMaryJane","date":"2019-07-16T00:38:43.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you dude was wondering aswell :)\nBut I kinda dont understand why there is n(n+10)/200\nand not n(n+1)/2 as the regular formula of triangular numbers claims(in terms of splitting the steps into 10,20,30 etc i understand that u use +10 but dunno how u got the /200 )","replies":[{"poster":"AFKWarning","date":"2019-09-28T21:04:09.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nI am glad you asked. Here's the explanation.\nIn the regular formula, the +1 part is eqvivalent to the fact that you allways add one point to the n-polygon. But in the case of Gathering storm, you allways add 10. That's the reason why I put +10 part. \n\nIf I would use this current formula now like this:\nn(n+10)/2\n10(10+10)/2=200/2=100\n20(20+10)/2=600/2=300\n30(30+10)2=1200/2=600\n(You can already see it.)\nETC.\nWe get the triangle numbers sequence, but they're all multiplied by 100. So to solve thise, we need to multiply the divider by 100. Therefor /200.\n=>n(n+10)/200\n\nI hope this was helpful to you and others who wondered my reasoning behind the formula.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-06T23:44:59.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"What exactly is the point of this post, most of us aren't math nerds and couldn't care less about the formula.\n\nPost something relevant next time","replies":[{"poster":"MobEpicMob","date":"2019-01-14T20:18:32.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"actually, i was really interested what the formula was\ni wondered how/why does this \"8\" AP turn into \"24\" then into \"48\" and so on\nthe guy above explained it satisfyingly well for me\nbut yes, it was unnecessarily detailed\nit seems that it was simple, \"the prev + n*8\"","replies":[{"poster":"AFKWarning","date":"2019-09-28T21:10:26.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nThank you for your possitive comment.

Reason being no one obviously seemed to know how it works on the internet nor the wiki. Or so I susspected from my searchings of this information. There also have been many posts and questions about the mechanism behind this rune. From this I thought it was relevant enough to explain it to other players.\n\nI hope I answered you well.","replies":[]}]}]}
