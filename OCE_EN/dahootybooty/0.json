How on earth do we get that Sona Emote?!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like I&#039;m going crazy... Am I the only person in OCE wondering how I can get hold of that limited addition Sona emote that&#039;s ONLY distributed by content creators? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if Riot knows this, but there are next to none big content creators in OCE, the only two I can think of (Tilterella and Jay Sea) haven&#039;t mentioned anything about it... nor is there one word of info on the client.\r\n\r\nI even contacted Riot support and this was their answer:\r\n&quot;I can&#039;t give you any specific places you can go, but lots of different content creators should have them - check out streamers on twitch etc and you should be able to find someone who&#039;s giving them out!&quot;\r\n\r\nSure, let me find that 12 subscriber OCE streamer who is mysteriously part of the partnership, they&#039;ll pop up way above imaqtpie or the LCK that is streaming right now.\r\n\r\nLike... if your&#039;re going to trail out a new partnership system can you at least please give us some info about it? ANY info?! I&#039;d love a chance to earn that emote, but I can when I literally have no idea how to go about it.\r\n\r\nWhat a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"ReportMeFeeding","date":"2018-10-18T17:52:27.645+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now its a green infernal amumu chroma that they are giving away.
