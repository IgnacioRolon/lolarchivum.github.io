Scammed or wait???","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ordered some merch from the Riot games merch official site found through the game, and reluctantly paid the excessive international shipment fees. A couple of days later I got an email with a tracking number.  That was the 11.02. I just tried it and it says this tracking number can't be found. \r\nShould I just report as a scam and get a refund from paypal, or would there be a legit. reason for this? If i leave it too long even PayPal can't help me get my money back.\r\nPlease someone tell me what to do?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-13T13:42:52.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you send a ticket to Player Support they should be able to see the status of your order: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nWould also be worth checking your mailbox for a \"your item has been delivered to the nearest post office\" slip.\n\nWhile there is a scenario where your package may have been lost, it certainly wouldn't be intentional. From personal experience, I know that the tracking sites are often buggy or down, and have never had an item not be delivered eventually from Riot, so I wouldn't be inclined to worry too much.","replies":[]}]}
