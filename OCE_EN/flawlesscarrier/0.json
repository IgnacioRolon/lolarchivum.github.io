While all this is happening on LoL I&#039;m still perfectly able to use the internet to watch streams, use spotify and EVEN PLAY OTHER GAMES WITH STABLE PING while I&#039;m sitting there on 1k+ on League.\r\n\r\nI noticed this has been happening since reworked Shen was released and I&#039;ve encounter this exact issue throughout last year and it kinda comes and goes as it pleases. I&#039;ve tried disabling iphelper and peer to peer transfer on the client, not too keen on copping low prios so hopefully there&#039;s a fix I haven&#039;t tried yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-02T05:01:16.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey FlawlessCarrier,\n\nCould you perform all the steps on the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), then if possible test your connection in a Custom match? If that doesn't help, run a [tracert following the steps here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) and post the results so we can see where the lag starts.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
