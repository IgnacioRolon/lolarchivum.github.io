I totally flamed someone, and said a nasty thing, and I deserved to play 10 games with limited chat experience i&#039;m fine with that.\r\nMy honor reset and I&#039;ve unlocked it.\r\nI Just wanted to know, will I not be getting any rewards? I have unlocked my honor, and been a good summoner, but I just really don&#039;t want to be diamond and have 0 rewards, especially since I do play the champ the skin is coming out for and of course my boarder. \r\nI enjoy the game, and I haven&#039;t been toxic in a long time, I just don&#039;t want 1 game to suddenly decide i don&#039;t get anything for my grind this year. Just because it also happened to be close to the end.","replies":[{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-23T02:08:24.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ain't getting the rewards man.
