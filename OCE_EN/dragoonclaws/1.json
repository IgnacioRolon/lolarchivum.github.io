Many times, I&#039;ve been paired with people very over or very below my level. In one game, I keep dying because a player is mega OP, and in another game, I keep getting fed. I then realize at the need of the game that me (lvl17) have been playing against a lvl28 with Tier 1 runes, or a lvl9 player. It&#039;s either really frustrating because you&#039;re the source of the enemy feeding, or there is no honor in winning because you just massacred a new player and he is not even understanding why all this is happening. Don&#039;t expect them to like the game because of such unfairness. Blind pick must not mix Tier 1 players (lvl20-30) with tier 2 (lvl10-19) or tier 3 (lvl1-9). For team builders, it should not allow such mixes as well.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-01T05:33:57.552+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think this is true in a sense but then again you need to learn to verse people who are harder and more skilled then you so you can learn off them, yes its annoying to verse people higher then you but that is how you learn and i know you don't like beating people under you but if you do get matched with that then help them out, give them some advice to improve and help them on their journey to level 30. but yeah the match making is bait ehhh but what can you do","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-05-02T09:35:03.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arclight Vayne,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=f7MbtR8X,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-01T06:13:18.511+0000)\n>\n> if you vsed people your skill level you wouldn't learn anything :^) but then again. playing normals you don't learn anything from that either :^) go play ranked noober.\n\nYou will be surprised what you learn versing people of your skill level.   Some of us research builds and why, but the key is you're playing someone as apprehensive/aggressive/bad, which gives a bit of forgiveness.   Being spanked by a smurf 10+ times in 15 mins teaches you nothing, but how to leave the game and lose the company money....oh thats right, the player base also dwindles and then you never have anyone you can beat because they're all your level and schooling you....\nYou need a fair skill level player out there.   Or less thick skinned players leave the game, never learn anything, because alot of bad@trolling players ruin the process of proceeding.   \nBalancing the player level is a start, but when I was trialling PvP, it was only +5/-5 to mm.  Even that is a huge player difference. (Lvl 3 runes vs 2 and 5 more points in masteries adds up...plus flash/smites etc)\nBut until we have more players, that aren't smurfs seal clubbing, you're stuck with limited options that the designers can implement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nommable","date":"2015-05-02T08:10:52.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As others have said, the majority of people are at level 30 and that OCE doesn't have enough players to fill a lower level game, but your region tag on your username says NA so that may also be the case in North America, even with its massive population.\nAnother factor you could consider is the time of day when you're playing. I'm sure you know when peak hour is in your region of choice.\nAlso, I'm not sure if you're referring to the Team Builder queue or the Blind Pick queue but from my experience Team Builder is far less popular than Blind Pick so the system has less players to choose from. Many people would say 'just go blind pick' but for me there is a certain element of fear when jumping into the queue so if this is your reason, then I understand.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Dragoonclaws,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=f7MbtR8X,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-01T03:50:38.582+0000) there is no honor in winning because you just massacred a new player and he is not even understanding why all this is happening\n\nI agree.
