Like if anyone on the team could give anyone else up to 200g. But again, it can lead to some negative outcomes as well as, the ability to not be able to punish a bad laner.\n\nIf someone is better than another person in lane, they should be rewarded for it my making their opponent lose CS or \"not be able to lane\" due to low HP. Any system that allows gold/item sharing takes away from this advantage for no real reason.\n\nAlso, if you want to heal your ADC, theres always champs with healing abilities, relic shield, redemption, athenes and the fruit in the river.","replies":[]}]}
