Ideas as to how to get it faster and much more efficient, riot please read!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":6,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hello folks, before we start, lets make this article catch riots eye, everyone who reads this article upvote it if you think it should work like this \r\nBlue Essence farming; is nearly impossible right? Why don&#039;t we make a new system that goes like this....\r\nYour first win of the day (525 EXP Bonus) will give you an orb of blue essence (we&#039;ll call this orb X, X is the amount of BE you get based on your level) Now you&#039;re probably thinking wait, if i&#039;m level 30 i only get 30 Blue Essence?! No! The conversion from IP to Blue Essence was 1 IP = 8 or 10 Blue Essence (I think? I don&#039;t remember) So instead of getting only that much you&#039;ll get 100 amount of Blue essence time X, X being your level, so level 10 you get 1,000, 20 2,000, 30 3,000, 40 4,000 etc... now what will happen in the long run is it will be cut down (When you hit a really high level say level 200) it&#039;ll be 50 per level instead of 100, (By then you&#039;ll have all champions unlocked esp if you&#039;ve been playing a while) Once you hit milestone levels (50, 100, 150 etc) you get a &quot;large orb of blue essence&quot; which will grant you an immense amount of blue essence. The catch to this though is that there will be a cap on the amount of essence you can horde (We&#039;ll call this 200,000 blue essence) Once you get to that cap you must spend it otherwise you cannot earn more untl you spend it!\r\nWhat&#039;s your thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-10T08:57:40.037+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea.

Then you are the cause of it not changing. \nYou want something like Riot to go \" CRAP WE NEED TO FIX IT \" Dont give them money.\n\nThen say why you aren't going to buy RP and how they can fix for you to buy RP again.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-10T08:11:27.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Numbers are a bit too high but this is definitely better than the current system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-11-13T07:16:02.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your idea is good, but it might be a bit too much.\n\nHow about this, instead of getting Blue Essence after every game, have something new like Essence Points.\nLike if riot make it so that you gain Essence Points after every game, once you gained 100 Essence Points or more, you get five times the Blue Essence from that much points, e.g, 100x5=500, once you gained 200 Essence Points or more, you get ten times the Blue Essence from that much points, once you gained 300 Essence Points or more, you get fifteen times the Blue Essence from that much Essence Points, once you gained 400 Essence Points or more, you get twenty times the Blue Essence from that much points, once you gained 500 Essence Points or more, you get twenty five times the Blue Essence from that much points.\nIf you have gained 500 Essence Points or more, you have reached the limit, and you cannot gain any more Essence Points until 14 days later/30 days later. After 14 days/30 days, Essence Points will reset itself and you can start the process over again.\nNote: Essence Points is not a form of currency that you can use to purchase anything, it is something that will help you earn Blue Essence.\nTutorial and Training mode does not give you Essence Points.\nCustom mode does not give you Essence Points even if you play with other players and both sides are even.\nIntro bots mode does not give you Essence Points, regardless of whether you win or lose.\nBeginner bots gives you 2 Essence Points per minute, and if you lose the game, you lose 25% of the total Essence Points, if you win, you get as much as the time you have spent to play the game.\nIntermediate bots gives you 4 Essence Points per minute, if you lose the game, you lose 15% of the total Essence Points you would get by winning.\nAll Howling Abyss game gives you 3 Essence Points per minute, if you lose the game, you lose 20% of the total Essence Points you would get by winning.\nAll PVP Summonor's rift, whether Normal or Ranked, gives you 10 Essence Points per minute, and if you lose the game, you lose 10% of the total Essence Points you would get by winning.\nI said this because I don't think it is necessary to get Blue Essence after every game, since every time you level up, you get chest that contains shards and Blue Essence anyway.\nThe way to earn Essence Points is not hard at all, it is just that you only get Blue Essence once you reached certain number of Essence Points\nI don't know if this idea is stupid or not, tell me if you are not satisfied with this idea.\nThis feature is only a suggestion, and it does not have to be implemented.\n\nMaybe when Season 8 hits, things are going to be different and you may find that capsule would be enough for you. There are still things that Riot is working on at the moment, if I am not mistaken.","replies":[]}]}
