I was never 100% sure...until now.\r\n\r\nWatch the full replay i've attached, use this guide to play the replay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYucvwWmd1w\r\n\r\nOk..so I'm teemo, went toward river first then top, nidalee drops a ward and sees me traveling top..fine. Now that the only time any of their team sees me, now I travel to the brush at top and wait. Now cause of teemo passive I can cloak anyway so i'm cloaked in brush and stay still.  Garen gets to lane late, now as by the replay..no wards nothing...then suddenly the nidalee PINGS RIGHT ON TOP OF ME....not anywhere in the brush..ON TOP OF ME in the brush...garen walks over and spins me...now ingame I was like WTF...I could have been cloaked anywhere..literally anywhere in that top half of map.\r\n\r\nNow if you think that is random, our pyke was complaining about nidalee hitting him while he was cloaked too, watch the whole replay...but as for me..I was convinced in the first 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nI could also argue the nidalee was also using scripts...but hey, I spose every Iron 2 nidalee looks like she throwing guided spears too right, followed up by that perfect execution combo? lol\r\n\r\nAnyway, what you think?","replies":[]}
