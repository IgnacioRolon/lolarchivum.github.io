I just lost one of my provisional's because our jungler didn't connect. This particular game I do believe wouldn't have been a loss if we had a 5th player, as I went 17/1/12 and my other team mates were significantly fed. So the question I pose is this: Why don't we get loss prevented when one of our teammates doesn't connect? Is the current system fair?","replies":[{"poster":"Oddfuturex","date":"2015-01-25T01:43:19.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's obviously a technical issue! The rule could apply both ways, if you were able to prove that you were unable to connect, then you would also get loss prevention, and so would your unlucky teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-25T00:13:02.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be technical issues.\n\nAnd Loss Prevented doesn't work like that. Loss Prevented is enabled for when there's a huge issue affecting a significant amount of players (read: all of them). It can't be done on an individual basis.\n\nIt's a shame that it was on your provisionals, but it's not like they're doing it on purpose. If they didn't connect to the game at all, it could just mean something about their connection, and that they're probably angry that they're getting a leave marker for when they didn't leave on purpose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oddfuturex","date":"2015-01-24T23:28:46.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The link to my game: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/76734736/200023615?tab=overview","replies":[]}]}
