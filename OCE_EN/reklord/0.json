Afterwards i was informed that i had been placed in lower priority queue and have to wait 20 minutes to get into queue every game for 5 games. Anyone know how to get a hold of someone to fix this. Pretty annoying how i have no say in when this happens and im not really wanting to play anymore because of it","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T03:19:00.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shouldn't ban you if it only happens once.
