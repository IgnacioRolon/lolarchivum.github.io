So around pre-season and the start of the new season, everyone jumps on, baddies, trolls, good players, those who are and will climb from true determination and the rest. From around the start of the season to mid year, a lot of the baddies and trolls who fail nearly every year try again but fall face flat, ruin games for everyone but will eventually stop playing ranked or play a lot less. So the ranked games get a little better. As mid year rolls into end of the year, end of the season, nearly all the baddies and trolls who know they can't climb also quit. We are then left with the good players and mainly those who will climb from true determination and hard work. But then the cycle starts over when the season ends and pre-season begins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-11-11T15:57:55.673+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also seem to be getting nothing but the worst trash players on my team I've seen in a long time! \n\nWtf happened?

You would expect that from experience comes some sort of improvement.

Riot, get your game on and give power back to the players.\n\nI dislike this post in a few ways, firstly, Flex isn't based off solo MMR, myself as a bronze player has been consistently matched with golds and above, last game I even had a challenger main as the enemy ADC. The reason why people are ragey and salty is because of this. Not everyone can play the game with the skills of higher elo (Plat+), some of us are what most people from those brackets would call \"Bads\" or \"Baddies\".\n\nWhat im trying to say is, people need to be a little more considerate when playing in Flex as the MMR differences are crazy and well.. some of us aren't faker and can't compete at that level.\n\nAnother point id like to make is LoL has always been one of the worst communities, if not the worst, for toxic and abusive behavior. It ain't never going to change im afraid.\n\nAs for some other people calling others trash and being ragey, you aren't helping in any way shape or form, especially when you come across a lower elo player, start calling them trash and bad, how do you expect that person to get better when no ones willing to hand out some friendly advice and maybe help the person instead of raging and calling them names. It doesn't make people play better, your actually shooting yourself in the foot by lowering that persons self esteem. This is where people turn from good people to bad (toxic/abusive/trolls) kind of people.","replies":[{"poster":"Kiryuuin Satsuki","date":"2016-11-16T07:38:22.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xSynx,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=JgfHvIs3,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-11-14T12:14:29.034+0000)\n>\n> I dislike this post in a few ways, firstly, Flex isn&#x27;t based off solo MMR, myself as a bronze player has been consistently matched with golds and above, last game I even had a challenger main as the enemy ADC.

But Riot do admit that Flex Q is broken and has only made a band-aid for it. You can read up on it on S@20. \n\nAs for the rage and calling other trash, I'm sure you are directing it at those who do act in this particular way. Just in case you were directing it at me, if it helps, I do have a honor badge for being friendly for 3 seasons straight. So I know what you mean and how you feel about the community. It does sadden me that the trolls and baddies (as in bad mannered players) far out weigh the good and decent people like you and I. That is why I really want the tribunal to make a come back in tandem with the current system. Like I said in the opening post, you can't let a machine do work that is something like a court room.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2016-11-12T05:15:21.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trolls are insane, just had a game we were winning, then about 15 mins in our jungler and sup go afk in fountain at the same time without a word said in game chat so im pretty sure they were duo.
