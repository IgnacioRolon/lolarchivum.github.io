This allows you to gain or lose more mmr depending on the result of your first few games, with the very first game being the most decisive in terms of where you end up, and the last game being the least important. The win-loss of placements is kind of irrelevant, it's more about whether you can win the first few in a row and inflate your mmr. Duoing with a higher ranked player also helps (you, not them), since if you can scape in a win during your first game or so, you'll earn a massive chunk of mmr and your deviation won't increase much since early games in almost all mmr system have deviation capping, get a few more of those in the first few games to reduce your deviation and earn a few scratches of mmr, and you've basically placed yourself already within the first 6 games. You can lose the last 4 in a row and it won't have nearly as much of an impact.\n\nIf you win the first 6, then lose 4,  you'll get placed alot higher (around an entire division) than if you did that in the reverse order, even though both were technically 6-4, because the mmr system perceives the first few matches to have a much higher weight.\n\nThis is just how all mmr systems work after a soft reset, if you play enough, you'll always end up where you belong, but your first few placements is where the real battle is.","replies":[{"poster":"dumbledore2016","date":"2018-01-20T05:20:41.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok, thank you for explaining it to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-19T04:17:45.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're probably right, but give the calculations are hidden we don't now how similar or otherwise Riot's MMR system is to others.
