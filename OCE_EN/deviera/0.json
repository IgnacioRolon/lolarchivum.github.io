The way the alpha client has set the chat message system up is just awkward, the chats are in random order and not in order of most recently talked to or even alphabetical which also annoys me greatly. I appreciate the time they&#039;ve put into trying to improve the client, and don&#039;t get me wrong; I can adjust with time to the rest of the updated client but the chat system just puts me off from chatting with friends on league.\r\n {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-11T11:37:39.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I prefer it in it's new set-up and, as far as I can tell, it actually does order them in \"most recent\" format. Perhaps it's just not always working as intended yet, after all the client has only just gone into Beta. There's bound to be a deal more issues to sort out.\n\nHonestly, I feel it would be a much better move on Riot's part if there was an option to alternate between the \"legacy\" chat layout and the \"updated\" chat layout. I honestly feel that a lot of \"legacy vs updated\" layout options would go a long way to not only pleasing the community but also allowing for a smoother transition, since people will be able to make the change at a pace more suited to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Deviera","date":"2016-11-11T12:40:07.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a great suggestion, thanks for the input! if riot could honestly add an option to switch around the layout with the chat system just like the in-game champion icons following the updated HUD. I think it'd be highly beneficial for players who have a preference with the two different chat layouts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sc  Nickzeekid","date":"2016-11-11T11:11:23.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What i Love the new chat!\nthe way it confuses me, the way its in the way its just rushed...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyahs huge","date":"2016-11-12T02:43:34.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't mind new layout cause they basically just copied DOTA's layout.
