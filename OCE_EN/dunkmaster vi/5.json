It also doensn't have bans and you can't see the enemy picks anyway so what is the damn point anyway.\r\n\r\nBut anyway you removed draft pick in the argument that the ques where too long. Yet this was said in the time where URF was active and half the community was playing that. So realistically the data was pretty damn flawed as it was. That is like saying Oh people aren't going to doughnut king any more when there is a krispy kreme next door that is only going to be open for 2 weeks. Then expect for the business of that doughnut king to stay exactly the same. Obviously that is going to have a negative impact on the numbers. Now i am queuing in team builder to prove a point i will probably hit 20 minutes before i even get into a game. I NEVER waited more than 5 minutes for draft pick. Maybe some people with diamond mmr actually had troubles but the majority of the community was fine with the ques and still qued anyway so there isn't a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-03-06T06:49:42.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy answer, **remove blind pick and replace with TB and draft. \n**\nTB for people who want to play the role they want every time.\nDraft for those that want structure and bans. \nEasy.","replies":[{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2015-03-06T06:56:02.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you but riot avoids any topic that makes them look slightly bad","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2015-03-06T06:47:39.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I spent 17 minutes queing to get into a game\n\n20 mins to form team \n\n3 mins to wait in  que until someone abandoned\n\nso there we have it 40 mins to que for not even getting into a game now i don't think teambuilder is working i NEVER had to wait more than 3 minuites at prime time to play lol for draft pick \n\nteambuilder is liteally 10x worse que time than draft pick yet you justified that draft pick was removed because of que times yet you wont remove teambuilder when it's que times are far more severe.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
