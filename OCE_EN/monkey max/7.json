I waited it out but it wouldn&#039;t fix itself and I couldn&#039;t close the game either to try and reconnect. My internet was otherwise fine, working on my phone and even on the same computer apart from league of legends. Woke up this morning to be slapped with a 20 min leaverbuster which I feel is pretty bs considering it&#039;s not my fault that something yourside kicked me out of the game.\r\nAny way i could get this revoked?","replies":[]}
