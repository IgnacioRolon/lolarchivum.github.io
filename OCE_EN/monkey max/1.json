Atm I&#039;m trying to learn Fiora, I&#039;ve only played two games on her and I got an S+ and and S, was wondering is Fiora super OP or am I just a natural god (yeah that&#039;s never gonna happen).

I meet Summoner101 in ranked the next day, Im still playing Azir, but they are now Vayne with 700,000 mastery points.\nNaturally it's going to be a much harder game.\n\nIt further compounds the problem when people get autofilled, now I'm not playing Azir, I'm playing Varus who I have far far far less experience with, and I'm still vsing a 700,000 mastery Vayne.\n_(in saying this, I still believe autofill is necessary)_\n\nThat is one of the reasons Ranked games seem to be harder.\nAlso not to mention people are paying more attention, taking less risks, etc.\nWhen 'Joe Blogs' dies in ranked, he's not going to alt tab and watch youtube until he's alive again, like he might do in normals.\n\nIt's a whole accumulation of small things like that.\n\n_________\n\nAs for Fiora, she is a strong versatile champion. As one of the dreaded melee-crit swordsmen type champions she is certainly in the upper tiers of champion strength. But as far as the crit-swordsmen themselves go (Yasuo/Trynd/Yi etc.) she is the bottom of the pile. \n\nShe is a good champion, I probably wouldnt call her OP, as unlike the other melee crit champs, she has very clear counterplay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TOTALL BEASTMODE","date":"2018-03-04T03:25:00.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-04T09:10:07.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bit slow in NA i see ðŸ˜‰","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-18T11:48:10.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because everyone in Ranked usually plays their best champs and tryhards","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-18T10:42:30.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people feel the need to troll and int feed in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2017-06-18T10:31:23.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're new to the game, \"https://www.op.gg/champion/statistics\" this will be your best friend. It'll show you useful statistics on each and every champion and also will show how to build on the champion in terms of items, runes and masteries. Obviously ranked is more difficult than normal games because the people who play ranked are more serious on winning the game than as opposed to players in normal games.

They also tend to focus objectives and focus on winning more.\n\nIn normals people play off roles, random champions they want to try and a lot of the time, don't care about objectives, they simply run around looking for kills.\nYou can definitely tell the difference between a Jungle main and a person just playing jungle.\n\nLooking at your stats, it says you only have 138 normal wins. Now, if you win more than you lose, thats still less than 300 normal games played. I personally feel that not enough to play Ranked and go in with all the tools you need.\n\nLooking at your Rune pages you dont own any Quints. Again, you should never play ranked with anything less than a full optimal rune page of level 3 runes.\n\nThere are 3 main rules you should follow before playing ranked:\n\n1. Do you have proper runes/masteries and know how to build champions properly.\n\n2. Do you know atleast 2 roles very well but are able to play all roles if called upon.\n\n3. Know what EVERY champion in the game does. You should know how each champion works and what their abilities do at a minimum. It is also good to know mana costs, cooldowns of abilties and powerspikes but those will come in time.","replies":[]}]}
