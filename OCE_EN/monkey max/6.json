For me I had to play games secretly throughout all my teenagehood because my parents despise all video games regardless of forms or any content, they also never negotiate on anything.\n\n.............\n\nIn your case, you could always arrange game times/schedules so that the \"you can't leave\" isn't so much of a problem. \n\nHowever that said, your parents' concern on the game's usually toxic playerbase and addictive qualities really ain't wrong, you can't deny that. But if you still wanna play League you could also convince them that:\n\n1) You ain't toxic.\n2) You can cope with toxic.\n3) You aren't addicted. You just like League that's all.\n\nIf you can prove these 3 points I'm sure your parents wouldn't be supervising you too much, given that your parents are understanding.\n\nAnd it's not like League is the only game, there are many MANY more out there. If your parents aren't just hating on games as a whole, there are a lot of workable solutions and alternatives you know; such as switching to singleplayer games for one already solves all of the concerns your parents raised, as well as switching to games with more laxed community (most games outside of MOBA, sports games and massively popular FPS like CoD tend to have chiller community). Just foods for thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-02-12T20:45:47.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah... they don't like video but but particularly hate lol =(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Derikay","date":"2017-02-12T16:11:03.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually this.
