I don&#039;t really understand that much about what makes a champion &#039;meta&#039; or &#039;strong&#039;, and I haven&#039;t seen Jinx played in any pro games I&#039;ve watched since I started. She seems pretty strong to me, because no matter how behind you are, you just need to farm for your IE and Runaans and then you&#039;re suddenly a carry lord. Could someone please explain to me what makes her worse than other ADC&#039;s?","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-05-16T09:26:03.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid unless some changes happen she isn't going to be in the meta anytime soon. As been Diamond, i know at least some game knowledge. \nTo understand why a champ isn't in the meta you need to know what that champion is.\nJinx is a champ that has no mobility, meaning she needs her team to protect her or she gets burst. \nHer early game is weak compared to other adcs as her abilities require at least lv 4 or 5 for them to actually help her do noticeable damage. \nThe meta currently this season is heavily focused on early/mid game snowball and ending the game before players can purchase full build. \nThe creation of this early game meta was intentional by Riot, (unfortunately) as they wanted to games to end quicker.\nIn season 7 the turrets were nerfed, having only 3300 hp instead of 4000hp  in season 6 and nexus and inner turrets no longer do increased damage over time to a target, making tanks more viable.Assassin update plus lethality buffs also gave assassins more early game damage.\nTherefore, champs who are able to protect themselves from assassins and can early/mid game snowball is highly picked. (e.g Lucian, ezreal and caitlyn)\nSo jinx, having no mobility and requires late game snowball stands no chance against aggressive early/mid game assassins and tower diving tanks, which is why she is currently gone from the meta {{champion:222}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-14T12:09:08.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx is a very strong champion, and she is definitely not 'worse' than other ADCs.\nHowever what is strong for one level of play isn't necessarily the same for a different level.\n\nFor example Yasuo and Master Yi are some of the most hated champions in lower elo (Bronze to Gold) because they are easy to play _(although Yasuo is hard to master)_ and do a metric f*ckton of damage very quickly, which doesn't leave much room for counterplay. So naturally they are over played and over powered in lower elo.\n\nBut one of the reasons they are powerful in low elo, is because people at that level don't know how to play against them, or even if they do, lack the skill to implement the theory in real time practice.\n\nThe pros however, know how, and can play against them, so their effectiveness is somewhat more limited because everyone knows how to shut them down. So as a result, these champions rarely find their way onto the pro scene.\n\nThe reverse is also true, champions like Janna are often discarded in lower elo, in favour of champions that have a more visible impact on the game _(such as Blitzcrank and Thresh)_ But when you are a pro and have the mechanics to dodge all the pulls and hooks, Blitz and Thresh become less useful, and Janna with all her not-so-visible strength, brings forth the power we don't get to see in lower elo.\n\nMy guess is that there are ADCs that better fit the pro level of play.\nIt could be that Jinx is a very good generalist, which is good for all kinds of team comps _(which is how low elo works)_, but when it comes to a specific team of champions _(one that has been planned out by the coaches for high elo play)_ there are ADCs that better fit into that specific niche.\n\n______\n\nBut Jinx is far from weak! she is a hyper-carry, which means that at full build she has more impact on the game than the majority of other champions _(but takes a while to get there of course)_.\n\nAlso for a majority of last year _(in my elo at least)_, if you didn't have a Vayne, Jinx, or Trist on your team, your chances of winning dropped drastically. To the point where people started banning all 3 of them, just to have a fair game.\n\nSo she definitely isn't weak. \nAre there stronger ADCs in the current meta? Yes.\nIs Jinx bottom of the pile? Hell No.\n\n______\n\nBut if I were you, I wouldn't be cut up about not seeing her in pro play. Any champions picked by crowd favourite teams instantly have their pick rates tripled in the lower elos _(cos sheep)_. So unless you like mirror lanes, pray that your champ isn't picked by SKT or TSM or any of those others :P\n\n**My opinion is:** If you like a champion, play them! It doesn't matter how strong or weak they are, with enough practice you'll always still be able to climb with them anyway.\n\nHave fun with the loose cannon!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-05-15T09:36:19.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed answer!

She is very strong and is fine to play.\n\nI would say that as you said, she requires 2-3 items to \"switch on\", whereas the in meta ADC i.e. Lucian and Xayah only really need 1 item.\n\nAlso a shift away from \"peeling\" supports to mage/damage supports doesnt help Hyper carries who require protection as they are usually immobile.\n\nI think once pros start to play on this new \"tank\" patch, you will see her more often, but right now with only MSI on and playing on 7.8, the meta as dictated by pro play hasn't changed yet.","replies":[]}]}
