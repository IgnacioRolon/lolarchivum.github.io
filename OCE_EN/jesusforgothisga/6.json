Controlling behaviors are designed to manipulate people into doing what the abuser wants them to do under the guise of love or respect or abject fear.\n\nScenario:\n\n1. I&#039;m already chat restricted which I accept, not denying that as I was semi toxic in some of my earlier games. Live and learn right? So my chat is already restricted.\n2. ~10-20 minutes into the game we are absolutely getting curb stomped and we are down 2 inhibs. We also have a feeding top lane but no one says a word, team accepts it, play along and all is well. Ask the team to surrender at 20 mins but 2 decline.\n3. ~25-30 minutes comes around and the game is essentially over. Their team is fed hard, we are down to last inhib turret at ~30% and they have baron buff. So I ask the team to surrender. 2 decline and the game goes on.\n4. A few minutes later with one last push we lose and that&#039;s game.\n\nNow here lies the part to which I don&#039;t understand. At no point in the game did I attack a player, verbally abuse anyone, single out a person, make a nasty comment, swear.... absolutely nothing! However I am reported for verbal abuse once we hit the lobby... wtf!\n\nThe only thing I can possibly think of is me asking the team to ff and saying it&#039;s pretty much game over didn&#039;t sit well with a person or a duo couple who then reported me. Either that or the report was somehow delayed from a much earlier game where I was kind of toxic and received my ban (which is fair enough)\n\nCan someone please shed some light on as to how the &quot;automated&quot; side of things work? I would assume it tries to pickup on common words, phrases  etc to determine if the report is justified?\n\nOr is it merely &#039;well you got reported my 2-3 people so you must of been toxic&#039;?\n\nI've read through the FAQ on the reporting side of things, however it's very brief and vague as to how the automated part of it works.","replies":[]}
