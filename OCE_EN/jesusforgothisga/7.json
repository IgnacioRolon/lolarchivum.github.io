I said and I quote \"you should leave the farm for nasus\". Oh well I guess I hit a sore point because he goes off the rails and afterwards reports me for verbal abuse and apparently being toxic.\n\nHonestly I come across this same attitude in a lot of games. You make one simple comment on something and next minute everyone wants to report you. Then you get people jumping on the bandwagon because you're losing and feel the need to take it out on someone via reports etc.\n\nIf we could just have an option to take away the chat then it wouldn't be an issue full stop.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2016-09-16T09:41:20.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"drag chat of the screen, you don't need it at all to win games","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-09-16T13:10:09.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"especially with the ping update","replies":[]}]}]}
