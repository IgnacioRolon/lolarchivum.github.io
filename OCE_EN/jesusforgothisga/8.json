Whilst I can appreciate something needs to be done about people who constantly rage quit and afk but getting low priority queue after 2 matches (which I returned and finished) is ridiculous!\n\nI had a tiny blackout in my area which forced me to d/c. Rejoin the match and finished it out. A few games later the blackout hit again but I still returned and finished the game. So far that I earned myself a low priority queue for the next 5 games! Are you kidding?\n\nI never intentionally leave my games no matter how shit they are and now I&#039;m punished because I left two non consecutive games? What has this game become ugh it really shits me to no end.\n\nI think the auto system needs a bit of a tweak and how quickly it hands out punishments for afk players especially if they rejoin and play out the game trying to win.\n\nFrom now on if I get d/c I'm not even going to bother trying to rejoin, I'll simply wait out and return when I feel like it as no matter what I'll be getting a strike from leave buster. GG, nice incentive for people who genuinely get d/c.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2018-08-23T11:55:11.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the system (not speaking on the behalf of Riot here - obviously...) can't tell the difference between people legit rage quitting and people who had their bad luck caught up with them.\n\nIn my opinion (you can sh*t talk me cause of this point if you want) I would've stopped playing LoL for the rest of the day, just to avoid another blackout. If for some reason this stuff keeps happening in your area that's just plain terrible. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-23T13:00:26.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can actually tell the difference between a DC and a quit, but there's a multitude of reasons that info isn't used. To name the two big ones:\n- It's very easy to spoof a DC, just unplug your ethernet/turn off your wifi\n- Someone dc'ing every game in ranked is still ruining all those people's games. At a point, players have to take responsibility for internet issues as well. Call your ISP, switch to ethernet, accept that online and multiplayer might not mix well with your circumstances etc.","replies":[]}]}]}
