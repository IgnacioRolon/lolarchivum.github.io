I bet majority of people like myself have to do promos 2-3 times before being successful. Not because of how we play but due to trolls and people having bad games as you put it. Before taking a break for ~6 months I remember being stuck in a vicious promo circle. I'd get to promos, lose the series, win my next games and straight back to promos only to lose. This happened about 3-4 times in a row before I got a half decent team. Clearly something isn't right when you continually win your ranked games then lose promos. It's like you get paired with the absolute WORST people and it's not just a one off thing, it happens every time I hit promos.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-26T07:01:21.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is annoying when you get a free win and get 2 teams of duds....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-09-26T18:42:52.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"playing support in series is asking to lose anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-26T07:24:44.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you suggest should replace promos if they were removed? \n\nWithout returning to original elo system, which didn't include that kind of stuff, do you think it should just automatically promote you upon reaching 100LP?

If you're -- let's say -- Platinum 4 and your MMR is DIamond5, you should be Diamond, not stuck in Platinum.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-26T09:31:07.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree. Similarly, when you think about the Ranked experience and that a promotion is supposed to make you feel rewarded for all your hard efforts, the promotion _series_ that directly leads up to that moment of glory is one of the most consistently distressing elements of the system. Unfortunately, not in a Dark Souls-esque way either heh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-26T23:38:17.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"'' let's say -- Platinum 4 and your MMR is DIamond5, you should be Diamond, not stuck in Platinum.''\nYour kidding right?  Just because thats your MMR does not mean you have a right to be there, you may as well skip having to do anything to earn it. Thats like saying well i won this race last time why do i need to qualify  again. its to give everyone else equal opportunity to move up.\nI know having troll's or just player having a bad game can be frustrating but, if your MMR is that high and your playing at a lower rank than it should be fairly simple to go upwards","replies":[]}]}]}]}
