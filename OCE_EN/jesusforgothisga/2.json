This is Fast Becoming a Joke.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"For those who don&#039;t read the forums much I&#039;ve posted a couple of threads regarding the MM system and how it always seems to pair you with nothing but the BIGGEST trash, asswipe people you can ever come across when yo're in promos. It&#039;s actually at the point where I swear to god Riot are trolling me on purpose. It&#039;s pathetic.\n\nHere is a thread regarding my last promo series in which I lost purely because of trolls\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/T1J8TH3I-i-cant-handle-this-game-any-more-heres-why\n\nHere&#039;s another thread regarding the same subject I opened up a while ago:\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/VaBFMEH7-losing-promos-from-trolls-and-bads\n\nAfter winning 6 in a row comfortably I&#039;m back to promo&#039;s. Easy wins also and everyone I come across were friendly and supportive. \n\nWhat do you think I get in my 1st game of promos? A fkn troll who intently feeds and refuses to help the team because and I quote &quot;Varus took my blue buff&quot;.\n\nSeriously Riot, I don&#039;t know whether I should laugh or cry at how much you seem to bust my balls. How many times do I have to go through this bullshit? It&#039;s not like this is just bad luck as this is a continuous occurrence and ONLY seems to happen when people hit promos. Your ranking system is a joke clearly and something needs to be done to counter this bullshit. Reporting them at the end game is simply not enough as if they don&#039;t continually troll they get away with it.\n\nIt&#039;d be nice to understand or get some feedback how the MM system works when you hit promo&#039;s because seriously, something is up with it and it definitely pairs you with the BIGGEST trolls it can possibly find. Does it pair you with people who have received reports recently for afk&#039;ing, griefing etc? Does it pair you with the lowest of lows and tilted people on losing streaks? Are you paired with people who are are about to receive chat bans on their next offense? Honestly, it&#039;s not just bad luck and I can essentially guarantee each promo series I play I&#039;ll have at least one troll who without a doubt loses the game for everyone.\n\nWhy is it this game and promo's decided on whether or not you get paired with trolls rather than player skill as it should be? I'm not saying I should definitely be ranked up etc, but when you've done promos so many times over and continually run into a wall of trolls something is wrong with the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-29T03:06:50.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its programmed so that you have to carry the game to get promoted.
