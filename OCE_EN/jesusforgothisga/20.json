Do these people get punished even tho the intent feeding isn&#039;t game after game? I&#039;ve come across one individual who when ahead plays normal but as soon as he falls behind he intently feeds, griefs and sits in the side lane whilst they take our inhibs and nexus.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had the pleasure of playing with this guy a few times now since we seem to be hovering at the same elo and his name is one to remember. Yet each time I&#039;ve reported him nothing seems to happen. I&#039;m certain others have reported him yet he&#039;s still playing to this day.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-03-09T06:18:40.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this is what I'm getting at. Can you please enlighten me or educate me on how Riot's automated system distinguishes between an intent feeder or someone just having a bad game? Just because a person isn't running it down mid lane doesn't mean they aren't intentionally feeding.\n\nThe person who I'm referring to in my post IS an intent feeder. There is no doubt about it. When this person falls behind in the game he/she constantly runs into a 5 man team trying to ace them solo. It's deliberate and 100% intentional. If they aren't trying to 1v5 they are sitting in a side lane farming whilst they are knocking on our base towers and refuse to do anything to stop the enemy team. Yet this person still plays on and from what I can tell goes unpunished.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-10T03:36:08.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system can recognise more than you might think, but for the more nuanced cases, reports, and report *comments*.\n\nIf someone is intent feeding and being sneaky about it, then reports are important. If someone is being reported every other game for intent feeding (by those with few false reports to their name) then it's going to know something is up and if the automate system cannot make a final judgement then it will pass it off to a manual review, at which point a report comment detailing the nature of their feeding is very useful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-07T09:08:43.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intent feeding nets an instant 14 day ban, skipping the two chat restriction tiers (for obvious reasons), putting them on the edge of a perma.\n\nThat said, a player with a bad score isn't necessarily intent feeding, and a player with a good score isn't necessarily not. Having a bad game is not punishable, and you're only hurting yourself by reporting it. Actual intent feeders are pretty obvious, so try to avoid reporting people who are just regular feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Colonel J","date":"2017-03-07T07:45:38.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine they get banned after a while.","replies":[]}]}
