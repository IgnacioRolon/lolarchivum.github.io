I&#039;m not talking about people just having bad games either, I mean intent feeding or sitting in a side lane refusing to help or griefing in some nature. I&#039;m positive Riot&#039;s MM trolls you in promo series games considering how often this happens. \n\nI comfortably won 10 games in a row (15W 5L in past 20) and again reached that dreadful promo stage. This being my 4th series and what do you know, again I get an intent feeder in my very 1st game and person who griefs the team after losing lane. Clearly this isn&#039;t the 1st time this person has done it as I received the instant feedback report afterwards.\n\nhttp://i68.tinypic.com/35at95j.jpg\n\nNow being the 4th promo in I&#039;m certain the MM is utter bullshit and is pairing people with toxic players in attempt to make you lose.\n\nCan someone from support who or someone with solid knowledge shed some light on just how the MM works in promo series? Clearly the MM system is using some other form of pairing other than skill to continually match myself and others with these trolls. Also from my other threads, friends etc who play the game I&#039;m definitely not alone in this.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-02-04T04:07:02.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh it's coming.
