That support is the most blamed and hated role in the entire game.\r\n\r\nNo matter what you do, how well you play, how much you ward etc it is ALWAYS your fault somehow some way. It&#039;s so frustrating and tilting to play I can see why others lash out and get perma banned from the constant blame that ensues when someone dies in the general vicinity.\r\n\r\nPeople don&#039;t seem to understand that you are merely their to assist the team and them in laning phase. Just because your support is around doesn&#039;t mean you can blindly run into unwarded brushes, engage into a 3v2 etc and try be a hero all game long.\r\n\r\nAlso I keep hearing that a good support can carry games, but in all honesty I really don&#039;t believe that at lower elo&#039;s. It&#039;s just not possible to carry a game as a support champ when your top or mid lane has fed the enemy team 10+ kills. Maybe at higher elo&#039;s where people don&#039;t make ridiculous plays and actually look at their map it&#039;s true.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-09T01:53:56.097+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually its jg then support","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-12T03:48:45.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mHRKXE8b,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-04-09T01:53:56.097+0000)\n>\n> Actually its jg then support\n\nYeah I concur, it's usually \"report jg no gank\" before \"report supp no ward/peel\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-04-09T08:15:56.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a sup/jg main i agree lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-04-09T19:05:41.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"STFU stupid its always fkin jg fault, no matter what jg fault, didn't gan i die, gank i still die, i die jg didnt die.

No matter how well I do bot lane (eg my last game my adc was up 7 kills during lane phase) we get stomped afterwards because someone has fed the tank top laner who has a MUCH greater impact on the game in general. It shouldnt be that way at all. A fed bot lane ( with a lof of assists and adc with a lot of kills) should be walking through the enemy top laner but instead myself and the adc feel absolutely fucking useless against a single tank who isn't as fed as either one of us. What's the point of having a support who's getting the adc kills if the enemy top laner can simply farm and have a greater impact on the game? \n\nIt's that bad at the moment I'm sitting here with LP cards that I refuse to use until something is done about adc's in general feeling useless and the support role changed. It sucks so bad at the moment is so infuriating!

Literally everything is your fault then.\n\nThe one that gets me is \"why aren't you warding\" when you constantly have 3 wards down on the map and have been since you rushed sightstone as a 1st item.\n\nThen you look at the wards placed at the end of the match to find they placed 1 ward every 10 minutes or 3 wards in a 40 minute game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-04-09T01:32:30.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have actually played with you before, thought I would say hi.\nThis comment has nothing to do with the discussion so...\ncarry on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-09T07:44:02.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Support is a useless role and anyone who mains it should quit the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-09T02:36:01.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's mainly because Riot needs to change the support role so it has a far greater impact in the game then just landing a good braum ult in a teamfight or having jungle constantly warded.

I think they need to do something about assists and support items together, like implementing  scaling gold increasing with the more assists you get as well as support items growing in power with assists. Ultimately I believe: \n\nA support that's 0/2/24 needs to have an impact on the game that's the same scale as someone who is 12/2/0","replies":[]}]}
