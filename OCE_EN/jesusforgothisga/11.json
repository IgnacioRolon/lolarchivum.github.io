Not the amount of times in a row it&#039;s happened to myself.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m actually thinking of starting some sort of log with game stats to prove that promo games are heavily weighted against you and you are intentionally paired with garbage toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"BOT LANE GO BOOM","date":"2018-09-04T11:52:28.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also mmr gets mixed and promo games weigh in on that. If you cant carry a game in that elo, why should you move up? Support is the biggest influence in the game, play a damage support, pick up the kills and smack the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-04T10:41:53.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A log is a *really* good idea. If there's negativity bias, it debunks it plain and simple, and if there really is a problem then again, now you know for sure. I would recommend logging all the games leading up to and after your promos as well for completions sake though (since your theory is that promos are markedly different from regular ranked games, not just that promos are always bad). I'd also encourage you to remember that having an absolutely terrible game (which happens to everyone) is not the same as trolling.\n\nEven if your log is something as simple as 5 X's for each game, green for neutral or positive players, yellow for suspect, red for intent feeding/trolling/flaming etc. It's an excellent way to put things in perspective.","replies":[]}]}
