I always end up having a few months break and return hoping the game is in a better place but I&#039;m constantly let down. In fact, the last few months to a year I can&#039;t help to feel the game has slowly but surely declined.\r\n\r\nThe community is just rubbish along with the banning system and essentially makes it infuriating for people actually trying to climb. Stats wise I&#039;d say that in roughly 50% if not more of my games I come across and intent feeder or griefer. The remainder games are either you get stomped or you stomp and never result in an even match. How is that meant to be an enjoyable experience and how am I supposed to take this game seriously?\r\n\r\nConstantly I feel myself wanting to lash out at people for their idiotic attitudes and outlook on the game. I&#039;ll be the first to admit it pisses me off to no end when you get some twat intently feed your lane because they messed up or someone afk&#039;s after dying.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel the same way or can sense the slow but surely decline of the game and it&#039;s state?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-25T15:49:25.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game has just gotten way to snowball oriented, the damage creep is through the roof, the game is \"balanced\" way to fucking often, same old meta champs every game..... and then we have lethality. the game is beyond enjoyable, might get one close enjoyable game out of 30, rest are a one sided stomp were i either get no enjoyment in winning, afk farm or just plain afk. the crappy game makes the community toxic.\n\ni used to enjoy telling people i play league irl, now if i mention it 95% of the time they'll chuckle and say something like, \" i used to play but quit in season 4/5/6 and i now play x game, id never play that garbage again\"\n\n\nhttps://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder286/34849286.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-28T23:47:25.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if only riot would let you go play other games \nits such a shame that they cant make this game suit you while also forcing you to play this and nothing else","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-29T06:22:47.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jigglejigglwoosh,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=JqdBAkfE,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2017-07-28T23:47:25.429+0000)\n>\n> if only riot would let you go play other games \n> its such a shame that they cant make this game suit you while also forcing you to play this and nothing else\n\nAnd where did I say that? In fact I said quite the opposite where I actually quit playing each time for a few months.\n\nAlso make this game to suit me? Sorry for wanting a non toxic game where griefers are actually banned and sorry for wanting close games.

Every game just becomes frustrating instead of fun, I used to play League every day for the entire day, now I play off and on every once in a while. As someone who has to try and solo carry games out of low elo League has become almost impossible to win for me. I win my lane and I'm always the only person fed on my team. Yet I find it next to impossible to solo carry games. It seemed much easier a little while ago but now League is the most unbalanced its been yet. Riot has to be downright the worst company at balancing I've ever seen in a video game. Just look at duskblade, they introduced lethality, had to nerf it, then buff it again, then tried to change duskblade to make it \"better\", then it was the most broken item in the game that every champion rushed. Then they hotfixed it, and its STILL op. Who seriously comes up with these ideas? How can you introduce something new to the game but not even get it right the first 3 times?
