I guess its because Taric doesn't push very hard. There's better champions to troll with in top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-02T09:55:31.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"janna is a surprisingly good toplaner atm. Her base damage and kit are so good for bullying in pretty much every matchup, earlygame she is so good at making laning phase infuriating, although she sucks at tower diving solo, and she can't do much to snowball, but in terms of denying and putting her opponent behind and on tilt, she's up there with toplane teemo and nunu.\n\nI don't think there is anything more meme than the enemy team flaming their pantheon for going 0-4 in lane against a janna.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-11-03T05:35:13.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for removing the link. Again, protecting the asshats that are actually ruining this game.\n\nTLDR, guy picks Taric ~50 games in a row regardless of lane assignment, loses majority of games then flames people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-02T12:11:06.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah stupid dirty one-tricks, the low elo ones make me laugh.","replies":[]}]}
