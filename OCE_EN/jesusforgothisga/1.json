I&#039;ve played a few games now on 1 champ where I&#039;ve received a S- or higher and nothing.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the reform stage is pretty frustrating. Not only do you cop a ban, but then you&#039;re further punished for who knows how long. \r\n\r\nThe reform period FAQ is extremely vague. How does the automatic system detect a &quot;friendly&quot; player apart from friendly reports after a game? Most people I know including myself don&#039;t bother with the positive side of reporting, only the negative and I&#039;d assume this would be a trend across the board.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-05-20T06:02:05.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes and I read that section, however what gets me is how does an automated system detect positive behavior. By picking up keywords... not saying anything? Using pings? Simply saying to continue playing positive doesn't really give much insight. How can a person reform when they aren't shown the way to begin with. It's like an alcoholic going to an AA meeting and just being told just not to drink. Sound advice, but in no way helpful.\n\nAs I mentioned it's natural human behavior to remember and act on negative experiences rather that positive.\n\nIt also outlines the fails of an automated reporting system and the punishment side. How does something automated pickup or distinguish between a comment made in anger or hatred to a friendly sarcastic reply? It doesn't understand emotions, sarcasm tongue in cheek comments or even if it was directed at an individual. I can however understand it picking up on certain key words (homophobic, racist words etc).\n\nAlso the term 'toxic' is being thrown around so much these days. Being quite an open and vocal player I find myself in games where people are easily offended by a simple suggestion on their build or remarks. How can you be supportive and try and assist the team when people are so quick to jump down your throat and report in return? Let's face it, OCE server isn't known for it's friendliness.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-20T08:00:43.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll put this simpler for you, don't be an ass, and you can get your chests back.\n\nIt's not just the system tracking you, if your constantly getting reports your not getting them back, not saying anything for several games will likely give it back.\n\nAnd comparing being an ass to being an alcoholic isn't really viable, because one is really simple to understand, and change, the other is hard due to an actual addiction.","replies":[{"poster":"Hisoka leJoker","date":"2016-05-23T17:37:08.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well I just got my second round of chat restrictions because I just had two fuckwits admit to me they report me at the end of every game so after 2 games in a row with them I automatically get chat restrictions.

I wish there was an option to actually turn it off instead of having to mute every single player each game in fear of rubbing someone up the wrong way and copping a perma ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-20T05:41:37.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After being punished by one of our player behavior systems, players will enter a \"reform period\" before they can use the Hextech Crafting system again.\n\n>\"Your reform period isn't over after a speicifc number of games, or after a certain date, but is completely dependent upon your behavior.\" - [Source](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463)\n\nEssentially, just keep playing games with positive behavior and you'll be back on Hextech Crafting in no time.\n\n\nI just copied this off boards from telecaster.","replies":[]}]}
