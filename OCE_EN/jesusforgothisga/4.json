I&#039;m sure anyone (which would be 99.9999% of us) have been in a promo series you sit there asking yourself wtf have u done wrong to deserve such retarded team mates. Well here&#039;s my story and why it&#039;s so hard to climb.\n\nWas roughly sitting at 70% win rate, so I hit promo&#039;s rather easily.\n\nWin my first game rather casually and easily no sweat, things are looking good. Then came games 2 and 3.\n\nGame 2. Winning comfortably that&#039;s until Rammus decided he need a break. Goes AFK between the 15-20 min mark. Just sitting in the fountain. Comes back for about 10 secs for what I assume is to reset the afk timer (wasn&#039;t really watching him) and then goes AFK again between the 20-28 minute mark. Doing it rough in a 4v5 but not losing many objectives. Now the ONLY fed person on their team is a Teemo. Rammus comes back after his break and you think he&#039;d buy ANY sort of magic resist? Nope, 4 armor items is is and then decided he&#039;s just going to roll around the map, farm and ignore everyone else. We lose, ggwp.\n\nSo shit, here I am one win one loss things are looking shaky. No problem, new game, report the afk&#039;r and I&#039;m still with a chance. Then Riot MM happens. I get paired WITH THE SAME GUY! Fuck me right! Honestly, are u just trying to bust my balls Riot?\n\nBut there&#039;s a kicker! There's and even bigger douche in this game and unfortunately he's on my team.\n\nGame 3. Starts out alright during lane phase but clearly my ADC is slightly retarded and is playing an immobile champ. We lose 1st tower so what does he decide to do? Constantly push out bot lane without warding at all against a Twitch who cloaks, runs up to him and melts his face. He&#039;s down 0-2 at this point and now has the shits. I kindly ask him not to push out so far with limited vision since Twitch has done the same thing twice. So you know what his mentality is? To intent feed and troll. Yup! Lovely isn&#039;t it? Stuff up and get rekt from your own mistakes and then make everyone else pay merely because they suggested you stop what you are doing and getting killed from. I mean I thought he would have learnt from the 1st time he got killed but nope.\n\nSo all game this asswipe runs around doing his thing not really helping anyone or doing anything. Every time he dies he makes a smartass comment and thinks it&#039;s amusing.\n\nHow is this a reflection on my performance and my abilities and how is it fair that people miss out on promotions purely because the OCE server is filled with asswipes? Also why is it only when you hit promo's you end up with the BIGGEST trolls and butthurt salty noobs ever?\n\nTLDR, easily hit promo&#039;s only to be hit with an AFK&#039;r and paired with an intent feeder who&#039;s butthurt he got solo killed twice in the same spot.\n\nGG Riot, well played!\n\n/rant.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-25T05:56:13.354+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to OCE.

Enough to go get a drink and use the bathroom. Guess he done the same thing. The third game it wasn't even him doing the trolling tho. To be fair he was dicking about but still trying. It was the other asswipe who decided he'd had enough of getting solo'd by Twitch and to take it out on the entire team by trolling (seems to be the norm on OCE server).","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-25T05:31:01.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let's just have a sit, relax, and play more Normals.\n\nOr you could also just play Ranked like Normals instead of trying to climb, assuming you don't just go fuck all and ruin everybody else's game that is.

Won my first 4, had a great KDA around 8, kill participation around 80% with a tonne of wards and high damage and gold so I was looking at this stage realistically at a gold, maybe if I'm lucky a plat ranking (according to lolsumo I had a master, diamond, and two plat performances)\n\nThen shit hit the fan.\n\nMy next game was against diamonds and plats, and my team were bronze and silver. You can imagine my heartbreak when first blood is given up on the first wave of minions  with 3 following in quick succession across the board, my adc constantly out of position unable to do anything but stand still while he cs'd.\n\nI get 90% kill participation, during the early game having a 5 kda before the overflow effect comes around to get me, and unfortunately netting myself a silver performance.\n\nsame again for the next one. I don't win any of my remaining 6 games but get performance ratings pf diamond, 4 gold and unfortunately another silver. I averaged out my performances and had an average of over 70% kill participation, 4 kda, higher than average gold, around 40 wards per game (I get shit tonnes of control wards as well) and, as a full suupport 5 of those last 6 games I had the highest damage to champs on the team.\n\nYet, in the infinite wisdom of the RIOT system, I get bronze 1 because my teams are shithouse. Just to add insult to injury, LOLKing has my elo showing as a mid silver.\n\nIn times like this I most certainly relate with the sentiment, Fuck you Rito....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-25T08:01:06.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really that third game was your own fault.\n\nIf you get a feeder/AFKer in your game, you should wait a period before queuing again or risk being matched with them again.","replies":[]}]}
