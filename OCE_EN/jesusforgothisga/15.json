Take this chocco starfish for example, _Name Removed_.\n\n2nd/3rd wave into the game I get catch a good Thresh hook through the minion pack. Great hook and totally caught myself off guard, no worries E myself as Morg from flay and run away. ADC is sitting under tower so it&#039;s fine, well so I thought. Sivir then decides to run in and 2v1 because that&#039;s the thing you normally do right and gets killed. Starts abusing me because I E&#039;d myself and not her (apparently Sivir doesn&#039;t have her own spell shield)\n\nSo after that she abuses me, sits in fountain and cries for the next 5 minutes whilst I sit bot lane farming not saying a word. Finally she decides since she&#039;s not getting a rise out of me she runs it up mid lane to feed after taking Anivia&#039;s farm.\n\nGame goes on, we eventually lose because where essentially down and adc and got outplayed. Shit happens right?\n\nNow the kicker is this toxic asswipe and his/her buddies decide to jump on the bandwagon and report me lol! So not only did I lose the 21lp, I received apparently 6 reports to go along with it for well... playing the game.\n\nWhy can&#039;t something be done about people phantom reporting and jumping on the bandwagon? Reducing report effectiveness isn&#039;t enough nor persuasive. Nor do you get some sort of message to say that you&#039;re BS reports are no longer as heavily weighted.\n\nTLDR, adc gets butthurt because I use an ability on myself, afk&#039;s, returns and feeds then get&#039;s his mates to report me.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nicaxqz.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mxSjddL.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/J2uGuc6.png","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-10-04T05:52:33.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were close and no I didn't exaggerate at all. Like I said, I caught a good hook from thresh, E'd myself to stop the flay and walked back to our tower where Sivir was sitting. At that point Sivir decided she would move from our tower and fight a 2v1 (I was pretty low hp from the Vayne and thresh). At that point she gets chunked hard and tries to retreat under the tower and almost makes it but dies. If I can remember the kill came from a Vayne tumble.\n\nNowhere did I say she died in front of the tower. Just that she was initially sitting at it.\n\nYou're exactly right about the Morg E but obviously she fails to realise that it doesn't stop any phys damage. You'd be surprised at just how many people cry about not getting shielded from other ADC'c auto's etc.","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-16T11:57:06.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JesusForgotHisGA,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=WAjAtXpp,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-10-04T05:52:33.725+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re exactly right about the Morg E but obviously she fails to realise that it doesn&#x27;t stop any phys damage. **You&#x27;d be surprised at just how many people cry about not getting shielded from other ADC&#x27;c auto&#x27;s etc.**\n\nNo, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Siv finishes with a KDA of 1.25:1, kill participation of 50% and an average of 6.1cs/min, pretty dismal stats for an ADC in Gold imo\n\n\n**Conclusion:** Yeah, Siv started sulking from about 4mins into game and didn't start getting her shit together again until after the 10 minutes mark (huge leap in gold around that time indicating activity) and they did make a half-hearted attempt to claw their way back into the game. But...\nThey weren't queued with anyone from that game, strictly yoloQ for this Siv. In fact I would go so far as to say if they have ever played with any of your team before it was strictly MM RNG. \nSo I doubt very much that you got mass reported as none of the people in your game were mates with them. Conversely the rest of your team would have to have been utter douchebags to side with Sivir (because of the AFK, sulking and roaming deaths etc) unless that first death to Vayne didn't go quite as you described it considering she died *behind* your tower, not in front of it, which is where you would presume to die if you dove forwards into the enemy from a position under said tower.. or maybe Vayne condemed Siv just as Thresh was flaying her back and that made Siv fly clear across the screen to land in a shattered lifeless heap behind your tower. I don't know. I can't tell *how* she died, just that she did and where she ended up.\nSo, are you exaggerating about what happened a *little..? just a bit..? maybe..?* \nAnd why the fuck add them/accept their friend request after game, that's just silly. Games over, move on. No need to draw out the drama by talking to them after the fact... geez >.<\n\n**TL:DR;** Your ADC that game was a dick, but you're acting a bit unnecessarily butthurt. Next game is a fresh game, forget about that douche =)\n\n\nP.S. While rendering recipients immune from all CC, Morgana Black Shield only absorbs *Magic Damage* and Vayne is 100% AD, so, except for the knockback portion of a Condemn, so you using E on her wouldn't have saved Siv from shit because Thresh Flay was on CD, as was his Hook, and any damage from Vayne would still have registered =) \nP.P.S. All times are approximate.\n\nGGWP\n\n*Initially I was just curious who this Siv was so I searched for the above game in your Match history\nand then I noticed the stats and they didn't add up to the usual feeder/AFK bs\nthen I got more interested because I do **love** a good mystery\nthen I decided to get a clearer timeline of what actually went down and where because of the above mentioned stats\nand then I thought \"fuck it, why go to all this bother just for myself, **lets share it with the world!**\" :D \n...and then I decided I need to drink less coffee so early in the morning >.>*\n\n*brb, I needa pee >.>*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-09-24T16:16:51.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold players LUL, I'm in Gold as well, and it seems that there are more toxicity regarding afks and overall just more dickheads in Gold than there are in other elo.

Getting reported 100 times in one game has as much effect as getting reported one. When someone reports you, they trigger some type of thing. Once this is done your game will be marked to be checked. The system checks the game and if you did nothing wrong then there is no point worrying about there \"Group\" when this happens just mute them and report at the end. -RedNalick","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-09-24T05:35:03.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And guess what, very next game they have a trio who's adc quits making it a 4v5.
