Has anyone else noticed the same thing? Is it just a low elo kind of problem?\n\nThis is my last promo series which is an absolute joke to say the least! How is this even fair or a reflection on my skill to determine that I&#039;m not worthy of a promo win? I literally got play 1 game that wasn't ruined by either an afk or an intent feeding troll.\n\n7 wins in a row, reach promo&#039;s:\n\nGame 1: Intent feeding Ryze - Finishes the game on 0-11 at just over 20 mins.\nGame 2: Clapped out team with a Shaco who only got his kills from cleanups. Not blaming Shaco solely, but he hardly helped the situation. I&#039;ll take that loss.\nGame 3: AFK mid lane - Game starts out great, 2 kills in the jungle to start off. Winning comfortably, Lux decides she&#039;s gonna afk for 10-15 mins. Lost too much lead, towers, free farm, map pressure etc and it was all downhill from there.\n\nThis is definitely not the 1st time this has happened and I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be the last. Reaching promo&#039;s only to lose them because majority of the time you get duds. Sure I definitely have games where I deserved the loss 100% and I cop that on the chin, I&#039;m an average player at best, but this is fast becoming a joke.\n\nThere has to be some other way other than promo&#039;s surely? Please tell me I&#039;m not the only one who seems to have this problem because I&#039;m going a little batshit crazy over it.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-01-05T05:44:58.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"welcome to oce home of cancer trolls \n\nriot doesn't give 1 shiet, stupid automated detection system does not remove trolls\n\ntakes 10 sec to create a new account after ban lolz\n\nRiot is a joke, just want $$$$$$$$$$$$\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2017-01-02T01:43:26.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Is it just a low elo kind of problem?\n\nI don't know what you class as \"low elo\" but it happened in low Diamond for me as well. I'd usually just say you're not good enough to climb it but after my experience trying to get to D4 I feel your pain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SampleName1337","date":"2017-01-01T17:53:01.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just have to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-02T01:33:43.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"last season i went from b4-b3 promos, lost one game till i get to promos, were i play supp and get an adc who built hurricane first then zerkers. he had like 95 dam by the time the opposition had about 150. 2nd game i played adc and get a morg supp which is looking decent .... 5 mins in the persons like \"ive never played this champ before\". proceeds to miss every q, lay like 2 wards in 15 minutes and feed hard.\ni'm like this is just a one off, then it happened again and then again for a third time were i said to myself  fuck this im playing aram and normals and haven't looked back since.\n\ni just have no luck whatsoever if i play ranked, i play support the adc is shit, i play adc the support is shit,i play jungler every lane is losing by 5 mins, i play mid or top and every other lane ends up losing by 10 mins. its one giant shitfest.","replies":[]}]}
