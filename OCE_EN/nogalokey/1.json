Now I&#039;m questioning why you keep flash as the main summoner spell. If you don&#039;t have it you really aren&#039;t open to many options. For example, when you start an account on league. You don&#039;t unlock flash till like lvl 10? These games make it so clear that the other spells (the ones you have instead of flash are nowhere near as compensating) are so underpowered. Have you every ran ghost as an adc? It&#039;s 100% pointless compared to when the enemy has flash. You will never get a kill if you don&#039;t have soime gap closers like ahri. Do you accept this because if you buffed these other spells (other than flash) it would throw every single champ out? Why are they weak so weak (example ghost) (considering flash is a must?) \n\nEdit: I'm mainly talking about things like clairvoyance, ghost, cleanse, clarity.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-13T05:14:32.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None of the other summoner spells fill the same role as flash. Simply buffing ghost for example would not suddenly make ghost replace flash in most cases(it cant get you over walls, it cant instantly reposition you), it would just make ghost super OP on the champions that already use it. Flash is just more versatile than the other spells which is why its so popular, something thats unlikely to change unless flash gets completely changed or something else becomes so broken OP that you can't afford to not choose it. With the exception of clairvoyance and clarity (and maybe barrier on the weak side), the other spells are fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saphixia","date":"2015-08-12T23:43:17.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure if u play league of legends but ghost is used a lot especially on Udyr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-12T22:38:11.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarity is actually just supposed to be an early-level, newbie-aimed spell.\nAll the others... CV was hugely overpowered back in S1-2, it got nerfed once and disappeared forever (then again a 10second global vision on a 30sec cooldown WAS big). Ghost never really had its moment... Cleanse is still very effective, but only if you're vsing the wrong team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-12T18:34:26.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People Run Ghost flash, I do it on Vayne some times.\n\nI run Ghost Ignite on Annie sometimes.\n\nI usually run Shyv with Smite Exhaust.\n\nSometimes play Irelia or Kat with Exhaust Ignite.\n\nOccasionally run Ghost Ignite on Aka as AD Top.\n\nOccasionally run Ghost Ignite on Irelia.\n\nSometimes run Ghost on Shyv with smite as AD.\n\nShaco often runs Smite Ignite.\n\nI do smite Ignite for Aka Jungle.\n\nSometimes do TP Smite on Shyv top.\n\nI sometimes run Ghost exhaust on Riv top.\n\nI often run Heal Ignite on Riv top.\n\nIt's really not a standard spell and there are many cases where people don't take it lol it's just often a risk because if you need to pick enemies off or chase over walls etc (Like vs Shaco) not having flash can be a set back.\n\nIt's also pretty standard on ADC's as they're often going to be facing gap closers and if they get caught out or want to dodge a Gap closers engage it's excellent for doing so.","replies":[]}]}
