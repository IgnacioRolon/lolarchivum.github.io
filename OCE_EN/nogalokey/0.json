But it doesn&#039;t change the fact that he is underplayed. Why is he underplayed? Because he is weak is he not? His ult is only for sniping and even then it&#039;s almost barely doing anything. His aa range is so small. His mana problems early are probably fair enough but he needs some better scaling or SOMETHING.. I don't really feel large powerspikes.. I could be wrong though, I  haven't mastered him","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-17T06:33:34.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian currently has some buffs in PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"Nogalokey","date":"2015-08-17T08:05:30.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-17T08:16:46.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nogalokey,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Z1ZflAVF,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-08-17T08:05:30.353+0000)\n>\n> WTF This doesn't look like buffs!!! \n> \n> Lightslinger [ Passive ]\n> \n> Damage of second shot decreased from 50% of first shotâ€™s damage at all levels to 30/40/50% (increased at levels 1, 7 and 11)\n> Duration of double-shot buff decreased from 6 seconds to 2\n\nThe values are getting updated in the PBE and his W got some buffs so lets hope he will be better after those updates.","replies":[{"poster":"Nogalokey","date":"2015-08-18T00:58:24.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MM turns out I was wrong these nerfs are old.

He fills a niche, that being a strong laning champion. If you're not able to abuse his early game to get a big lead, you should probably just play something that scales a little better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-17T07:10:44.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian needs to get a lead in lane in order to be good. He's moved from an \"all-round\" champ (being good at all stages of the game) to more of a Caitlyn style. Win-lane, win-game style.\n\nThey are buffing his passive to allow him to scale better, but thats not his problem.\n\nWith the tank meta, he also fell out in favour of Jinx/Kalista/Sivir. With the tanks leaving, he may see more play.\n\nI mean Lucian was the undisputed no.1 ADC for like over a year, lets just be happy he's gone for a while hmmm...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-17T05:33:17.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian is a burst ad caster which I think is why he doesn't do well in the tank meta.
