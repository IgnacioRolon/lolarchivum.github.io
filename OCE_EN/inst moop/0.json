YES, I understand I should not be flaming at people, that is wrong, but if someone is saying &quot;fuck y&#039;all i&#039;m afk&quot; or &quot;i&#039;m int&#039;ing&quot; when I haven&#039;t said I god damn thing, WHY DO THEY NOT GET BANNED BUT I DO?! I wouldn&#039;t be flaming in the first place if they would just grow up and play the god damn game! This banning system is biased and retarded. It seeks out that you&#039;ve used bad words, bans you, then goes on its merry way. How about watch the god damn games and see that there is a reason behind it?! What happens if I&#039;m provoked? THEY get off scott free and I get banned. It&#039;s so fucking unfair!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-06T08:59:43.067+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you */mute all* and don't talk at all and play to win, there is literally no reason for Riot to ban you.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"INST Moop","date":"2017-10-06T09:03:04.858+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I have people running into my lane feeding, what the fuck am I meant to do?
