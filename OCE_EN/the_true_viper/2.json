She was delighted that she had Professor Ryze for magic class. He looked past that her family were originally from Noxus. Fresh sandwiches from mum and she was going to see Teemo's and Tristana's new baby later today. She wondered how they could keep with the institute up with summoning them. Annie was a bright young girl and she got along with adults more then people her own age. As she turned the corner the school came into view. A massive ivory white building with hundreds of little square windows. Students milling about the place. skipping stones, chucking hexatech cherry bombs in the neighboring pond. Today felt like it was going to be a good day. Something caught Annie&#039;s eye and her heart sank. Ammumu was being teased by three big tough looking boys. They had his bag and were tossing it between them and calling him names. While hot fury bubbled up within Annie and had to resist them overwhelming urge to reduce all three boys to ash. Annie see despite her age was a very skilled fire mage and subsequently was part of the institute and got summoned like Tristana. Annie didn't mind she had made many friends like Poppy and well most of the yordals. Surprisingly Jarvin was very nice being royalty and all. It was still weird to openly fight side bye side her teacher. At the same time she got to know Ryze in a different light. Being a champion meant she faced off against things far more scary then a few bullies and stormed and bought her pet demon bear Tibbers  into being. Fire whirled around the monster of A bear. The bullies looked at Tibber&#039;s razor sharp fangs and inch long claws. &quot;Leave him alone or you will have to deal with me!\" Yelled Annie. They took one look at the eight foot tall snarling burning bear and at Annie who was holding a ball of fire now, turned very pale dropped the bag and ran very fast into the building. Picking up the bag and having fits of laughter Annie strolled into school with Ammumu who was much happier now and thanking Annie repeatedly. Flicking a hair off face she casually replied to Ammumu's repeated thanking \"Don't worry about it. Seriously it was nothing. Now we better hurry or we will be late for history and you try tell Professor Zilian that we lost track of time.\" They both laughed. Annie felt good it wasn't often Ammumu was happy only rare occasions like this. Yes Today was going just fine.","replies":[]}
