Yet both were to be removed from the game for the same reason. Why is this? Please share your thoughts on this. if the active is so op then why not get rid of it. Yes death fire was there to combat tanks but there are other ways now and mages were kinda misusing it to end that really fed {{champion:45}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:67}} etc. Mostly to nuke some poor champ into nothingness. Yet one is here. I loved death fire not just for it's active but also for it's ap and cool down. So when riot get rid of it but keep it's bother for different game mods I feel a little scorched.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-02T21:59:14.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont know if it would be worth to get a DFG without active.

It could be an oversight by Riot where it wasn't removed or just a mess up. This could even be an issue specific to the patch shipped for OCE, which would make sense seeing as it would easily be forgotten here rather than on NA or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-01T21:38:45.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stack BFT on Nidalee in Hide n Seek and boom.
