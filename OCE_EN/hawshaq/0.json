When I go into the store and click on purchase said champion it says I have less ip then what it says in the top right at the main menu.\r\n\r\n If anyone could help me out by telling me whether it is a fault at my end or at Riots, I would really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Max","date":"2015-11-20T20:42:51.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same issue for past 2 weeks, I was thinking its due to the upcoming season change?\nany idea?","replies":[]},{"poster":"straw hat romii","date":"2015-09-24T23:52:19.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having the same problem here.","replies":[]}]}
