Riven also has very little utility later in the game when behind since she has to be in melee range of enemies to do anything at all.

If Riven doesn't gain a significant enough advantage in the early game, she falls off hard. You can't use the video of one of the best Riven players worldwide as justification to suggest she's broken.\n\nThe main thing with Riven is that ALL of her abilities are physical damage. This means that champs like Malphite counter her pretty handily since he loves building armor, but you can build armor on almost any top laner to instant counter her.\n\nCounter pick champions (in approximate order of effectiveness):\n\n* Malphite, Renekton, Garen, Lissandra, and Teemo (yes, Teemo).\n\nCounter pick items (situational/champ specific):\n\n* Ninja tabi, double Doran's blade/ring, Seeker's Armguard, Frozen Heart, Sunfire Cape\n\nThe problem with Riven is that people try to *beat* her in lane. The truth is that all you need to do is avoid deaths and keep up with her farm until you can buy some armor. If you avoid deaths (especially at level 6) you will generally win lane against her in the long run. Once you have enough armor that she can't all-in ulti combo you, you will win any fight you pick with her.\n\nNote that I'm not denying that Riven is strong. She's definitely one of the stronger champs you can pick. I just wouldn't go so far as to say she's broken. A broken champ cannot be won against in a situation of equal skill. I routinely beat Riven mains in highish Elo when I'm forced to top lane and I'm not even a top lane main.","replies":[]}]}
