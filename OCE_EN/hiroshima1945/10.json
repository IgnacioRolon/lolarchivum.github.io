It's all about mentality. Focus on improving, not trying to \"carry my shit bronze team\". In the nicest way possible, if you can't get out of bronze playing support it's entirely possible you're not playing the role very well. A well played support makes such a difference for the team- a great laning phase for bot, and as the person with most of the CC on the team you have a lot of control of when and how teamfights happen. Plus having good vision control makes it much easier for your team to get baron/dragon. \n\nPS, I was B5 back in the day and I mained support all the way to P2. It's definitely possible to climb with support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"flamingsword2","date":"2015-07-11T04:13:27.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\nI just wanted to say that the most important thing is your mentality.\nDon't think of this as \"I need to get out of Bronze\", rather \"I will get to Silver if I am good.\"\n\nAs support is a team-centric role, always ask your ADC: \"Are we going to passively farm or aggressively trade during the landing phase?\" \nCoordinate team strategies: We need a split push going mid-game/Lets go teamfight @20.\n\nIf your ADC goes in, don't just stand back and blame your ADC in /All Chat. Go in with him, and with luck you could turn it into a trade in your favour. \n\nRegards,\nflamingsword2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-16T23:33:02.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sad truth is ... it is impossible to get out of bronze with a support, I mean you have to carry your cardboard 29 adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-07-11T01:18:08.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, the easiest way out of bronze is to simply NOT play support. Hear me out.\nSupport is one of the, if not THE most team reliant role in the whole game; you rely on your team to follow up, back down, heavily considering positioning of yourself and your ADC, punished with certain champions if your ADC overextends etc etc. It is far better to play a solo lane, at least until Silver 4 - Gold where supports actually perform alright. Although I carried myself from Bronze 1 to Gold 5 playing almost exclusively support, it is essential to either play a carry support like {{champion:1}} {{champion:43}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:143}} due to their late game scaling and play-making potential rather than my most played support {{champion:40}} due to her passivity. Also, another important point is to get a duo partner, someone who you can talk over using skype, ISNT toxic and plays according to each other.","replies":[{"poster":"hiroshima1945","date":"2015-08-16T13:18:58.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: Played {{champion:25}}  in my promos.

The more pressure you have on yourself, the more you will make stupid mistakes and go...\n\"WHY DID I DO THAT?!!!\"\n\nIf your ADC is going cray cray on you... adapt.\nThe main role you have to cover is: Adapt to your ADC's play style.\nWatch the whole map.
