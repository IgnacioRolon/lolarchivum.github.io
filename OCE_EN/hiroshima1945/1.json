They start flaming after a while too.\r\n\r\nNOTE: IT WAS A NORMAL GAME. NOT RANKED.\r\n\r\nThe current surrender system is flawed in my opinion. Here&#039;s a simple and possible fix: after having 3 YES&#039; and 2 NO&#039;s 3 or 4 times, the game ends.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nSurrender vote failed for your team 3/2\r\nSurrender vote failed for your team 3/2\r\nSurrender vote failed for your team 3/2\r\nfew moments later...\r\nAlly team agreed to surrender\r\n\r\nI really hope they do something about this.

Yes, Lee Sin isn't very good late game. I play him for FUN so do most people I know.

If the enemy support is 5 levels up your mid laner and has a better K/D/A than your adc, you're probably gonna lose the match anyway so why not save those extra 20 or so minutes?\n\nLastly, how are you supposed to learn from being killed by a fed Irelia and a Udyr over and over again? Again this isn't a game like counter-strike where only you gets better, in this game you AND** your character gets better**. Put a fed Silver 3 Garen with 4k hp and full build against a Plat 5 Garen that's 4 levels below with only 3 items. 9 times out of 10, unless the Silver 3 is brain dead, the Plat 5 player is gonna lose.\n\nYou're only Silver 3.
