Like zed can jump in and out, but Azir has to stay in a combat range to actually put out his famous dps. Zed can blink with his shadows, but Azir has to position his sand soldiers beforehand to make a big play like the shurima shuffle and he has to be careful nothing get's in the way of his flight path otherwise he's now in a very very bad position with no escapes. Azir's damage is more awkward and after the nerfs from proplay, less. He's not got much in the way of defensive peel outside of his ult and if enemies dash through his sandsoldier ranges, he's got 1 spell to reposition them, which is also his primary form of offense, so if he wastes it and the enemy get's close he's pretty screwed. Also just like zed shadows, you need to manage the placement of your sand soldiers and how much stock of them you have since if they're out of place you'll do no damage and on top of that you have to make sure the lines between them and you is clear in case you need to use your mobility spell e, since it can be blocked by champions.\n\nHave you played both Azir and Zed? \nI know I haven't played much of either myself but I've tried them out and even though I had alot of difficulty playing zed I felt I could pull off some of the basics and he felt decently strong, but with Azir, even though I spent alot longer learning him, I still felt underpowered and overwhelmed when I was playing him, even into favourable matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-10-30T23:14:55.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played both. Have not played Azir in a long time so I don't know what nerfs has done to him. They are both hard champions and only reason why low elo say they are noob champions is because they do not have a single idea of how to counter him. I don't find yasuo hard tbh ( I USED TO MAIN HIM), all you have to is dash in and dash out, all you have to do is maintain the use of dashes for every minion. I literally carried a game with yasuo the other day, I built PD, IE , BT , HYDRA and bersk boots with Bloodlust keystone. Told my team to go bait dragon while I soloed baron.

He's a very hard matchup for some champions and a pretty easy one in lower elo for other champions. I don't play midlane but as long as he's not lastpicked (I'll generally try to see him banned if I'm an early pick, since convincing low elo players to ban yasou is a piece of cake), it's not especially hard to counter pick him. Especially since tank yasou is less of a thing now. I find yasou a case of have a counterpick or some way to shut him down and then he's not an issue, or don't have a way to kill him and lose. Yasou is extremely strong against uncoordinated teams though and as a skillcap champion you just have to realise that sometimes the yasou just isn't someone you can kill unless he's dumb enough to run in solo into a teamfight. \n\nYasou was for quite a time, my least favourite matchup champion, but over time, my hate has turned into understanding of how to counter him.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-10-31T01:40:08.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good yasuo can decide the game","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-05-03T10:06:18.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lajneen,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=kJvfKbuX,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-03T09:57:06.251+0000)\n>\n> Yasuo is the 2nd hardest and 6th weakest champ in the game, losing to him is only possible if you get severely outplayed.\n\nayy lmoo\n\nfirst euw post i have seen on oce boards xd","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-24T09:41:10.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you mate, he is.
