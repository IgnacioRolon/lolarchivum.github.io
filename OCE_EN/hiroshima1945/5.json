She&#039;s already quite strong especially when placed in a good match up. \n\nI guess Riot is really forcing these &#039;minigames&#039; into the game. They should, at most, make it a 5% damage increase instead of 10%.\nIf this change (at its current state) makes it past PBE then what&#039;s the point of allowing people to make PBE accounts?\n\nEven Boxbox doesn&#039;t like these buffs... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1UfGvq9A-8","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-10-02T18:00:50.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the point was to address the early kill potential she has at level 1. \nNerfing this means that lower MMR Rivens won't snowball as hard in Bronze, Silver or Gold but she will still deal as much damage, actually even more once she has items and has full Edge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-02T15:10:09.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boxbox doesn't like them because they're not buffs lol.\n\nShe can't passively zone with 3 rune stacks by using Q pre-fights etc and she can't sit in brush and mash two Q's then engage with runic chaining to the same effect as she used to although it can still be useful to put Q on its global cooldown and engage with a 2nd or 3rd Q so that once you've started fighting your Q is already cooling down for its 2nd set of 3 Q's while you are fighting so that you can do a 2nd sequence of Q's sooner into the fight than if you start the fight with your first Q.","replies":[]}]}
