We're all humans behind our masks\". \nIf the enemy is flaming at your team, encourage them to not reply, people will typically stop flaming if you don't reply, because they believe you ignored them (that's the man thing to do). \nAlso, if the enemy is flaming, or laughing at or talking smack to a teamplayer, 5-man gank him at every opportunity, and give the kills to the laner, and he'll feel much better. \nSeriously though, encourage people not to reply to enemy remarks, just destroy them in-game and watch their sentences become more annoyed because they are spending so much time dead ;)","replies":[{"poster":"hiroshima1945","date":"2015-09-18T07:02:58.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been using Sky's DST (d*ck sucking theory) and it seems to work very well.

Those who are just stressed with a bad situation and end up lashing out. I've responded politely to these people, and they apologize and the match goes on happily.\n2. Jerks (unfortunately more common than the first type). Basically just ignore and report, not much else you can do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-11T14:59:14.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing, absolutely fucking nothing can be done, trust me.\n\nI spent a good 20 minutes in my last promo game trying hard, very hard to get Fiora out of the top lane, she spent 40 minutes either in the lane, getting to the lane, or killing minions in our base that were stopping her going to lane. That and trying to rally my team to group up for once, at least. What do I get, reported and abused.\n\nGame after game it is not just what they say, you can mute them before it starts, but it is what they do that matters. A player with a shit attitude won't even help the team. You miss a gank, a skill shot, get a KS by accident. They won't just hate you, they won't help you and that is that and nothing you can do about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-11T13:56:02.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A toxic situation that involves other players and not you can be very hard to deal with. One thing I would suggest is to ignore them and focus solely on what you're doing and encourage your other teammates that aren't involved to do the same. That way at least 3 of you will be focused on the game and not being distracted by your inconsiderate teammates. It's an unfortunate situation but it's almost impossible to deal with if it's not directly linked to you.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nRegards,\nEuVee [@euveelol](http://www.twitter.com/euveelol)","replies":[]}]}
