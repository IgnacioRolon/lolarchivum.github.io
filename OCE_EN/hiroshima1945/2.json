This could solved issues listed above since:\r\n1) They&#039;ll actually start trying because no one likes getting called a Bronzie.\r\n2) Bronze V level players who somehow landed at Silver V after provisionals will be put to the league they&#039;re supposed to be in.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-19T08:26:10.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ahahh the funny thing is that bronze and silver are the same skill tear wether you like it or not","replies":[{"poster":"hiroshima1945","date":"2015-09-19T12:49:42.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're Bronze 3 so you get matched with or against low mmr Silvers.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-19T13:06:03.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that's the point until you get to gold don't be posting on the boards shit like this as lets face it you probs need to get demoted as well and you can get demoted from silver to bronze","replies":[{"poster":"hiroshima1945","date":"2015-09-20T06:27:53.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to know so much about the game.
