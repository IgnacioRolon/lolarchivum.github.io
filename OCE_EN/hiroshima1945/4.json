Unkillable teams with unlimited CC. Consists of no skill required tank champions.\n\n_\"Why not just play tank junglers?\"_\nThey&#039;re boring to play, unlike Lee Sin.\n\n_\"Why not play Lee Sin?\"_\nA Naut or a Gragas can CC him until he dies or a teammate comes in for the kill.\n\n_\"Why not play tank Lee Sin?\"_\nHe loses all the kill potential he has left, making him really boring and less rewarding to play.\n\nA possible fix: Nerf Cinderhulk even more or just buff early game junglers (e.g. Lee Sin).\nHow to buff early game junglers (e.g. Lee Sin): \n1) better smite range so squishier junglers don't have to go through the whole enemy team just to try to steam the baron.\n2) better clear speed and sustain in the jungle for more ganks = higher snowball potential that can compensate to their terrible late game (when everyone has 5k hp).\n3) buff Warrior enchant, will make squishier junglers like Nocturne and Shaco more viable in this tank meta (don&#039;t over-buff because that probably will piss everyone off, especially the ADC mains). \n\nYes, I&#039;m a Lee main (since Season 5 start). Talk about how bronze this post is below. \n\nCan&#039;t wait till either Lee Sin becomes a more viable pick or this tank meta ends, then I&#039;ll start playing ranked again.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-12T20:26:52.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was no tank meta to begin with, just squishy mains who builds 0 defense all the time crying about dying to tanks when they are finally viable once again.\n\nGranted, some became OP as a result, still that doesn't mean tanks are all the problems.\n\nAnd god forbid Lee is actually just an average champ for once, he dominated the game for 3 years, I don't think giving him a break is a bad idea at all.","replies":[{"poster":"hiroshima1945","date":"2015-06-15T11:37:27.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, just played a game of LeBlanc.
