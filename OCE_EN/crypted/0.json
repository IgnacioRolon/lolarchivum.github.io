Always another one afterwards.\r\n\r\njust please read this forums and do something or plan to do something anything will help i cant deal with more players like this, having harsh punishments not technically banning the player but not allowing them but something so they can learn from","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-06T22:55:29.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Crypted,\n\nIm sorry you've been through some negative experiences in our game. We are working hard to deter and punish negative behaviour. \n\nThere is no silver bullet that solves negative behavior in online games. Players are a diverse bunch, and each player has different motivations and responds differently to different consequences. We design diverse systems using three core philosophies based on reform, punishment, and reward.\nread more about out Player Behaviour Design Values here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nRead more about what we already have in place here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nAnd if you're really interested I highly suggest watching these great GDC talks by our Player Behaviour lead Riot Lyte\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player \nhttp://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player","replies":[{"poster":"NatsuDragneel612","date":"2015-10-07T11:05:57.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one thing you guys need to do is message the players and let them know if the person the outcome of any reports they made and why the person was or wasn't punished, least then players will see that something is being done. I honestly feel that is one of the biggest problems, players are seeing so much toxic behaviour they report these guys but they never feel like anything is being done because they don't get any updates on what happened to the person they reported.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-08T00:31:55.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey NatsuDragneel612 (Personally I would have gone with GlidartsClive612 =P ),\n\nWe hear you on the feedback loop for players that report, we have something in place now but it isn't perfect. \n\n\"Follow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished\"\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing\n\nCurrently it only notifies the player that reports if they are the FINAL report before the punished player is banned.\n\n> For now, this is true. Only the reports in the game that triggered the punishment will result in a pop-up. We're going to be implement Chat and Ranked Restrictions into the Report Feedback feature, and Intentional Feeder Detection into the Report Feedback feature, so you'll be able to get pop-ups when your reports punish a lot more types of behaviors. Because of this, we started the Report Feedback system pretty conservative and didn't want to spam players.\n> Although many players on Reddit are OK getting pop-ups when anyone they have ever reported is punished by any system, turns out anywhere from 20-30% of players do not want any pop-ups at all when their reports trigger a penalty.\n> Some players suggest just doing a toggle, or a \"summary\" that gets sent once a month, but we wanted to get the Report Feedback system to players earlier and then iterate on it as we collect data and see how it's working. Once we get the new punishments into the Report Feedback system, we'll re-assess the spamminess and figure out a longer-term solution.\n\nRiot Lyte - https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3jkcg6/am_i_the_only_one_who_has_reported_like_extremely/cuqjx0f","replies":[{"poster":"Friezy2402","date":"2015-10-12T23:44:56.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are now officially my favourite Riot Employee just for that comment, good day to you sir","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-09T11:25:29.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so... what are the stats on the copy/paste replies you give % wise to written selfwise?\n\nCould you like, implement a system that if 50/60%+ players report for feeding that person gets an hour  queue restriction, to help deter this behavior? so that person realizes that if they do intentionally feed they can get a miniature suspension, and after every 3 (1/4/7/10 etc.) of these suspensions it becomes 2 hours, 3 hours so forth, and every month(?) this is rest.\n\nMeaning the more they feed, the more they intentionally feed, the more they have to wait","replies":[]},{"poster":"NatsuDragneel612","date":"2015-10-09T10:23:41.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah man I should have but then people would have expectations of me being to OP ha ha ha. \n\nThat's good I didn't know about that. But I agree it needs work. Facebook has it that when you file a report they let you know the outcome and even if it's not the outcome you wanted I still like it because it just makes me feel more involved and actually be like \"Well at least it feels like it's being acknowledge\". Which really is what I think a lot of players would like.  I understand getting things like this into place takes time and effort, but I really feel players need more feedback on what happened to people they reported because the not having that knowledge is what creates the whole \"Nothing is being done about it anyway so why bother?\" mentality which a lot of people feel in the game, which leads to people not reporting which leads to those toxic players getting worse and getting away with it.

I have played I dunno about 30 games (I transferred from NA server) and I think maybe 3 of those matches I have had good team mates with no trolling or toxic behaviour or anything bad. Though in those times the other team would be having problems with a toxic player. It's getting beyond a joke really, I should be able to come on and play a game at least the majority of the time without encountering a toxic player. Nothing feels like it is being done about it and this is the exact reason why I stopped playing for about a year, because I was just over the toxic players and now I have come back it's worse than ever. I have never played a game in my life that has such a bad amount of toxic players. LoL is really starting to get a name not as a fun game but as a game full of trolls and abusive players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-06T14:29:56.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing about intentionally feeding is that I mite go 0 20 1 game but go 20 0 the next now how do you know if I fed on purpose you don't and that's then thing and this community would report anyone that dose not get a good game 24 7","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-10-06T22:19:37.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"RIOT hasn't cared since EVER!\n\nAs long as nerds are buying skins and they are getting $$$ they won't give two a fly F....","replies":[]}]}
