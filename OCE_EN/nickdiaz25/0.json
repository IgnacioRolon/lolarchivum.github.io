These games are now a coin toss and its not fun.\r\nAn unranked player with 80 cs and 15 deaths at 30mins just makes any game a non contest.\r\nI thought unranked players are supposed to have s3 mmr?\r\nWin or lose, any game with  a new player is an auto win/lose, not competetive at all,\r\nthis is happening in every second game for me at least","replies":[{"poster":"SappyLumberjack","date":"2018-11-05T10:39:22.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, I am experiencing this too. All of my games seem to be stomps. I also checked LoLWiz and saw that there is a huge difference between the ranks. Some times I am playing with high plats and even diamonds and also in the games are unranked players. A bit frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-05T11:02:06.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that Rank takes a bit to catch up to MMR, and that an unranked player hasn't necessarily never been ranked and isn't necessarily new.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-31T03:20:17.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fresh unranked players will have a Silver 3~ MMR, but if for example a player was gold last season, their MMR will be higher then the default. It's also possible for a fresh account to raise it's MMR to low-mid gold if they are winning every game in their promos.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that especially at this time of year, visible rank doesn't always reflect MMR, which is the more accurate indicator of actual skill. \n\nA player with a rank of Gold 3, could easily be a diamond player on a fresh account in an off role. Their mechanical skill is lower than their main but their game knowledge remains the same. A player could have been autofilled, so despite their skill in top/jng easily matching their plat 4 rank, their skill in support is pretty lackluster.\n\nThe vast majority of these problems will be addressed, at least to a degree in the new ranked system next season, but for now, end of season games are always much more polarised than normal. Higher population, higher variety of skill and consistency, and less accuracy on those players who don't queue for ranked very often. End (ranked rewards) and start (placements) of season make everything a little wonky.","replies":[]}]}
