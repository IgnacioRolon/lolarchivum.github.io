Role: Marksman\n\nP- isolated power: standing away from allies stores energy. At full stacks of energy the next auto attack on a champion will deal 5% of the enemies maximum health in physical damage. An allies next auto attack on the same target will deal 5% of the enemies current health in physical damage.\n\nQ- cheap shot: fires a skill shot in a line, going through minions and dealing damaged to the first champion hit as well as slowing them, does extra damaged to an impaired target.\n\nW- Tag In: first cast selects an ally. If the target ally is within range Yikiri can then cast his w a second time, pulling the target in then shooting the ally in his slingshot to a target location. The ally receives extra magic resist and armor when they land at the target location.\n\nE- blunder weed: Yikiri rolls a blunder weed in a straight line. The blunder weed knocks up all enemies hit and increases in speed the further it goes\n\nR- Ancient Spirit: Yikiri summons a spirit under a nearby knocked up champion, which holds them in the air. Yikiri then lines up a powerful shot and hits all  early knocked up units with a powerful shot. (can shoot up to 5 special shots and hold up to 5 enemy champions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLycero          The considerate twin      Role: Support\n\nP- Bonding power: upon standing near an ally champion, Lycero charges up energy. At full stacks of energy the next auto attack will release the energy dealing 5% of the enemies max health in Magic damage. An allies next auto attack on the target will deal 5% of the enemies current health in magic damage.\n\nQ- snare sand: lobs snare sand to a target location, rooting all enemies for x seconds and dealing damage.\n\nW- tag out: on first cast selects an ally champion. On second cast pulls the selected ally champion towards Lycero.\n\nE- Guardians stone: places a small totem at a target location. The totem heals nearby allies and silences and damages nearby enemies. The totem has 3 health for ranged attackers and 2 health for melee attackers. The heal is stronger towards those with less hp. The guardian stone counts as an ally and can charge Lycero's passive\n\nR- free spirit: Lycero channels for 1 second before leaping to the target location. Lycero knocks up herself and all enemy champion around her. Free spirit deals more damage based on enemies current hp% ( more damaged the more % ho they have)\n\n\nI haven't done cool downs and stats but the basis is that Yikiri's abilities scale ad and lycero's abilities scale ap.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2015-11-26T07:37:37.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the concept of Lycero, however Tag out might cause a few issues with pulling a low health champion into the pack of the enemy team... threshes lantern has the active component that you have to choose to travel to the new location. otherwise they seem pretty neet","replies":[]}]}
