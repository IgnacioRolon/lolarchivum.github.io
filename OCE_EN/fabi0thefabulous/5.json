Yakisota is unique in having 3 toggle on and off abilities, all 3 affecting his auto attacks. His lore is that he is one of the last of many special elemental warriors, and uses a bow and arrow as well as the power of the elements. His q, w, and e have a 2 second global cooldown between each attack, so he can not perma slow. Yakisota also uses an energy bar as there has not been an energy champ in a while and it will extend the cooldowns on his stronger abilities, because if he spams the stronger abilities he will run out of energy, leaving him vulnerable\n\n(P) elemental balance: upon using all 3 basic elements (fire, ice, and earth)  gain a movement speed buff (scaling with level)\n\nso upon using his q w and e in different variations he will gain the buff. this may include 1 q then a w,e combo. if he uses a q,w,e combo (typhoon) he will immediately get the speed buff upon using attacking.\n\n(Q) element- fire: next auto attack will burn for up 3 seconds       (20 energy)\n\n(W) element- ice: next auto attack apply a slow for 2 seconds      (20 energy)\n\n(E) element- earth: next auto does extra damage                            (20 energy)\n\n(Q, W)  element- water: next auto will heal                                        (40 energy)\n\n(Q, E) element- lava : next auto will have extra % armor pen           (40 energy)\n\n(W, E) element- crystal: next auto stuns for x seconds based on the leveling up of w   (40 energy)\n\n(Q, W, E) element- air: next auto will summon a small typhoon around the target, knocking them up and all nearby allies.          (60 energy)\n\n(R) Volley: fires a wave of arrows at the target area. the ability can be cast a seconds time within 10 seconds      (no cost)\n\n\n\n\nYakisota will look like a youngish monk with either cloth/ light weight looking clothing or more of a monk robe. He will also, again, have a bow and arrow.  P.s. i&#039;m bad at stats so if you guys/girls want to you can put your ideas for stats in, or if this idea gets popular riot can.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-22T07:18:16.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i fucking HATE toggle abilities. also that character is pretty much udyr.....also no mention of mana.....you expect this guy to not have mana and be an on-hit damage champ? im sure that'll work out perfectly......","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-22T10:43:07.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you think that is bad wait until you see this...\n\n\nZen, The Mysterious Illusionist\n\nLore: Zen has seen many dark and evil things in the world of Valoran.\nAt a young age Zen witnessed the deaths of his parents to creatures he later discovered came from the shadow isles.\nFurious and Desperate to avenge his family he studied many forms of destructive magic,\nHowever he was only able to successfully master one of these magic techniques.\nThis magic allows the caster to fabricate an object from his mind, including things his currently veiwing.\nthe magic is illegal almost everywhere in Valoran so Zen decided to practise his magic on a remote island just off the coast of the shadow isles,\nZen recently learned of the dark beings that are currently compeating at the League of Legends, enraged by this monstrosity he decided to join the league of legends,\nand attempt to purge it of all evil and dark creatures, both from the Void and the Shadow isles.\n\nPassive: (Copycat) Whenever Zen uses an ability he leaves behind a copy of himself with 50% (+10% of Zen's current Health) that lasts for 6 seconds,\nAfter the 6 seconds have passed this copy will implode pulling and slowing enemies by 30% for 2 seconds within a 250 unit Radius and,\ndealing 60-80-100-120 (+60% of Zen's AP) as Magic Damage to caught within it.\n\nQ: (Mirror) Zen creates a copy of Target champion that lasts for 180 seconds.

I see this champ being a bot lane carry version of Udyr and Sona, having Udyr's on hit reliance and Sona's cooldown reliance. Instead of AD + AS from Udyr or AP from Sona, however, he can't build AS due to his one-hit only abilities, and AP tends to leave his attacking a bit weak. Building AD makes him extremely fragile, thus giving him flexibility.\n\nAlso, change around the combinations to be a lot more intuitive, burn + slow shouldn't be a heal... This isn't DoTA 2 where you can get away with making Invoker and force people to become a one trick pony simply to master it.\n\n\nI'd suggest that the passive should be: Every time he uses an ability, he gains 100 range until it is applied (and his auto attack range is 475, thus forcing him to use abilities and waste energy, or take hits and waste health, when farming to compensate for his potential, in exchange he gets a slightly above average range of 575 when he's out of lane and has a team to peel for him.). If he uses the 2 ability combos, the bonus is 150, leaving his at 625 range. If he uses the 3 ability combo, he instead gains 175 range, leaving him at Caitlyn's 650 for 60 energy.\n\nHis ultimate should interact with everything else instead of just outright copying Varus and Ashe... Literally, the name Volley is taken. I'd say his ultimate should interact with his Q, W and E. I'd say he can apply his last basic element (Q, W, or E, but not considering combinations), and it becomes an on-hit effect that applies to all of his auto attacks, while still allowing him to use other abilities normally, for 5 attacks or something. I'd recommend you change his ice element though because slows don't stack. His range is increased to 675 also.\n\n\n\nWhat does balance him is the fact he's the first champ to be energy without an efficient way of recovering it.\n\nHe'd be a short range burst ADC like graves... I'm not sure how graves fulfills the role, however.\n\n\nAlso the name kinda sounds like an attempt to make an exotic name gone wrong and a bit racist. Yakisoba is a type of Japanese noodles sold in food stalls.","replies":[{"poster":"Fabi0thefabulous","date":"2015-10-30T08:50:08.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you very much for your feed back. Your ideas are good and I can see the point you are making. That passive idea is really good. His ult could be a damage buff maybe even a medium range teleport or something so he can have mobility but not so much that he's unbalanced. tbh I made the name up in like 30 seconds and apparently I have a talent for naming Japanese noodle companies -_-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-10-25T23:50:37.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't create characters/kits for MMORGPS and expect them to work in League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-22T07:39:30.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His name sounds like Filipino noodles","replies":[]}]}
