He is melee yet does have certain tools to get him into a fight, and get his damage off. He is meant to look muscular, yet somewhat small. He will have bits of armor, and a larger sword, which will pulse with lasers. He will however look a bit scrappy, and his armour will look somewhat old. For a skin idea (improved Kirean) he can look like he was upgraded by Viktor (pretty sure project isn&#039;t meant to be made by Viktor, if they are then scrap this idea)\r\n\r\nPassive: when attacked by champions Kirean stores damage. When he gets 4 charges he will discharge the stored damage on his next auto attack, dealing extra damage and slowing the target. \r\n\r\nQ: Kirean switches between high gravity and low gravity. Low gravity will give Kirean a small move speed buff and an attack speed buff, it will also interact with his w and ult. High gravity will give kirean more armor and magic resist, as well as a bit more damage.\r\n\r\nW: (low gravity) Kirean jumps a long distance with his boosters (can go over terrain). If during his jump Kirean changes to high gravity he will slam down immediately, dealing damage and slowing nearby enemies.\r\n\r\n      (high gravity) Kirean charges forward knocking aside enemies hit and dealing damage. If kirean changes ti low gravity mid dash he will shoot up and can re cast his w to dash a short distance.\r\n\r\nE: Kirean activates his bubble shield, gaining a shield and spell shield. if the shield is depleted he will lose the spell shield. If the spell shield blocks a spell, Kirean&#039;s next auto attack will become ranged. the ranged auto has onhit affects, so it can proc his passive\r\n\r\nR: Kirean throws down a gravitation mine. The gravitation mine will push enemies away then pull them in, dealing damage when they are pulled in. In low gravity Kirean is also pushed and pulled, but does not take damage.\r\n\r\nKirean&#039;s passive is helpful as when he takes damage he can return it and make it an advantage. His q should be fun, as you have to manage your gravity, and choose how it will affect your abilities, as well as your stats in a fight. His e allows him to deny harass and then potentially return it. Kirean&#039;s ult has good cc as well as a bit of damage, and when used correctly can get you out of a bad situation, or get an enemy into a place where you can finish them.","replies":[{"poster":"Fabi0thefabulous","date":"2015-11-29T11:06:55.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your feedback **Talon12** and **DarkGate**. The idea of making the e change depending on which gravity state he is in is quite good, I like the idea of every one of his abilities revolving around his q, making you choose between durability, and raw damage, or mobility and quicker attack speed, aswell as the idea of 'do I want a shield for damage, for the adc, or the spell shield for the ap carry'. I hadn't really thought abut the change of his q giving a small buff, but the only champ who does it is jayce so I guess it is a reasonably unique thing, he could get a move speed and maybe pass through units for 4 seconds when he changes into low gravity, and maybe a 5% damage reduction for 4 seconds when he changes into high gravity. Thanks again for your feedback, i'll try and make a lore, and I can try to draw something up, if not maybe my friend can cause he's a pretty good drawer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-29T04:24:35.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dw m8, project was made to combat viktor\n\nAnd make e interact with his q as well, say he gets a shield for 20/40/60/80/100 + 10/11/12/13/14/15% max hp in high gravity, and spell shield in low gravity which gives him 25% increased aa speed on next auto (auto becomes ranged)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2015-11-29T02:42:06.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like a strong champion, i'm interested in seeing them on the rift. the wombo combos that could ensue from his ult would be devastating. \n\nwith his Q low and High Gravity. would their be an active effect?  eg when switching from High to low he gains a short move speed buff,  and when switching from low to high, gaining a small shield. \nor would the effect be purely passive like Nid's Cougar form. \n\nhow durable would his **E** _Bubble shield_,  spell shield be. \nif it only blocked the effects of a spell leaving the regular shield to take the damage that sounds like a neat kit and would open his kit for counter play options. even more counter play could be created by lowering the duration of the bubble shield. although that would make him more challenging to play. \n\nGood Idea all around. i would love to see some concept art and lore\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
