I was thinking of some buffs for it and I thought of 3 different buffs. one could be ignore unit collision. If some crazy person started sprinting at me I think I would step out of the way, so why don&#039;t the minions. the second is it could be like in mario where you get the 3 mushrooms, so she can activate her ult 3 times, but a weaker buff. the third option could be that she and her team get a move speed buff, then little move speed pads spawn, if an ally step on them they get the move speed buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-27T03:59:24.147+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fabi0thefabulous,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=51yyptyZ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-09-27T03:00:45.636+0000)\n>\n> I think that Sivir is underplayed \n\nwhat drugs are you smoking","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-27T05:05:36.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In majority of my games I never see Sivir played, or banned, or hovered over, or even considered.
