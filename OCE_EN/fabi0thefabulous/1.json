A new skin would be good for Sion, and i thought of Snow Monster Sion. he uses a shovel instead of an axe, his w is he makes a shield thats blue instead of red and has snow and snow flakes, his e would be a snowball, his ult is he is covered by snow and looks like a giant snow ball. he would look like a giant evil snow man.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-09-13T13:51:46.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I can imagine is a giant snowball rolling across the rift screaming death and it's honestly the best thing ever, I don't even play Sion but this would make a fantastic Christmas skin. To do it properly they'd have to make it at least a 1350 though, not that anyone would mind, I don't think Sion has a 1350/legendary yet.","replies":[]}]}
