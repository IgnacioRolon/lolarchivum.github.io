He doesnt really feel like a yordle in a mech suit, but just a robot. I think he should be able to leave the mech or just have some fun mechanics which make him a bit more unique, cause at the moment the hardest thing is managing your spells for your passive and landing your large range ult. please post any ideas you peoples have to make rumble a more unique and fun champ xD","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2015-11-26T12:17:14.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that Rumble is pretty unpopular in lower ranks, and in some cases higher ranks, but that's just because of the new mastery system.
