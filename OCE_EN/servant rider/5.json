Players who exhibit extreme toxicity or negativity in the form of severe homophobia, racism, etc. may be permanently suspended with no intermediary punishments. \n2. Players who exhibit consistent toxicity or negativity without indications of reform may be permanently suspended after they've gone through some sort of punishment and showed no change in behavior afterwards. \n\nThe reform card that you received may have only been from one match; however, not all of the matches that contributed to your Permanent Suspension are included in your reform card. If you have any additional questions regarding the Player Behavior systems, feel free to create a thread within the [**Player Behavior & Moderation**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) sub-boards, and we would be more than happy to discuss any questions or comments you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2015-12-11T12:26:27.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm ok, thanks for the info.
