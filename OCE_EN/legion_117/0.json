What happens if I agree and Telstra doesn&#039;t, do I get banned? Is there any way for me to prove that I wasn&#039;t leaving? In the games in question I was ahead in both, and I never flame in chat, and I usually don&#039;t even like to surrender. So I think it would be obvious to any rioter that looked into it that I wasn&#039;t leaving these games of my own volition, but I don&#039;t know if these things are even able to be appealed. Should I just stop playing until my internet contract expires?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-04T07:17:15.139+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you got the I agree thin then it's the first time Leaver Buster has noticed you so you don't have TOO much to worry about. it usually takes a few significant leaves in a short timeframe to actually get you a LB punishment (which scales from a 5 game 5 minute wait to a 5 game 20 minute wait) so even if you left once more it is unlikely you would be hit. That said, you will get LeaverBusters much faster in ranked so you'll have to be wary of that.\n\nYou have to leave a metric butt ton of games before you'd get banned instead of LeaverBustered. The \"I agree\" is just a warnign and an acknolwedgment.\n\nMy advice is to either stick to norms for a few days, or at least check the telstra statuses and test in a custom game for 5 mins or so before you jump into a ranked game. \n\nAn easy way to check your ping without starting a game is Start > (type) cmd > enter/open the command prompt > (type) ping google.com > enter. Which will tell you if you're lagging or not, but it won't help if the connection issue is specifically between you and the Riot servers","replies":[{"poster":"Legion 117","date":"2016-12-04T16:49:28.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thanks that's a bit reassuring. I've played League since 2011 and that's the first I've seen this thing and I was worried that I close to a significant punishment.\n\nThe problem is sporadic and doesn't seem to be preceded by any connection issues that I can tell. I'll have 14 ping all game, then everything will disconnect for 10 min, and then back to 14 ping, but thank you for the advice :D\n\nYeah, I'll play less ranked for a couple days and see if it happens again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-05T01:00:30.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, maybe talking to telstra would be a good idea. I get random ping spikes every so often (800-900ms) but they don't last long, and I've never had an unexplained dc, especially for that long :(\n\nAre they maybe starting work for NBN in your area or something?\n\nYou should be able to find specifics about your area through this: http://servicestatus.telstra.com/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-12-04T17:17:45.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i've afked/left game like 10 times since i started in season 4. only got hit by a technical issue once this season that caused me to be afk for 3 mins as i tried to connect and got hit by remake penalty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legion 117","date":"2016-12-04T07:17:21.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thx for the responses guys :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-04T07:10:52.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be hit by Leaver Buster and have to suffer a 20 minute pre-queue several times.\n\nIf you want to reduce your chances of that happening, increase the amount of games where you don't AFK.\nFor instance, if you play 20 games a week you could AFK 2 of those games and get no penalty.\nIf you play 100 games you can AFK 10 with no penalty in sight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-04T07:07:04.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, in the EULA, it stats that internet issues that aren't server related are on you,  so if you afk for any reason that isnt riot server related, its on you and you are punishable for it.","replies":[]}]}
