Games won? Lost?\r\nWhat exactly?\r\n\r\nI know the game gives duos a &#039;boost&#039; to put them with higher skilled players, that is because they should be able to co-ordinate better, unless they are just some random you grouped with last game. But does it take into account games played with certain champions or roles? Does it allow for win or lose streaks? Or does it simply go, ha, you won here is +X amount of... stuff.\r\n\r\nAccording to one of the many LoL sites that show in game stats, one of my games tonight we had a lower MMR than the enemy, it might be, it might not be the same as Riots system.\r\n\r\nEither way, their algorithm worked out that the enemy team, based on all stats from all players in all servers with the same or similar stats and yaddy yadda,  the usual, it worked out my teams MMR as being lower than the enemy, yet in that game I had a Teemo who for 44 minutes sat his ass in the top lane, when he got to the bush near the golems he sat there until it was safe to push, safe to attack an enemy and run, or just die, he finished with only 217 CS after 46 minutes and a score of 3/8.\r\n\r\nHe joined us for ONE team fight, just one at the 44 minute mark, 2 minutes later we pushed 2 towers, an inhib, 4 kills and the nexus. During the game we also pushed and fought a baron, took an easy second baron, 2-3 contested dragons and multiple skirmishes in a 4v5 situation while he sat in the top lane, refusing to join us, and complaining if someone went into &#039;his&#039; lane and took &#039;his&#039; CS. Fuck him, I stole all his CS I could when he started bitching.\r\n\r\nMy point is this, even with all the averages over all the games of all the players, whether that be personal MMR, your rankings MMR, your specific champions MMR or that specific 10 man setup MMR, it worked out our average lower and yet in a mostly 4v5 game we still comfortably held on until we finally had a 5v5 fight and won.\r\n\r\nI know external sites don&#039;t have the same stats down to a T, they can&#039;t see where you were in specific situations and so on and give you the same champion score at the end, but for what these sites offer, they are not bad. But why is it we didn&#039;t even come close to losing in that situation even though we should have lost?\r\n\r\nHow does Riot actually do it? And what can be done to improve it? That game was a normal game, not ranked. I just think that if someone else can work out you should have lost, and had a moron who didn&#039;t join your team, than you should have lost.","replies":[]}
