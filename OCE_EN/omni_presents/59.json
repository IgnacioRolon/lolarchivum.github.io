Soon? ...Never?\r\n\r\nI just finished a game with a 4 man premade on my team and 3 on the enemy. As you know, when you premake a team it places you in a higher MMR bracket, from the outset of that game I was outdone. 2 players on the enemy team should be the same MMR as myself as they were solo, but the 4 premade ones would have been lower than their 3 man.\r\n\r\nTo top it off I don&#039;t think they spoke English, I didn&#039;t see even on more of it for the whole game.\r\n\r\nI play games to be SOLO, not a team, there is an option for that. Over time I have seen more games lost with the team who is premade, or has more premade players, than I have won. A fair few of those games you get the premades blatantly letting you die, blaming you for the lose and just being general asshats.\r\n\r\nLike it makes ANY fucking difference whose fault it is for the lose, being an asshole about it does not improve anyone&#039;s game and having that attitude is half the reason those premade players lose. Just because you are premade with your friends, that does not mean you can ignore the rest of your team, it does not help you to get a win.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-02-28T14:17:03.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"probably never.\nlearn to abuse the new system.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-28T23:25:54.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alfawarrior3,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=y8H4OBt5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-28T14:17:03.058+0000)\n>\n> probably never.\n> learn to abuse the new system.\n\nSounds about right.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-29T23:19:25.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm, it's coming out in a few months...probably around March/April even","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T02:21:24.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They won't release it till they get enough out of dynamic queue, because they know full well no one will use dynamic queue the second solo queue is released, because solo queue means something, dynamic queue is just who has the better premade.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-01T00:21:59.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it is who has the worst premade, at least at low ranks and MMR.

Once they get the full solo queue going I may actually play more games, hopefully they can also bring in a scoring system that rewards you for YOUR score, not that of your team.\n\nThey already have a system in place that gives you a personal scoring system based on your own play, this encompasses what champ you play, what lane you choose, what role you take and all that, so forget KDA and use everything they have available.\n\nAn example would be in a 5v5 loss:\nI play Nasus, even when I get low kills and high deaths, I generally get top damage taken and a fair bit of damage done in both categories, this shows I am actually doing something for my team in being a tank.\n\nYou then take that Shaco player who has high kills and low deaths, but also minimal damage done showing that all he was doing was roaming and KS'ing. And when I say minimal, I've seen some 5000 damage for 20+ kills with no assists and only a handful of CS.\n\nEven though the Shaco has high kills, he has nothing else much more than some jungle farm, the system can be made to pickup on this and see that he was doing nothing for the team and punish him for this type of play.\n\nToo many times I see players take champions and play simply to get high kills and nothing more, even in ranked. In normals I can understand, in bots I expect it, but in ranked you need to stop thinking of being a selfish asshole and blaming your team just because you stole all the kills and didn't really help your team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Swooz","date":"2016-02-29T05:39:23.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not expecting the SoloQ to come this season, probably start of next season..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-02-29T02:10:20.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked as now has too many friend's boosting.

Most of the time they ignore you, and don't even bother to ping so you have very little idea what is going on. Personally I think you shouldn't be able to queue as a 4, only 1,2,3 and 5.\n\n> I play games to be SOLO, not a team \n\nWhile I am sure you mean you play games not to be squished in with a premade 4, you must accept the fact that league of legends is a **team game** and someone has gotta fill that gap.  You not only climb the ranks based on your own abilities (which is not that important as it is getting harder and harder to solo carry) but your ability to work well in a team. Encouraging others, keeping a cool head, being able to rally your team around objectives with minimal communication (low elo solo q is great for not communicating at all), are all part of the experience that shape you as a player. \n\n>A fair few of those games you get the premades blatantly letting you die, blaming you for the lose and just being general asshats.\n\n>Like it makes ANY fucking difference whose fault it is for the lose, being an asshole about it does not improve anyone's game and having that attitude is half the reason those premade players lose. Just because you are premade with your friends, that does not mean you can ignore the rest of your team, it does not help you to get a win.\n\nYes people can play the blame game, but there is no point in getting salty over it. A big part of getting better, is the ability to leave the past behind you. This includes accepting that you can't argue with/teach people that don't want to listen or provide a basic level of communication in your games. \n\nThe best thing you can do while we wait for the official stance on OCE solo q, is to[ join a premade ranked 5 team.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) That way, you can learn each others play patterns, make long lasting friendships, and have A+ communication. It also provides you with extra IP & champion mastery points. \n**There is literally nothing to lose. **","replies":[]}]}
