That just shows the difference in skill at this rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-15T15:27:13.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something better directed at the Instructors, and I am not equipped very well to answer, but I want to mention something a lot of people tend to overlook, namely tier dynamics. I.e the differences in standards between tiers.\n\nIn Bronze/low Silver most players lack a lot of skill in areas like playing from behind and stalling games, this means that once a team gets a lead they will snowball much harder if left to their own devices. This is where playing jungle or support can be really valuable, because you can identify the members of the enemy team that need to be shut down and have the means to do so as early as possible. (i.e stop the threat BEFORE they're a threat you cant handle, don't try to after)\n\nKills and Damage don't win games. They certainly help, but ultimately it's how many objectives you can take that matters. You can't win if you don't kill the nexus. I've played plenty of games (some in Bronze) where a team was way ahead in gold and kills, but had little awareness of what the other team was doing, and ultimately lost, still ahead on kills and gold, because they just hadn't taken the objectives.\n\nThat game you linked? That Nasus had TP and alright farm, and a Yasuo wouldn't have an easy time stopping him. If he'd been timing his split pushing he alone could have easily cost you that game, and from the looks of things almost did. He had your inhibitor a whole 13 minutes before you had any of theirs.\n\nThese games are only decided by luck if both teams lack awareness of their enemy. Whichever side is more aware (consistently) will almost always win.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-16T11:21:47.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you are saying, _**I**_ do, I can't speak for the shit I get stuck with. That Yas, like most Yas players I am playing with these days, suck major ass, there is nothing good I can say about them. The game before that Yas asks to swap with me top (being Nasus myself). I made a comment that my top laner opponent was quite bad, I was ahead in farm by a fair bit and had taken his tower, so yeh I thought what could go wrong, Yas goes top and feed twice instantly than starts to bring the team down with him with the other 3 on my team complaining about him, it almost happened in that Malz game.\n\nThe issue is this, I play well in lane, I almost always do, even if I fall behind in farm and kills, I can still defend my lane, it's possibly the easiest thing to do early to mid game in top and mid lane, no matter even when I get those 1v5 lanes I can still defend well enough to stop them just running over me.\n\nBut the issue? You get players like Yas who fall so hard their champion gets concussion and they start playing like a drunken sailor. I for one need to defend MY lane, secondly I try to help where I can, in that game being mid, I stopped my opponent first and formost, cannot afford to constantly roam top to stop Nasus farming and allow my mid to get free farm also. But when I do stop my lane and have free time to roam, that is when the minions are not attacking my tower and my opponent is either dead or gone B, I roam. By than, due to how bad some players play, it's too late to help their lane and all you can do is focus on end game, getting kills, CS and items so you can push and hope to carry your team and pray to god they stop feeding.\n\nI have had games where I took 9 towers, alone, as in, ALL alone. 100% of the lane pushing was done by myself and my team done nothing, lost causes since my team cannot defend even under a tower, eventually the enemy just run over us. In that game I linked (which the link not surprisingly seems to have been taken down) I took 5 towers, my team took 3 combined. 3 towers and an inhibitor were taken by the minions (can't recall who was helping push, if any).\n\nBy 42 minutes we were almost down in gold the enemy were able to come back that hard. No thanks to my triple kill (almost a quad), followed by a double kill and 2 inhibitors falling, we were able to hold on for the win. Think of the kills as lucky if you wish, again I done triple damage from almost all other players on the map, half my kills were mine alone, even a couple of 1v1 fights against there Nasus (god I love Malz minions with 45% CDR).\n\nIn a situation where there you get grouped with players who have no map awareness and cannot defend a lane to save their mums life, you end up with enemy players split pushing and making it very difficult to carry with ANY champion. And I refer you to my most wonderful of games (can you taste the sarcasm?). Yi Jungle, and I kid you not, 100% truth be told, 1 MILLION Damage Dealt, 250 THOUSAND Player Damage, almost every tower and inhibitor alone, buy alas I was playing with a 4 man premade, according to them all on the same internet connection. Constant DC's, a combined 6 kills or some shit by the four of them compared to my over 40, and I still lost.\n\nI had a game recently as Nasus, sitting INSIDE the enemy base taking on 1v3, and staying alive long enough to get kills, whilst my team in a similar 3v1 fight, couldn't even stay alive, let alone kill the person. In almost every ranked game this season I have won, I have either broken even and got lucky with my team vs. the enemy, or completely out stated?? my team to the point it looks like I was smurfing (and been called out for smurfing) that it looked ridiculous, and even than almost lost some of them. Whenever I get a bad game I almost always lose, even in those games I get that far ahead I end up fighting 1v4 and almost take all 4 of them down my team STILL can't even take one lousy tower.\n\nI've had ADC's do nothing but farm until it is too late for us to fight back either by sitting in lane the entire game or roam just for farm, never pushing a lane. I once had a Teemo top lane who sat in lane for 40+ minutes with me constantly harassing him for 20 of those to leave the lane (no joke, 2-3 minutes after he stopped feeding and left the lane we won our first team fight and inevitably the game). I've had plenty of games where my team simply split after the team fight, go farming, never push a lane or take ANY objectives, minutes later we die, lose baron and the game.\n\nI can go on forever, by playing in the solo queue and not folding to Riot's dis-belief that it is better for everyone to join a team, players simply refuse to listen until it gets to the point you are told \"Fuck off, the four of us are on Skype and I am the one who tells you what to do\", than proceeds to feed and yell at everyone for being bad. Yeh, that actually happened to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
