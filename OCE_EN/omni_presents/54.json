Looking at that game, I get regular games like that, but still get loses. I even get them S scorecard loses, how?

They run Udyr/Nasus split pushing jungle/top, and their strategy basically has nothing to do with the rest of the team. They win whether their team sucks or not because they focus on pushing towers instead of just racking up kills.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-02-15T11:55:09.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That still takes 2, I am solo and wish Rito would make a SOLO queue, not a \"Let's group this solo with 2 premade teams who start hating on each other\".","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-15T12:06:47.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are actually going to introduce a Solo only Ranked queue.
