In all games the time the person was AFK we ended up losing at least a tower, 2 towers in one of the games, yeh, that means nothing.\n\nWhilst &#039;only&#039; being ARAM, it is still a game that needs to follow the rules and something needs to be done. I am now expecting to join a game and have an AFK and planning to lose, not so much the losing part, but the part you know you are going to have your asses to the wall and not enjoy playing.\n\nSo far tonight I have had:\nInternet troubles\nSpilled water on desk\n3 minutes to eat dinner that took 10 minutes\nAnd a random AFK\n\nThe first 3 came back, albeit too late, and just acted like it was OK to randomly go AFK and ruin the game for everyone.\n\nI don&#039;t care about losing, I don&#039;t care about winning either, I will always give my best regardless of the situation, but I hate assholes who don&#039;t care about the game in general, regardless of reason, if you have an attitude that shows you have no fucks left to give, go play another game.\n\nI hate games that are one sided, I don&#039;t care what side I am on, in fact I hate winning more when the enemy has AFK or players who are obviously in the &#039;I don&#039;t give a shit&#039; category. I tend to play worse when the enemy is blatantly going to lose.\n\nIf you are going to play an obviously competitive game and not be competitive, go play farmville. I come into each of my games with a good attitude towards players who actually want to play and want to give their best. You may feed, not know how to play your champion, not really know much about strategy, if you actually try, I for one will be happy that you did give a good effort and do what I can to assist you, and it is pretty obvious who are the ones who are bad and those who just don&#039;t care.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-30T22:36:52.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer some players forget that the other game modes like norms do still matter in my opinion norms is just important as ranked like what do you get from ranked a border and a skin cool bro cos that is important","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-01T10:25:40.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well maybe up until gold, after that you can really start to work on rank and try to stream, get into competitions and whatnot, that is if you are somewhere other than OCE.\n\nBut yes, essentially if you are good enough than ranked means jack shit other than free advertising as to how good you are, you and I, like a lot of others, do prefer the non stressful version of this game in playing normals. Too bad there are enough of those in the I don't care category that ruin it on a regular enough basis that it is painful.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-12-01T20:00:50.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not stress for me I went all the way upto  gold 1 on my brothers account and kept the rank for 3 weeks before I got board\n\nsee I can play {{champion:23}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:120}} like a god in top and jg but I'm that guy who likes to go {{champion:114}} sup full ap top/mid  {{champion:19}} I just cant handle the fact that I need to play 3 champs and only 3 champs to climb so until I get my pool a bit bigger I'm just gona play for fun \n\nand yes iv tried to get up rank on this account got to silver 4 before going back down to wood","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-03T14:13:02.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold is easy, but you are right, most of the time you need to stick with the same champions game in game out, that can be cumbersome, especially if your team are asses and the enemy hard counter you.\n\nThe amount of games I have stated \"I can't play support well\", yet get stuck with support, 4 abusive team mates and possibly 4 reports, is retarded enough to make me want to puke and turn off the game all together, it's just a role I cannot play well. But in Normals at least if I get stuck with it I just deal with it the best I can.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-01T00:15:15.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Whilst 'only' being ARAM, it is still a game that needs to follow the rules and something needs to be done.\n\nYou mean like reporting players who break the rules? That's usually a good place to start. After all, Riot can't punish players who break the rules if they're not being flagged for doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-01T10:21:06.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh it doesn't really do much, even though Rito have stated they made so many changes. Players just go on doing it like they have done it enough time to not be worried about it anymore.\n\nThe game can recognise an AFK, they should do something about it. Much like they do with players who flame others, put players on an incrementing ban, if they don't learn just keep increasing the time they are banned until they eventually get perma banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-01T11:37:31.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean like what is already happening? Players do get punished for AFKing/DCing, more than a few come onto the boards to complain about it. It starts with LPQs and, if that doesn't convince them to reform, they get increasing bans, until the get a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-12-01T20:04:33.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree so many have it in there head that riot dose not ban any one so no one reports stupid 12 year olds","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-01T11:49:54.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It needs to act faster. 5 games in a row I had 6 AFK.
