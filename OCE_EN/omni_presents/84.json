My friends just don&#039;t play MOBA games and that won&#039;t ever change.\r\n\r\nYou may end up getting a little more % of players playing with friends, or getting new friends to join, and when they do it will take about 3-4 weeks before they all start hitting level 30, get the minimum 16 champions required and start ruining the ranked queue to no extent. Either that or they will just ruin games all over since they will be grouping with an experienced player.\r\n\r\n6 years into a game and making this change is only going to benefit those who already play with friends and make those who play solo look like they are getting a good deal, which they aren&#039;t. We already have enough issues with players grouping, getting matched with higher skilled players and having their asses handed to them.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is something that is actually going to change that, make a completely solo queue that does not allow grouped players and than place all the grouped players together, 2/3/5 man groups get into the same queue and solo players separate. Even if I get my friends to start playing now in anticipation of patch 6.0, I have 4 years more experience than they do, for them to catch up, learn firstly how to play, than learn the following:\r\n* Jungle timers\r\n* All,  most, or at the least all the most used champions skills\r\n* The ability to read up on an enemy champion and at least learn the basics within 5 minutes so you don&#039;t get smashed\r\n* Roaming\r\n* Pings\r\n* Ganks\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to learn before I even consider playing with my friends that I won&#039;t even bother. They will start the game and when they hit 30 will get smashed so bad it will turn them off, annoy a torrent of other players and make things worse. I realise this now to the point that I don&#039;t even bother asking them to start playing. It is a really good effort from Rito, but one that I fear is years too late in the making.\r\n\r\nWith the upcoming patch 6.0 changes being announced, Rito are simply rewarding older players who play with friends more than they are enticing new players to join. With 127 champions with costs somewhat around - 32 @ 6300 IP / 975 RP, 40 @ 4800 IP / 880 RP and 55 @ 3150 IP / 790 RP = 566,850 IP / 109,850 IP.\r\n\r\n~75 IP for each game, plus 150 for FWoTD, 5 games a day, that will take approximately 1000 days with at least one win in each day in the solo queue to get all the current champions... or 3 years, give or take. Matching with friends, let&#039;s say every game is duo or better, around 750 days would be a good estimate? Or you can just pay for them all at a cost of ~$900 AUD.\r\n\r\nI started playing this game when there were like 40 champions, I can tell you now, I would never start the game fresh now, there is just too much to catch up. Where do you even begin? You could start with the mega bundle, 21 champions and a shit load of skins for $100, but than what is the point of free to play? With IP it takes about 7-8 days, 5 games a day to get a new champion, so one a week every week with a assuming nothing less than 20 minutes a game, 1 hour and 40 minutes minimum a day of game play and up to what, 5-6 hours maximum? Every, single, day just to catch up in some 2-3 years if you are not big on spending a ton of money.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nIf you are trying to entice new players to join, you need to STOP looking at the end result and START looking at how to actually get new players to join. You need to think about the first 6 months of a new players account, not the fact some of us have been here for years, give new players a real reason to get into the game other than just playing with friends, rewards are great and all, but how do you really get new players into the game to STAY in the game?\r\n\r\nFYI - I started playing MOBA games when DoTA was all there was, back than I tried to get my friends to play, and that was when everything was free all the time, even back than when it was pretty basic with no cost involved they would still not do it, I have been playing LoL for some 4 years with a few breaks in there and own 95 champions, it takes time to get this far without spending a lot of real money. I have put some $300 into this game over that time, mostly for skins, and that remembering was when there were less champions to buy.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-04T21:35:41.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR for the TL;DR plz.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-11-06T07:22:57.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito need to look at enticing players to start playing and stay in the game, not look at the end result as to the rewards for playing.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-11-05T07:44:42.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point most people know what LoL is and have either made the decision to play or not play. Instead of focus on getting new people to play they want to focus on improving the existing community's ability to form new friendships and actually feel like a community within the game client.\n\nSure, you could take their use of the word \"friends\" to mean your real life friends but I think they want us to make new friends in game. No matter where they come from they will keep you in the game and that's Rito aim at the end of the day. Take a look at the social features of any MMO, their ability to start friendships and how long people play these games. It's pretty amazing.\n\n>I am not about to start adding random players that I had one good game with, I tried that in the past, it mostly turns out to be someone who is playing on a smurf account, someone playing at a time they don't normally play, or those random games when you get terrible team mates, but the enemy is that much worse making them look like great players.\n\nI completely understand where you're coming from with this. Despite my real life friends not playing I didn't add people for ages. As it got lonely it became a nice change to have people appear on my friends list. Turned out a lot of them are absolute legends. While it's limited what we can do right now I can see the changes being a motivator towards throwing down a few games or even just have a place to talk to one another. From there who knows what can happen.\n\nThat in my eyes is exactly what this game needs.","replies":[]}]}
