Seriously, a 3v5 ranked game and one of my team who is a regular Platinum Korea server player (well that is what he said) could not believe he was actually seeing players AFK in a ranked game. That was the guy chatting on screen.\r\n\r\n3-4 minutes in, no one playing badly, our jungle goes AFK, than about 10-15 minutes in our ADC goes AFK. Players give dont give 2 shits about ranked anymore, I get no issues with normals, ARAM, TT or anything else, but get all the players in ranked go and ruin the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-09T15:33:32.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately you can't do much to change the outcome of that 3v5. What is under your control though is how much that game tilts you.

This could be the issue, players are flocking to the better queue just for more convenience, including players that dont give a hoot about ranked. implementing the same queue for normals could help?","replies":[]}]}
