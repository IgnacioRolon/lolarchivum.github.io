Pathing the LONG way around minions, than turning back and going the &#039;short&#039; way, resulting in easy 0.5-1 second longer to get through a creep wave, therefore I miss the CS.\r\n\r\nShit like last game where my champ would just stop, randomly when walking near a minion. Or the game before where I planned to run one way, my dumb ass champ got stuck in a wall, done the hoola hoop and inevitably got caught by the enemy and died.\r\n\r\nIt is really bad at the moment for me, and I am not sure if it is the same for anyone else, but it annoys the shit out of me at best of times. When I miss a CS, stop chasing an enemy with 100 health, or get caught and die, that is retarded. Surely others are experiencing this?\r\n\r\nOn that note of the creep change, I can still block the first wave, but somehow cannot block the second or third on occasions, it is really dumb at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mighty Smurf","date":"2016-03-22T07:45:46.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get this quite often as well. Worst map for it is the 3 v 3 since it's been condensed. Quite a few times I have clicked to go top lane in 3 v 3 and end up walking to top lane from the bottom lane WHILE starting at the base fountain. Dunno what causes it and other times I could be just trying to move around in the lanes and can end up on magical journey's through the jungle\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-23T12:37:43.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is much worse now with the change to the creeps, I am constantly pathing in a weird way like I have never seen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-22T09:44:07.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and why is it that if you keep right clicking the same spot somewhere across the map, the pathing line constantly changes? there should be no reason for it to change so drastically and randomly, it should always be the quickest, sharpest SINGLE route to get there, always","replies":[]}]}
