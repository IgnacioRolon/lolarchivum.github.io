Game started and 30 seconds in he started giving shit again, than two more of my team started, it got 10 times worse from my first death until the end. Just shit talk to each other for no reason.

Do these players ever wonder why they are stuck at low rank? How many of you realise WHY Riot have a &#039;tip&#039; stating that X% of games are lost when players are abusive? It is because it makes other players not give a shit and would rather lose just to see the assholes take a loss.\r\n\r\nPlayers like that just make you not want to give a shit, they not only act like %%%%s in game by how they talk to others, but by how they play also. Low rank in this game is full of fuck and has so much salt it makes the Dead Sea look like fresh water. I did wonder why I stopped rank, but now I know, the assholes who just make your whole game experience bad.\r\n\r\nAnd before you all state &quot;OMG just mute him&quot;, no, that is not my point and that doesn&#039;t stop them from being %%%%s and not helping their team unless they can get a kill, and that is my point. If I had a reason to be bothered trying when I get one or more of these players, maybe I would, but as it stands if I am going to get an asshole who calls out each and everyone&#039;s mistakes whilst not accepting they also make mistakes, why should I be bothered to try and get a win? I have never yet had a win when I play with these players, the least I can do is put up with it and just take it easy.

Instead of complaining over and over, change YOUR style of play.\n\n[Here is an example, click on it.](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/128554454/200912352?tab=overview)\n\nSo what happened in this game? The duo Mundo and Volibear stated they would both feed in champ select before the game began, all because Voli has no balls due to the mid laner inadvertently banning a champion they wanted to play. So then Jinx decides at the start of the game to feed first in the bot lane and then follow Voli around their jungle, while cursing Voli all of the time. This leads to Fizz disconnecting for more than 15 minutes.\n\nSo, me being support, what did I do?\n\n1. Muted all toxic talking noobs, i.e. the whole team but Fizz\n2. Started FARMING. If Jinx and any other toxic noob wants farm, I tell them UNLUCKY, MY FARM, you won't need it, you're a feeder.\n3. Start farming the jungle camps also after the enemy smashes your towers down. Be careful not to get caught, but hey in bronze its easy not to do this if you have a brain.\n4. Defend tier 2 towers.\n\nAt this stage Fizz reconnected and Jinx started playing like they weren't a feeder. Of course the whole time, Mundo and Voli weren't feeding as they suggested in champ select. So we now had a team.\n\nNext: Split push and win. Hopefully you have a capable champion that can do this. Kayle works well, so in bronze noob games I take her as support.\n\nThere you go my friend, change YOUR attitude and sometimes you can win games that look doomed. Remember 95% of OCE is trash level. Thats right, do the math. 200000 players, only 10000 are any good. Makes sense. School holidays are on, more toxicity by kids with no balls.\n\nJust have fun, troll if you have to. Don't put up with people ruining your game though. Have a good one.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-06T15:26:01.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play yi.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-06T00:24:50.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were playing teemo top you deserved it.","replies":[]}]}
