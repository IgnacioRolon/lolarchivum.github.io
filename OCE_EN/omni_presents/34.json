No issues with his combos, no issues with his ult.\n\nI don&#039;t get this patch, AT ALL. All you done with Zed was fix his combo so he can&#039;t wombo combo you, so unless I am coming across shit Zed&#039;s, he is broken like most of the game now.","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-13T15:02:18.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good, no more of that cancer champion.\nNext we just need Vi to be broken.","replies":[{"poster":"GD FynoL","date":"2015-11-13T19:04:13.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vi is the least of most peoples concerns atm lol","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-13T19:57:10.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol had 10-0 win ratio with ranked Vi. She's pretty broken.\n\nCan't actually peel since she just barrows through your team and decimates ur ADC because if her teams behind her and they focus you, they're all sitting ducks and your knockaside makes a few of them sitting ducks to some extent anyway if your team follows up ur engage well enough  - then with their follow up - even if they have tried to peel you from the carry, your team gets a big follow up for free. I mean it's a catch 22, be a sitting duck or counter-engage on the enemy team and leave ur carry to Vi (not a good idea) but I guess you could always just run and leave them or tell him to sell a BT and buy Zhonya's so he's not chunked to half / 1/3rd HP with one R-E-Q-E smite).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DIG BlGGER NICK","date":"2015-11-14T06:00:35.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-11-14T05:51:51.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you man.Apparently rito fucking hates zed. Zed will NEVER see competetive play anymore.I mean why play zed when u have someone like fizz or diana who can fuck you up with just 3 buttons.And rito said it was to balance out zed.I always do well with zed but his nerfed kit is just way too hard.Because of his q speed,I can't even burst someone down before my ult pops.First they nerf his damage now they nerf his wq combo next thing you know rito be like\nNext Patch Notes \n\n\nZed - We are giving Shadow Slash a cast time becuase the instant cast gives opponents less counterplay to react. This will give breathing room for laners and opens more opportunity against him.\n\n\nE: Shadow Slash\n\n\nRemoved Instant Cast - New Cast time increased to 0.5.﻿\n\n\nthey.fucking.hate.zed\n\nI will say that he is trash tier right now,he can't do his job anymore which is assassinate a prime target.\nSee what makes me mad the most is the fact they made him even more counterable despite having so much counterplay (zhoyas,qss,kalye ult,bard ult etc)\nDon't even know what the fuck has gotten into rito's head,seems like they are sucking adcs dick and also here we have some people who says \"he is stronger now because of the items\" well goodluck going all out.\n\nBut I guess only zed mains will understand how it feels to have your main champion nerfed to the ground (might as well remove him from the game).\n\nRip zed\nAlways loved playing you in midlane,apparently there is someone who hates you and thats RITO,\n\nI can make the case that if zed remains like this.No one would ever play him,he would be the next urgot but worst.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
