It is even getting me to the point I don&#039;t want to go back to ranked, but just what the players say, but how they purposely would rather let you die than help sometimes. Having someone to blame does not take away the fact you just lost the same game they did.\r\n\r\nLast game Yas dies 2 minutes in, yells I&#039;m done and DC&#039;s for 15 minutes, I say we probably can&#039;t win in 4v5 and get shit from Amumu for the rest of the game, like non-stop shit talking.\r\n\r\nGame before that I get grief from 3 of my team for dying when I push a lane, than get blamed when they push a lane and die and cop 20 minutes of shit talk from them. Yes, they died on their own and blamed me, I wasn&#039;t in the same lane, I wasn&#039;t even anywhere near them, I went B just after our team fight and it was my fault they kept pushing and died.\r\n\r\nGame before that I go jungle, ping to attack a lane, as I am already in the lane behind the enemy my TF uses his blue card against a minion, than proceeds to run away while I die, rest of the game he avoids me every time I try to help him and gives me shit for it.\r\n\r\nBefore that all I see is shit talk from the enemy team in /ALL, non stop for the whole game asking us to report each other. Especially straight after I killed Yi AND Leona on my own they asked to report them.\r\n\r\nBefore that I have my team giving shit to our bot lane who fed like mad. Going 3/25 combined and rather than offer assistance or, you know, go down there to try and help, mid and top just complained, a lot.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just one shit talker after the next, someone makes one bad mistake, one wrong play, dies for ANY reason and BAMN, the rest of the team just jump on them like an all you can eat buffet, and you wonder why sometimes players just can&#039;t be fucked trying to win. It&#039;s not just the shit talking, but the players who want someone else to blame will purposely go out of their way to try and make sure they avoid helping.\r\n\r\nJungler ganks, no kill was taken &quot;GG shit top, not helping you&quot;\r\nBot lane dies in a 2v4 situation &quot;GG shit bot lane, can&#039;t even defend&quot;\r\nTop laner dies &quot;Shit jungler, can&#039;t even gank&quot;\r\n\r\nIt is the never ending story, all players just play the blame game when they lose and do the whole &quot;look at me&quot; when they play well. Skill has nothing to do with getting out of bronze, it&#039;s the attitude of the players that put them there and keep them there. You need to be real lucky to have a good run of at least some games so you can climb out or just get stuck with the shit mentality, shit players who are only looking out for themselves and general blaming of others for losing.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-26T09:13:51.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you get out of Bronze don't worry, you'll still be experiencing this.

If you need to mute everyone in order to play your best then by all means go ahead. The thing to remember is that the game is designed for fun, and if you're not having fun, there's no point in playing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-27T10:00:45.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 games tonight. one intentional feeder who trolled all game, and another with a jungler who I am going to take to bondi skin clinic for a checkup because I think he could in fact be a walking talking cancer.\n\nThe bronze feels are real.
