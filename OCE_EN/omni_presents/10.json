Too many AFK, too many players who just don&#039;t care, too many who openly admit to going AFK, doing something else, not trying, admitting to feeding, admitting to letting you die and not helping you and for no reason, players are just ass holes.\r\n\r\nIn every recent game in the last few weeks, there is someone who ruins it for one reason or another, whether that be on my team or the enemy team, it makes you not want to play if you can&#039;t get 10 players who actually want to try.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is about time to start with the IP bans? Who gives if a household has 2 or more players and one is being an ass and ruining it for the rest, leaving it how it is will only make the rest of us stop playing and turn this already toxic community into something worse.\r\n\r\nMy last game had mid roam top ONCE, our jungle just, I don&#039;t know, I was too busy trying to stay alive with the enemy jungler ganking me only to realise our jungler went AFK. I got all the usual side orders or no pings, team hate and salty kids tears, it was wonderful...\r\n\r\nI have NO IDEA what to do to stop this all happening, but this game is nothing like it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-12-09T23:11:37.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've learnt that in solo queue you simply cannot rely on anyone on your team to babysit your lane, if your losing lane hard, instead of feeding profusely, let the tower go and go roam, see if you can make a difference somewhere else on the map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-08T15:32:36.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but less people playing means less people paying. riot are never gonna do jack shit. its just not smart for them economically, riot is still a business.  at least they're trying to feign effort being put into solving this by at least potentially solving the champ select problem. i wouldnt be surprised if this isnt released in tonights patch though....not surprised, just, disappointed rito","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-09T12:51:58.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No release and I am disappointed.\n\nRiot need to look at more than just numbers, they need to see which players are assholes who don't spend money and just ban them, IP ban them for all I care.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-09T13:48:06.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol true, if they're not spending money they should get banned hahaha if only it were that simple, and ethical, and legal....","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-10T10:21:18.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is illegal about banning someone from a game that they have no financial obligation to?
