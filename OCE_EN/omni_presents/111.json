Next thing you know Jinx has 7 additional kills and Kog has 1... A jinx with zip items was doing more damage than a fed Kog... just wonderful. Up in the top lane, the usual with Nasus, full tank build and pulling 700+ damage with his Q once he got his first damage item with a Sheen with fuck all kills.\r\n\r\nOur team smashed them early, more kills, 3 towers, more CS and up by 4K gold at 14 minutes to 2.5K gold at 20 minutes. Fast forward to 35 minutes and they are ahead by 5.3K... in 15 minutes the game turned around that hard once Nasus got his ONE damage item and Jinx just, went on steroids or something, while our Fiora and Kog fell to shit.\r\n\r\nAt 35 minutes there was a blood bath, 9 deaths. 1 minute and 34 seconds later we had Baron, 1 minute and 34 seconds later again we had not only taken Baron, but the first Inhibitor, at 38:33, game over.\r\n\r\nSo we have Jinx with no kills, no CS and no items doing more damage than an early fed Kog.\r\nA tank build Nasus able to stand under a tower and cop a 600+ AP full combo from Malz, survive AND kill him.\r\nAnd a Malz with most damage to Baron, an inhibitor, 2 towers AND Nexus in less than 4 minutes with a 1 minute respawn...\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know what the respawn timers were exactly, but by the time we had the bloodbath at 35, looking back at the actual stats, we killed only 3 enemies in 4 minutes with a baron and took down their base.\r\n\r\nStory over.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n20 minutes - our team was ahead in everything, +2.4K gold.\r\n35 minutes - enemy team was ahead in everything, including a 7.7K gold turnaround.\r\n35 minutes - BLOODBATH - 9 deaths.\r\n36:34 - we take Baron.\r\n38:08 - 3 enemies dead, first enemy inhibitor dies.\r\n38:33 - game was over, we won.\r\n\r\nThat was probably the most odd game I have played in ages. That 4 minute complete turn at the end over was something I have never experienced before, a 6.4K turn around in gold and taking the base so easily is something that should not occur with one team being ahead by so far and losing so easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-24T12:21:52.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol RIP.

By the time we all started respawning it was some 3 minutes or less and the game, being quite even in terms of structures destroyed, was over.\n\nI was hitting over 600 damage each hit to towers... as a mage. 5 years or something and not once have I seen mages do that, thanks to that I was able to virtually take down on my own an inhibitor, 2 towers and a nexus in like 30 seconds.","replies":[]}]}]}
