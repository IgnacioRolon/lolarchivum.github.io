To top it off at around 8 minutes he went into our base and did not leave, but kept shit talking.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of that our Zed gave up, brought 5 tears and started shit talking from inside our base. 2 AFK/trolls/attitude riddled 12 year olds.\n\nNext game, same guy in my team, not even a word and he started in the champion select. If I was not in a promo game I would have dodged he was that bad. About 3 minutes in of non stop attitude problems, him being the support, our AD said something nice to him, so he quoted \"Yeh that&#039;s right, at least someone know&#039;s their place\". I mean really? We were all trying to be nice to him and ask him to calm down and whatnot, but someone saying something positive about how he was playing and he STILL had to give some shitty attitude?\n\nTo top that off, in this game he went AFK. 2 games in a row with the same player, some shitty attitude and an AFK.\n\nI now have a 14/20 ranked record since starting ranked, thanks to fucktard above I lost my first 2 promo games. Next game we all got wrecked, nothing much can be done and the game after? They HAD to be smurfs, they smashed ALL our lanes like there was no tomorrow and I started having 3-4 of them ganking in my jungle whilst my team shit talked saying I was bad, mid with 31 CS after 20 minutes, top with 64, I can go on, but no as always it was the junglers fault for 3 separate lanes losing badly.\n\nIn my 34 ranked games (14/20), I would have had more than half with an AFK, at least half of all the games, if not more, players with a shit attitude. If not for the occasionally terribly bad enemy or them having the odd AFK, I would not have won 14 games. Some of my games with shit players attitude on my team, there were more on the enemy team which allowed the few of us who were nice to push and win.\n\nI have had maybe 2-3 of my 34 ranked games with NO issues, win or lose. That is sad. Losing because I suck or was beaten, fine. Getting shit for being soundly beaten or countered, not fun. Having a toxic team who need their heads checked, not worth my time. And the wonderful AFK, they can get fucked.\n\nIf we have too many AFK players, there needs to be something that ensures that game does not count, for both teams. I will take the win fine, but I don&#039;t like it, beating someone into a pulp when they cannot fight back is not fun when you know it is going to happen to you soon. As for all others, if they get reported enough, do something, faster.\n\nTL;DR:\nI vote if players AFK, don&#039;t count that game, plus If players get reported enough, put them all into a timeout corner. Somewhere that they can still play normals, but get a set amount of games or time where they cannot play ranked, if they don&#039;t have the right attitude, take them out of ranked and if they keep it up when they are back, ban them for some time. If they still keep it up? Warn them, adequately, and permanently REMOVE RANKED from their accounts.\n\nI want a fair game where I can show my skill and get better to challenge the better players, I don&#039;t want more than half my loses to be of something I cannot control. And before you say it, I had a game on the 04/09, went as Yi jungle, got a score of 19/12. My team went a little something like this, 1/11, 6/7, 1/7, 7/3. I topped the damage on both teams and doubled my next best team mate. The enemy team said I just had bad luck and honoured me as a worthy opponent. You CANNOT carry some games, no matter how good of a game you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-05T10:06:34.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what bronze is for afkers and not so good Summoners","replies":[]}]}
