Is MM that retarded? Because there are sure as hell enough players, I mean, most of the population is Gold or lower, but yet in each game you always get that team, the one that has one good player and four potatoes.\n\n2 Ranked games ago I had 3 potatoes. I went 2/0 as Malz Vs. Yasuo 10-15 minutes in, evaded some 6 ganks from TOP lane (Teemo on my team never called an MIA, ever). Thanks to Teemo being a potato, and later going AFK, Riven was allowed free roam so their jungle sat in the bottom lane and got them fed. The inevitable, we lost.\n\nNext game was the same shit, different team. The enemy jungler was the only one with half a brain and was not playing like a sack of shit. I, again as Malz, got to the point I was taking on 2-3 at a time, and with some spell vamp I was able to not only survive, but get kills and walk away with full heath.\n\nI would say one out of every 10 games minimum would be a decent, not even close, but decent enough to call it a good game. Every other low rank game I have been in there is NO CHANCE for one of the teams to win, none whatsoever. You would get 2 lanes fail like the bitches they are and the third lane just cannot do anything. You can&#039;t roam, you can&#039;t win your lane, all you can do is defend and pray for a miracle.\n\nRito needs to do something. Not only is there that one person on each losing team who, as much as you all like to say it, NO YOU CANNOT CARRY THIS SHIT, there is always that one person at least who does not deserve the loss. On the flip side, there is always at least one person on the winning side who plays like shit and doesn&#039;t deserve the win.\n\nLINKED TO MY GOOGLE DRIVE - A spreadsheet I put together years ago to input MoBA game stats and give you an overall score. You simply input your end game results, get a score (score 2) and this will be your LP gain or loss. This gives YOU a personal gain or lose. In the last game I just played, on the spreadsheet, shows Shyvana gets no gain or lose and Rek&#039;sai/Trundle, due to how well they played, get a better gain than the rest of the team.\n\nWith this information you can see the better players get a good score, the ones who are average get, well, an average score and those who suck ass, get nothing. You can play around with the values of what you think each stat is worth. Try it, simply input any game you think you played well and lost, and it will give you a result. Most games in which you thought you played well, they should give you a + result.\n\nOn my last ranked loss, in a game I thought Lee (jungle) and I should have had no LP lost, inputting the stats into this spreadsheet showed just that. Lee and I had ZERO score, whilst 3 of my team had a negative score. And due to how short the game was, or more so how boring it was with the never ending defending, the scores were relatively low overall due to the low stats. But still, the end result was expected based on how I felt the game was played. The 5 enemy team had a + result, 2 higher than the others due to their influence, and 2 on my team didn&#039;t lose any LP, with Teemo going AFK he lost the most.","replies":[]}
