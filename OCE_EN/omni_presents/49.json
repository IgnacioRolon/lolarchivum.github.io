I am starting to get annoyed with the fact I play so well compared to my team mates in some games, I have even had players recently apologising for letting me down.\r\n\r\nDo I simply have to give up and wait for the inevitable? Or is there anything different that can be done to try and carry these types of games? I want to try and get over this hurdle before next season starts, I got stuck in Silver with these types of games.","replies":[{"poster":"Bill","date":"2015-11-10T21:50:12.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the power of magic XD\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/110663547/200223635?tab=overview","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-10T01:01:48.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, you're focusing on the wrong games. The games where your team feeds up a storm and are all 0-5 10 minutes into the game aren't the ones holding you back, even a much better player wouldn't win those. The games that are holding you back are the close ones which you are unable to quite make enough difference, where if you'd played slightly better, or not got caught that one time, or made a couple of better decisions here and there, could've been a win and not a loss. These are the games that you're losing that a better player would win. These are the games you should be focusing on and getting frustrated at losing.\n\nSecondly, you're not doing as good as you think. I'm assuming you were the yorick in that game you posted, in which case i'm not surprised you couldn't carry with a build like that. Going full damage on a melee champ with no mobility and not even taking flash is setting yourself up to be useless lategame, doesn't matter how much damage you do if you die in about half a second and then they can just run away from your ult. You're not gunna carry many games if you're spending 5 minutes dead and another 5 minutes running out of the base after you respawn every game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-11-09T15:01:47.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That Rengar build {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-09T13:41:41.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who were you even playing? if you were the yorick why do you have so much non-tanky items. im seeing a yorick. and im seeing a bunch of offensive items. now i look over here and im seeing a guy complaining about his team. i look back over. the rest of team has fed or only put down 4 wards and destroying 3 in 38 minutes. but srsly now, you only make up 1/5th, 20%, 0.2......out of 1......of your team. the odds are greatly against you. the best thing you can do is offer something to your team that they can and will work with. if you're a carrying yorick, you go and carry and prevent the enemy from.....anti-carrying you......if you were a support or low econ in general you try to sacrifice what you can and protect your valuable team. if you're adc you get off as much damage as possible, and if you're not kiting well you have only yourself, and maybe your teammates, to blame","replies":[]}]}
