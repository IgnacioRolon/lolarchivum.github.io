The Ahri game was WAY too one sided in her favour, I couldn&#039;t even get close to land one hit, let alone push her around. The second game was against Trynd and I smashed him to the point I was getting 4 players in top lane to try and stop me. We won both of those games, against Ahri I did feel useless, under farmed and feeding.\r\n\r\nWhilst some games can last and we do get the rare game that can go either way, there are too many games that you either feel like you cannot do anything or are having it too easy.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel this way?","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-11T07:06:11.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree.

I tend to avoid dragon completely as one lost teamfight for an objective - not worth much till 30 minutes I add, can snowball the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-12T09:45:24.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't care less so much about the dragon that I don't really remember what it does anymore, some extra damage and movement speed or something.\n\nWhen my bot lane is either winning hard and not taking dragon, or losing dragon, I don't mind anymore, it doesn't really matter. Even in my last game we were winning so much I charged in to a 1v3/tower fight when the enemy had Baron and didn't even notice they had it, still walked away alive.\n\nIt gets to the point now you either win so easy that getting any of the 4/5 (Baron/Other thing) does shit all to sway the majority of games, and getting the other thing takes long enough that you need to have no opponent in top and mid and have your jungler or mid assist in getting it, a complete waste of time when you could be farming and pushing the enemy tower some more to assist your whole team and not just one person.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-12T09:39:54.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was Silver when I done ranked before 5.2, even than games were one sided, but now in normals they are EXTREMELY one sided.\n\nLook at my last game:\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/118439435/200513795?tab=overview\n\nI got top in everything as, kills, damage to champions, damage dealt, damage taken, gold, turrets (8/11 myself), inhibitors, minions, CS, I even got third/fourth in magic damage, as a tanky AD, with no AP.\n\nI didn't even try for half that game and only died so much due to trying to chase the jumpy bastards with all their CC, even than I went 1v4 and almost killed 2 of them, if not for the CC and escapes I would have killed them all.\n\nYou can't say Nasus is OP, a few games ago I lost HARD to Ahri in top lane and done nothing really useful for at least 20 minutes. It has got to be either balancing or just not enough oomph to make the games feel epic.
