If you take the full 20 minutes to defend, most likely you will win the next round in 10 and if you win the offensive round quick enough you are almost guaranteed the win on defense.\r\n\r\nOK, so it is the first weekend since it went live, I still feel it will be a waste of a game mode and therefore a waste of Riot&#039;s resources in making it. They should seriously consider what they are doing with this game and place their time into fixing Ranked to make it fair for both Solo and Premade teams.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-16T11:59:02.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak to your experiences, but every game I have played has been close by the order of <2 minutes. One game I lost by 6 seconds.\n\nIt has its slow moments certainly, but overall I'm really enjoying it. It's also good in the sense that once you're in game its hard capped at 40 minutes, so if you know you only have limited time, you know it isn't going to unexpectedly go for an hour and fifteen.\n\nIt does seem to be a love it or hate it kind of gamemode, but to each their own. I don't really like OFA that much but I don't begrudge others the chance to enjoy it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-07-16T12:51:56.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> It is a good idea, just, nothing happens.\n\nWell, it *is* a siege after all. Sieges tend to have a lot of \"nothing\" to them and really wrap up fast once defences are broken through. I'd say that suggests the mode is working as intended.\n\n> They should seriously consider what they are doing with this game and place their time into fixing Ranked to make it fair for both Solo and Premade teams.\n\nIt's honestly surprising how many people don't get that not all of Riot's efforts are going into one or two things while sacrificing others. The team(s) that work on featured game modes (such as Nexus Siege) generally have nothing to do with the ranked experience (and vice versa). Ranked is the responsibility of other team(s). Riot aren't sacrificing one by putting effort into the other, they're both getting attention. It just might not seem that way because featured game modes are made so prominent while changes to the ranked system happen more in the \"background\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-16T12:39:28.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stfu it's heaps fun stop complaining about every little thing, URF can wait. Can't you let Riot innovate and make some fun game modes instead of just feeding you more URF? I mean I'm looking forward to it again but honestly it can wait.","replies":[]}]}
