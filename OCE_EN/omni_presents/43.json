Ulting literally any other member of their team would have been more useful. The amount of damage your ult does aside, using your best ability to lockdown the support, while taking yourself out of the fight is not worth it. While I'm sure there are situations where ulting the blitz would make sense the majority of the time it would have been better to save it, or ult the Darius.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-01T11:57:49.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you can read, or have a brain, THREE times I ulted Blitz because I couldn't get to anyone else in the entire game with a new ult every team fight.\n\nSo what do you want me to do, jump into the enemy team and ult someone else just to die?

And when you die youre obviously out of the team fight.\nBut as mentioned by Mozzie25, your ULT still takes you temporarily out of the team fight anyway. And given blitz cant really do a huge amount of damage to your team on his own, his only threat to the team is dragging 1 of you in, so blitz should probably be last on the kill list.\nMaybe you could have tried baiting blitz to grab you, and be quick on your spell immunity, then your team can jump in while you suppress one of their damage dealers? Never played {{champion:90}} myself I don't know his mechanics, just by what I've seen. But your team comp had a workable platform for initiating the fight imo. I guess not every individual plays on the same wave length as another.\n\nAt the end of the day, you won the game and that's what matters. Flaming your team for targeting the wrong champ gets the team no where, too many are quick to flame before instructing, and this results in sloppy team fights.\nSo I totally agree this game is full of hot headed flamers, and some just have no people skills and cant instruct properly and it comes across as rude or condescending. But some players, asshats or not, do have some good ideas and tactics, which daily I myself am taking on-board. Team doesn't always win but at-least my game is improving.\n\nTL;DR\n\nI think you'll find most agree that blitz is never a high priority. If you can't out brute the enemy, out smart them.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-04T10:12:44.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some Blitz, especially the ones who initiate the fight and can actually pull of a decent grab, are more important in some fights.\n\nI get what you are saying about my ult taking me out of the fight, but in reality no, I get Blitz at max range making it equally as hard for them to get to me, PLUS it puts down a pool that damages anyone who tries to get close, and that shit can hurt.\n\nThe few times I did ult blitz helped us win the fight, but sadly most of this community has zero idea how to play outside the norm and think \"Save your ult for the squishy\" in 100% of the fights. That cannot always work, no matter how good you can play, if you cannot get to them thanks to a special someone knowing how to play, I might as well use it on them and help get the fight started in our favour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-06-29T19:33:39.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=8PVEOIZ7,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-29T13:25:15.654+0000)\n>\n> At least at low rank that is all it is, fuckers who all they look at is the bad and give no shits about anything good or have any brain how to win.\n> \n> Apparently in that game I linked, I was carried, well according to Braum I was, who all game kept complaining about me ulting Blitz 3 times.
