You have the /who that lists who there is, there level and some information. You had multiple chat channels, guilds, the whole she-bang.\r\n\r\nGet where I am going?\r\n\r\nTurn the lobby into a map, just a windowed game the size of the lobby with a map that has nothing but aesthetics and however many, or multiple many &#039;shops&#039; needed to cover all the facets of the lobby.\r\n\r\nOne shop keeper for the play button, or one for Conquest Solo, one for Conquest Teams, one for TT etc. A small enough map that you don&#039;t have to move around to much in order to get to where you want to go to, or a big enough map with enough &#039;shops&#039; to allow you to easily find what you want regardless of where you are, one that has enough room for all of us not to make it feel crowded.\r\n\r\nBasically think of whatever MMO you play, take your players main town or starting area and turn it into a LoL map that we can run around with similar mechanics, you know, the mini map so you can see the players you are grouped with, can find the shops, navigate around and so on, and than allow us to take whatever champion we like with whatever skins we have and just roam around.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to see more of the game, feel more involved and can give more player interaction and make new players feel a part of this shi... ehhh, great community. No really, seeing who you are playing with before hand and actually feeling like you are talking to something other than a forum bot would be fantastic and maybe than I would force, yes force my friends to join this game.\r\n\r\nThat is one thing I miss from MMO&#039;s, not playing but just running around having that interaction. You can than see who is in front of you, you can chat to them when they are not on your friends list, you can chat in an open world environment, maybe even integrate all the servers into one large Barrens style Chuck Norris chat and have a separate chat channel for each of the servers separately so you can know who to ask to join you.\r\n\r\nMake guilds instead of just friends lists, this would help that you don&#039;t have to start with 3 friends and try to find those to play with, you can join a group of players and know that you can ask any of them to join you at any time and not only find players faster, but find players who can play and not just hope the next 15 players you add to your friends list are decent enough.\r\n\r\nBasically take all the human interaction you get with an MMO and implement it into LoL with a LoL style map we can run around in. It won&#039;t be hard to do, the map you need won&#039;t have to have anything but lanes, just some random artwork for now that can be redone as needed. You don&#039;t need to think about the minions and what &#039;lanes&#039; the minions will roam down, just get a map that we can run around in and see other players.\r\n\r\nRight now, who fucking knows how many players are connected, well, none at the moment the way the game is going, but I don&#039;t know, I just go into the solo queue and hope for the best, or I can come to the forum and start a LFG chat thread, that gets almost nowhere sometimes.\r\n\r\nLETS DO IT RITO!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
