Personally I haven't had any issues with dyna queue and ranked this season doesn't strike me as all that different from S4 or S5 so I'm curious to know why you think this. The game has evolved sure, and the S6 changes were defintiely the biggest I've seen, but the game is constantly evolving and realisticalyl has been since it's release. I don't play solo ranked at all so my perspective is limited, I'm genuinely curious about your opinion here.\n\nThe balance has its issues sure but it always has. End of last season it was juggernauts, before that it was something else and before that something else again. It's why bumping the bans up to 6 has been in discussion for a while.\n\nLoL is a game so diverse the balance will never be perfect, and any competitive MMO has its 'flavours of the month' so its not like it's just a LoL thing either.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-13T03:37:24.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never seen the game this bad in ranked, other than the usual start of season changes, the dynamic queue is the biggest change in years.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-13T08:29:27.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say it's bad in ranked, but how is it bad? You can't really just say something is bad and expect people to understand why. \n\nIn my experience, yeah there's a few champs you wanna keep banned, but that's why bans exist. Yeah you'll have some one sided games or games that are decided early, but for the most part if you play a little smart instead of just throwing yourself at your enemy I've found that most games are fairly evenly matched.\n\nDyna queue is a big change certainly, but I haven't seen it to be a negative one. I don't play in large groups, maybe once a month I'll queue in a three or four, I usually only duo, and if anything I have noticed a significant improvement in the toxicity in ranked and a decent improvement in the teamwork mentality instead of the solo carry mentality (which rarely wins you games).\n\nI'm not saying problems don't exist, I'm just saying I haven't seen them to be any worse than last season or the season before.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-14T08:05:05.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last game Vayne AD simply gave up because Fizz had 5 kills by 20 minutes. In Ranked. in my promo game. Sat there in bot lane farming while 5 of them pushed our inhibitors.\n\nGame before that I didn't even have to try to win and was taking on 3-4 of them at a time. Same as the game before that and the game before that and the game before that. In FOUR ranked games in a row they were that bad that I felt like I was playing bots. Actually I take that back, bots have proven to be harder.\n\nOne fucked up ranked game where my AD just goes and gives up and purposely let's them win and lost a promo game, 4 SUPER easy games before that, and you wouldn't believe how easy unless you seen it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-03-12T01:57:05.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think one reason is that most players have reached a point where they have been playing for a few years now so they think they know everything even if they are in low elo. so its made team work much harder as everyone thinks their right and everyone else is wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-03-11T19:11:52.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heaps of new smurfs, bought accounts and newbies are playing right now in low silver... makes for random level games and usually one side will stomp the other. Dunno why they would make it easier to get level 30 and start ranking, they should have made it harder, like 500 wins in normals. Also a lot of accounts are boosted and/or transferred from another region. Like a platinum dude in season 5, now silver in season 6 with a 25% win rate, yeah right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-11T10:30:34.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://www.ebertcomposites.com/images/pole_close.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-11T10:30:06.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://az276019.vo.msecnd.net/valmontstaging/ingal-eps-images/lighting-and-telecom---special-applications---camera-poles-(large).jpg?sfvrsn=2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-11T10:29:16.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://www.roclagroup.com.au/Rocla/Originals/Combination_transmission_distribution_power_pole_-_Central_Coast_NSW.JPG","replies":[]}]}
