Sometimes you cannot win on the back of your own game play and that is not fair for those who can actually play.\r\n\r\nTwo of us done decently, Viktor and myself. Vayne was shit talking, just in general, said in game chat &quot;I tried&quot; or something to try and make it look like they were being held back (and not the first Vayne this weekend I have seen say something like that), and after game asked to be honoured, for what I don&#039;t know. Tahm was asked by someone to go tanky, but he just flat out refused, and the rest is history.\r\n\r\nI mean, look at it, I got more kills than anyone on my team did assists (other than Viktor who actually could play), and other than Donger, everyone on the enemy team has a positive or neutral KDA.\r\n\r\nIt may be a &#039;fun&#039; mode, but this just goes to show, matchmaking has no idea, 1 minute to get into this game is fast enough to tell me there is enough players to match evenly and get a good game. Players in game attitudes are just borked, no grouping, thinking they are god and it is the teams fault they are losing (in game I don&#039;t complain about my team, I defend myself and those who are being harassed for no reason).\r\n\r\nI just want a game, any game, any mode, any queue where I get a full team of players who care, who want to try, who want to learn and play well, not those premadonas who bail at first sight of trouble, than yell it was someone else&#039;s fault. I get players who yell &quot;OMG why don&#039;t you group up&quot;, than run when the fight starts only to comment &quot;Shit team, can&#039;t even...).","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-04T14:17:57.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why are you complaining still?
