Than yes, move around, go for a hit, move back and so forth. If you are alone and just farming mid game, SMASH THE LITTLE FUCKERS! You don't need to be fancy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-11T22:45:09.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They probably want you to improve your mechanics.

Tumbling away from an enemies attack and then condemning them into a wall would be a mechanical Vayne play / shows you have understanding of her mechanics? (Very basic example, I could be so damn wrong)\n\nOr maybe it means you move/act like a bot and are easily predictable?\nI'm really not sure lol.","replies":[]}]}
