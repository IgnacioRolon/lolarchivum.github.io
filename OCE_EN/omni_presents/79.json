Last ranked game I played I was Nasus top Vs. a Gnar with Lee jungle on the enemy team. About 10-15 minutes in, Gnar being 0/4, all of a sudden went missing, confirmed AFK. Or more so according to the enemy team, rage quit.\r\n\r\nSo what does the enemy mid try and do? Lay the blame on the enemy jungler for not camping top lane and helping him out, blatantly, not just hinting he could have done more, stating it was all Lee&#039;s fault for Gnar quitting because he didn&#039;t help enough and it was Lee&#039;s fault for them losing the game and Lee this and Lee that.\r\n\r\nFair enough to blame the one who rage quit, but blaming the one who was still in the game for not camping one lane and one lane only? Low rank is just a shit fest of assholes. It is the cesspool of rubbish you will not find anywhere else, not at least that I have ever seen. Riot needs to do something, and be serious about it, they can&#039;t keep letting this kind of behaviour happen and make those in the low ranks suffer because of someone else, be it Lee or Gnar&#039;s fault I don&#039;t care, the fact that Gnar quit and pretty much gave us a free win is enough for Gnar to take the full punishment of that lose and at least give SOMETHING to those who still had a good score in comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-25T02:49:36.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've had a similar Gnar on my team before he said he had no idea what he is supposed to do against Nasus to stop him farming and let him hit a completely ridiculous number of stack by 20 mins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alu1n3th6","date":"2016-05-25T02:46:51.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low Rank, a more wretched hive of scum and villainy the League community has never seen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FEED AND SUCCEED","date":"2016-05-24T09:29:56.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was probably someone he queued up with that's why he was being so defensive of gnar. see that happen all the time.\n\npre mades like to scapegoat someone else no matter how bad they or their friends play .","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-24T11:35:37.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any scum, and I would call them worse, but it won't accept it here, who tries to defend a friend when they are the end reason as to why your team lost for ANY FUCKING ASSHOLE REASON, can go jump in a lake.\n\nThere are a few things that right royally piss me off and this is one of them. I see it all the time too with players defending players, but defending someone who has gone and rage quit is like defending the devil.","replies":[]}]}]}
