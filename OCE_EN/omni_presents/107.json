And before you say &quot;Oh but you can&#039;t get banned&quot;, no, you can&#039;t: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=taiwan160112\n\nLast game is a premium example of that. First pick gets the jungle role, doesn&#039;t take smite, so at the last second I take it with whatever masteries I have, funny that I managed to carry my team from there. Mid is on an abusive rampage with our first pick, and than starts abusing the enemy team and our bot lane. And in the meantime the enemy team sucked balls and allowed me TWICE to simply walk into Mordor and take out their Nexus alone.\n\nI will keep saying it, Rito needs to implement a system that gives and takes LP based on YOUR skill, not that of a fuckknuckle team. Our first pick, been given the JG role and not taking smite, should have lost LP for doing that shit. He had the worst stats behind only both supports and the enemy jungle. If I had not taken smite, we would have most likely lost that game and all because of one person being a dick.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-22T06:08:15.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're in the hell that is Bronze, you more than likely deserve to be there.\n\nI'd suggest removing that link as you're not allowed to name and shame people.\nIf you have a problem with the player report them and more on, if you feel that is not enough send a support ticket as a further report.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-22T06:53:25.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is not naming and shaming, it is an account someone created for the sole purpose of being a dick in games to prove you cannot be banned, for anything, ever.

You wont join a premade team (as we all know they are more fun) but you keep saying that randoms in your team are screwing you over. You have two choices. Keep trying to rank up solo style and deal with randoms, or join a team, make friendships and climb together.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-23T12:29:29.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is NOT naming and shaming if you can read.\n\nThe guy who made this account PURPOSELY DONE SO to prove you cannot get banned.
