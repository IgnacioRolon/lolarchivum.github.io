But let&#039;s say you implement that each of those champions needs X amount of games played? How about games WON?\r\n\r\nGame after game I get players who either very obviously cannot play the game, cannot play the champion they are using or spout the usual &quot;I can only play XX role or champion&quot;.\r\n\r\nSome of them say that to get what they want, and proceed to suck ass. Some of them really cannot play anything but and their stats show that.\r\n\r\nI want to rank up, but getting team mates who lose their lane less than 10 minutes in, or go 0/8 by the 12 minute mark, it doesn&#039;t help.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-13T06:22:28.986+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess what friend, EVERYONE gets those players.

Mid sucks\".\n\nInstead, think, what do we need to do in order to press our advantages? Do we split push, do we set up good wards and get a bush gank there are plenty of options open for when you have a \"useless\" teammate.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-13T10:46:35.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that time spent typing and tilting your own mid laner could be used tracking enemies as they roam or warding.
