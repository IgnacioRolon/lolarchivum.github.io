No ganks while the enemy teams ganks a lot. And it is not just me, other players in those games complain the same. In all those games I have had a lose.\n\nIn some games I get that retarded player who farms for 30 minutes, never joins the team and always runs first, yet always ends up with a positive score, presumably just to look good. In all those games the enemy stick together better and win the game.\n\nIn some games I have been scared to look at the scorecard and map, knowing it will make me want to give up. 10 minutes, 2 tower loses in both other lanes, teams falling behind with the enemy double or triple our score, game over.\n\nI know I am the only constant denomination in all my games, but when my team ends with a score of 2/11, 3/11 and 1/10, how can it be my fault? In my last game I went 10/13 and had the wonderus AD who went 4/6 and farmed most of the game and only decided to start to join us when her support was already trying to surrender at every opportunity.\n\nWhat has happened to this game? I have never felt more wanting to quit than ever, I no longer have fun playing this game, but I know I used to for many years enjoy most games and could deal with the raft of bad players, but it has gotten pretty bad recently.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-09T13:38:44.917+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still yourself only.
