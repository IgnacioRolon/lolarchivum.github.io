I love playing as him, he is fun to use, but after seeing more and more Teemo&#039;s getting picked I can see why players hate him, more so not him, but the players that pick him and how they play.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of Teemos I have played with, in all honesty, between 3 Teemos, left their called lane ONCE. That is 1.5 hours give or take and all 3 of them sat in their lane for the entire time except one Teemo who left his lane for 2 minutes. They don&#039;t roam, they don&#039;t make any calls, they don&#039;t care about the team and how Teemo currently is can be attributed as to why they play this way.\r\n\r\nMuch like the Eve, Kog, Ashe and Twitch, if I see a Teemo on my team, unless they actually have a brain and play well, I consider the game 4v5. Very rarely since I have come back to the game have I seen any of those 5 champions actually play well at low rank and in normals, and that is sad. Back in the day they all used to be viable picks, now with no escape mechanism, squishability and overall pain in the assedness, it&#039;s sad that 9/10 games with one or more of those champs I have been correct in stating the game was over before it begun.\r\n\r\nBut back to Teemo, the way players use him is completely against everything as to how the game is currently being played and mostly seem to be picked by kids with the attitude they give you, the fact they refuse to listen and communicate, the double mid, double top, or jungle Teemo trolls I am seeing, it is sad and needs to be addressed. Even a support Teemo with the free level 6 wards doesn&#039;t work, he has one bit of CC and once that wears off, what now? That CC doesn&#039;t even do much, you get hit, you just run away if need be.\r\n\r\nIt is really quite bad that once a Teemo is picked everyone instantly hates on him, and than even with trying to communicate to a Teemo and trying to assist them they just play bad. A quick rundown on Teemos stats shows 85th in win rate and 23rd in popularity over the last month. That is top 20% being picked over the last month and being in the bottom 30% for win rate, that is just terrible.\r\n\r\nLooking at Annie and Darius, 2 champions right around Teemo, both sit top 20% for being picked, yet Annie sits top 40% win rate and Darius is top 15%. You really need to look at some of the top picked champions and really find out why they are losing so badly, because in Teemos case I don&#039;t think it is the champion himself, but the player base who actually chooses him that makes players hate him due to how he is played.\r\n\r\nYou rely on your stealth for that surprise attack, that relies heavily on the enemy being in the wrong spot at the wrong time, and that must work well with your shroom placement, and if it fails, you just die. That makes players sometimes simply sit there and wait for the enemy or pack their lane full of shrooms and never want to leave or put them to waste, and that is not good to have to play 4v5 while Teemo sits in his lane all game long.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-27T22:24:35.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is a little bit undertuned right now, but it doesn't make the game a 4v5. Teemo is supposed to stay in his lane. His objective is to bring 2-3 people to him, and then kite them out with strategically placed mushrooms, while the rest of the team gets a free drag or free mid turret. \n\nIf he doesn't win lane this doesn't really work. Since he's a little weak right now, it can make winning lane hard in some situations.\n\nTeemo is not picked by toxic players, that is a very old stereotype. I think they most toxic players are those who want to win so badly all they play is flavor of the week champions.\n\nDon't play to win, play to improve.\n\nTL;DR\nTeemo is fine, up your carry game.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-28T03:09:32.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Don't play to win, play to improve.\n\nProbably the best thing I have ever read.\n+1","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-27T22:43:21.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"play to improve wen I read that my eye twitched play to have fun","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-27T23:18:14.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you have fun when you don't improve, ever?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-27T14:22:20.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You fucking play teemo and post this you useless piece of crap.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-30T12:34:54.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh look, it's you again.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-30T13:44:41.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And it's you still being a useless bronzie <3","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-27T14:17:43.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo is really weak imo.

I had a few matches as Teemo and in one I spent nearly the entire time in my own top lane because it was a close battle with me and the other guy at top, if I even tried to leave my lane for to long so sad to bad I just lost a turret. Even when I was pinging for help from jung (who was near me) to come and gank the guy so I could have some more breathing room and spread my shrooms out and help others, I got nothing and their jung ended up coming and ganking me. Hell when their jung came again and my teams jung wasn't helping anyone else I was still ignored and what do you know ended up losing the top lane. Sometimes the reason isn't because they don't want to leave because they have put so much effort in but because they are trying to make some headway in their own lane and can't leave. It's a bit hard to care for a team that won't help you. Now that is just my experience but I think it's unfair to role every Teemo user up as the same just because you have had a few issues with them.","replies":[]}]}
