And a rant to follow.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just played probably my last game on that god forsaken game mode. All I seem to get are players who give no shits about anything but themselves.\r\n\r\nFizz constantly sat there and watched me die while waiting for the opportune moment to jump in and get a kill, he never helped unless he got a kill, even if it meant letting his teammates die or himself get killed straight after he got a kill. Towards the end Lucian sat in base while I tried to defend 1v3 in bot lane, Fizz in the meantime was in top lane farming minions, than proceeded to complain I couldn&#039;t hold the tower alone...\r\n\r\nTo top it off, AGAIN my teammates were premade, obviously just fucking around and letting me die, than bitching to me in game that I could not defend while doing nothing to actually help.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in every TT game I play, I get premade teammates who have zero idea how to actually play a team game, one of which is rubbish, and the other player blames me for the loss, never his friend who gets the least kills and least damage EVERY TIME I join TT. Always the same, one player does nothing but try to get kills, the other does nothing and I get the blame because you can&#039;t blame a friend can you?\r\n\r\nBut when I carry? No, nothing, the one good player who is looking out only for himself states how good they are with all the kills they stole. So either remove it since it is cancer, or make it permanent so players actually get used to the difference in map and team size. I am not joking, all TT is are premade teams who join with the same handful of champions with the sole intent of getting the most kills, win or lose means nothing to most of these players.\r\n\r\nYou still think I am being a whinger? 30 minutes for a TT game, I have shorter Conquest RANKED games than that. Talon would get a kill, than run away and not bother pushing the tower, Teemo would sit in the bush with Shaco and attack only when they could get a kill. If Shaco could not get a kill, he would go invisible and disappear. All three of them only farming when it meant no or little damage to our towers.\r\n\r\nCompare it to those level 30 players who take Talon or MF into a beginner bot match, that is all TT is becoming with the limited time we get to play it. I don&#039;t think Rito want yet another queue to go down the drain. If players keep playing like this it will only turn more and more away until there is not enough to sustain it and than do the same as Dominion, retire it due to players having dodgy strategies and forcing others out until there is nothing left.\r\n\r\nAs it stands I already need to wait some 4+ minutes for a game, that is more than double what it was a few months ago and given the limited time the queue is open, it really has nothing to do with what time I play, non of us even get a choice when we can play. I just want the game to continue to grow. The new champ select needs to be implements across all queues, a FULL solo queue needs to be implemented across all queues, a personal scoring system to allow +/-LP based on your score, not the fact 4 of your team mates flopped 10 minutes in, a permanent TT, or some other game mode, something to give players a reason to play other than just ranked teams or smurfing for easy games.\r\n\r\n3 or so years ago I was having fun with TT and Dominion, I would join the occasional premade team and almost got to platinum, but that was also back on the NA server before OCE came in. Now either there are too many servers, or simply not enough players on OCE and the gap between the worst and someone who has half a brain is very noticeable. Along with those top players who do nothing but fuck about to try and get the most kills with the least effort, the game is nothing like it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Cancer","date":"2016-02-27T03:48:40.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You always get shitfests for the first dozen games of dominion or TT. And after that too I guess, now that there's no ranked to care about, so a lot of players use the Friday night TT to just let off steam and troll. Unfortunately with the former being completely unavailable, and the latter only on Fridays and Saturdays, it's hard to get through the slog. If they made ranked queues for each, and pushed them with separate balance teams etc, then they'd see a lot more play. I for one would play both, the amount of salt i get into my system from bot lane would probably take me away from the Rift forever.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-02-28T12:30:08.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need to do SOMETHING. Currently Riot are putting all their eggs into Conquest and slowly but surely that will be all that is left, and even that is currently not going too well.\n\nI have more TT games than I do anything else and would love to see it come back to how it was, sadly I also had a ton of games on Dominion.","replies":[]}]}]}
