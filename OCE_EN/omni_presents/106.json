Two games in a row, both times our support had no masteries and played like rubbish. Either they have NO IDEA how to play, or are just trolling. Two games ago I had NO ADC, NO MID, well, I had someone in those lanes, but a Lee mid and Mundo support (No Masteries) and a Mumu bot lane.\r\n\r\nLast game I was 0/1 15 minutes into the game top lane, evaded multiple ganks and had only one gank back. In the meantime bot lane had just lost their SECOND TOWER. I couldn&#039;t do jack shit from top, I was getting ganked regularly and couldn&#039;t get a clear lane to TP to bot to help, I could have but would be in trouble giving away free farm and possibly a tower. That would have resulted in top simply roaming.\r\n\r\nI than have one on my team bitching I should not build Titanic Hydra on Nasus, my only real DPS item I built, aside from Iceborn, yet ended up not only with the least deaths, I had the most CS, the most Gold, the most Towers and almost got an Inhibitor. On top of that I got the MOST DAMAGE DONE and MOST DAMAGE TAKEN.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I missed from that game were most kills on my team. I had everything else better than my team and almost took an Inhibitor to boot. My opponent in that game couldn&#039;t keep up with me 1v1/ He only got an advantage because my bot lane sucked ass and therefore the enemy jungler had nowhere to go but mid and top, making it quite hard to got 1v2 for most of the early stages. That was the same for mid, he couldn&#039;t go anywhere with the enemy jungler just roaming mid and top.\r\n\r\nI lost my first tower 19 minutes in, by than bot lane had almost lost their third tower and the scores were 9 - 24. Seriously, defending a lane is basic shit even if you can&#039;t push or get easy CS, you should not have almost lost your third tower by the time the first in another lane falls. I basically got stuck in two games, both times support had no masteries and one of them had the wrong runes, one with no real mid or any ranged champion, both guaranteed loses even before the game started, and I get a simple loss like the rest of my team. That is not fair that a game is pretty much decided before it begins and I can do nothing about it.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-04-03T14:40:02.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> WHY DON'T YOU INCLUDE OTHER DETAILS, LIKE HOW MANY KILLS OR DEATHS I HAD, TO DETERMINE MY RATING?\nIf we did, it would encourage players to focus on killing other players instead of strategically winning the game. For instance, players who choose supporting champions would be adversely affected because they are not expected to earn kills. By putting as many measurements and incentives as possible on specifically winning a game, we avoid side behaviors that aren't as fun and confuse the rating process.\n[SOURCE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide)\n\n\n\n[We had this exact discussion on the boards a week ago.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/1ErgEln1-ranked-results-needs-to-be-change) \n\n> Two games in a row, both times our support had no masteries and played like rubbish.

It's how meta is made.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-04T09:29:33.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I bring this discussion up regularly and have been since the start of S6 when I realised how bad Ranked has gotten.\n\nI realise playing off the meta isn't reportable, there are a lot of things that aren't reportable, but now 3 games in 2 days with no real support or AD and all three have been loses. Playing the meta does tell you something and I will say it time again, losing a game because some troll decides to take a full AD Fiora as support is not fair for the other 4 players.\n\nThe meta is the meta because it works. You can have the occasional game that something else works, but with no CC and/or tankiness in the bot lane, all you are going to find is that champion who requires CS to function is going to miss out and be a sack of shit late game, it is just how some champions are designed.\n\nA Mundo fort example (no offense to the last guy I played with) going support won't be able to farm, won't be able to build health and will only have soft CC at best. He won't be able to tank and when his health runs low from his own doing, he will either run or die. Having low total health means his ult will do bugger all and therefore make him quite useless late game.\n\nIt is like taking a Nasus as a support, his Q is all of a sudden useless. Or my 'support' in my last game, a Fiora who called top, got told top was already taken and started trolling in team select. Than built like a top lane champion and started stealing CS from EZ, that has a 2 fold effect. 1 - EZ can't get farm, EZ can't poke, EZ can't defend and EZ dies (1/11 for the game) and 2 - Fiora fails with EZ, can't support, can't tank and can't get kills.\n\nFiora was playing only for herself, a typical cow who chooses to take whatever champion they want just because they want that champion, than goes into whatever role is left with the sole purpose of fending for themselves. 5/8/3 with 77 CS and second lowest damage dealt aside from EZ, showing she was only after kills and nothing more.\n\nIt is great and all to play the game differently and have some fun, but as we all say all the time, it is a team game, you can't do that shit. I try to mostly play for the team unless my other lanes are failing, than I will split push and backdoor to try and carry my team. But I am seeing players from the start, from lane choice and champ select just looking out for themselves and doing whatever they want, and it is thanks for those players that we are losing games and get stuck at low rank and MMR.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-03T21:12:23.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me after a game soloing que which goes for over 40 minutes \n\nhttp://www.toolsoffitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Back-Pain.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-04T09:32:27.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing beats the Yi game I had, and if I was smarter I would have saved the game somewhere.\n\n250,000 player damage, 1,000,000 creep damage or thereabouts, it was around this mark at the end of the game.\n\nSomething like a 35/5 score, took 8 towers and 2 inhibitors and solo baron, but lost.\n\n4 of my team were all premade and on the same network.
