I finished with more kills or equal than 3 of my team did assists, now that tells you something.\n\nBut no, I know you are all thinking it is still my fault. No pings to warn me that top and bot are both coming to my lane while I am dealing with Mid and Jungle, making a wonderful 1v5 situation, but I get told off for asking for pings. I have to have a third eye to watch 2 players and the map at the same time knowing my team are going to not help.\n\nI get most damage done, least damage taken, most kills and again at one point ALL of my teams kills, ALL OF THEM! And STILL I have to rely on watching the map so I don&#039;t have to deal with a 1v5 lane. And yet AGAIN my bot lane failed, let their opponents get too much CS, lose a tower at the 10 minute mark and pretty much just allow them to roam while they sat down bot farming. FUCK, I should learn to ADC so I don&#039;t have to pencil in a bot lane lose.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/135503607/200513795?tab=overview - And this, top damage done, taken, kills, towers, CS, you name it, I had it. At one point THREE of my team couldn&#039;t even kill ONE enemy, they done no fucking damage. If not for me split pushing and taking all the towers and inhibitors, we would not have even got to their nexus.\n\nAnd I will keep posting like this until Riot realise they are doing nothing for low rank, and as someone said, probably most of the community. They focus on Diamond, Platinum and Masters more than anything, no mention of Gold, Silver or Bronze in anything they make changes for. Yeah good job, cater the game to the what, top 10% of your community?\n\nEDIT: FUCK IT ALL! - http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/135496143/200513795?tab=overview\n\nEven Kat on my team was on my side on this one. Garen 'Support' taking Vaynes CS and building NO boots trying to take them all on on his own. Our 'Mid' decided he didn't want mid and stole Jungle, than failed like bitch. I got ONE gank some 2 minutes in, enemy got a fair few more, yet I still took top lane tower before Yas and killed him a few times on my own, but NOOOOOO, Vayne has to blame me for losing top lane... WHAT! IN! FUCKS!

Go look at my builds when I win, they are much better than when I lose and it is all down to how the game goes in the first stages.\n\nFor example, if my bot lane is being retarded and don't know their heads from their asses, I will build more damage on Nasus than I probably should be, at least I can try get some farm, split push and get somewhere. It almost worked a few games ago, I managed to push down 2 lanes and both the nexus Turrets, and if I built more damage I may have taken the Nexus alone. Got within 2 hits of killing it. If I had built like I should have, I would have probably not been able to take those towers and almost win us the game.\n\nSame goes for when I go mid, if I am going well in lane, I will build full balls to the wall since I know exactly what is coming, either I have a great team and can help them finish the game faster, or I can hope to kill the enemy before they kill me. I tried twice recently a counter build, some defense/offense items with some full defense, I didn't die as fast and was able to use my skills more, but done nowhere near enough damage and felt like I was more of a burden than a help.\n\nI can always try to just go stock standard build, but I like to see how my team are doing and adjust to at least try and fill the void for what my team is lacking. I have tried full counter build Nasus, fun to sit in the middle of the enemy and take no damage, but when my team do no damage, what can I do?\n\nAs for climbing out of this rank, before Riot fucked us over with the dynamic queue, I have previously been higher than Gold, S3 or 4, can't remember which one, it was when there was no OCE, I done it on the NA server and took a break after that, only came back because they made an OCE server, and now this.\n\nDuring last season when I did come back, I made Silver something and was actually climbing much faster than I am now, but the season was half over so I stopped doing that and focused on the new champs I missed out on and getting back into it some more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-06-01T15:08:11.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We can rage about the loss of skill in the game. We can rage about the bullying that goes on in 4+1 premades. Riot doesn't care. You have to adapt, or continue to expect this sort of thing. Try making a premade team yourself, then crushing the division, would be one way to advance. Princess Yaia (a helper on here) did this. They got past silver to gold division.\nOr you can continue playing solo queue. But it's not worth complaining about really, this is normal for the game now.\n\nP.S. This sort of thing is very common in Silver 5.

That is simply not the case, Riot have to look at it a different way and realise they cannot justify changing the queue system to benefit the top 1% of players.\n\nThere is no point changing the system to benefit the top echelon of players when 99% of us will now never stand a chance to get there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-06-01T21:40:41.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get good xd\n\nor dynamic boost its up to you i guess","replies":[]},{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-06-01T08:41:55.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man.\nI gotta say I agree with most of your points, but what can you do?\nCeaseless complaining ain't going to do much.\nBetter just to adapt.\nThen again, I know the feeling when premades decide to \"break the meta\" and do some really obscene things.  \nIf you want someone to play with, feel free to add me.\nName: Frozen Despair\nCan't help much more than this >.<","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-01T09:45:50.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck this game, seriously, I just had a Garen 'support' stealing all the CS, or at least trying, and doing some really retarded shit.

All other ranked seasons I have played in, from S2 until now, I have NEVER seen it this bad in my life.
