Yi was one of the first champions ever made in this game, people should know he can&#039;t be the one to engage a team fight. On top of the abuse, she got the worst stats overall aside from the enemy support and STILL blamed me for us losing.\n\nShe complained about me not engaging when I was stuk in Jinx&#039;s CC, she complained when I didn&#039;t engage first and still got a double kill, she complained when I did engage first in a 3v2 fight and died due to being CC&#039;d twice.\n\nCorrect me if I am blatantly wrong, does a Yi engage the team fight first? Or is his job to go in after it has started and clean up the mess?\n\nIs it just that some assholes love finding fault in others to blame when they are that bad they can&#039;t do anything themselves? I don&#039;t get it. I really don&#039;t. Why is it that the clearly worst player on the map is always complaining about someone? Why do they always pick one particular person, mostly the jungler and never looks at their own game as to why they are losing?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-09-24T01:23:33.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is an assassin style champ who can run down an isolated champ and blow them up before they know what hit them .. he can be very strong in team fights if he times his q correctly to doge cc however I would say he shouldn't really be straight up engaging on the entire team .. because he will get cced into oblivion, let the big front line tanks do that and soak up the damage and spells before he goes in. I think people rage at you because they are not doing well, so they try and blame it on others, also they might not be very good, or used to playing another video game.. they don't realize it might be their own fault they are not doing well ... or just to afraid to admit it. best thing to do is just report them for negative attitude or mute them early.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-24T09:49:14.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi is a noob champion where you just save CC for and burst him while he is stunned and of cancer done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-24T02:59:42.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd prefer to keep the communications open, like in the event of that game our Ashe never pinged, not even once, she only talked in chat and even though she sucked ass and we lost, she at least tried to talk in chat.
