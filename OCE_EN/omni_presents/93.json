I played him for the first time tonight and cemented what I had already thought about his W... it&#039;s garbage.\r\n\r\nI think it needs its range lowered, quicker to be activated and offer less. The activation part is what gets me, I not ONCE in a half hour ARAM game got anyone stuck in that thing and made any use of it. I either placed it to far to be of any use, or to close and by the time it activated everyone was either dead or out of the range, therefore no shield for me, no slow on the enemy and overall, just a waste of my global CD that I could have used on something else.\r\n\r\nYou have 3 seconds once it is placed to leave the radius, I have not once ever been caught in that thing and tonight, caught no one, you just simply walk out of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-29T11:14:19.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His W is excellent as I see it right now. Use it on summoners rift though.. You can tower dive at like level 6 using its huge ass shield.. and not to mention the dash in you can use to outplay and stun your opponents. Bait em by running back then turn around and dash in and their stunned. If you find that you're not getting the stun in much, then use it only to tower dive or minion dive and also use it to slow enemies when they're running away. Its easy to get a slow off if you're not placing it in a place where you can dash or run in to.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-28T14:12:52.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That just makes you bad, i played a bunch of both Tank ekko and assassin ekko, and it really isn't that hard to hit, but you have to be smart and not just cast it where they can see you casting it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-28T15:47:48.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny because most people can predict where he is going to throw it based on who he is running to","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-28T15:11:47.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lel.\n\nJust try forget about using it for CC.\nI tend to only utilise for the op shield; timed right from a distance, E into it on activation and smeck some face without worrying about the counter.\n\nAlso.. ARAM isn't a good ground for him too.\n\nedit- go in low and entice someone to duel you = profit","replies":[]}]}
