You would think that would be fair to reward my game based on the actual game, not based on other players not in this game, right?\n\nIt makes no sense that I don't get rewarded for having such a good game when I had 4 terrible team mates. Because, again, it is not fair that some players are always premade, some players are always doing well, whilst others like myself get stuck with players who can't play.\n\nRiot has changed this game so much that they base everything around how well your premade team works and doesn't care at all for the solo player.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-05-22T12:03:48.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nNot sure if this was already said but a few things to consider:\n-CS and objectives matter (such as last hitting drag, etc)\n-Towers that your team has lost matters\n-Whether you won or lost matters\n-Kills (obviously) matter\nAlso, don't quote me on this but I've seen a few people suggest that the game actually tracks your map position in the first 20 minutes to determine what lane you are. And since, for example, a Zed mid is a common pick, you're ranked against EVERY other Zed in your reigon.\nBut for example if I go somewhere like Thresh jungle (xD) then my overall score and objective total would be different, making it easier to get an S.\nAlso, I'm pretty confident that if you play a support, it's easier to get that sweet S rank.\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-05-21T21:40:15.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Champion Mastery](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery) is calculated based on other players' performance at that champion.
