The rank is based off more than just how well you \"did\". I think a lot of people don't realise how much of an impact you CS has on your rank. I see so many people getting a - b scores even if they went 19/2/3 or something, simply because they got like 100 cs in a 4-minute game. and on the other side, I see people getting S ranks for going like 5/1/6 with like 220 CS in a 25-minute match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-29T14:08:06.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud and the s ranks will flow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-29T12:56:16.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You post about this at least once a week XD\n\nMay I recommend asking the guy in-charge of the system? **Riot Ghostcrawler**'s pretty active on his [ask.fm](http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler) especially around 3 pm (California time).","replies":[]}]}
