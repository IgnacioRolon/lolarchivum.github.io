I refer to the LGC Vs SIN game 1. I watched that, I actually watched the entire game from start to finish for some reason or another thinking _maybe_ it will give me some insight into what I am missing to make to the top of OCE, but alas I was mistaken.\r\n\r\nRANT TIME!\r\n\r\nHow the fuck can an OCE tournament game be so fucking one sided? LGC stood NO CHANCE to win that game, and I don&#039;t just mean the difference in champ compositions, but 25 minutes into the game half of LGC were doing no fucking damage. So much for XP rubber banding and all that jazz, it done fuck all.\r\n\r\nRant over.\r\n\r\nIt just shouldn&#039;t happen. You cater your new queue system to said players who play in those tournaments, I know why, they are the top players, hence the top streamers and top watched players, top friends, top in premades and all that and are supposed to attract new players into the game. I mean, no one in their right mind would want to watch a Bronze player who sits here and yells &quot;My team are bad and I can&#039;t climb&quot;, right?\r\n\r\nWell, look at that last game, poor Tally was getting well ahead of his team, but due to his teams lack of anything, they couldn&#039;t defend long enough to stop the enemy from running over them and give Tally enough room to back door. I watched this game as I seen an earlier match where Tally was playing Irelia and wrecked the enemy.\r\n\r\nAgain in this game I seen why, he may not be the best, but he is a damn sight better than his team. But thanks to his team not being able to sustain in lane, get enough CS, do enough damage and in general just keep in the game, it was just going downhill. After watching that game I will think twice about watching anything ever again.\r\n\r\nWhy watch games like that when I can play in them down in the dumps of ranked? I get similar games, I do better than my whole team, whether I backdoor or group, roam, tank or do damage I get games where I play well for what I am doing and my team fall apart like LGC did. Why would I want to watch a game like that and learn absolutely nothing from it when I can play in those types of games myself.\r\n\r\nThere is no way Riot can just sit here and go &quot;Yeah, we have no problem with that game&quot;. True that SIN got the upper hand early and deserved to win, but how they won was what got me, I have been in situations the same as SIN, you get so far ahead that all you have to do is stay alive and no make any plays and you win, the enemy can&#039;t engage without dying, the enemy can&#039;t stop you from just taking all the towers and it is bat shit boring.\r\n\r\nIt is bat shit boring on both sides for the winning and losing team. The winning team can&#039;t lose, and the losing team can&#039;t win unless someone makes a colossus mistake, right? And at that level you would expect them not to, right? Well, even at Silver or lower rank it is the same, you would think even making a major mistake would turn the game around, nope, doesn&#039;t happen.\r\n\r\nI have had plenty of games this season where I was losing and continued my hardest, got the best stats on my team in every category and for what? Nothing. Turn the page and I have had games where I knew the game was won, stopped trying, unintentionally fed and still got better stats in all categories than the enemy team for a super easy win.\r\n\r\nI have been hard countered in lane and still won it with ease. I have countered the enemy and lost no matter how much I try. The game is in an absolutely terrible state at the moment and after watching Game 1 LGC Vs SIN, I just don&#039;t know what is going on. What I do know is this, in roughly 100 ranked games this season I have predicted the winner of a game that I have been in, whether I go balls to the wall man mode (win or loss), or whether I stop giving any care and just feed (win or loss), I still predict who the winner is going to be. And I am not talking 45 minutes into a 46 minute game, sometimes as early as team select I can predict the winner. Even as close as being one Nasus Q hit to the Nexus away from winning and almost going against my prediction, I still get the loss I called in the first 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-07-06T00:45:13.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legacy were still in that game 1, until people kept getting caught by hooks or arrows. Even at 8-0 down the gold difference ws only 500g. Tally could have carried if the others were a bit smarter.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-06T14:26:15.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True they were only a little gold and kills down, but just look at how hopeless LGC were, no damage, no initiation, no surviving, just nothing. Maybe a couple of play go their way and they are back in it, but no plays did, every play that was legit (not 1v4 or something bad) they stood no chance, and that is my point.\n\nPretty much from the first Ashe arrow mid when SIN took out LGC the first time until the end, nothing went LGC's way. Unless they could get a 5v4 or better, they stood no chance at winning. They slowly fell behind from the start, and stayed behind until the end.\n\nYes Tally was not really with the team, but the team never really fought 4v5, yet they still fell just enough behind that they were never coming back. Even the commentators mentioned King's 'mid game build' at the mid game mark that was not yet a mid game build.\n\nIf Tally didn't push like he did, they would be a lot more gold down, but would have probably won some team fights, who knows, all we know is that SIN got the smallest of leads and not once looked like they were going to lose. That should not happen in Tournaments, Diamond rank or even Bronze Rank, it shows bad balancing issues that need to be rectified.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-07-20T13:11:40.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carbon got caught out too much because LGC did not inch their way up the mid lane, he tried to ward alone.\nSometimes teams get outdrafted (especially in OCE). Notice how future teams have been banning Thresh and Ashe against Sin Gaming? \n\nYeah King has some issues with his builds. LGC always get him to go mid game build. But then again, only good teams will take advantage of this issue ^_^. \n\nI don't think things need to be over-balanced. They have three bans to balance things. They just needed to play smarter. \nOn the subject of bans, notice that when dumb teams forfeit their bans against Nuovo Gaming in the OCS, that they lose because Cheese is too beastly on Swain? Haha.\n\nOCE gameplay is very weak in terms of macro-level play. Let's hope it improves. But they won't make worlds this year, dynamic queue has ruined their practice chances to improve. And OCE teams don't have a budget to bootcamp in Korea. I think only the day when League gamers are paid like a full time job, will OCE players genuinely start to threaten the other region's dominance.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-20T13:30:30.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about what you are saying, I constantly see games, not just OCE, whatever random Twitch or Youtube game I watch and very rarely see a balanced game.\n\nOnly when a team has a bad early game and good late game and IF the game goes long enough do you see the game turn around. Generally games overall, once a team is in front, will stay in front and just get further away with no real chance for the opposing team to fight back, let alone win.\n\nI have my own games that when it gets to that point, I just stop caring and stop trying, win or lose, there is no point at the moment to even bother trying once you get past the point of no return. Riot give you no incentive to group up, go turtle style and drag it out until everyone has 6 items at level 18, not like you can get that to happen anyway unless you are 5 man premade.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-07-20T13:41:03.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nq4vd5hU,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-20T13:30:30.778+0000)\n>\n> Generally games overall, once a team is in front, will stay in front and just get further away with no real chance for the opposing team to fight back, let alone win.\n\nWelcome to season 6. They made it so that minions push harder the more towers you take down. Certain timers have also been reduced. Riot want quicker games. Farm and objectives are priorities over kills even more so. \n\n> I have my own games that when it gets to that point, I just stop caring and stop trying, win or lose, there is no point at the moment to even bother trying once you get past the point of no return.

SKT Telecom T1 are great at turtling. In soloqueue if you are with guys that have insufficient game knowledge it may not happen. Or they may not know how to make it happen. Or with your team compositions, it may not be possible. If you are at low elo however (under platinum), keep plodding along, because OCE is the region of throws ^_^.\n\nPersonally I preferred season 4 style of play, with more diverse items, more damage items for both adcs and mid laners (and supports) and giving players the choice of what to do. Removing these items and tuning up patches so often that seen to favour a tank style meta kinda makes the game dull. I.e. it's been over-compensated for. For example, patch 5.22 was fine. Some adcs were doing a lot of damage. That's how I think it **should be**. Anyways, just my 2 cents worth.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
