{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-05-21T13:04:10.926+0000","title":"This game is now making me angry to play with a question, what is happening with the games recently?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Incoming rage thread in 3...2...1...\n\nOK, so I took a hiatus from this game for a bit, precisely the last 3 champions released, which could be awhile since they take ages to now release a champion, which is good as it allows more time to balance and whatnot.\n\nBut now in the last week I get angry at how bad the games or players are, let&#039;s look at the last 4 games I have played, 2 today and 2 yesterday starting from the first game yesterday.\n\nGame 1:\nI went Gnar top for the first time, went 0/4/0 in the first 13 minutes and lost my tower to a Cho&#039;Gath. No assistance from my team, period. At this point he had 2.8K health... I had 1K. We also lost bottom tower at this stage. For the next 20 minutes they got 2 more kills and took 2 towers before my team surrendered. I went from 0/4 12 minutes in to... 0/4 31 minutes in. NOTHING HAPPENED for 20 minutes until my team finally surrendered and I thought that was bad.\n\nGame 2:\nYi top, finished in 30 minutes with a score of 4/5/2. 20 minutes in I was 0/0/0. The enemy had 2 jungle, Lee (4/4/0) and Shaco (0/2/3) who would do nothing but go invisible and run. They had EZ as ADC, had, until he cracked it and started running the gauntlet feeding, that was about 6 minutes in and he finished 0/24/0. 20 minutes I thought they would surrender, they didn&#039;t, I went ham and just tried to have some fun. On top of that I had a Lulu top who started building hybrid before selling her AP items. A troll, a feeder and 2 jungle on the enemy team, that was even less fun than my last game.\n\nGame 3:\nYi top again, this time against a Vayne. For 39 minutes I got 2 words out of my team, once was in the lobby so really 1 word in 39 minutes, when Fizz didn&#039;t ping he called MB. I would have had more luck playing with bots than these guys. I finished 5/12, Fizz went 8/4 and that was it, no communication, no team work, no trying to even attack the enemy, just run when they are seen and don&#039;t die was the general consensus. Just imagine what it feels like playing a game where you get one word in 39 minutes from your so called team.\n\nGame 4:\nThis game started well, but ended with an AFK, yet another game that was over before the 10 minute mark for one reason or another. While we did try, we also had a Rengar support and Taric top that did not help our cause.\n\nIn the last few weeks I have seen Cait AP Support, players who simply refuse to assist, players who won&#039;t assist AND give you shit for asking. players who value staying alive more than anything else and would rather finish at level 12 with zero deaths, players who will call shit to anyone and everyone whether they play well or not. Games I have started well but given up on when I decide to look at the score card.\n\nThe list goes on and it was never this bad when I last played. I came back and started on ARAM to get the feel for the game before moving to Conquest and it is just rubbish after rubbish. I don&#039;t care for the win or the lose, I don&#039;t care how good or bad you are, how you build, what lane you go into or anything other than that you actually try to play and be nice about it. No calling out shit, no AFK, no purposely feeding or trolling, just do your best and have fun.  What is going on with these games? It was never this bad and makes me think twice before joining another game.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo my next 2 games it didn't get any better. AFK Mid and a Trynd top going 0/4 within 10 minutes spouting some shit as to why, in the meantime bot gets zero kills for a combined 10 deaths.\n\nGame after that I got a lovely LB Support and a troll Urgot who didn't even get his boots until 30 something minutes in. ended with 2/14 saying \"It's only normals\"... and I think that is the problem.\n\nI want to be serious without having to have this kids thinking they are better than the rank they are at, I haven't decided what is worse, coming back to this game, playing with kids who think normals is OK to be a troll, or going into bronze with players who think they deserve better.\n\nWhy isn't it ever seemingly possible to be grouped with a whole 9 other players who actually want to be there and want to try to play and have fun, not troll and feed and think it's OK?","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-21T20:25:33.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=akaRaven,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=pyQOt1HJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-21T13:04:10.926+0000)\n\n> Game after that I got a lovely LB Support and a troll Urgot who didn't even get his boots until 30 something minutes in. ended with 2/14 saying \"It's only normals\"... and I think that is the problem.\n\n\nMaybe next time don't rage in normals and go play ranked. Normals people are allowed to make mistakes and have fun, if you are interested in serious play then play ranked and stop bitching about people in normals.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-21T22:20:53.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FuckHead,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=pyQOt1HJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-21T20:25:33.648+0000)\n>\n> Maybe next time don't rage in normals and go play ranked.
