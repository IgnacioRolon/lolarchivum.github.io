If that game is anything to go on, I can join 5 man teams all day and rank up easy. That game was 10 times easier than any solo game I have played this season and makes me remember why I played ranked teams in the past.\n\nFast forward to today and I have a Yi camping top and tower diving me with a Darius constantly, I got ONE counter gank the entire game. One. Game over, as Nasus when a Yi is playing, you are screwed. Yet, even with the camps, my team still failed. Go to the end of that game, I tanked three enemy players, 2v4 with the rest of the players and 3 of my team die, our Jungler simply ran like he did all game.\n\nBoth those games were vastly different in how they played out, the team game we smashed them. Two 5 man teams going at it was actually a good indicator of how a team should work, but when going solo, it&#039;s hit a miss and indicates nothing but the luck of Matchmaking.\n\nTo give a better indication of how your skill is Vs. the other 9 players on the map, Rito need to do one of the following, or something different to what they are doing now:\n1. Use the scorecard to correctly award LP\n2. Use all your stats to award LP, and not just KDA, or\n3. Make a 1v1 map, 3 &#039;lanes&#039;, one main lane and two side lanes. you both pick your champion as blind pick and go.\n\nWe all know this game has only a little influence on your champion chosen and in a 1v1 situation the best thing to do is counter build. That plus your own skill will determine who wins. It is all about when you attack, when you push, when and how you farm and when you B and everything this game is designed to do to give yourself the best chance to win.\n\nNone of this relying on 4 other players to be half assed to at least have any chance of winning. I had a game recently where our AD simply gave up. She stated &quot;Fizz has 5 kills, I&#039;m done:, than went on to complain that I was pushed top under my second tower in only 17 minutes. But in that 17 minutes I was only 2/2 with comparable CS to the other top laner. Before the AD quit, they had the same kills as Fizz and I&#039;m sure more CS.\n\nSince the AD gave up, I started going hail mary. But if I had a reason to keep trying the way I was, I would have. I would have defended until the end, tried to fend of the creeps and not die to the enemy for as long as possible. Up until the AD gave up, I had the second best score on our team and I think 3rd CS. By end game if I kept going I would have had stats that should have given +LP for effort, at least not lost any LP, or in this case, I shouldn&#039;t have lost my promo game just because someone on our team let the enemy win.\n\nBut as it currently stands, I had nothing to lose. I was going to lose anyway, so I may as well go balls to the wall and try my best for a win, you never know, it may have worked. But unfortunately, as we well know by know, by the time the enemy is in your base, a 4v5 game never works in your favour and you have ZERO reason to even try at that point.\n\nMatchmaking should use your own skill level to match you in games that should give you more than half your games as a close game. Even if it takes 5-10 minutes per queue or more. In the event that you get counter picked and out matched hard, a system needs to be in place that rewards LP based on your game, not just because you had bad team mates (and abusive mostly too in those lost games), or better opposition.\n\nEDIT: Or you could implement the new champion selection in normals, thus allowing those who simply choose ranked as a venue to ensure they get one of two lanes choices to still get their choices and not screwed over players who actually want to do ranked.\n\nI have seen players counter pick themselves, or taking stupid picks into top lane, very obviously only doing so because they wanted that champion and chose both mid and top simply to get that champion regardless of anything else. The same thing happens in normals, someone calls mid, it's already called, they call top and take Zed. They only went top because they wanted a solo lane with Zed, no other reason.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-16T06:13:36.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's more to the game than just doing well imho.

You need hard carry to climb but no acknowledgement to incremental improvements. Some players have are better and can be really good at any games but many of us have to improve in time. This system makes it very hard  for players to feel the changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-16T12:22:36.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, it does not reflect your skill. Not in the slightest.\n\nI always go for the same example, in lane, with no assistance on either side, I never lose my lane, period. But the minute you get a better mid, bot, top or jungle on the enemy side, they start assisting the other lane and can come and make my day difficult.\n\nIf the enemy in my lane is vastly superior, I can only defend and hope for the best in the other lanes, if I am better by just enough, I can roam and assist, but at the least, I will ensure I don't lose my lane. I have this mentality to ensure that even if I am counter picked and the enemy is that much better than me, I can still hold my lane and slow them down until I get some items and stand more of a chance with some counter items.\n\nI am not about to try and be a hero and take on someone who is either better than me or counter picked me and feed them to allow them to win easier, I will try to stop them getting in front and hope my team can have someone who can win their lane, or keep defending until I can win my lane.\n\nBut in a team environment, if anyone on my team loses their lane, I seem to be the next option, come take my lane. Or, I see opponents in my lane just leaving, they can't beat me, so they leave and push other lanes and try go for the win that way.\n\nThe best option I think is give a 1v1 rank system so players like myself can play the way we play and never have to worry about being ganked 1v4 (It happens to me quite a bit), or having a team who loses their second tower by 10 minutes and makes it impossible to defend.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-17T06:38:47.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wots dis? someone that pushes out the lane and actually gets punished for it? where have you been all my life? anywhere but opposite me in a lane :( probably just ward more m8. if you're a nasus you can spirit fire+wither the turret tanker and get back a kill, a lot of the time, even in a coordinated 2-man tower dive. i would assume you already know to auto+Q someone for the life steal. if they pulled off 3 successful 2-man tower dives they deserve to beat you,  lesbihonest. also true if you dont have flash on nasus. maybe its fine on shyv and maybe even heca but nasus with flash is still really good. the only time ghost will help you there is to run to your inner turret when you recognise a potential dive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-16T11:19:23.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that this is a team game. The communication and knowledge of ability and playstyle of your teammates is a HUGE advantage over solo players. Yes ranking up as a team is easier, but that's kind of the point. \n\nIf you develop your skills as a team then you play better as a team and so on. It is expected that long time teams will play better together than 5 solo players who have never played together before.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-16T12:14:48.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team game I played, was our first time as a team, we just basically picked up 5 randoms who at least one of us has played with before, and won with ease.\n\nYes the game is a team game and is focused around being a team, and if Riot want to keep the game focused around that, than they should ditch the solo rank system, or implement two separate systems, one for ranked and one for solo.\n\nThey cannot simply keep the solo system running the same as the ranked system, it is two vastly different scenarios that allow you to abuse it and get free wins. Think about taking a 4 man team, always 4 man, never 3 or 5, what happens? The four of you get so good together that no matter who you get as a 5th, you win. Yes one person on the enemy team can smash your odd person out, but if the other 4 play so well together, it will only be one person who is putting up a fight. You can't really lose in that situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-17T00:33:43.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Changing the system is their choice, they don't do anything without a reason. \n\nPeople make the assumption that your rank is indicative of individual skill but it isn't. Your rank does not accurately reflect you individual skill because that is not what it is designed to represent. Rather your rank represents your skill as a apart of a team. How easily you can adapt to a team and play with them (or around them if you have to)? \n\nIt's why people go on an on about games where they smashed lane but still lost and then complain about being stuck in a rank. It doesn't matter how hard you win lane if you don't use that to do anything with the team, because it's that teamwork which will win the games for you and get you climbing. \n\nYou could have been smashed in lane but will still win if you work together with your team to get things done. I'm a pretty trash ADC, but I've come out of lanes 1/4/3 and still won the game because I understood my limits and did everything I could to help the team. I ended that game something like 14/8/9.\n\nMy recommendation is to play support in norms, A LOT, get a real good feel for what it's like to ONLY be able to do things with the team (for the most part). Get used to sticking to a particular person in fights, to positioning of you and the enemy and how to target or avoid the biggest threat, how to win games without being a damage dealer. Then go back to whatever role you like playing with a TEAM mindset instead of a SOLO one.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FrostmournexE","date":"2016-03-16T11:51:14.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Threads of this nature are posted way to often, and it's always by players in the lower end of the ladder.

Lets just take a second to look at it from a more \"Mathematical\" stand point if you will;\nLets take the worse case scenario shall we...\nLet's say you're soloq'ing\nand there is 4 \"bad\" players and 5 \"good\" players queuing also and you all get matched together\nNow mathematically speaking, there is a higher chance that \"bad\" players end up on the enemy team, because there is 5 slots available on that team, rather than just 4 on your team (since you take 1 spot).\nUsing the following mathematical law I will tell you how you will climb elo.\nThe law of large numbers as defined by dictionary.com:\n**_The theorem in probability theory that the number of successes increases as the number of experiments increases and approximates the probability times the number of experiments for a large number of experiments._**\nEssentially what this is saying is, yes you can have some bad streaks, but if you play more, eventually it will even out, and in this case, it will actually become favorable for you due to the 4 friendly 5 enemy team slot thing mentioned above and the fact that you will improve as you play also.\n\nThere is plenty more I could say but I'm not sure if it's worth my time to type it all out as this just seems like the ramblings of a heavily tilted soloq'er.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Would also just like to quickly add that if it was such a big problem as you make it out to be then Riot would have surely noticed by now and changed it, but it has been unchanged (And working as intended, and as it should be) since the Tier/Division system was released.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-16T12:09:51.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I not once, nor will I ever state I deserve higher than I currently am, and I know that due to how the system works, it doesn't.

But this game has nothing to do with you being a solo player, even though you queue solo and have an MMR system based on a solo game.\n\nIt has been and always will be a stupid system to use for a game that relies on 4 other players aside from yourself. What I am suggesting is to stop you losing LP and de-ranking for situations that are outside your own control, yes, it may help some players get to a higher rank, but I simply hate being screwed over and losing LP for other players mistakes, like as noted those players who simply give up, including those who quit, start purposely feeding and AFK.\n\nAs I say, I don't care for the win or lose, I care more for playing a game that is fair for all and to have fun.

The game is not a 1v1 game, so it literally doesn't matter if you win your lane 100% of the time (which I might add is kinda hard to believe that you have NEVER lost without being ganked or something, regardless...) If you're getting ganked a ton, then your others lanes aren't and if they're losing int hat game then so be it, in others if you get camped they will win, it's just statistics. Additionally, the enemy team will have the same problems as you're complaining about just as much (Actually more often, but I can't be bothered explaining how that works rn) in the long run, so get over the losses and just play to improve your own game and you will climb.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"M4DN35S","date":"2016-09-16T03:02:36.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"See, you get dislike-bombed into oblivion for posts like these because the reality would invalidate the endless toiling of depressed and insecure players that have sunken their life and soul into ranked games.\n\nThe problem with them is that, unlike the pros, they play to win.\n\nThe pros (imaqtpie, dyrus, etc) play to, well, play the fucking game.","replies":[]}]}
