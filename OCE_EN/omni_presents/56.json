I few games ago I went against a Teemo top, every time he popped Q, nothing from the minions. Even when he was right next to the minions, nothing.\r\n\r\nNow the guy goes and tells me it is because it is an ability and that does not proc aggro. That is like stating a full fledged 600 stack AD Nasus Q will not proc any aggro, because, you know, it is just an ability... even if it hits you for 2000+ damage before crits.\r\n\r\nOr was this player I was up against a dodgy bastard and using scripts or hacks or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-03T12:15:56.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The difference between Teemo Q and Nasus Q is that Nasus's is an empowered basic attack, whereas Teemo's is a true spell. Easiest way to tell the difference is the cast mechanic. Nasus activates his Q, then it procs on the next basic attack, whereas Teemo Q is just a spell.\n\nFor example Rek'Sai Q (unburrowed) is an empowers her next three basics, Kayle's E empowers her basics for a few seconds, Shyv Q empowers her next basic, etc etc adding an extra spell effect to a basic attack. Malz space aids, Ahri Q, Syndra Q etc etc are all just spells. \n\nUnusual cases would be things like Ez Q which ISN'T an empowered basic (it is it's own contained spell) but does function as a basic attack rather than a spell.\n\nEmpowered basic attacks function with minions and additional effects as basic attacks, not as spells. This means that Nasus Q will aggro minions, and proc things like Iceborn, but wouldn't proc something like Rylai's or Liandry's. \n\nTeemo Q on the other hand is a true spell, and thus won't aggro minions, but will proc things like Rylai's, but not Iceborn.\n\nDid that make sense?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-03T13:07:46.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is still retarded. Taking that much damage and not aggro'ing the minions is plain idiotic.\n\nAnd honestly, in 5 years of game play, this is the first time I have ever came across this, never seen it written anywhere, never seen anyone say it happens, never seen it happen prior to tonight. And I know I have never seen it, in top lane I purposely let the enemies hit me to gain aggro for 2 reasons: 1. To take damage and 2. To allow my minions to stop attacking theirs to control the lane better.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-03T13:59:16.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean you've never encountered the difference between empowered basics and standard spells? Many champs have empowered basic attacks. Mord, Nasus Q, Kayle E, Rek Q, Ashe Q, Blitz E, and those are just the ones I can think of, I highly doubt you've never encountered any of those champs before, but maybe you just missed it as a lane mechanic (minons aren't really a huge deal post 6).\n\nHow is it retarted? Why should Teemo Q get special treatment that any other spell doesn't? The damage is does is negligible early. If Teemo is maxing Q then that's all the damage he has, and if he's maxing E then the Q isn't going to hit for noodles. \n\nIt sounds like you're talking about late game, but minion damage is near nil that late into a game, and if you're in a scenario where you'd have to consider it then it's a strategic decision you have to work with, just like any other mechanic in the game.\n\n>  in top lane I purposely let the enemies hit me to gain aggro for 2 reasons\n\nThat's all well and good but mage tops aren't a new thing, and if they're using spells to poke you can't be giving them free damage. You wouldn't do that against a Liss would you? or an Aurelion? or typically in mid lane because you are vsing a mage. You should be playing your opponent first, then your lane, not the other way around.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-04T09:10:33.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the difference, but I have never came across it before, first time I have ever seen someone hit me and not take aggro.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-03T22:59:26.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it should cause agro. any form of damage against a champion should cause minions to agro.\nmaybe you weren't in minion agro range or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-04T09:09:55.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It SHOULD, but as I found out yesterday, after 5 years in this game, it doesn't.
