Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\r\n\r\nOCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\r\n\r\nWe won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nEnergia\r\nRiot Player Support\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Man Mode April 22, 2016 11:01\r\n\r\nHi Energia\r\nI didn&#039;t know there are third party programs that can be used in League of legends. The last time i logged into my account was around Dec 2015. Despite the fact that i spent hundreds of dollars on my account, i can&#039;t be responsible for something i have not done. I didn&#039;t even receive an Email from Riot regarding this suspension. Please help me out on this as i certainly believe i am unfairly punished, otherwise I&#039;d like to thank Riot for the past 6 years as this would be the end of my journey with them.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nafter many back and forth email replies\r\n\r\n Broken Blade Wednesday at 03:16\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry that I had to be the bearer of bad news, but all of the context regarding your suspension has been fully explained.
