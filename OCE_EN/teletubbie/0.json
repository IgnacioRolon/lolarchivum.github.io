He&#039;s nice, cute, pretty amazing tbh :~) He always treats me with respect, kindness etc. He&#039;s actually flawless as well - and makes extremely funny jokes which make me smile 24/7 (although I&#039;m kind of insecure about my smile). Everything about him is actually perfection... except for one thing :( He sucks at league! Holy moly! I&#039;m trying to make good plays right and the loser just ruins everything. He&#039;s actually so bad LOL this is the only reason why I&#039;m thinking about finding someone else.\r\n\r\nThis link actually describes our league relationship:\r\nhttp://gfycat.com/LeadingAdmirableKinglet\r\nI&#039;m the Kog, doing my own cool shizniz and then the Annie (him) comes along casually and ruins everything.
