Living alone, trying to impress countless women to engage in conversation - ultimately coitus, then. Then I got the call... \r\n\r\nHere it was: the culmination of my life-long culinary dreams. My one chance to make it or break it big time. I&rsquo;d been chosen as one of the 16 chef hopefuls on the next season of Master-Chef Tahm Kench&#039;s famed King&#039;s Kitchen. I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on appearing on the most popular television show in Runeterra, but I&rsquo;d decided that not even the very real possibility of embarrassing myself in front of millions nation-wide was going to stop me from reaching for my dream.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;d finished packing up my things weeks before my Trip. I was both enormously excited and downright terrified of what was to come. To prepare myself for the ordeal, I&rsquo;d made it my mission to watch every single episode of both King&#039;s Kitchen as well as every other cooking program Tahm Kench had appeared on. My poor hard dives were overflowing with this smug bastard. I must admit, given Chef Kench&#039;s reputation I was slightly apprehensive of him and of the events to come.\r\n\r\nHe had a certain vibe to him that I could not quite describe. Mostly I was repulsed by his arrogance and blunt gluttony. On the other hand I was impressed by how he immediately took control of any situation. It always felt like he owned his surroundings and even the people around him. Even though I&rsquo;d never admit it to anyone, there was something very attractive about his assertiveness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we arrived in Bilgewater, we were carted off to the studio kitchen and the adjoining dorms where we would be spending the next five weeks. We dropped off our belongings, changed our clothes and then we were off to the kitchens. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. After what felt like an eternity, the door suddenly burst open. Applause. There he was, mister Tahm Kench himself. Always a flashy {{summoner:4}} entrance.\r\n\r\nI was surprised by his physique, the television really does no justice to him. He was much slimmer than I&rsquo;d imagined him to be. On TV he always seemed so&hellip; overly Elephantine. In reality he was an Average, Roundish thing with a huge mouth (to match his ego). He had the body of a man who can appreciate food, but also knows how to hide it. I felt intimidated by his sheer presence &ndash; and he hadn&rsquo;t even opened his mouth yet.\r\n\r\nOtherwise he was just as I&rsquo;d pictured him to be, just as he was on TV. Years and years of high-stress work had left its mark on him; his forehead was deeply cut by wrinkles. His ghost white eyes were mysterious and passionate, he was clearly very excited. His hat was a gorgeous addition to the ensemble, impeccable as always, and he had his signature fork carefully balanced on the end of his whisker. He had said something, presumably to greet us and welcome us but I was so deafened by my own nervousness that I could only see his mouth moving. His teeth were blindingly white against his experienced, lobster red skin.\r\n\r\nThis is it, I thought, it begins. Bring it on.\r\n{{champion:223}}  \r\n_\r\nThanks :)_","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:15:13.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You capture his essence so well!
