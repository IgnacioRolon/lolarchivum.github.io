Did you hav to restart queue when the timer was resetting? When you're on a dodge timer it just closes the timer, but if you're in an LPQ it actually says something like \"Leave Queue\" and will reset your timer if you press it and leave queue.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about LPQ is that it locks you out of the client for the duration, and if you or anyone in the premade clicks that button you're gonna have to restart the whole thing.","replies":[]}]}
