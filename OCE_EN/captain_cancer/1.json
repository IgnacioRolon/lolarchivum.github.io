Over time, as the majority of people have noticed, his kit is a victim of bad design. He was originally supposed to be part of that small group known as the &quot;melee carries&quot; such as Jax, Master Yi, Yasuo, Fiora, and Tryndamere. The things all these champions have in common are mainly:\r\nA primary focus on auto-attacks;\r\nGreat lategame; and\r\nSome form of damage mitigation.\r\nThe last one is surprisingly important to this situation in my opinion, as these champions typical full damage build (apart from Jax) and low range means that they need something to stop them getting oneshot. Aatrox is missing this, so he is forced to play with a (relatively) tanky build, and thus be balanced around being a bruiser. His insane low hp healing is very problematic when paired with highly defensive build, as crowd-control no longer becomes meaningful counterplay (because CC into focusing someone like Yi is usually the way you play a fight like that). Funnily enough, the aforementioned champion recently was another sufferer of the same problem, with his devourer-based bruiser build being extremely frustrating to play against. Because of this &quot;tanky destroyer&quot; problem, Yi was changed so he was forced to focus more on damage if he wanted to get similar rewards (E nerf and the later devourer removal). So, because of this problem, Aatrox is forced to be given weak numbers so he is unable to oppress anyone until Riot comes around to reworking him.\r\nAnd this is only one of his problems! Other ones include:\r\nThe gimped blade of the ruined king being a core item of his;\r\nA Q which is cancelled far too easily that really, really frustrates the player, while costing him 10% of his current health;\r\nToo much budget of power into his passive, which puts even less power into the rest of his kit; and\r\nA pretty boring ultimate. Gaining attack range is a lot of hidden power as well, as one of the biggest balancing points around bruisers and melee carries is the fact that they&#039;re melee(one of the many reasons why Graves has been difficult to balance). Other than a weak AoE nuke (and some blood well gain, which basically just translates to more attack speed), the ability just gives attack speed.\r\nEven thematically, he doesn&#039;t make too much sense. As basically a God of war, he should be focussed around just not dying, rather than dying and then coming back, so I feel his passive is not core to his kit, and can be removed in order to make him a healthier champion. So let me get into my adjustments.\r\nAttack range increased to 180 from 150. He has a big-ass sword, so similar to Garen, and a few other champions, he has a slightly increased attack range.\r\nPassive: the stasis is removed. Already the champion seems so much more responsive to changes just because of this. He keeps his blood well, but his blood well has a significantly higher maximum value and attack speed gain, and health stolen through basic attacks now go into the blood well. More on this later. Also, all his abilities scale only off bonus attack damage(unless specified that they also scale off blood well) and have low base damages, so he has a weak early game and really strong lategame, as is the melee-carry fantasy,\r\nQ: in an attempt to work in some damage mitigation, and also remove the frustrating nature of his Q, it is now a charge-up skillshot. It can be instant-cast to have slightly less range than the current iteration, while fully charged (over say, 2 seconds) his range is increased by maybe 50% over the current range. Now for the important bit: during his Q cast and charge-up, Aatrox is untargetable. This is his Fiora-style outplay potential and survivability, and allows him to survive better in teamfights without his revive passive. It&#039;s cooldown is also decreased incrementally depending on how much is in his blood well. This increases his strength and survivability as a fight progresses. To compensate, a higher base cooldown is in order. 2 seconds might be too high, in which case, it can simply be a Fizz style double press ability where he only has 1 second instead of 2.\r\nW: his bonus damage and healing now scales slightly higher with bonus attack damage, BUT with almost no Base. Instead, his healing and damage now scale with how much is in the blood well. I did this so Aatrox starts a fight weaker, but gets more and more powerful and sustainable over the course of a fight.\r\nE: this is a difficult one, because many people have an issue with it being useless, while I find it to be useful waveclear. I decided that, to incentivise a damage-based build, it now deals physical damage, and no longer scales from ability power, but has an increased bonus-ad ratio. It also has a lower cooldown based on how full the blood well is, to assist in Aatrox&#039;s kiting troubles as the fight extends.\r\nR: Aatrox instantly removes all debuffs and for the next (~10) seconds, his auto attacks hit everyone inside his attack range and gain 10/20/30% (bonus?) armor penetration. When the ultimate ends, Aatrox is healed for a base amount, that is amplified by the percentage of his maximum health that he healed during the ultimate. (This incentivises low-health builds so he heals more) Can be cancelled early to get the heal quicker while giving up on the buff. This really incentivises teamfights and &quot;drain tanking&quot; as everyone hit by this AoE auto attack will proc lifesteal etc.\r\nSo there it is! With low bases and high scaling, the ability to avoid damage, no revive passive or tanky build incentives, and a greater focus on using blood well to gain power in extended fights, this new Aatrox should be a lot more balanceable. I really think this has a lot of potential and would greatly appreciate feedback, or even better, being seen by a Rioter!\r\nTl;dr, cmon man, I put a lot of time into this! I guess the previous paragraph is an ok blurb.","replies":[{"poster":"RIMRAMSTYLE","date":"2016-05-10T07:25:41.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ooook first of space out the text a bit more, seeing that much text like a gigantic block will make people just click out of the page,\n\nsecondly, changing aatrox like so will turn him into another fiora/jax e.t.c. so no new gamestyle or playstyle will be introduced from this rework, i mean it feels like you love aatrox but atm you feel like he is being outshined by all the other melee carries (yeah i kinda agree with this since his kinda fallen of and alot more focus has been put on fiora jax etc and aatrox has been untouched) so you'd like a change i guess?\n\nanyways just, space out the paragraph pls, its way too intimidating to read (although i did read it since i also enjoy atrox :P)","replies":[]}]}
