Isn&#039;t this super flawed?\n\nAlso I just played a game where we got first blood (and another kill very soon after) and the other team was allowed to remake, I thought if a kill happened you couldn&#039;t remake?","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-17T03:31:42.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how the system works personally so I can't comment but do you have a screen shot?
