What role I am and champion doesn&#039;t matter, I always lose half(or more of) the games I get fed in/get others fed in regardless of these things.\n\nI push towers, I group and I ward. I try my best to lead via chat and pings. Ultimately what happens is people will get caught out or start really bad/pointless fights or they will just suicide for no reason and it happens over and over to the point it ends up feeling like the game is based on getting lucky teammates. I end up getting pissed off and tilting because this happens so much and how can I win/apply your advice to games where I am not ahead or didn&#039;t get a teammate ahead?\n\nMy last 2 games in gold 1 - plat 5 promos were, 4 teammates with over 10 deaths where I went 4/0/4 but it was useless vs 4 fed enemies and the second game no one except our support and me had over 2-3 KDA on their champions, a mid Sion with no keystone mastery and a 22% win rate on his champion ADC where I went 5/1/2 but once again, it was useless because they just started to die over and over the moment I wasn&#039;t around. I could go on and on as these sorts of games happen way too often and it is very demotivating, so please help me before I break something and quit.\n\nFeel free to go here and click ranked solo and scope out my last 20 days of games if it helps.\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Blatzcrink","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-12-06T11:10:51.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to OCE. Here are some tips if you are serious about climbing in ranked:\n\n1) Don't play ranked between the hours of 7am-9am. You'll be with the all-nighters, speed kings, and pot heads that aren't concentrating. And also the hours of 3pm-10pm during school terms. Very few kids these days have self control, experience, and understanding of teamplay, and will ruin your experience.\n\n2) Try to positively encourage players when playing ranked. If they then flame you, instantly mute them, but continue to the help the others in the team.\n\n3) The bottom level of every tier has noobs, boosted boys and trolls. Try to clear these for more enjoyment.\n\n4) The season has ended. Welcome to reckless times until the new season begins again.\n\n5) When the new season begins, do not play ranked until at least one month has past, and the good players have been seperated from the rest.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-06T07:08:46.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, a flaw in people is trying to make people angry, if they can find a reason for it, they will provoke it. If 1 person makes a mistake, and you flame them for it, its likely they will start to devote the game to losing it just because you were a prick.\n\nmy advice, plead to riot to give you a chat restriction, so only things you can say are nice, never any trashing, and yes, it actually works.","replies":[]}]}
