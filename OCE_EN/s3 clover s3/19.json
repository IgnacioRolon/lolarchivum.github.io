I am all for the \"you're the one who needs to carry\" mentality and this ruins it, at least in the old jungle you were still fine and barely got put behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Malothere","date":"2015-01-22T02:34:56.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you end up not being able to get a leash then try doing scuttle crab, It gives you free hp from your machete. \nAlso if you are on the upper part of summoners rift then you can smite Gromp and then eventually make your way over to red buff and smite that for extra hp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mikeg123445","date":"2015-01-21T06:49:00.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some junglers like{{champion:35}}  don't need leashes but if u need to catch up probably start Gromp by yourself and smite him the poison will make it easier to clear out buffs.\n\nAfter clear out wolves till you smite is closer to becoming available then go red pop a HP pot if u need to and wait till your done healing then start the buff smite it when u get about half HP if you do this right you should be able to clear it get lvl 3 and have 1 HP pot.\n\nBack if you need to or if you wanna try your luck clear out Krugs or Raptors or get one of the crabs to give u more health by then wolves should be up do them then back and then clear out blue and continue how you usually would.\n\nYour results will vary based on which champion your playing and what skills you choose for your first 2 lvls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingTheFinalCake","date":"2015-01-20T22:33:41.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The jungle has changed quite a bit since it's change. A good way to counter this is to get champs that completely bypass that change. For example, play {{champion:35}}  because he doesnt need a leash and he completely avoids damage from blue and you still have your pots in tact. You can head straight for red with all that regen and smite ready in your pocket for that extra heal. Or play {{champion:14}} , because of his knock up and low CD on his q, he barely needs a leash.\nIt all depends on who you play and how you play them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-20T19:47:46.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tell people every game leash or ganks because I will be too far behind. And honestly you are too far behind too gank effectively. The only other ways I use too catch up is smite every jungle monster you can for the exp bonus or counter jg and drag their jger down so you don't look as bad XD","replies":[]}]}
