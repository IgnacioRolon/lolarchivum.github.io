At level 6 from out of vision if he hits you with all 4 shots it is a 100-0. I was Malphite with a cloth armour and 2 of his shots did 600 damage, I have 900 max health at this time. If he hits the first shot it&#039;s almost impossible to dodge the rest as well.\n\nHe also out ranges the tower even if you&#039;re right against it and combined with his ability damage burst with the crit auto and a player who can manipulate the tower not to hit them when walking under it for a second via timing it makes csing under tower crazy difficult.\n\nHe can easily dominate the lane with freely won trades with the crit passive and burst / quick cc of his abilities.\n\nIt's a good thing I've yet to come across a good player on him because of these things I feel.\nSo basically any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-13T06:35:32.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins are his bane.\n\nassassins were made to kill adc. But unlike other adc he doesnt have a reliable way to either burst you fast enough because of his auto windup, doesn't have a dash and doesn't have reliable cc to stop an assassin getting on him, so when the assassin gets to him, 9/10 times he winds up dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-02-15T02:02:42.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dat name tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"ApeX SlowZ","date":"2016-02-14T04:35:58.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pick a luc for dahs to dodge all his abilities or pick sivir cause of spell shield= easy win lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-13T06:25:10.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone half decent with jhin i have one thing to say.\n\nCC\n\nJhin has terrible mobility until he reaches full build and can reliably proc his movespeed passive.\n\nAnd even then his passive doesnt stop knockups and stuns and the like so what good is 600ms when you cant move.\n\nThe other thing is grab a thornmail, he will be hitting you for about 1.6k crits in the mid to late game if he is building correctly, as such he will reflect back to himself a total of 1000 damage if he fires all four shots at you.\n\nGood counters would be anything with a long range skill shot with cc, so nami, morgana, blitz, thresh (if you have enough souls to do damage), and xerath all come to mind.\n\nOr anything that can stick to him, like say akali or master yi.\n\nAlso in regards to his ulti, he doesnt gain vision beyond what he would normally have, so use that to your advantage and run as far out of vision as you can till he has to guess where you are, then move on an angle so that if he fires where you last were it wont hit you.\n\nOh one last thing, his ult and 4th shot are both based on missing health, so straight up armor is far more valuable than health until you reach the diminishing returns point (around 250 armor)","replies":[]}]}
