He started to run at me so I kited back while still trading hits with him so it was essentially him level 1 vs me level 2 and 8 minions. He won this and was still able to walk away from all the minions and be healthy.\r\n\r\nAgainst a Trundle I scored an early kill and then like 2 minutes later he walked under tower (tanking the tower damage, my damage + my cc) killed me and was still close to full health.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand why these champions win out in what should be terrible situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-15T07:23:44.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What champs were you playing in these scenarios?","replies":[]},{"poster":"bonjwa1","date":"2016-04-15T07:11:08.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ALL U HAVE TO DO IS PULL OUT THE LMAOKAI AND YOUR TOP LANE IS A BREEZE","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlphatheBeta","date":"2016-04-15T06:08:46.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, being a teemo I can relate. I started laning really late because I had dced with bad internet and I had no TP. I got the most kills in that game and carried my team from 10 deaths down and 2 dragons down.
