There is so much negativity in the lobby for this game mode that I think it needs a change.\n\nTo save a lot of pain, trolling and toxicity could we please get a pick order to blind pick? You can't even try out or practice champions properly with this cesspit of festering immaturity. There will be less arguing and bad manner because there will be no locking in vs calling argument and people will be more likely to suck it up if they are lower in pick order. People are also more inclined to be nicer when someone says they prefer a role - ranked proves these things and the premise will still be there by not being able to see the other teams champions. This also leaves the opportunity for people to craft teams better instead of quickly calling or locking their champions or roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2014-12-19T00:12:49.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usally just dodge if someone instalocks, or people start trolling. if I have dodge too many times I'll probs just play whats left even if someone else instalocked the role i called. there things happen in normals nothing you can really do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dslxk","date":"2014-12-13T02:00:42.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you heard of a little thing called 'team builder'?","replies":[{"poster":"s3 Clover s3","date":"2014-12-13T02:11:27.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience it's taken at least 20 minutes to actually get in a game for team builder.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2014-12-16T01:31:36.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah only during the sr summoner icon promo, it has been easier to find a team.
