I know the new &quot;clash&quot; was meant to be the replacement mode but this is only every few months for 1 weekend. Why did the old 5v5 ranked Q get removed totally? I mean yeah, there is Flex Q but its just not the same as having your &quot;team&quot; competing.\r\n\r\nis there a chance this will ever come back?\r\n\r\nWhat&#039;re the thoughts of the community?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-15T12:59:11.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My understanding is that Clash is meant to be much more frequent once it's up and running, just that they had some *major* hiccups with their initial live testing that have taken a long while to get sorted. \n\nThere are still a few issues but they were able to get most games going and completed with this test, and they're planning to run one day tests on other regions in the coming weeks, so hopefully we'll know more soon!","replies":[]}]}
