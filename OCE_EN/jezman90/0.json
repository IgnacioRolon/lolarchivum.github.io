We keep an eye out especially for instances like you describe, where disruptions occur for small groups of players when everything else is running smoothly.  Some players do look to use unfair advantages and this occasionally results in issues like you have described.  We've investigated this incident and taken appropriate action.\n\nThanks for reporting this to us!\n\nCheers,\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
