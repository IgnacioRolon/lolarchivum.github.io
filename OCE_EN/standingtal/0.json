What a Joke!!!","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"So riot has been banning people for using Overwolf. Last week I was banned for apparently using 3rd party programs. So I sent my ticket to support asking how as I only have chrome, league, discord and overwolf on my desktop. The reply I got was we are not aloud to discuss it. So basically iv'e been banned for nothing. I asked is Overwolf was legal to use for league. They didn't reply back and just said case is closed... So iv'e been without my account for a week and a half for doing nothing cheers riot you tosses.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydo","date":"2017-06-25T07:40:08.145+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\n\nSophie from Overwolf here.\nOverwolf will NOT get you banned.\n\nWe are working closely with Riot Games to ensure that all the apps we publish are aligned with their Terms of Service and their 3rd party policies.

Just wanted to chime in, since someone asked about our thoughts on this. LoLWiz, in it's current incarnation, is no different from visiting OP.GG or LolNexus or any other similar site. The only real difference is that it is displayed via an Overwolf Plugin, rather than a web page. It's powered by the Riot API, and no questionable access the game client, so as of right now we have no issues with using this app and will not frown upon players who do so.\n> \n> That being said, we reserve the right to change our stance on this, if in the future the LoLWiz app adopts any functionality we find to be harmful to player's experience or the game's ecosystem. (Though if that happened we would first attempt reach out to LoLWiz and try to course correct things there, instead of banning players.) Also, naturally, we can never officially condone or promote the use of any third party tool, as we can never guarantee your game stability or safety in doing so.\n> \n> TL;DR - It's not directly affecting the client, as it is a component of Overwolf and not a game-mod, so you won't be banned.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot Sargonas,realm=NA,application-id=ZGEFLEUQ,discussion-id=sJia9ty5,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-02-24T23:09:51.311+0000)\n>\n> Beat me to it. i was going to link to this same post.

Though to clarify for the people who are unsure, Overwolf will NOT get you banned for 3rd party. That is of course subject to change with any update that Overwolf introduces, if they were to introduce something that was malicious or cheating, but that isn't likely.\n\nHeartVine touched on it, but the most common reasons someone would get a 3rd Party ban without having used any themselves is boosting, account sharing and compromise. If you believe your account was compromised then you need to submit a ticket to Riot saying so, and go through the account recovery process. If this is the case then you will get your account back.\n\nIn the case of voluntary account sharing, the responsibility lies with you, and the ban will not be lifted. In the case of boosting the same goes. Boosting alone will get you a 2 week and loss of all ranked rewards for first offense, boosting with scripts is an instant perma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-06-24T05:56:24.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The official statement is that you use third party programs and custom skins at your own risk, as they are auto detected as malicious by the client and you'll receive a permaban if they are noticed.\nAt the start of the year Riot announced that this year they will make custom skins fully against the rules (ToS) as a way of cutting out the possibility of people being accidentally permabaned.\n\nIt's important to note that Riot does not, and will not discuss how or what they detected.\nDoing so reveals too much information and makes it easier for new \"hacks\" to be developed to be undetectable.\nNot to mention if they told you what they detected, it's possible you have another script running that they didn't detect, which would give you invaluable information if you realised they didn't detect that script.\n\nOverall it's your own fault you were banned, and honestly you shouldn't have taken the risk to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-06-24T11:18:53.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm curious how you claim that its his own fault to begin with for using overwolf it has been widely accepted as being ok what 'risk' was there? \n\nOntop of that there are many things that count as being a '3rd party program' that you would not even think about.  The fact is things get triggered and Riots process while making it hard for people to figure out which legitimate scripts caused these things, also make it neigh impossible to sort out false positives unless riot finds the fault without the persons help which is rare.. The system has its merits but it has very big flaws also. \n\nI am not saying the OP is telling the truth and it was overwolf or that he isn't lying.
