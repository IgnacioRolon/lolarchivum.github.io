I couldn&#039;t select any champion so i couldn&#039;t lock in or pick one, in the small time available I cleared the search bar seeing if i may of type something in there, again there was no champions to pick and lock in. I tried to use the role button and still no luck... I&#039;m pretty sure i wasn&#039;t lagging as I could send messages to people in the lobby.\r\n\r\nIf someone could explain what might of happened that would be grateful, in the mean time I&#039;m not going to risk my LP in case of another glitch/bug like this one.","replies":[]}
