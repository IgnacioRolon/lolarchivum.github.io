If you're getting 60 fps why would you want to upgrade?\n\nIf you need higher graphics but don't want an inconsistent frame rate, then set the frame limiter to something like 30 fps.\n\nAside from that, if you *really* need an upgrade, just buy a better graphics card. Your base system is good enough as it is, and $600 will get you a graphics card that can run League on High without any frame lag (unless it's a patch problem, lol).","replies":[]}]}
