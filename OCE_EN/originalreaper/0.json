I won&#039;t say anything on Morde changes yet since I havn&#039;t done much with them but I have played enough Darius to at least form an opinion so let&#039;s start from the top. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the passive. The bleed definitely feels weaker, the poke and early game damage is drastically down unless you get to 5 stacks and get that damage boost from the updated passive, without that laning phase is much harder to win a trade. It could also be that Decimate (Q) now has a cast time and is essentially no longer a part of the combo so it takes longer to apply stacks. \r\n\r\nHis Q, this is the main issue I have with the rework, it feels weaker and the scaling looks like it is so underpowered until you get 5 stacks especially early game but the damn cast time is the failure here. So many champs that were easy to duel can now &#039;step out&#039; of the q and make you miss easy trades. That or the better players who know the changes dash in to fight so they take half the damage from the handle and can initiate while you are unable to auto attack. That&#039;s not to say it is too hard to land Decimate (Q), easy enough to ensure they land, just a problem having enemies avoiding it so easily. 0.75 seconds doesn&#039;t seem like much on paper but to an experienced darius it is enormous. On the bright side, Darius clearly requires more mechanical &#039;skill&#039; now thanks to this change and will take time to learn. \r\nThink about a riven, when I initiate a q for poke the delay allows him to dash in so his shield absorbs the half damage I do and he can begin his q + auto combo before I can return fire, he then has the option to extend my inability to do anything with his own stun. Clearly this is meant for a late game darius with the heals being more useful as he has more items and the delay to prevent him spamming heal but I&#039;d rather remove the heal and cast time and just let him have his damaging q back, help win those trades again rather than sitting in teamfights 30+ minutes in finally being able to do stuff IF you survive long enough to actually cast q. That change though is just my personal preference as I liked actually doing damage as Darius, was fun to feel powerful throughout th game. \r\n\r\nHis w, nothing to say, fine as usual.\r\n\r\nHis e, is it just me or is the slow new? it&#039;s a nice touch either way.\r\n\r\nHis r, it is essentially the same but I like how the new bloodrage passive lets you put 5 stacks on the target immediately for chain Guillotines. \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nOverall a fine update, most abilities are the same, the passive changes are weaker until you get max stacks but then they reward you with that beautiful damage and insta-stacks which is a nice change with his ult. \r\n\r\nHis q needs work, sure you don&#039;t want him to be an immense bully in lane so you took away bleed and q damage scaling and gave him a heal for sustained fights but that cast time is absolutely brutal. Sure make Darius players play safer in lane to get to late game but being unable to do anything else while casting it (you can move and flash) makes it so hard to lock someone down and combo them, you lock someone down and they escape while you cast decimate (q). I doubt Riot will remove the cast time but reducing it would be nice to say the least.\r\n\r\nA minor concern about reducing unique gameplay, sure you make different champs have unique roles with the juggernaut update but Darius in particular feels like he is incentivised to build tanky only and trying anything else will just result in a lot of deaths, reduces the fun I get by trying new builds on him.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2015-08-22T02:56:46.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played Nasus vs  Darius and i did notice what used to be a super strong counter of burst is now a slow noodle fight where somehow Darius out sustains Nasus, So now Nasus has lost the only thing against this counter that kept him there, the ability to out sustain opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"OriginalReaper","date":"2015-08-22T06:18:42.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find as nasus stacks up he outsustains anything darius can do.

His lane phase seems to suck but all he needs is levels now, where he used to need a bit of farm.\n\nHe can just play passive and smash a lot of top laners. Trynd wrecks him though.","replies":[{"poster":"OriginalReaper","date":"2015-08-22T02:02:45.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you get the 90% slow with 1 point in e, it doesnt scale with level. Right from the get go you have a strong pull but no damage to make use of it early xD \n\nHis burst is weaker than it used to be do to reduced damage until you hit 5 stacks of bleed and the cast time on q ruining the combo. \n\nPassive is the only way to play now :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-21T09:50:01.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They took away his move speed boost on Q and added a stronger slow on W+E to compensate.\n\nI've played him. He feels wrong. Doesn't feel like Darius, at least, the way I play him anyway. He no longer is that Q+E+W+Q+R insta killer I loved to play. Riot forcing you to build him pretty much full tank + new Hydra and go for drawn out fights, which is not what Darius was all about (to me).\n\nHe needs more attack speed and slightly shorter cast time on his Q imo.","replies":[{"poster":"OriginalReaper","date":"2015-08-22T01:53:54.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed, I am fine with that since a trinity force or a phage gives movespeed if I desperately need it, he really does feel wrong, I am used to early game darius, try to bully lane and carry early before you drop off.... like a lee sin. Now they completely flipped him and it just doesn't feel fun anymore. I have to play safer in lane only to sit in teamfights for long times to cleanup later. Attack speed is fine thanks to his w resetting auto, i can get an item or use runes if I need to. I'd rather cast time removed or reduced.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-08-21T12:35:49.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was literally going onto the boards after playing the new {{champion:122}} to comment just this. I like his new passive (personally think its better than his old one) and I have no problems with his w, e or ult in that matter. But his q, just adding the cast time to it RUINED EVERYTHING. Riot didn't realize that almost every other top laner has some sort of dash,speed increase or quick escape?{{champion:98}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:76}}  {{champion:92}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:150}} . Landing his q now is extremely hard when solo laning (I could only really land it in team fights). Because of the q cast time darius has lost his poke potential and now I'm actually starting to lose lane a lot. Riot can keep all the damage nerfs JUST PLEASE TAKE THE CAST TIME OFF.","replies":[{"poster":"OriginalReaper","date":"2015-08-22T01:49:58.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah my issue is the cast time, feels like a stun.
