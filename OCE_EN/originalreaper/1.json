Everytime i have this build my W becomes invisible at some point. I cannot tell if this is based on having one item, a combination of items, being cc&#039;d while casting or the time of the game however I thought this needed to be brought up as it needs a fix :) \r\n\r\nWhile I can still hear it when it is active and re-activate it this is annoying for my allies who arent watching my shield when I cast it, it even becomes difficult for me in a teamfight  where I alt+w and then I cannot tell who the shield paired with. \r\n\r\nPlease look into this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMe.","replies":[]}
