The account name is ProfWombo, this account  was an alt for Australia, but i cant login as ProfWombo to either Na or OCE, so I&#039;m using this account. I was wondering if its meant to take this long or if its bugger or what or not.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-26T07:37:54.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?\n\nAs this is an account specific inquiry, you'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to the friendly people over at Player Support, as we here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific inquiries.","replies":[]}]}
