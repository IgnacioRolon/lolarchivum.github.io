After a month or two of anger, I decided to make the best of it and start a climb.\r\n\r\nHighest previous rank: Silver 1, was in promos for Gold 5 and the season ended. Gutted.\r\n\r\nCurrent Rank: Bronze II, 0 LP\r\n\r\nMain Selections: Top - Garen, Riven, Irelia\r\n                              Jungle - Xin,  Warwick,  Shyvana, Nunu\r\n                              Mid - Lux\r\n                              ADC - Vayne\r\n                              Support - Sona\r\n\r\nGetting here:\r\n\r\nB5 to B4 was rough. Basically an afk every 3 games. I found tanking top was the easiest way out - Garen, the Bronze buster.\r\nGot promoted from B4 straight to B2, and then got 2 afks in my first game, 1 in my second, and 1 in the 3rd. Straight back down to b3 without a sniff of a fair chance to do anything about it.\r\nI won my way back to B2, and am currently battling along.\r\nTo give you an example of &quot;bronze/ELO hell&quot;, I just went 22/7/9 on Jax w/ Devourer. The ONLY reason we lost was the Ashe in my team trolled, followed me around laughing, stole my stacks with last hits and refused to join team fights. Honestly, the reason was because he was playing like balls and I was carrying. This somehow upset him. Terrible, toxic player. Sometimes you get people like this, and you just have to roll with it. But holy balls its frustrating.\r\n\r\nSome of my win streaks:\r\n\r\nhttp://postimg.org/image/bie1d8so9/\r\n\r\nhttp://postimg.org/image/w6uwbtfrt/\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll just be posting as I go, letting you know how I&#039;m going. Any advice would be great, feel free to check my match history and point out weaknesses :)\r\n\r\nCheers for any support,\r\n\r\nR&ograve;b\r\n\r\n(On a side note, why don&#039;t we have a general discussion? Such a welfare selection).","replies":[{"poster":"Ròb","date":"2015-07-13T12:38:51.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, Riot Trolling me.
