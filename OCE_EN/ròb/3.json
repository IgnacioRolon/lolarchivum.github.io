I won&#039;t be naming or shaming anyone (here). I might well point out the positive players I experience though, which would be a good thing.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;ll be a mixture of new posts with particular details of certain games, and summaries in the original post.\r\n\r\nKicking it off - Game #1 - Twisted Treeline (3v3) - Normal :\r\nHad an AFK - {{champion:157}} . He actually had the hide to request that I choose a different champ so he could have a knockup. Then, we join, he buys dorans blade and afk&#039;s in base. THE MOMENT THE GAME ENDS, and we&#039;re in the after game lobby, he starts talking. Couldn&#039;t believe it. Horrible Summoner.\r\n\r\n# Of Games           Total AFK Players             Total Troll Players\r\n        1                                  1                                        0\r\n\r\nAny Estmates? I&#039;m guessing approx. 20 full blown trolls and 30 AFKs. I&#039;m currently climbing out of bronze so It may get slighty better until I hit S5 again.\r\n\r\nWISH ME LUCK!\r\n\r\nR&ograve;b","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-25T22:13:25.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good lux","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-01-25T22:01:46.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of times it's not their fault.\n\nThey bought a cheap bot, and it crashed.

The line that says:\n# Of Games Total AFK Players Total Troll Players\nNo doubt you wanted the \"#\" to show up. If it's put at the start of a line, like you've done, it'll actually change the font as you've probably noticed in both your own post and just above in mine. To get around that just use a backslash, like this: \"\\#\", and it will show the \"#\" without changing font. (This wont be needed if it's in a table though) For example (hit that quote button if you want to see \"behind the scenes\"):\n\\# Of Games Total AFK Players Total Troll Players\n\nAs for your attempt at a table, there's actually a way to edit in tables on the boards (and again, hit that quote button to see how it works, this one's a bit more complicated), like this:\n\n| # Of Games | Total AFK Players | Total Troll Players|\n|:-----------:|:----------:|:------------:|\n| 1 | 1 | 0 |\n\nThere is a Rioter post somewhere on the boards that explains this kind of stuff but I couldn't find it.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-16T12:25:19.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, that last example was weird, ty though","replies":[]}]}]}
