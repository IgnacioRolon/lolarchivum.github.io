Also because you your predictable play style you become easy to gank. other than that, you can deny roaming as garen can push very fast and destroy towers and his roams are pretty brutal. unless you are lane swapping or counterpicking (and even then) you should avoid. but if ur playing blind pick anything works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2015-02-08T13:07:15.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I watched as a Garen on my team destroyed an Azir in mid and then continued to carry the rest of our scrub team sooo hard.
