I've been playing fairy well lately when I'm wining I've got a pretty high score and even when I'm losing I don't feed I just play safe and get my cs up and poke a bit. But my main concern is I'll just be trapped and have to deal with people who claim to have lag or are toxic. I just would like to no what's the safest way to play a ranked solo queue in case your wondering I'm not in any leagues","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-21T04:52:14.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Deadspec,\n\n**TL;DR**: if you want to improve your own game play solo queue, do not spend your time criticizing other players mistakes because that doesn't help you improve.\n\n*I have used rank and rating interchangeably below*\n\nPlaying **solo queue ranked** is one of the best ways to determine your **current** skill over all as a player. You should only play ranked if you want to see your rating **AND** learn and improve from each game. This means not looking at external reasons for losses but looking at your **own** mistakes in game and how you can get better. Obviously there are some games that are frustrating losses, a dc, an afk , an extremely negative player. But those games are far and few between (in my  experience) and you shouldn't let those instances take up too much of your time. Don't worry about others just focus on your own gameplay.\n\nThere is only one reason players get \"stuck\" at a certain rank. It is when they reach their natural rating. Whether this is bronze, silver, gold , plat , diamond, masters or challenger it's okay to reach a plateau where you hit a 50% win rate. That just means that is where your natural skill level is **currently**.\n\nIf you want to continue to climb from the plateau you need to put more effort into learning the game. Watch pros, read guides, learn about all the intangibles (creep wave management, vision control, objective control, lane pressure, map pressure etc). If you do put in effort you will once again keep climbing even if you are stuck for awhile.\n\nThe only thing you should be afraid of is the feeling of **entitlement**. Never think you *belong* in a higher rating than you currently are. Never *think* you only lose because of other factors outside of your control. That is when you get truly stuck. That is when you plateau **AND** you don't look to improve or learn, you just blame anything and everything but yourself. That is when people get stuck for extended periods (or worse tilt and drop tiers) and that is when people complain about \"Elo hell\" (which is totally impossible depending on how you define this.)\n\nPersonally for me ranked has been a great learning experienced and really helped me improve as a player (some of the learning was even applicable in the *real* world =O ). But it is what **you** make of it, as long as you focus on your own game and look to improve on your mistakes you will find it a rewarding experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-21T07:05:38.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I'll trying do all the things you recommended","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Breawien","date":"2015-01-21T04:01:05.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends is just a game.

You can't get 'trapped' in ranked. Play enough games, and your rank is a clear indication of your level of skill in the game. Most people refuse to believe this, but it's true.\n\nIf it goes bad, never do it again.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"RÄ±n","date":"2015-01-20T17:31:14.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't belong in that division you will climb easily, yes there are a lot of toxic and laggy people but you get used to it after a while (theres a mute button for a reason). Don't be scared to try ranked, its basically normals with bans. You could also try duo with someone you know that is already ranked, that might help you ease into ranked knowing you have someone you trust, or talk to normally.","replies":[]}]}
