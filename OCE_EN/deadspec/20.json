His q effect could be that he throws a ruler. and whilst raged he throws a foot ball, next his e could be that he uses a skipping rope to jump over enemy's and whilst rages he catches a foot boot/American foot ball/ his w in his rage form could be he performs a tackle and his  R would remain the same .
