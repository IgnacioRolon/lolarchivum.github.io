I'm at ~35 ping. I was NA, which was ~300 ping.\nNeither is laggy.\nBecause it was consistent ping. Not spikes. It is spikes that cause the issue.\nIf your Internet actually has high ping, you'll know because it spends forever trying to log you in.\nFurthermore, there is a ping cap at which the server simply denies you access. Try it. Use your bandwidth up completely then try logging in.\nWhat the OP is asking for is not a \"tell me my ping\" but a \"warn me if playing right now is an issue\".\nPerhaps a ping test that checks how stable your ping is, not what it is just once. Like your first 10 seconds in Q is a ping test for stability. Not stable? No playtime. Excluding bot games, of course. PvP I'd have that for all though.","replies":[{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-19T04:25:10.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You raise a valid point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-15T11:29:56.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if you have LoL and you use Windows, (Cause lets face it, if your using Mac you shouldnt be playing LoL) learn to use cmd. Everysingle thread that complains about this topic will get the same reply, its simple.\n\n1. Go to the Start Menu.\n2. Type in \"cmd\" and click on it/hit enter\n3. In the console Window, type \"ping oce.leagueoflegends.com\" and hit enter\n4. Look at the output for \"time\", that is your ping. \n5. Press the Up arrow Key so that it gets the last command you typed (\"ping\") and hit enter again. Checkk to see if it is fluctuating.\n6. If the Time (READ:Ping) is higher than your normal ping, dont play. If its >200, dont play.\n\nThis has been a TMk2g PSA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-15T10:21:19.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Over 50 is fine. I sometimes play on 200 and its just as good as me playing on 50. I guess its because I play other games on American servers that I am used to it though. It should just have a ping display at the top of the window.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-15T10:47:17.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. For me 200 is like medium, whereas 50 is like a divine ping for me. That would be a good idea though to have some kind of warning, and what would be better is if you could set the limit to when you can get the warning, in consideration to everyone's different internet and connections to the servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-15T22:23:57.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I generally play an aran or a custom game to test out my ping. \nOne thing that I have noticed is that my ping when I play on my NA account is stable at 207, whereas when I play on OCE it usually stays stable at about 56 but then randomly spikes up to 2000.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-15T10:51:49.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah not many people play on 50, not to mention the client is completely separate from the actual game in terms of ping etc.\n\nHonestly you could check yourself with a custom game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-15T10:30:28.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah this would save alot of trouble, also a sustainable connection test","replies":[]}]}
