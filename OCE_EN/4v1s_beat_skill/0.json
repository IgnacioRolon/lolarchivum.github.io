But when I created my second account I found that I was losing a lot more than I should be since i&#039;m technically a smurf, I was wondering if I should wait to get to a certain level before I go back to PvP or if i&#039;m just bad? Probably that last part haha.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-04-17T14:00:33.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends. I didn't start playing PvP until level 20 once I got my tier 3 runes because I was afraid I would always get stomped on PvP. I would actually get the shakes in any PvP situation and for that reason I avoided it for as long as possible.\n\nHowever, my advice is play at whatever level you're comfortable at. When you feel you have had enough experience in bots to be confident at farming or playing your chosen champ decently, then go for it. I advise that you DON'T hold out too long with getting into PvP, because the rewards for bots, now that the xp to get to the next level is halved, will get smaller a lot quicker and farming on it will only be effective for the First Win of the Day bonus.\n\nAlso, if you get too used to stomping bots, you are going to have to change the way you have been playing for X amount of time to adapt to the enemies that actually know that towers are bad and try to poke back in lane. Also, unless you have been looking up and researching the game while playing bots you might not have a clue about the current meta or where your chosen champion sits on the \"OP to Useless\" scale.\n\nTL;DR Wait until you are comfortable with the game and a certain champion, but don't wait much longer than that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-17T02:28:17.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you are a smurf, there isn't really a set level I would suggest entering PVP.
