I was pulled up for a racist term (g o 0 k) when I was questioning whether someone on the other team was being deliberately racist or if they mistyped (the phrase which was a big factor in the suspension, word for word from chat logs, was \"did you say g o 0 k or good?\"). In the interest of full disclosure I also said \"neck yourself\" to a particularly horrid little bastard. But the use of a racist term was a big part of the suspension.\n\nClarified with riot who agreed that I was using the term to clarify the intent of the other player and not to insult. 14 day suspension stood and they said they respected my right to quit the game (or in other words, they told me to get fucked even though they agreed that the suspension trigger was not interpreted properly by the system).\n\nApparently the c word gets picked up because the script was written by an american and not an Australian, which kinda sucks balls too.\n\nAnyway, good luck with that support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"V Thy","date":"2017-11-26T08:08:35.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too got a 14 day suspension for typing \"kys\".
