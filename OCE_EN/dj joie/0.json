The warm amber flames waved in the wind like flags. A large top hat crumpled and burnt lay on the ground. The soft ash slowly forming around it like moss to an old tree. Steps create the crunching of dirt and ash which came from behind the prone figure, to whom&rsquo;s hand covered their face. The sound of a young lady sobbing was heard as the steps grow closer to the prone figure. The steps stopped but a mere meter away. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gone,&rdquo; the figure sobbed as she turned to face the large individual who had approached her. Caitlyn, her once neat raven blue hair now frayed and split covered in dust and ash.\r\n&ldquo;We can rebuild,&rdquo; A rather masculine female voice huffed. Slowly the figure approached her Neon pink hair now tinged with grey and crimson. Her strong facial features scared by cuts and gashes and a tattoo on her left check. The Lunari symbols for 6, VI.\r\n&ldquo;No, no we can&rsquo;t. There is now way we can do this&hellip;&rdquo; Caitlyn paused turning to face the Enforcer before continuing, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything Vi.&rdquo; She said her voice starting to go horse as the tears began to flow.\r\nSlowly Vi began to move towards Caitlyn&rsquo;s shaken figure, extending her hand to the Sheriff. &ldquo;Do you think I said that when those workers were trapped in the mines? No I didn&rsquo;t. Now come on cupcake we got to up patched up.&rdquo;\r\nCaitlyn looked at Vi&rsquo;s hand then her face. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; she sniffed whipping a tear from her eye. Can placed her soft bloodied hand in Vi&rsquo;s, and slowly and carefully Vi pulled up her up. Though standing a head shorter then Vi, Caitlyn still managed to keep eye contact with her friend.\r\nThe soft crackling of the burning city was wiped from Vi&rsquo;s mind as she stared into the face of the very woman she once hated, but now respected. No not respected&hellip; loved.\r\nGently Vi placed her hand under Caitlyn&rsquo;s chin, dawning her vibrant blue eyes with a soft loving look. Caitlyn only looked confused at her partner as slowly Vi drew her face closer and closer to hers. And just like that their lips met in a single kiss. To Caitlyn it felt like she was feeling a rush of different emotions, so telling her to return the kiss others telling her to slap Vi. As for Vi it was pure bliss as her soft blue hues closed as she pulled back.\r\n&ldquo;I promise to you Cupcake, that I won&rsquo;t let this happen again. Mark my works,&rdquo; Vi uttered as she let go of Caitlyn and moved towards the great flames that engulfed the whole city. The hot winds blowing her long cindered pink hair.\r\n&ldquo;Vi.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Please Come back to me&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I will Cupcake. I will&rdquo;\r\nAs Vi turned to go into the fray of fire and death she smiled knowing that she wouldn&rsquo;t fail the woman she loved. Moving to her gauntlets, Vi slowly placed both her hands in the mechanical marvels, the turning to face the flames. Slowly she waked forwards, flames soon enclosed around the entry to the city centre Vi turned to see Caitlyn&rsquo;s soft face once last time before going forth.\r\nSoon she would face her old friend and this time she will save her. Even if both of them die in the process. Vi had a promise to keep, and Vi never goes back on her promises.\r\n&ldquo;Come on out Jinx, it is time to end this here and now,&rdquo; Vi&rsquo;s bellowed as she moved through the city centre. Burnt corpses littered the roads and pathways. As she made her way to a pile of debris sat a thin woman with two long pigtails.\r\n&ldquo;About time Vivian, I was wondering when you&rsquo;d show,&rdquo; the girl laughed maniacally as she rose from her seated position spinning one of her neon blue pigtails.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just Vi now, Vivian died when the mine collapsed as did her friend, Jessica,&rdquo; Vi hissed as she marched forward towards her rival.\r\n&ldquo;Well I still she Vivian in front of me, so let&rsquo;s fix that problem,&rdquo; Jinx&rsquo;s voice went monotone as she grabbed Pow-pow and revved the motor of the mini-gun.\r\n&ldquo;Very well, I see you in the Void.&rdquo;\r\nThe two figures stopped roughly three meters apart and readied themselves for the greatest battle of their lives.\r\n&ldquo;One must stand and one must fall,&rdquo; Vi growled as she activated her gauntlets letting the steam hiss from the values.\r\n&ldquo;No, I must stand and you must fall,&rdquo; Jinx laughed manically as a murderous grin spread across her pale face.\r\nAnd with that the two charged forward, both ready to die and both ready to end the promise they made many, many years ago.\r\n~several hours later~\r\nCaitlyn moved to the centre of her city the fires now but cinders. She saw the holes where rockets and power fist smashed the once graceful road. Over by a wrecked Hex-mobile lay a shattered power gauntlet and rocket launcher. Fear flowed over the young sheriff as she looked at the weapon Vi used.  Caitlyn continued forward through the desolate warzone. Seeing spots of red on the road. An Icy feeling made its way up her spine as she saw two figures slumped over each other.\r\n&ldquo;Vi!&rdquo; Caitlyn screamed as she raced forward to see the pinkette lying next the mad woman Jinx. Caitlyn grabbed Vi into an embrace checking for a heartbeat.\r\nLub-dub\r\nLub-dub\r\nLub-dub\r\nThough faint the beat was still there. For the second time that night tears formed of the Sheriff&rsquo;s face as she held her Enforcer.\r\nThe End.","replies":[{"poster":"YourRoyalHueness","date":"2016-06-24T20:54:02.883+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"5174 letters","replies":[{"poster":"DJ Joie","date":"2016-06-24T20:55:46.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YourRoyalHueness,realm=OCE,application-id=wJE2nAgV,discussion-id=ti4FtfF2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-24T20:54:02.883+0000)\n>\n> 5174 letters\n\ndid you count them all? or did you use a word doc?","replies":[{"poster":"MondayWaffles","date":"2016-06-25T03:33:00.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You actually typed 614 words don't worry bro {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
