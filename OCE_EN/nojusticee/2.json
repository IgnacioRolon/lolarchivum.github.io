Difference is most people will put the lucky streak down to playing well, or being better than their division, or deserving some luck for a change instead of seeing it for what it is. Maybe you got lucky and got to silver 1, then you were out of your depth and fell back down.\n\nNaturally even very good players will trend towards a 50% winrate as they begin to be matched with players of equal skill and start to be evenly matched with their enemies. If you have a 50ish % winrate over a sample size as big as 600 games, the fact of the matter is that you're at about where your skill level is.\n\nAnd yes, alot of games are one sided. These aren't the games that you need to carry to climb. The games you need to carry are the ones that are close (and there WILL be close games) and make sure these close games are ALWAYS turned into a win by you playing better than the enemies and tipping the scales in your favour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-04T17:33:56.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to get out of silver, pick a split push champion, and mindlessly split push until you are platinum. Your games are not rigged, it just seems that way because when you tilt, it makes your team tilt. Trust me i felt exactly the same for a period of time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-06-11T04:31:40.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your teams can't be trolling because you are the only player on your team therefore you are the reason for every loss you ever have and are just bad if you can't get out of silver. It is not a team game so it must be only you who are losing the games.","replies":[]}]}
