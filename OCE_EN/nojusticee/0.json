I just won my promos series with our top laner never even connecting which forced us to 4 v 5, so it can be done.  Remember computer games were not made to be easy and this game pages you to the limits. It's why this game has a huge sport factor compared to something like mine sweeper.  \n\nHang in there and keep practicing.  Also afk now is auto banned. Had it ban me for a rage quit. \n\nHave fun.\n\nHavok","replies":[]}]}
