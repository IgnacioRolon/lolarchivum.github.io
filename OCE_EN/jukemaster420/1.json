XD legit this happens every game. Like why is this a thing? It&#039;s pretty unhealthy and is totally not fair. I went from 3-0 to 3-4 because Vayne kills me in 3 autos. Yeah I understand I shouldn&#039;t be trying to fight her if I can&#039;t win but I mean here I was just tryna run for the hills with lord baby Jesus at my side but not even he could save me.

You're not seriously saying to nerf Vayne? Your just salty lol. Vayne has the lowest damage of all adcs until the mid game. She dies easily to jhin, miss fortune and ashe and she is extremely squishy and easy to blow up. Sure she has insane damage late game but she has to position to dodge cc and damage. In higher elos, shes high risk high reward because of how effective she is but how easy it is to focus and blow up. Shes balanced and the only thing you did was play to her strengths. Literally walking up to a veigar when your missing half your health.... YOURE ASKING TO GET FUCKED!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JukeMaster420","date":"2017-07-19T11:47:47.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Psylock but the thing is I wasn't leaning against her, I know drakes are important but like with a mage/assassin they have combos to use and land, other adc's have to actually kite and think about their positioning meanwhile Vayne tumbles into you 90% of the time and you're dead in 3 autos","replies":[]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-07-19T11:29:21.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its cos of her ult it gives damge and her roll aswell and the third hiit deals true damge and her e knocks airborn and if you hit a wall you get stunned so yeah she is broken but easy to counter just farm and last hit minions thats important cos hats where you get gold and a good score your not playing ranked yet your playing against noobs just my build as an adc to help blood thirster, or static unless your playing twitch kalista and a couple athers , then infinity edge, then essence reaver for cdr and crit, then phantom dancer, then the scimitar and if they have a tank get lord domoniks wot ever and also last thing remember the use ur  masterys and runes look them up they r impotant! trust me im bronze\noh and with this build u can do 1100 crit as a normal adc as vayne if u ult and roll it can be 2000 so u can be 2 shotting people and remember dragons r important always get infernal for more ad","replies":[]}]}
