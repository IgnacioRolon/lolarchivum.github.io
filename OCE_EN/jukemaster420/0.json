Are you serious? 60% ---&gt; 20% ap and the base damage nerfed THAT much? Wtf are you trying to do? Have the enemy at 3/4 hp level 18 after her full combo? SHE&#039;S AN ASSASSIN/MAGE AND NEEDS TO DO DAMAGE. I get she&#039;s strong and permabanned in ranked but come on wtf is that nerf? Her damage isn&#039;t the problem in case you haven&#039;t worked it out, it&#039;s items/masteries that go WITH her kit. All you&#039;ve done since the assassin rework is gut her alive like wtf? This is actually going to destroy her and I hope you&#039;re happy with that and will leave her alone. All player support had to say was, &quot;It&#039;s important that we don&#039;t make rash balance decisions. Sometimes it appears that a Champion is too strong or too weak, when the problem really lies elsewhere. If we immediately fixed the symptom, instead of looking for the cause of the balance issue, our game would be in a much worse state.&quot; LOL it&#039;s currently in a bad state because the balancing team sucks in all honesty, they focus too much on her kit because people cry about her when they don&#039;t realise masteries like Greenfather&#039;s Gift, Assassin, Merciless and Double Edged Sword are present? Items like Morellonomicon with the greivous wounds? Rabadons Deathcap granting bonus % ap? There are way more problematic champions than LeBlanc and if you&#039;re laning against her and she uses Distortion on you, then Shatter Orb, that&#039;s on you for sticking around to take damage or not trying to trade back. If she hits you with her chain right next to you you can easily outplay her, people are just lazy and would rather bitch and cry. She&#039;s been nerfed for 6 out of 7 patches in a row, when will you leave her alone??","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-08T06:53:21.899+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Like Talon12 says, she should have to work for a kill by utilising her _whole_ kit, not just landing a couple of spells. \n\nIts my view that all assassins should be able to 100-0 almost anything except a tank, but ONLY if they perform their combo absolutely perfectly, hitting **all **their spells at \nthe **right** time. \n\nAs it stands currently, champions like Leblanc, Fizz, and Zed could jump on someone, miss half of their kit, abort the fight, and still come away with a kill. \n\nLike riot said in her update and again in the 7.5 patch notes, the purpose of LeBlanc is to _deceive_ the enemy, not suddenly remove them from the game. And and by definition, _deceiving_ someone requires them to be alive long enough to actually fall for (or outplay) the deception.  As it was until now, there was no need to deceive someone, when you could just jump on them and squash them flat before they realised. \n\nif you want to jump in, assassinate someone and jump out, then play point and clicks like Fizz or Zed. But want you want to drastically outplay someone so much that they stare at a grey screen going... \"I need to watch the replay of that, just to understand wtf happened.\" thats when you pick Leblanc. \n\nwhat this patch does is try to force her into her intended playstyle, and away from the playstyle of other assassins. \n\nand in any case, riot said that this isnt the final conclusion, they clearly say that she was such a big problem in some areas that their number 1 priority was to remove the problem. They felt that it was more important to get rid of the problem than it was to make sure she was in a healthy state afterwards. \n\nSo they got rid of the problem by nerfing her damage, and now they will start building her back up, trying to get her to be more _deceptive_ instead of outright bursty.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-08T08:45:07.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"except riot is notoriously bad at understanding 'deception' and 'premeditated' gameplay mechanics, they either end up a bit too strong, or a bit overlooked.

They've decided to take the Azir approach, and nerf her damage to levels that force her to play on the upper end of her skillcap spectrum to make her remotely viable. This ruins her for low elo but balances her in proplay, where pros can make use of her kit to maximum potential.
