I added him and we play a game every so often but recently he asked me about playing  ranked with him. He wanted me to play with him because he is new to the game and doesn&#039;t want to be bronze any more, and he thought i was good at the game. After saying i cant play because we are two ranks apart and i don&#039;t like playing ranked he sent me his account and said he would pay me 10000 rp to get him into silver. I instantly declined this and said i wasn&#039;t allowed to do this and he wasn&#039;t allowed to do this, because he most likely didn&#039;t know what elo boosting is and its against the TOS I think.  \r\n\r\nThe main reason I am sending this is i need help to help him understand that not all people are as nice and forgiving as i am. If he gives his account details to another player, they could easily take his account, email, and anything else connected to that email. What can I do to help him?\r\n\r\nAny feedback/help is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-19T06:36:30.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nIt is great to see you looking out for your mate like this!  There should be more summoners out there like you! :)\n\nOne of the most important things to realise is that when you share your account information with someone (eg. username & password), that is giving them complete and total control of the account.  They can do anything with it and you have no control over what happens from that point on.  Would you trust that person not to get you banned?  Would you trust them not to sell/share your account information to a third party?\n\nThere is a lot of good information on our support site - especially on the [Protecting your account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664-Protecting-Your-Account) page, so maybe start there.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
