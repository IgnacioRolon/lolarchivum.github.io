The enemy lee got fb on soraka and decided to play around bot quite a lot,which is all fine so far, shit happens. Our jungle in retrospect decided to camp top, and they were absolutely crushing the enemy top.\r\n\r\nThe problem came when the soraka, who is a thresh one trick, felt like we needed to win the lane by fighting them. As a result, he was usually out of position and died almost every time lee came. On top of this he wouldn't listen to me and continued to get caught.  I feel like we could've won the game if we went even bot, as the vayne ended up walking out of lane with a shitload of gold on me and snowballed into a win. \r\n\r\n-----> Am I correct here in saying that we should've afk farmed while handling lee more easily in the goal that we go to mid game and win the 5v5 because our top was way ahead.\r\n\r\nI get his point of view that jinx can outrange and bully vayne, but I just don't think it was possible with a soraka vs yuumi and lee looking bot for all of lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease don't just say 'outplay them' since, I get that I could trap the lee to save raka, but everyone in this game was diamond and didn't fall for simple tricks if you were immobile and without flash. \r\nI'm not looking for micro advice, but macro :)","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-18T06:12:00.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm not at you're level so you probably don't care what I have to say but I will still post. \nIt's not easy if soraka doesn't want to play ball.

Like putting undying on a ranged champ if the champ combos are bad or you know how some people will probably  behave (e.g so you can take more hits and heal yourself + kiting with your best buddies; turrets in case of trolls/noobs galore).

Kills on any champion in any role makes them stronger and securing kills is a very under-rated aspect of league. Outplays happen more than they ever have and a lot of the time it's because people try to give kills over when it's too risky to do so. \nAlso if a player is not great at last hitting or ability management they probably need to work on farming more before they take a carry role seriously. Every role has an element of kill secure by farming or objectives so the carries in particular should be competent at this by default.  \n\nWhat I meant by support no matter what was more directed at the general notion that the supports primary role is to support the adc and empower them to stay safe while they do their thing. If you believe you can have more of an impact else where (ie: enemies are backed, dead or also roaming) only then is it fine.\n\nActually, on this subject, I have found by watching my own games I have very often been caught out by people not warding enough and me trying to be the hero support always paid the price. Since I became more aware of this I have been warding smarter and constantly sitting nearby my carries where the enemy has no vision. Quite in diamond and below people see an easy pick they have the mentality \"out of sight out of mind\" so they jump at the chance to try to carry the game or just greed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-10-13T02:54:03.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"afk farm = just farm safely without engaging with enemy champs if you can't trade positively  (in case anybody was wondering)","replies":[]}]}
