Also I really like his character and  phisiophical  personality. I also play the shakuhachi in my down time already so he could teach me a few songs, but apart from that i&#039;d really like to just talk to him and experience his life from his own perspective. Of course i don&#039;t condone everything he&#039;s\ndone, and I even think that sometimes he was wrong. But overall I would have his back, and hopefully he would have mine :)\n\nAnd being honest, it would be pretty bitchin&#039; if he taught  me the wind technique!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"XXXTENTACLEPORN","date":"2015-12-14T13:20:14.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:102}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-12T07:35:58.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-11T23:07:29.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to think it would be {{champion:133}} (and Valor obviously) but it's probably more likely to be {{champion:32}}...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-11T21:32:27.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no champs would like you or anyone else that plays this game.\nthey'd despise you all for wasting your time on video games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-11T20:23:38.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you play yasuos instrument and 97% of your games are of him? sounds desperate af, unless you're a hot chick i wouldnt want a stalker like that lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-11T16:45:46.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac{{champion:154}}","replies":[]}]}
