A simple approach every time you walk out of base can be to start at the opposite side of the map to where you'd like to make a play so that you can complete all camps and impact the map. This is a very efficient and effective approach you might find in solo queue, of course the jungle role is always reactive to lots of factors but this can give you a good starting point.","replies":[{"poster":"Good listener","date":"2017-02-03T07:15:21.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"(this is spookz btw lol)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"0riginalName","date":"2017-02-03T07:05:42.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are your favourite games besides League to watch and play?","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Swip3rR","date":"2017-02-03T07:10:47.083+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overwatch, Minecraft sucks and is for casual gamers.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2017-02-03T07:06:53.741+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"M I N E C R A F T","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swiffer","date":"2017-02-03T08:11:25.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"CIv 5 lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Havan√§","date":"2017-02-03T06:18:31.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much does the Quin bench","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Swip3rR","date":"2017-02-03T07:04:48.710+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes benching about the bar now, quite an upgrade from his first week.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"shiruba","date":"2017-02-03T06:13:15.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@anyone If you win the oceanic league for the 5th time what are your plans for the future?","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2017-02-03T07:00:54.616+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Win it for the 6th and 7th times obviously..
