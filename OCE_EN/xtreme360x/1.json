Gnar because he is tanky and have lots of CC and Irelia because she is just OP and very hard to itemise against because she deals Physical, Magical and true damage and can build almost full tank and still do lots of damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-05-31T08:14:02.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll suggest Gnar, long hand and when you r in mega form your damage and hp can allow you to trade with other. Irelia is also strong but need a lot time to practice and she quite depend on item. AA and Fiora is good for 1v1 but in combat they quite hard to do anything. Nid, the better you r the stronger she'll be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kazaragho","date":"2015-05-30T10:18:23.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I voted nid just because I like her.","replies":[]}]}
