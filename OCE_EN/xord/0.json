Jagex believes that this consists of 98% of all bots seen in the game.","url":"http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/ClusterFlutterer","image":"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape2/images/7/76/Bot_nuke_day_celebration.png/revision/latest?cb=20111025161908"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently I have noticed a surge in player-side bots during Summoner Rift Co-op VS AI matches. Similar to a script, botting is setup by a user to automate a process without user input. I&#039;ve heard of the wave that swept through ARAM games, but I was not witness to that. If they are indeed botting, and I&#039;ve followed the correct procedures in reporting and helping Riot identify them, then why am I posting here? Because this situation puts the game in jeopardy. It is not well known, and I feel that if some small portion of the community can better understand and help spread the word about this whole process, then we would atleast in worst-case scenario have a lull in botting before a new wave of ai comes out on the nefarious side of things; best case scenario being that this never happens again because a crack-squad breaks in on the whole procedure and shuts it down with a new process and/or program.\r\n\r\nWhat specifically are these bots doing that makes them identifiable:\r\nfrom my multiple encounters, I&#039;ve identified a few trends that all these bots share with one another. They take Grasp of the Undying, They dont participate in kills, they take smite  and heal, they build almost exclusively Blade of the Ruined King, they alternate small camps in the jungle, making using of the afk warning timer before proceeding to the next camp in order to generate enough ambient gold, swapping between enemy and friendly side camps, backing between each camp, they have random amalgamations of letters that string together to make a pronounceable word, leaving in order to queue immediately during post-game. these are just a few noticeable trends that I&#039;ve picked up on in my experiences\r\n\r\nWhy does this matter/How does this affect me as a player:\r\nBotting is in direct violation of the Summoners&#039; Code (although I doubt many players know of a Code existing), and is also against core game beliefs, whether that be video games, or real life sporting events: using illegal methods to obtain an advantage over others/upset the core spirit and integrity of a game. Most of what botting does is covered by game integrity, and the upset that it causes in relation to integrity. How does this affect the average joe gamer? I personally rarely play Co-op VS AI, and have only recently taken to it in order to complete the missions for the current PROJECT Event. This affects new players, as they are in Co-op VS AI mode in order to practice and learn more things about the game. now imagine if they weren&#039;t able to do that because a duo of bots join their game and afk jungle farm. This does 2 things: make the new player believe that this is correct behaviour, and most likely cause a loss for the player side, unless someone is able to cover multiple lanes and help to easily push into the enemy base and win, which also doesnt help the new player understand how the game works that well. I fear that this AI could spread into normal games, risking the competitive normality of games for everyone. Botting is mostly used in order to level an account, in order to sell it once it reaches the required stage for ranked (level30 account selling is practically illegal) because people are to lazy to level an account for themselves. the other problem that this presents is the potential toxic and banned state of the buyers of these level 30 accounts.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do as players: By helping to identify bots, report them, and spreading the word with other players, we can become part of the current solution, as of this time. directly sending names to Riot Support tickets can also help stem the tide, but clear identification NEEDS TO BE TAKEN AND UNDERSTOOD/proof of the botting taking place.\r\n\r\nWhat can Riot do: Have you heard of the Bot Nukes of 2012 in RuneScape? clear trends were identified/programs used, and every single account registered as botting at the time that the nuke went off was instantly banned. Server Data can be combed by a program, identifying users. workers at Riot can then comb all of these individual cases in order to confirm the botting offence, and once the timer reaches zero, every account that has gone through this process is terminated. of course if this happens, new software is going to be developed by nefarious people, but that is why we as a community need to step up to the batting plate and identify and then ERADICATE botting for good!\r\n\r\nIn identifying this issue, and closing this first post, I hope that an order within the community is established, that can successfully identify, report, and spread the word about botting within the coming months, and the near future. Thank you for taking your time to go through this. See you all on the Rift, Summoners!{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2017-11-27T02:12:58.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would also make a comment that there are different types of bots you will see in game.
