So what justifies the winning team only deserves half the LP? Losing team losing nothing is more than fair for them, I don&#039;t see why the winners should be punished out of half their LP because they were affected by wotever it was too!\r\n\r\nAnd then there&#039;s the situation before when everyone was stuck _after _ game ended. Gameplay was not affected in any way and the match is in our match history yet no one won or lost LP. Once again the losing team benefited coz they lost nothing but the winners miss out on LP for a game they _won fair and square in_. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m devastated to win my promos and find out it didn&#039;t count. Why did I get punished for this while my defeated enemies breathe a sigh of relief they lost nothing.\r\n\r\nThis it is not fair at all. You win you should be rewarded not the other way around.","replies":[{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-09-26T09:29:19.513+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"winners don't get the full reward because sometimes the victory wasn't completely deserved. riot can't manually go through each and every game to determine who deserved their win and who didn't so they just apply loss prevention to all games within the problem period. it sucks if you won a fair game but that's just how it is, there's no viable alternative.","replies":[]}]}
