Motivation is what i need and i will perform and not disappoint, every one says this but i really dont belong in bronze or silver and have never found anyone committed enough to duo with and try and climb. All im looking for is a chance which will be the up-most motivation and im always still learning but all im learning now is how to hit my head against the wall. Im cant be more serious and would love a chance to get on some coms as i hate not being able to discuss whats going on in the game and prove my worth ! :) Cheers ! \r\n\r\nI should also add, i do main ADC at the moment but can play any other role except for jungle just fine since my knowledge base spans over 6 seasons. \r\n\r\nPLEASE GIVE ME A CHANCE haha o.O \r\n\r\nAdd me on my main BrySkuxx to talk about anything :)","replies":[{"poster":"Chelbster","date":"2017-02-10T02:56:52.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i believe in you dude go get em","replies":[]},{"poster":"samuelror","date":"2017-02-07T10:22:25.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro i just added u on this account lets duo dia adc","replies":[]}]}
