Only thing I don&#039;t get is why I can&#039;t get S. I ward a lot, I always have 50% or more assists and I die max 4 times now (since I got mastery 5). Guess what I got? A+ \r\n\r\nA fucking + (am I allowed to swear? lol)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really confused about this. Only time I got S was when I went 10-1-19 and they gave me S+. So I thought, maybe I need to ks? this is why sona players always ks, I thought. BUT I remember that in a game with Nami I went 0-0-28 and got S and with Janna I went 0-3-and definitely more than 20 assists and they gave me S, so it&#039;s not about the kills.\r\n\r\nGame from yesterday I went 4-1-19 and got an A+ wtf \r\nThe game I just finished now I went 2-3-21 and got an A -_-\r\nPlease help me! How do I get S with Sona?","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-15T19:47:20.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy redemption in lane phase and use it on lanes about to gget a kill","replies":[]},{"poster":"not a girl","date":"2017-07-16T04:07:21.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your score gets matched with every other sona player in either the world or the region - it needs to be better than the average to get S/S+ (since sona players don't usually get kills, having lots of kills will be more likely to give you an S than having that same number as assists.)\n\ntook me a hell of a long time to get level 7 as janna, because everyone gets massive assist scores with her.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-16T04:10:22.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> since sona players don't usually get kills\n\nThat's a blatant lie! xD\nSonas are some of the most bloodthirsty players out there xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"White Boy","date":"2017-07-16T04:09:52.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kills for sup doenst mean anything... KDA is something to worry about but u basicly need to get more gold per minute, try to roam to help other lanes when your adc is not around and be the shootcaller to have towers gone and all other objectives... if u have most participation doing objectives I'm prettu sure u gonna get your S or S+","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-07-16T03:52:03.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go full AP, take all the kills, ward, ???, Victory, S+.\n\nThats all I do and shes now almost max ranked with a bunch of other supps I roll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-07-15T16:20:32.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly, its not known.  It has been confirmed tho, that kills=assists for sup rankings.  4 deaths is hard to get an S on.  Make sure your vision score is huge if you want an S, sweep regularly and buy pinks.  I find it fairly easy to get an S on sona, (3 this week in ranked).  She's strong at the moment, which ups the bar, as you're competing with the other sona's.","replies":[]}]}
