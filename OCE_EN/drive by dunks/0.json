Basically,  riot dgaf about bots,  or about their players.   I've had a gutful of these endless bots and the non-stop bad behaviour and afks.   Riot can take their horribly run game and stick it.  I won't be back.   If this was a general store or supermarket they would've gone bankrupt by now, because they treat their consumers like morons and give them very little respect.     Don't expect any comment from Riot about this, in fact their silence over the years on the countless threads about this same topic just says one thing.     Gtfo, we (riot) don't want to discuss this so go away.  Same with their totally useless reporting  system  -  it does nothing, zero, zilch!  In summary...  riot are useless  and treat their customers with zero respect.\nGo find a better game.  I have.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-03T08:07:33.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post was deleted because you posted it in the wrong board.
