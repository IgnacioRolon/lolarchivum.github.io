I advise following Riot's support documents first, but to troubleshoot DNS issues you will want to look into manually setting your DNS server addresses for your network interface and look into the NSLOOKUP command for the Windows shell console. \n\nIf you've made changes to your router configuration or your host computer firewall, definitely start there first as DNS can be configured on most home routers and if your firewall is blocking port 53 for TCP/UDP that could be the culprit as DNS checks run on that path. \n\nHope this helps a little.
