And who thinks he needs to be nerfed or set to a different lane?","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-14T13:07:58.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also if you can CC Jayce in team fights he should be deleted really easily.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-14T12:10:45.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have quite a few games Jayce, probably 80 this season, in both normals and ranked, and roughly 35 games the season before that.\n\nI am by no means an expert Jayce player, but he is a go to champion for me in ranked.\n\nImo the best ways to counter Jayce is abusing his weak early game, and against certain champs you can also abuse him really well in the mid game.\nIt is totally dependent on the matchup.\n\n**Bad matchups:**\n\nJax vs Jayce - a good jayce will dominate the Jax in the early phase, getting a significant lead\nKass vs Jayce - good Jayce will deny and dominate kass early, once Jayce gets ahead, Jayce stays ahead, his powerspikes easily keep up with Kassas\n\n**Average/Good matchups**\n\nFizz vs Jayce - Fizz starts flask and focuses on csing, Fizz gets a quick power spike at Sheen and can go for all ins at level 6+  (as Jayce in this scenario, you sit back and farm with e > q, unless however, you have managed to get a significant cs lead over the Fizz, in which case the Fizz is bad at csing, if this is the case Fizz will need jungler attention, once Jayce gets to deep Fizz ults and e's then the jungler helps kill Jayce)\n\nLb vs Jayce - A good lb can easily win this matchup, it does however, rely on the LB to make great use of Jayce's weak early, if Jayce can farm it out and get Murmana + brutalizer + lw Jayce will easily smash the LB out of lane :)\n\nNasus vs Jayce - this matchup is very dependent on your jungler and their jungler, if their jungler is smart enough to camp Jayces lane it will be easy days for Jayce, but this likely will not happen, Jayce will desperately be trying to kick the Nasus out of lane, but if Nasus can sustain through his damage and Jayce starts running low on mana/over extended Nasus should easily be able to get kills onto Jayce, wither is very very strong tool for your jungler to get ganks off. If Nasus gets 0 jungler help it is RIP Nasus however. \n\nRiven vs Jayce - if the Jayce gets in to close to do an auto he will get his head ripped off by a good Riven, Riven has the potential to zone Jayce away from cs but needs to be careful in not taking any dmg/too much dmg, Riven wins this matchup by capitalizing on Jayce making positional errors and also making good potential of riven level 6+ roams.  \n\nGnar vs Jayce - farm lane, Gnar needs to keep up on cs with Jayce and also harass him a bit, if Jayce starts Dorans + 1 health potion you should wack him out of lane and gain a lead, if Jayce has started longsword + 3 hp pots you need to focus on out csing Jayce and maybe zoning him a bit, just before you get mega gnar you bait him into a fight with you, this should lead to a lot of dmg dealt and possibly a kill. \n\nFiora vs Jayce - as Fiora you need to leap on Jayce whenever he extends too far away from his minions, you need to make sure you make good use of parry and your as buff, at 6 you bait Jayce into fighting you, perhaps whittle him down then diving him with your op ultimate + ignite, if Jayce ever gets to close to you and is far away from his turret he is A. asking to die or B. Baiting you onto him. In an all in exchange, a vast majority of the time Fiora will win, but Jayce is designed to e > q his opponents whittling them down, sometimes after an e > q Jayce will go hammer use the gate, then q > walk back to the gate > get through it> wack fiora back a final time and hope she isn't in range of another q, then in combination with an R, at this point you should be close to your turret so you will probably be safe, but yeah, if Jayce does waste his e instead of waiting for your dash he is probably dead meat.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanLuna","date":"2014-12-14T13:56:57.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow Justify! Thankyou for the wonderful in-depth strategy! It seems having a jungle is the main key besides early lane dominance. This game I played against him, we didn't have a jungle, so that probably didn't help much. \nThankyou again!","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-15T09:35:59.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"another tip for the Nasus v Jayce matchup is ...\nMax e as Nasus and go for a full AP build\nSame goes with Nasus vs Ryze\nMax e and you get them out of lane really well :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nerdzilla123","date":"2015-11-06T12:10:08.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jayce top lane is a top laners worst nightmare he is similar to nidalee in ability's but much more powerful but heavy CC and 2v1 situations have some effect","replies":[]},{"poster":"eVo Chaser","date":"2014-12-15T06:18:48.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jayce is not top meta btw, he is in mid meta and tier 1 ATM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-15T02:46:02.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:38}} \"Balls to you sir\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-14T23:42:39.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Pan %%%% on him early GG","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-14T21:17:04.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windwall his ball of %%%% and he's completely useless in team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SiriusPayne4U","date":"2014-12-14T12:52:20.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP - No\n\nStrong - Yes","replies":[]}]}
