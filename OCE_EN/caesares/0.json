It should be easy to get your point across without having to go the extra mile. \nThat said, I can understand your frustration due to the lack of quality in players in your recent games. But looking at your match history I see that your team which is usually consisting of a majority of Silver players are versing a team with a majority of Gold players. So presumably the other team would be better.\nBut another way you could put it is that you're on tilt. My friend is also on tilt at the moment and I will tell you what I told him. \nBeing on tilt is a both a good and a bad thing. It's bad that you're losing so many games but it's good in a sense that it can act as a wake up call. Whilst you usually only come to the realisation that you're on tilt and should stop playing when it's too late e.g. division drop, it will make you realise you're having a bad luck streak and should take a break from ranked play. Play normals or just not play League at all for a bit and then start practicing again in norms to redefine your skills before going back into ranked.\n\nHope this helps.\nSincerely,\nFog","replies":[]}]}
