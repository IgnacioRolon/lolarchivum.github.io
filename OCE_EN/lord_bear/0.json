We have more than enough players to play ranked 24 hours and I'm getting sick of being locked out. I work late and get home around 10 - 11pm and all I want to do is play some LoL, by locking us out from ranked queues at 1 in summer and midnight in winter I'm finding it extremely frustrating and frankly it makes me want to stop playing (mostly because normal modes are pure trash and aren't worth playing due to the trolls that inhabit the queues). \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, we've endured these ranked restrictions long enough and I haven't met anyone that doesn't agree with what I'm saying here (yet). Lift your game and bring us the features our North American friends are enjoying day in and day out, stop leaving us cold and alone in the shadow of your NA servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Pope","date":"2015-02-06T13:30:05.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RaF is coming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-05T18:25:47.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention the fact that they just gave NA players transfers to OCE for free.\nLike, I'm talking to my friend from NA right now, because being awake at this time is normal for her and I don't know...
