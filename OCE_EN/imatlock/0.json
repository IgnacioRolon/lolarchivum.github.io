At some stage last year I tried to play League again and so I contacted Riot support about getting my account back (because I couldn&#039;t remember some details about my account). I logged in but I don&#039;t think I played a game.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I got the urge to play again today and so I updated the client and went to log in, only to find out I&#039;m permabanned. There&#039;s also an email in my Inbox about it. Anyways, there&#039;s no explanation as to what I did to get the ban but the ban was apparently made a while after I got access to my account back but a very long time after I&#039;d last played a game.\r\n\r\nIt sucks because I have quite a number of skins. \r\n\r\nAny ideas why?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-13T09:23:13.888+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's likely the account was compromised and used for something like scripting which got it banned.\n\nSubmit an account recovery ticket to player support and they ought to be able to help you out: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nLemme know if you need a hand with any part of the process :)","replies":[{"poster":"iMatlock","date":"2018-03-13T10:59:03.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=YTLhkqVx,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-03-13T09:23:13.888+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s likely the account was compromised and used for something like scripting which got it banned.\n> \n> Submit an account recovery ticket to player support and they ought to be able to help you out: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n> \n> Lemme know if you need a hand with any part of the process :)\n\nAccording to the match history the account hasn't been used to play a game since 2016... well before I asked Riot support to retrieve the account, which is interesting. \n\nI've already submitted a report under the suspension system just tonight.

Not sure why, since the account technically hadn't been used to play a game in almost a year.","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn Bot","date":"2018-03-31T03:12:55.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well 18 days later whats happened I'm interested?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-13T18:50:59.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rip","replies":[]}]}
