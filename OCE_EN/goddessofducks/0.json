And apparently some problem caused the program to stop working correctly. I downloaded it on my other computer and it works fine but I'm not actually allowed on the other computer. Do you guys have any suggestions for what I can do to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"PixelPoro","date":"2014-12-12T10:49:52.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had that problem twice. Remove the LoL client then get ccleaner (I used the free version) and run that it will remove any stuff left behind but it will delete your browser history and all file so make sure u check the ones it want too delete. Then re-download the client it it worked for me both times I've had that problem","replies":[{"poster":"GoddessOfDucks","date":"2014-12-13T06:26:22.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks! :D","replies":[{"poster":"PixelPoro","date":"2014-12-13T10:47:50.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did the ccleaner work ?
