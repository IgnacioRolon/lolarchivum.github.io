RIOT NERF BECAUSE THAT WILL STOP THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN!\n\nI've yet to have someone instant lock in Ekko in normals. I don't think I've even seen him in a single game of mine yet. I grabbed him because I have the IP and I refuse to not have all the champs available to me, but I've still just been playing Lux, I want that shiny Level 5 Mastery.\n\nHonestly get over yourself. Every new champ or reworked champ is either OP or UP for the first week or so. Either because the PBE is a terrible testing ground for champion's balancing numbers, or because people are stupid and slow on how to learn a new champion.\nRemember how Gnar and Azir were considered weak and useless upon release? But then people finally learned how to play them after two months.","replies":[]}]}
