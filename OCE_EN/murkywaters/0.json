They glanced from side to side every now and then, all of them waiting for it. Then a red glow appeared. The clearing lit up revealing the true horror that awaited there. What seemed to be 12 figures&hellip;actually were 12 demons. Each had a mask upon its face, symbolising the demon that awaited them beyond. The red glow filled the entire clearing basking them in the warmth of the light. This was the light of the Blood Moon.\n***\n_An hour beforehand._\n\nA figure was moving swiftly through the mountains, humming as he went. He glanced towards the dimly lit blue moon. Almost time, he thought. The figure stopped for a moment to look towards the brilliance that was the city. The man or the artist he called himself could see and hear the last minute preparations for the blood moon. &ldquo;If only they knew,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.\n There was a commotion in the city, people buying last minute masks and stores running to the market to get ingredients for the dinner rush. The lights of the city were in perfect harmony. Magic filled the air causing the lights to show an array of colours, Blue, Green, Red, all of them in sync.  One could be mistaken this was New Year with all the bustle. \"What do I care?\" he thought. The artist continued his swift approach to the blood moon ceremony, his last performance.\n***\nThe man was running swiftly through the woods as silent as the wind. He stopped when he heard the laughter of the men in the distance and he could smell the scent of the liquor from his position. He murmured, &ldquo;Death is like the wind, always by my side.&rdquo; He stalked in on his victims&hellip;He struck viciously&hellip;\n One strike was all it took. 3 men lay there with stunned expressions on their faces for they had not the time to react against the man. The man stood there disgusted as he wiped away the blood from his sword. \"They deserved it, those filthy pigs,\" he thought. He glanced towards the moon and saw the time was near. He was almost there and the call was stronger now, almost pulling him towards the mountains.\n\nHe arrived at the cave entrance. \"This is it,\" he thought. The call was leading him here. He entered the cave and strode through without making a noise. He saw a light at the end of the cave and knew that it was time. He strode through vines and entered a clearing with 11 other figures standing there silently, waiting. It was time. The ceremony has begun.\n\n***\n\nLeave a comment below if you want me to continue this (can finish in less than a day) or if you think it is better off suspenseful like this!
