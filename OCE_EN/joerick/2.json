So far the only &quot;villains&quot; are Zed and Katarina. That&#039;s 2 out of 9... We need more.\r\n\r\nAll PROJECT skins are at least 975 RP, with 2 being legendary (more than any other theme), and both of those are for the heroes. How about in the next batch of PROJECT skins we get more baddies and the 1820 skin be for one of them? Maybe, it could be their leader?\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s my suggested Champions for the legendary PROJECT villain skin:\r\n\r\n* Syndra\r\n* Mordekaiser\r\n* Swain\r\n* Lissandra*\r\n* Viktor**\r\n\r\n*Maybe not since she already has Program Lissandra\r\n**Perhaps too obvious, and he&#039;s already tied to the Battlecast skins\r\n\r\nThey&#039;re all leaders or main rivals of leaders in their own lore, and I personally think that these guys could do with a little legendary love.  Can you imagine PROJECT: Mordekaiser sending a holographic dragon at you? (yes, I know he&#039;s really weak right now but it&#039;d still be cool) Or PROJECT: Swain transforming into a cyborg-were-vulture?\r\n\r\nMy other candidates for possible (non-leader) PROJECT villains include; Darius, Morgana, Renekton, Malzahar, Nautilus, Diana, Maokai, and Draaaaaaven.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think? Can we get Riot to do this for us?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-23T14:25:24.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PROJECT NASUS\n\nlol jks that would be terrible","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-08-27T07:56:18.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LED PIMPCANE INCOMING","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2016-08-27T07:28:19.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oo oo what about project SHACO AND BLITZY!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-24T00:25:19.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it us a sub-universe, if I'm correct it is actually the canon future of the current lol universe. (could be wrong)\n\nAs for the bad guys, The Battlecast series of skins are the enemy PROJECT: is fighting. \nZed and Katarina switched sides for more power, they weren't the original enemies of Ashe and the others.\nBattlecast Vel'Koz can be seen behind Katarina in her splash art. And a skin resembling a possible Battlecast Olaf kills Master Yi, in his original life.\n\nThis makes Creator Viktor the probable enemy of the PROJECT: Rebel group.\n\nAlso magic does not fit the criteria for the theme of PROJECT: skins, so i think it is unlikely that there will ever be a mage with a PROJECT: Skin.\nSo unfortunately that cancels out all of the skins you mentioned except Darius Draven and Nautilus. \n\nRenekton doesn't fit the criteria either as he is not human, and being human seems to be another criteria for PROJECT:","replies":[{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-08-25T08:44:33.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya know, Maybe since Viktor is the enemy of Project, Maybe there is a project Jayce in development?\nhehe totally not a Jayce Main","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2016-08-25T03:23:20.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could see a PROJECT: Diana happening.
