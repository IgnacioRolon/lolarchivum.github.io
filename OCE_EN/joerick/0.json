What it gives us is 3 extra item slots (hotkeyed by default to 8, 9, & 0) and double the starting Gold. As the game progresses we get extra gold from all sources;\n\n* x2 gold per 10 seconds\n* Minions and Monsters give us either +50% or +100% gold\n* Champion kills and assists give us either +33% or +50% gold\n* Objectives give us +50% gold\n* Gold-granting items give x2 their usual amount (excluding bonus gold per 10)\n\nChampion created CS (Tibbers, Heimer's turrets, Yorick's ghouls etc.) or other gold granting things (Azir's Turret's, Rek'Sai's tunnels, clones etc.), champion gold passives (TF's Loaded Dice, League of Draven etc.), and gold-boosting Runes and Masteries are unaffected by the gold increase.\nAlso the Relic Shield line of items should remain unchanged, since the minion gold amount is already boosted.\n\nI was thinking we've had game modes for just about every other aspect of the game; URF for resources and general craziness, Hexakill for team comps, One-for-All and Nemesis Draft for Champ Select, Doom Bots for vs AI, Ascension for Crystal Scar, Poro King for Howling Abyss... so why not a mode for some crazy item builds?","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-03-15T09:18:42.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually sounds like a pretty fun idea. I've always liked the idea of having the ability to buy more item slots, but that was always plagued with balance issues. This seems like it could be a very fun game mode, as the extra gold means the game would hypothetically keep pace with current games (ie filling up 6 item slots by 40ish minutes translating to filling up 9 item slots by about the same time), but make the game more fast paced with ADC's now being about to build more AD damage, mages building more AP damage and tanks buying more tank items.\n\nAs an added caviat you could maybe have the option to pay and respawn? Something like 100 gold for each second you would have had left. So for example you die, theres a 30 second wait before you respawn, you can pay 3000 gold to instantly respawn, or wait until the timer is say 15 seconds and only pay 1500 gold.\n\nEither way, I like this idea and wouldn't mind seeing it in the future. One of the better ideas I've seen on these boards. +1","replies":[{"poster":"minnie002312","date":"2015-03-29T12:26:54.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds fishy.... like dota 2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-04-18T04:40:09.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really like the idea of being able to pay to respawn. Too much potential to troll there. That's also why I think champion created CS should remain unchanged, so people who want to troll don't just play Yorick or Malzahar and give the enemy free  gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-18T06:15:06.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too much potential to troll? We literally just wrapped up with URF, a game mode where there is no mana cost and a support like Sona becomes one of the most broken champs in the game. Sure there's the potential to troll, but there's a limited period of time you can play that game mode, and you can only do it IN said game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-04-28T11:30:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing Sona in URF isn't trolling, it's smart picking and poor bans by the other team. I'm talking about people who, in URF, would play Anivia to trap their team in base, or stop their team from ever recalling. \nIn this case, because you'd be gaining gold very fast, you could \"pay to revive\" more often than you might think. Thus the feeding kind of trolls would be able to feed even harder and faster, especially in the early game when spawn timers are shorter.\n\nJust because it's limited time and in only one game mode doesn't excuse troll behaviour. Regardless of what game it is, troll players ruin the fun in games for others. As such I like the idea of trying to minimize their damage to the fun-factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-28T14:19:08.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because it's there doesn't mean the majority of people would do it. I played plenty of games with Anivia's in URF and they were fine.\nHeck, there exists the potential to troll already with Kalista's ult. Trolls are the minority, not the majority, and you should punish the majority for the potential acts of the minority.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riqs","date":"2015-03-21T01:23:15.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool Make that game rito","replies":[]},{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-20T05:18:13.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OPNESS ALERT THIS IS JUST AS OP AS URF SOUNDS SCARY AND ANTI BOT NOOB (HOPEFULLY){{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2015-03-15T18:25:52.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty new to League (October start), but this does sound fun. A good mode for jumping straight into the game, getting geared faster, a little more cut-throat if you lose time in lane/give enemies kills, etc.. Games would probably be over faster, but they would be definitely interesting and probably more opportunities for swinging the game, gearing some very interesting kits, etc.. (super attackspeed kits, super AD kits, immense tank kits, GCD kits, etc..)\n\n+1 from me. I am a mostly Rift player, but that's because other game modes only sporadically interest me.","replies":[]}]}
