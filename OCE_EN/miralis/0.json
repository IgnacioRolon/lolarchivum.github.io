In my mind Fiora is all about rewards well timed abilities and then punishing once that is accomplished; Tahm Kench&#039;s devour not going on cooldown really doesn&#039;t follow that. I was wondering if this was intended and if it is why?","replies":[{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-10-15T08:16:04.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can confirm, was playing Sivir and spell shielded devour (animation and all occurred) however he was still able to devour me right after","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pack a Bag","date":"2015-10-15T06:59:12.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sure he was trying to use devour as soon as he got the 3 stacks?
