Also the expected waiting time is always VERY LONG for all Champs!!!\n\nIs this due to the network problems you have or is this my account? Does anybody else have this problem?\n\nBy the way, Blindpick works fine.\n\nI tried ( all for more than 15min):\n\n- Ashe, bot, marksman\n-Blitzcrank, bot, support\n-Yi, jungle, assasin\n-Fiddlestick, mid, mage\n\nPlease help!\n\nEDIT: Blindpick also stopped working for me, see attachment!","replies":[{"poster":"PhilBazer","date":"2015-03-06T07:57:25.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am lvl17, so there's not the possibility to play RANKED and blind pick is just the most annoying thing, when you have to play with noobs all the time.\n\nI did check it in a different wifi and it's the same here, whats going on?!?!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T09:25:34.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use the \"Reply\" feature of the boards to give notification to the people you reply to.\n\nThe players who are found and sorted into teams use the same algorithms in all Teambuilder, Blind Pick and Ranked.
