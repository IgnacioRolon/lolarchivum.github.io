Whether or not it's a problem wholly on your card's side or some combination of factors I don't know. Hopefully support can point you in the right direction at least.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-13T06:36:24.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried running a clean reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool?\n\nIf you are getting DirectX errors sometimes only a full reinstall will correct them. If that doesn't work either I'd recommend making sure your DirectX is up to date: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35\n\nI'd also recommend reinstalling your graphics card drivers, since it could have been a bad update or conflict causing the issues as well.\n\nIf all else fails, contact support and they should be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nSome things to note when contacting support, keep it short, simple and to the point. Tell them the issue and what you have already tried to fix it.","replies":[]}]}
