I am wondering who might remember when one could do an AoE stun with Tibbers, then follow it up with a stun from another ability using 4-stacks? With so many players, there has to be someone. I have checked some notes, the more recent issue over Tibbers placement is not what I am referring to here. I am specifically asking about Tibbers ability stunning AoE, regardless of stacks. Appreciate any helpful replies from people remembering it, thanks!\r\n\r\n[ _Sorry btw I submitted this about 21 hours ago in Help &amp; Support (OCE) because I didn&#039;t know &quot;General Discussion&quot; had been abbreviated!_ ]","replies":[]}
