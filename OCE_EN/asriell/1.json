Restart PC and join game again. Enemy about to run down our nexus and it&#039;s apparent my whole team is only now reconnecting to the game also. Keep in mind game was even and no towers had fallen -&gt; 2 mins and they&#039;re taking nexus. Everyone on my team is also saying ddos. Enemy team is pointing fingers and claiming they&#039;d done it etc. I&#039;m kinda in disbelief that ddos attacks are actually still happening. I thought they started and died during that kinda crisis like 3 or 4 years ago.\n\nI&#039;m posting here because I have no idea what to do after that. Can I get my series back? Can I help get the perpetrator banned? Is this game just a part of a larger ddos crisis going on? Is Riot actually working towards a fix or is this just an isolated incident?\n\nThanks for any info or help Rioters or more informed individuals might be able to provide.\n\nAlso, I'm just assuming this was a ddos attack because I'm not aware of anything else that could have caused such a specific attack.
