Remove the name and link please.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-23T01:55:38.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd rather dodge than getting at least 20 minutes of drama","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-05-23T01:06:33.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Based on the information you've provided, both of you were in the wrong.\n\nIt's true enough that if they didn't want to play support they shouldn't have queued for it *however* that's no reason to name call, and, let's face it, that seems to be where the issues actually started.\n\nThey were in the wrong for offensive language/harassment and feeding, *however* you were also in the wrong for offensive language/harassment.\n\nIt's entirely possible that the situation never would have escalated if you had decided *not* to offend them.","replies":[]}]}
