AND THEN your support {{champion:432}} {{champion:223}}  comes out of nowhere and takes your kill, you get 50g for the &quot;assist&quot; and him/her gets 100g for that kill. It&#039;s just not fair you go back to lane with the tiny advantage of 2cs. \r\nWhat I&#039;m proposing is that your kill participation decides how much gold you get for that kill e.g 97% kill participation you would get the base stat of 50g plus 47g = 97 and your kill stealing support or whatever would get the base stat of 50 plus 3 = 53g\r\n\r\nso that 0-50 extra gold would really change up the game and actually make the adc do more than 1 auto for a kill. I know there will be some problems with the lcs and they want there adc fed and putting kills onto specific player but im saying this for like normal or ranked game play\r\n\r\nplease give me your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\nyours sincerely True Inspiration","replies":[]}
