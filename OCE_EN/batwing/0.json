Legacy did.\n\nChiefs finished outright 3rd, so they play DW. \n\nAV/TM/SIN all finished equal 4th so had a three-way tiebreaker to see who made playoffs. AV won.\n\nSo the final standings were\n\n1 - Legacy\n2 - DireWolves\n3 - Chiefs\n4 - AvantGarde\n\nWhich gives us Legacy v AvantGarde (1v4) and DireWoves v Chiefs (2v3).\n\nSimples!","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-07-31T11:44:53.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr answer - because tiebreakers","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-08-04T01:17:07.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this is correct.
