OFA: Mirror Mode made one appearance in *2014* and OFA, in it's original form (with some slight balancing changes), made a *single* appearance in 2015, during the second half of October.\n\nHexakill made 2 appearances in 2014, one at the start of the year as it's original release and another appearance in October of that same year as Hexakill: TT with a *single* appearance in 2015.\n\nUltra Rapid Fire made it's original appearance for April Fools in 2014, with only a *single* appearance since for April Fools in 2015.\n\nAscension has made only a *single* appearance, in *2014* no less!\n\nBoth Black Market Brawlers and Nemesis Draft have each made a *single* appearance (both their debut).\n\nHonestly, just be patient. I'd say it's more than likely Riot will bring it back some time next year (possibly with an altered style like certain previous re-released featured game modes).","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2016-01-04T15:18:05.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ascension and Black Market Brawlers they're still fairly new. However I think Riot might not be making Doombots again cause they need to do \"All this work\" which is for colour blind people, changing champion spells and recalls to a different colour as the map is all and mainly dark. So on and so on. Also the fact was that it was on the OLD map of SR not the New so they'll have to make the new one all dark themed. You catch my drift about now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-12-30T18:24:07.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i never tryed it what is it about","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-30T21:49:33.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was honestly the best mode ever, I'll get hate for this but URF was so overhyped.
