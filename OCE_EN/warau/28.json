I came across the part where it said Tradtional Trundle.\r\n\r\nIn order to get this skin we had to own him before the rework. I&#039;m not here to argue but I&#039;m pretty sure I purchased Trundle before the rework but never got his Traditional Skin. \r\n\r\nIf a Riot employee would be nice to check the date of when I bought Trundle that would be nice. This may not seem important but it&#039;s just something I need to know.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-08-11T11:12:51.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya **Kido**,\n\nAs this is an account-specific inquiry, we can't assist you much further on the boards. You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Do your best to not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n3. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n4. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-08-17T08:27:51.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for late reply.
