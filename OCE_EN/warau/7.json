Not much of a difference I guess but our $20 dollar cards, we get 38 more then Canadian. However NA seems to be getting more value. What I also noticed in the table was that it doesn&#039;t tell us how much we get for $50. NA gives around 7200 RP. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong. So I&#039;m wondering if Riot will ever change the amount, or I&#039;m just a complete noob with the value of money around the world. Aside from that I would like to know how much $50 will give me in OCE.\n\nWe all gotta get ready for them PROJECT Skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-26T12:52:01.007+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just an FYI, we get less RP on the OCE server cause the aus$ is worth less than the us$","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-26T15:18:53.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the au$ went up slightly, they should raise to compensate ^^... no such thing will ever happen, they make for money this way, soon it'll be 725 for $10 I swear","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-26T15:51:33.507+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The dollar went up you say?\n\nhttps://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AUDUSD%3DX#symbol=AUDUSD=X;range=5y\n\nI say we are at a 5 year low, try not to make shit up.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-27T02:42:05.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it went up 0.1$ 3 days ago, and then 1 min ago from this post it went up another 0.001$, riot should give 5 rp bonus per $ because they nice, but alas they aren't that nice","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-27T03:06:33.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EgLRvy0q,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-27T02:42:05.108+0000)\n>\n> it went up 0.1$ 3 days ago, and then 1 min ago from this post it went up another 0.001$, riot should give 5 rp bonus per $ because they nice, but alas they aren't that nice\n\nit didn't go up 0.1$. the highest it's been in the past week is 0.73. if it went up by 0.1$, it would've been at like 0.63$. and they only change it when they're a large increase/decrease.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-27T04:43:51.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's always changing, it goes up 0.01 then down again few hours later, riot just did the rp on the average amount, but its always changing it was 0.75 a few weeks back now its around 0.7 again, always changes, so its just easier to us the average cost.\n\nFrom the post before when it was at 0.7279 its now 0.7119, riot should still be nice and give us 5 rp more per dollar though, I'm sure they have plenty of money atm","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-27T04:57:01.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EgLRvy0q,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-27T04:43:51.804+0000)\n>\n> it's always changing, it goes up 0.1 then down again few hours later, riot just did the rp on the average amount, but its always changing it was 0.75 a few weeks back now its around 0.7 again, always changes, so its just easier to us the average cost.\n> \n> From the post before when it was at 0.7279 its now 0.7119, riot should still be nice and give us 5 rp more per dollar though, I'm sure they have plenty of money atm\n\nit doesn't go up or down 0.1.\nthat's 10 cents.\nthat's fucking ridiculous.\nit's easier to leave it as it is when it's fluctuating by about 0.01, or else they would have to constantly change it, and I'm sure they have better things to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-27T07:15:51.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oops, soz I meant 0.01$, wondering why everyone getting so agro lol. ill go fix those\n\nmeh who cares, bonus 5 rp for every cent amiright","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-26T23:52:26.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EgLRvy0q,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-26T15:18:53.248+0000)\n>\n> the au$ went up slightly, they should raise to compensate ^^... no such thing will ever happen, they make for money this way, soon it'll be 725 for $10 I swear\n\nit's still 1 aus$ buys 0.71 us$. that's a fucking insane difference in value. not as big as the british pound, but that's a difference story.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-08-26T12:52:07.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read through this then you'll understand why :)  (still annoying not getting as much though :( )\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/MXv9uHnL-rp-adjustment-in-oceania","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-30T18:59:56.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"50$ Gets you 5900 RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-08-31T05:56:06.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NA -
