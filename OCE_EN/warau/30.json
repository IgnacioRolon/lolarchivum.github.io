I mean it just doesn&#039;t any make sense\n\nI know about those new skins that came out recently a while ago like Demon Vi, the voice changed but the lines are the same, Elderwood Hecarim is designed and painted in a forest like place yet he&#039;s still talking about death, I wished he&#039;d be talking about protecting the forest, Void Bringer Illaoi void designed says same lines etc. If it&#039;s not to hard to make it a little step further it would be awesome.\n\nThe point is don&#039;t give a skin that&#039;s totally different for a champion only to include the same lines. Demon Vi is the only thing I&#039;ll actually accept.\n\nYes I know about the Legendaries and Ultimates, they have all have different lines. Some just however look exactly the same.\n\nHowever Dunkmaster Darius and Brolaf are just great examples they look so sports like and casual (different) and hey were a HUGE success.\n\nK now Im just rambling.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-28T10:15:35.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the Legendary and Ultimate skins can have new voice lines because of their price.","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-11-29T06:29:01.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ik but it's retarded to me.","replies":[]}]}]}
