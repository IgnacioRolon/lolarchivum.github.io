After returning some what to look at hextech crafting. I thought i&#039;d come back to league, however ever since this 6.7 Patch has came out. I&#039;ve had 33% in my Client patching which then led to it scanning files none stop. After that I searched up ways to see if there was a solution. None had came up. So what I did was uninstall the game and reinstall. I think ultimately here this was my real problem has of now, when it passes 33% I have to wait for it to finishing patching 3k Mb worth of files but then increasing 1% slowly for almost every 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to increase the download speed. My internet connection is fine, as the download speed for other games such as CSGO and Hearthstone are perfect. It&#039;s the  League client that I don&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on with it. Any help is much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-12T09:19:02.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhat speed are you currently downloading the game at? \"increasing by 1% slowly\" doesn't tell me how fast you're downloading the game.","replies":[]}]}
