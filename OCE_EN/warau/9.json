I mean he goes under it i know that but than you might as well make it so Tristana can&#039;t get stunned when she w&#039;s over. Hang on she does and idk why this doesn&#039;t work for Vlad want goes under and over should work the same way. The only thing I want seeing going under a Veigar E is water. I don&#039;t know I mean seriously it bugs me and hey blood is thicker than water. Anyways can we please make his W actually get stunned when he&#039;s exiting a Veigar E from inside or going towards it with his W. Aside from that even when entering the Fountain he&#039;s untargetable if so than that&#039;s just a slim of how broken he can be to finish off ppl at low health when entering spawn. \n\nI may seem like I&#039;m bragging. I might be bitching even. But please. Just make him get stunned when at a Veigar&#039;s E wall and burned when entering fountain. \n\nPlease. \n\n{{champion:45}} uses E {{champion:8}} uses W tries to escape but gets stunned\n{{champion:8}} entering fountain equals {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3751}} BURNED!","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-27T18:29:47.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about instead of making us read this mundane question you actually do some research yourself as to why this may be. also instead of asking why this happens and then stating why it should be the way you want it to be after it didnt work the way you wanted it to in favour of the champ you were playing, maybe you can learn to grasp a sense of better understanding of how champs, abilities....words.....work. blood is thicker than water, is your justification for why vlads pool should be stopped by veigars stun.....sigh.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-26T13:37:13.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's untargetable by everything after hes used it.
