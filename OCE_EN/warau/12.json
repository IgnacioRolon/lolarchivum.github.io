Just currently in my last game I was vsing against a Diamond Ranked Sona.\r\n\r\nI'm sure many people are having this, seriously it's not fun vsing people who have more experience in the game then you do. Our scores were from 12-44. My team did end up flaming and blaming each other. \r\n\r\nIt was until after the game I checked all their profiles. Their play styles seemed really to well to be in silver/bronze.\r\n\r\nAny ways I'm pretty sure low ranked players will be having this issue. Highly occurs in ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-13T15:49:07.748+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who actually cares? It's ARAM.
