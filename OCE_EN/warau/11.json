That said, Annie already has many great skins, Frostfire and Goth are fab, and I'm a big fan of Red Riding as well. \n\nVayne has only 2 skins (excluding soulstealer) that I really like, Dragonslayer is the one that almost everyone has so doesn't really feel worth owning it for a champ I don't play much, and while I really like the SKT skin it's still 750 tier. So from that perspective I would consider Soulstealer Vayne as well.\n\nI do like the ward skin, but not enough to worry about spending gems on it while there is other content I'd want more. As much as I like the two crafted skins, I think I'd wait (and will probably have too just because of the gem drop rate) for another one or two crafted skins in hopes there might be one I like better for a champion I play more/doesn't already have a skin I like/own.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-10-25T10:53:08.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was lucky enough to get a Hextech Annie shard in the first Hextech Chest I ever bought.
