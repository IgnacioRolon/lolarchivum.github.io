Oh I was just in a match where just 1 graves shreds a Garen and a Hec...like wtf. Riot. What happened to &quot;TANKS&quot; yes tanks, literally he only needed 4 autos. Malz ult needs a nerf on the duration and slight dmg. only mid laner with silence atm. Warwick is never going to get changed nor poppy. Poppy splash art needs updating and ww has always been broken. You just can&#039;t kill the sustain scumbag.\n\nEdit: Sorry this is ARAM wise. Masteries with tanks now FUCKING TRASH","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-11-18T14:08:54.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason that Malzahar's ult is doing so much damage is because of the keystone mastery deathfire's touch. As for your argument about tanks Malphite, Mundo and Rammus the few hypertanks currently has the highest win rate in the game. Also Garen and Hecarim are more of a bruiser than tank and normally build 2 damage items and then full tank. About graves being OP i do agree and he is getting nerf next patch so please be patient.
