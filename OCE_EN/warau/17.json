However protected by the Doombots and with random garens and fiddles popping out from where'd ever you went.\n\n**Edit: In the Old Doombots you had 5 different levels to pick from.**\n\nCurrent Doombots or should I say &quot;The Teemoing&quot; is half the map cut off, with doom bots but basically a tower defence mode and while at 0:00 since it&#039;s a countdown a huge devil teemo will spawn in the middle of mid lane and slowly make it&#039;s way to your base, except the doombots protect it, it&#039;s super tank and does insane 1 shot dmg.\n\n**Edit: The Teemoing has 2 levels to pick from. **\n\nImo I don&#039;t want &quot;Doom bots&quot; to be a &quot;Tower Defence Mode&quot; it should be more wild like the old one, where even pushing you&#039;d get punished or spooked by a random Fiddle and Garen popping out of the Brush/bush.","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2017-12-20T01:41:18.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have taken alot of the Rotating game mode and changed them, not for the better with all of them in my opinion either. I do miss the fact that Doom Bots is no longer an actual match but more of a tower defence game about wave clearing.","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2017-12-20T09:06:23.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the old one was more challenging because it covered the entire map, to win current doom bots ppl just play ziggs","replies":[]}]}]}
