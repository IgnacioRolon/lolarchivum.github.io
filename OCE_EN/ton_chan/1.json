If you get 4 teamwork honours and 5 honourable opponent honours every single game...it would probably only take you 3-4 games to get a badge xD Personally i got my first ribbon(Teamwork) at 22, Honourable opponent at 46, Friendly at 32 and Helpful at 14(back then I got at least 3 honours per game, which is pretty consistant). \n\nGenerally what I think helped me get my 4 badges is to just congratulate people when they get a double or make an amazing outplay and etc. Also if you are doing bad at a new champion you're not sure about, don't be afraid to ask for tips! If people flame you, just mute them...trust me it makes things so much better when there's nothing to distract you from doing your best:). I know the world isn't all sunshine and rainbows but a lot of the time it just helps to be optimistic:). \n\nPs. Yes it can be extremely awkward when the chat is all 'iDeadly: Nice work! iDeadly: My bad, will try to stay at the back next time iDeadly: gj! ' etc. and one else is talking, but I think you can potentially make someone's day when you tell them about how truly amazing their play was!:D \n\nEdit from a year later randomly looking back at boards history: 1. Yup my name is Amaryliss now xD 2. I really really don't recommend spamming 'gj', 'mb' etc. anymore, it blocks out important pings and a lot of people will find it very annoying .-. So for anyone looking at this for whatever reason, if you want to create a positive atmosphere do congratulate teammates, but tone it down and only type after an amazing teamfight or some significant play :D \n\nGl in getting your badges! :)\n\nEDIT: If you don't mind, could you tell me how long you've been playing? :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-03T06:45:03.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about the number of points but the consistency. basically you have to get honoured for one of the four consistently. (it has to be one not a mix of all) So if you were getting Honourable Opponent every second game or so you'd get a badge, and the badge would go away after a while if you stopped getting honoured. It's why you see so few people with badges. Usually the ones that have them have a few friends who honour them reasonably frequently as it's nigh impossible to get random honours frequently enough, people forget it's a thing that exists most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-03T06:41:37.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's not really a specific number, because they are percentage based as well. The more you play, the more you need to get basically. Getting 100 of each won't get you a ribbon if it takes you 2000 games to get them.","replies":[]}]}
