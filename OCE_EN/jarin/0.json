I like this game so much. The only negative which is making me to think if I should stop or quit playing is the huge number of toxic players. I don&#039;t like arguing with anybody especially when I play to relax my mind. But these people bring my joy from this game so down. I think Riot should do more in terms of not allowing the toxic the players take the passion from the others. What is the community thinking? Maybe I should join a team. How do I do it? Thanks for you input.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-13T23:14:42.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably every 5th or more game for me.

So what kind of people do you think that's going to attract? The lowest of lows who don't care what happens because the game is free. Even if you do get banned nothing is stopping you from creating another account.\n\nThe second point just opens things up even further. People openly admit that they don't care if you report them because it's not their main account. It's just a troll account leveled and used to stuff about at the expense of others.\n\nAlso Riots reporting system is hardly groundbreaking and they acknowledge themselves it isn't working as intended or up to standard.\n\nSo when you put it all together at the end of the day what kind of game or experience are you really expecting?","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-02-09T11:57:25.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being bronze 3, isn't great. I am trying to get better at the game and improve on my mechanics although while people tell you not to blame your team, sometimes it comes to a point where the game is out of your control, of course you could do things better but if you have a 0/10 botlane by 12 mins who are both stacking {{item:3070}}s its not going to be easy. In 75% of my games i have someone who is toxic, 30% of the time i get intent feeders, and 10% i get afks (gladly due to the remake system). And i do understand that people get tilted and flame their team (which i have actually done myself and gotten a chat ban which was actually extremely hard to play around) and i realised that its never necessary.","replies":[]}]}]}
