Passive: Ancestral stones\r\n Ancient crystals litter the map, when taric touches one of these crystals, he gains 350(+25% Armour) and a +45 movement speed buff that decays over 15 seconds. His next basic attack will deal 40% of his armour and 20% of his health* and a small burst of damage (enemys hit by the burst will be dealt the passives armour and &quot;health&quot; damage).this can be stacked up to five times. when an enemy unit walks on a gem, all the stack damage is dealt to them. when an ally walks on the gem, their next basic attack will deal 20% of their (attack damage if they are a marksman or fighter, AP if they are a mage or assasin, and health if they are a tank) and 10% of their (the beforementioned).When taric kills an enemy champion, he gains a stack.\r\n2.Q: hammer slam\r\n15 second cooldown, RANGE 675. MANA 35/45/65/75/80\r\nTaric slams into a targeted enemy unit or open space, dealing 45/65/85/135/175 attack damage to all enemy units within the 400 units.\r\n3.W: Might of the Gem Knight.\r\n10/14/16/18/22/16 COOLDOWN. 625RANGE. 125/135/145/155/142\r\nTaric heals all ally units in reach for 5%/10%/20%/22%/35% of their maximum health. all enemy units within reach are dealt -10% of their health and gain a -25% armour buff for 2 minutes.\r\nPASSIVE: Each healed unit gains +20% armour and +10% armour penetration.\r\n3.E: Gem Shot.\r\nRANGE: 475 / 1100 COST: 50 MANA. COOLDOWN: 15\r\ntaric fires a magical gem at the target which stuns them and deals 35% of tarics armor as magic damage.\r\nSTUN DURATION: 1.5/2/2.4/2.6/3\r\nPASSIVE: the stunned target is stunned for an addition second for each 25 points of armour taric has.\r\nR: Prism blast.\r\n\tRANGE: 375 / 1100 COST: 100 MANA COOLDOWN: 200\r\nTaric slams his hammer into the ground, dealing 200/300/400 (+0.3 AP) magic damage to all nearby enemies.  for the next 20 seconds, his basics attacks deal 10% of his AD.\r\n\r\n**GOOD SUMMONER SPELLS**\r\n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:12}} \r\n**GOOD ITEMS**\r\n{{item:3068}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3190}} \r\n\r\nso this rework would turn taric into a heavy duty Ganker instead of a bot lane support, he relies on gaining stacks to be effective. the highlighted &quot;Health&quot; thing means that i think health is OP, it could be changed to Attack damage, which could be more balanced.\r\nand that you could maybe change his selection quote to &quot;The gems, they call me to battle.&quot; he could say &quot;feel the gems strike!&quot; when he attacks.\r\nhe would become slightly more aggresive with his personality, instead of how relaxed he is.\r\nso this is how i think taric should be, im sorry about my punctuation errors if you notice! :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-10-18T06:17:13.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Repetoir (10/8/15):\n\"Taric's design work was actually finished early this year, but he's getting the full deal as far as updates go: model, animations, effects, sounds, lore, icons, gameplay. \nHe'll be a Sion-level rework, and he should probably come late this year or early next year. \nI did his game design work, so if you hate it when it hits PBE, feel free to let me know then.\n\nHe still has a Heal. Armour scaling ability, Armour buff and will stay a Support Tank style champion\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-18T05:27:17.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's receiving a rework sometime next year I believe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-10-18T05:00:11.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could have left him alone in the first place , he was better , and far more popular before they started changing things on him.
