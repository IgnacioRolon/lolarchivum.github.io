Darn, I've never heard of that one before!\n\nHeya! My name is Kyle, currently a bronze 2 Tristana main on an 11 win streak, And i'm looking to improve. I've been playing LoL since mid season 4, but i've started playing some ranked and i found a new love for the game. Ive never really played 20+ ranked games in an entire season before, so i really don't know where im supposed to be at. \nIf by any chance you have an hour or two open, a  coaching session or two would be hugely appreciated.\nI am available 24/7 for the next week, If that helps at all.\n\nMany Thanks","replies":[]}]}
