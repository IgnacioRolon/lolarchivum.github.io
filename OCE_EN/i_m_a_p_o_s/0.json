All 5 of us, 100% focusing him, couldn&#039;t kill him. Not only did he get away from it unscathed, but he killed multiple people.\r\n\r\nA game like this is broken when there is no way to outplay a particular champion -therefore- it&#039;s broken with mundo in his current state.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-02T23:45:28.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It’s not that their damage is higher... it’s that they survive longer enough to deal more damage","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn Bot","date":"2018-06-07T20:33:58.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrong","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-09T02:25:59.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right bud.

They are tanky. They are not tanks. They are bruisers. \n\nMaokai is a tank, leona is a tank, Nautilus is a tank, alistair is a tank. They are both tanky and have CC, lockdown and engage. They get very tanky with few items thanks to aftershock and resistance steroids.\n\nMundo isn't a tank, he builds tanky and has amazing base damage thanks to his utter lack of ratios, but he's actually more of a bruiser. Mundo also isn't really tanky until later into the game, a 8min Alistair can engage a 5man under a tower with low risk. A 8min mundo however cannot.\n\n Mundo is one of the hardest scaling bruisers in the game because earlygame, he sucks. His abilities cost health, he has few actual damage steroids, his waveclear burns through hp fast, and he has very little mobility outside of some tenacity and his ult's movespeed. Mundo loses alot of earlygame lane bully matchups hard, but he scales exceptionally well, and lategame your options to peel him boil down to a strong lockdown frontline, or hoping your carries have both the ability to cut healing as well as resistance penetration.","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn Bot","date":"2018-06-07T20:33:09.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mundo is a tank and so is garen what planet are you on","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"i m a p o s","date":"2018-06-06T06:17:02.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@clickclack472 - yup grievous wounds key item against mundo\n@mysticLlamaz - 1 mundo vs whole team and he kills 2 ppl and walks out unscathed.... dunno about that\n@Lexhanatin - my most recent games on shen don't reflect mundo matchups since i rarely take shen into that matchup. \n\nThe specific scenario i was highlighting, which has happened in several of my games, is where Mundo is in our jungle on our side of the map, by himself, with ZERO FEAR of being caught, because he can 1v5.\n\nIt wasn't a case of we were focusing the wrong target in a teamfight, it was and constantly is the case where he is the ONLY target as the rest of his team is at their fountain and all 5 of us collapse on him. Chain cc? Yup. Grievous wounds? Yup. Multiple full-damage carries? Yup. GUESS WHO WALKS OUT ALIVE?\n\nMundo. \n\nAfter killing a couple of ppl, he saunters out, unscathed. Full tank, no damage items, able to not only withstand the damage of a whole team but also kill multiple members from said team.\n\nNow in teamfights, obviously you focus their carries, not the Mundo, but... you know... when everyone is getting chunked by a pure tank .... wtf is that?!\n\nMundo has been over-tuned (and/or counterplay items are under-tuned).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexhanatin","date":"2018-06-04T00:54:40.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The counter play is don't focus mundo. Mundos job is to tank and sustain. Look to flank around and focus someone else. I play mid ekko so I'll usually try to sit in some awkward spot and wait for the team fight to start. If I see an opening I'll look to focus the priority target. Priority target is usually adc/mid, but it could also be anyone who's fed and squishy. Too difficult to label the target as it's different in every game, but It's definitely not mundo.\n\nI see you play shen. If you can't deal with mundo in laning phase, and I mean you really can't deal with him after studying the match up in depth and looking at every option, shove into tower, roam mid. If you can't gain in your lane, gain somewhere else. Steal jungle camps, help your jungler invade, force the enemy midlaers sums/recall. Idk top lane in depth, but I've played with top laners who can't gain advantages in their lane, so they come to mine creating a 2v1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-06-03T09:02:31.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they have grievous wounds?","replies":[]}]}
