But honestly i have no faith whatsoever that they will make it remotely viable in contrast to the loss of the dfg. \r\n\r\nTake ahri for example, late game she has to fish for a charm to be usefull or she cant really healp much. The dfg is what makes people respect ahri so much in the late game. she really needs that item to be able to do her job as an ASSASSIN. without it she will lose the recednt competative viability that she saw with the mana reduction and slight dmg buff to her orb of deception. \r\n\r\nNow take leblanc, no longer has a silence so throughout the whole game she has to be very careful about who she targets and be able to do her job as an ASSASSIN to be useful. without the dfg that becomes increasingly hard to do as her single target burst is while still high diminished by allot. Add that to the amount of cc most rank viable supports bring and their shields/heals.  \r\n\r\nThere are more that i could talk about but i think i have made my point. \r\n\r\nreconsider this change, \r\nSincerely any one who enjoys playing ap assassins that can actually do their job.","replies":[{"poster":"InstaLife","date":"2015-01-14T13:48:46.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Zed main (on normals) sometimes ranked on other accs  I am still waiting of the removal of Zhonyas. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gizzel AniviaGod","date":"2015-01-14T10:40:57.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like this change to see new mids. the the same trashy mids in solo q are getting old","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-14T10:29:53.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assassins is why i never touch mid \n\nunless im karthus, cause im farming from a hugh distance =D\n\nIm bias ik\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-14T08:39:10.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot likes the taste of trash people's tears. that's why they did it.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-14T10:27:04.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how does that compute? DFG was only \"over powered\" against trash...so it being in the game causes more tears to trash players than it being removed...\n\nDFG being removed REDUCES the already low number of viable AP item choices in the game...from now on i assume it will be a highly AAS/ROA dominant AP scene. which it already is because of the nuke nerfs to bigger assassins like kass and a few others who had huge burst potential with a DFG/rab route over a ROA/AAS route and are now better off with the ROA AAS items than a DFG rush.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-14T10:14:39.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait wait, they removed DFG?\n\nWTF RITO?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-14T08:30:22.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like people are just going to swap back to Syndra/Ori. fotm...","replies":[]}]}
