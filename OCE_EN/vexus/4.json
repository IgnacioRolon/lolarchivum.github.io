I will admit, the old forums had their problems, but that's not to say boards doesn't have theirs. at least forums never stopped me from posting where it wasn't out of my control.\n\ndo you know why it had more threads? because more people used it. that is the main issue. heaps of people decided not to use boards, and I honestly don't blame them.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-02T10:48:06.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clearly the issue is not that \"the boards suck\" or that \"the forums were better\".
