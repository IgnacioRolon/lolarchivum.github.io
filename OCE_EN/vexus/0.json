To me, \"Boosting\" is the act of having someone else play YOUR account to hyper-inflate the skill level of that account.\n\nDuoing with someone who is above someones skill level and hand guiding them through the elos is, to me, Not boosting. Here is why:\n\nThe Process of duoing is so that you can have some form of teamwork or communication. People may abuse this by having lower ranked accounts which they play with lower ranked people outside their duo range, but this is a basic concept of teaching/coaching. You cannot expect someone with a PhD in Maths to be trying to teach Imaginary numbers(Gold) or the Principle of Mathematical Induction(Platinum), to someone who only just barely knows their 2 times tables(Bronze). The teacher will have to use their knowledge to lower their teaching standards in such a way that the pupal can build up the core requirements/knowledge. By teaching them the theory of algebra(Silver) before Mathematical Induction(Platinum), the pupal will have a background they can fall back onto that they can use to guide their learning of higher concepts.\n\nLets say someone wants to get better at something, obviously they can either learn it the hard way and learn by mistakes and over a longer period of time, become better. \nOr\nThey can get someone that has a better understanding of the game, and teach those aspects to the learner.\n\nThe hierarchy of teacher-pupal can be applied in this instance. If the teacher is teaching them correctly, the pupal excels at the rate at which the teaching gets through to them. If the pupal does not understand the teacher, the pupal should not be able to excel. \n\nThis is the same concept of having a Plat Player teach/tell a bronze player things the bronze player should do to improve from bronze. If the bronze player excepts the teaching and applies that knowledge, then they excel past the bronze stage. However, if the player is truly bronze level, the person would not be able to climb or climb easily without first making numerous mistakes. Once the pupal has grasped the theory and application behind a certain level of thinking, they should be able to apply themselves to get to that point.\n\nThe point im trying to make here, is that your friend sounds as if he got coaching or learned vicariously when duoing rather than being Boosted. If you say that you have witnessed him climbing from gold to diamond, it would then indicate that he has the capacity to achieve that level of play through his own knowledge of the game and not that of someone else playing his account. In Summary, i think your definition of Boosting may be too broad, and what you really meant is that he got coaching/duoed and learned vicariously.\n\nTL;DR\nYour interpretation of Boosting is too Broad, your buddy didnt get Boosted, he got Coached or learned [Vicariously](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/vicarious)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-29T13:28:33.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You saw him playing his all his games? And how do you know that was him playing?\n\nIt could very well be the person that's boosting without you knowing, he may just be trying to make himself look good when really hes just trash which he probably is, you don't get from bronze to diamond just like that unless you're good. it makes no sense this all seems very fishy to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2015-01-29T15:16:13.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i did","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-29T12:39:09.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he actually git gud at some point, but that doesn't mean he did something that was allowed.\n\nHowever I ain't gonna pass judges.","replies":[]}]}
