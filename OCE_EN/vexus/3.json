If you paid any attention at all, riot stated ahri was intended to be a kite Mage when created, and the fact that she was dashin in to blow champs up before easily escaping was unsatisfactory and unbalanced. What they want is for players to juke with ahri and using her skills defensively, and as a matter of fact she deals more damage than she used to when you play her as a kiter now, due to her increased scalings. Also, if you want to be refunded simply because she got nerfed, that means you only bought her to exploit her power, and don't actually enjoy the champion design.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-30T08:14:42.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DatEpicPotato,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=tcGJoUY9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-30T07:50:21.205+0000)\n>\n> To be honest, this was not even a nerf at all, more like a **rebalance similar to viktor's rework**.\n\nViktor's changes were absolutely amazing, practically all were slight over buffs but people still don't play him much because I dunno you tell me {{champion:112}} {{item:3198}} {{item:3198}} {{item:3198}}","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-30T08:52:14.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well tbh his e was nerfed pretty hard, tho I gotta admit the rest of the changes were awesome, I still prefer one shotting people with my old e :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-01-30T02:29:51.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri was not nerfed IMO, she was rebalanced. She no longer does 20% increased damage with her Charm, but honestly the boosted damage from her Foxfire and the new accuracy make up for it right? Also, she got a MS boost when her orb is in flight so all around it is not that heavy a nerf.
