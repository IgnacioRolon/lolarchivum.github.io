That's why your first few disconnections won't issue any punishments. If you're DCing or AFKing a lot, at a certain point you have to take responsibility for the effect you are having on other players. \n\nNot to mention it's very easy to spoof an unintentional disconnection (just unplug your ethernet cable or turn off your wireless).","replies":[]}]}
