I wanted to post to miscellaneous\nForeword\nI suck at essays, if you wanted a concise and prepared set of ideas leave quickly. I am also aware I am quite a bit late to this party, I just didn&#039;t get around to it. \n**My theories on Ekko&#039;s ultimate:**\nIn order for it to just take up the ultimate space it would be a targeted ability. Target yourself and you channel the creation of a checkpoint(This gives enemies a moment to prepare). Target an enemy and you both go to your respective points, given that they were within range when you set the checkpoint. Having just the enemies cooldown and Health reset makes it seem like a lame escape rather than a properly useful skill. I suspect that ekko&#039;s cooldowns will not be reset, his health with be restored partially though. Either by means of a regeneration after the cast or a large medium (Bigger than normal medium, smaller than small large if you don&#039;t get my sizing system) heal with a debuff (Maybe until you leave combat) to max hp. If the teaser was remotely similar to his in game functionality Ekko&#039;s ultimate will also have a multicast on rewinds. \n\nI also have theories on his passive but those were mainly based on the theatrics of the teaser rather than the major focus of it. That is that Ekko actively targeted weak spots. This leads me think of the possibility of his passive being used to shut down carries rather than provide a boost to Ekko&#039;s stats.\nMy ideas on the specifics boil down to:\n-Ekko can have multiple stacks of this passive effect\n-It may only be applied to one champion\n-After being out of combat for XX seconds Ekko gains only one stack\n-Casting the ultimate grants addition stacks(He learns as he goes to try again)\n-Debuff remains until enemy leaves combat\n-Removes an of the enemy&#039;s highest stat (Calculated in the same way that no stat is given at an unfair rate of return) increasing as ekko levels and enemy stats increase. I.e an incremental increase in percentages, X%/(X+Y)%/(X+2Y)%/(X+3Y)% at levels 1/6/11/16.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-12T22:05:31.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would say its not a channel ability or else Ekko (in the vid) is fucked lol","replies":[{"poster":"TheEverydayWiz","date":"2015-05-13T10:39:42.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a long channel, just a moment to set the checkpoint.
