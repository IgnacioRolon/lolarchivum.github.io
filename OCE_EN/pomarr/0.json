I find it interesting from watching a video of a summoner running bots from a lot of computers to level up accounts and sell them for money.\nI find stupid that people cannot level up accounts legit.\n\nSecondly, I want to let you know that there are summoners who instalock certain champions every match that you mm with, for instance.\nI&#039;ve been in a summoners game about 6 times. their name is *name removed*, He &quot;mains&quot; miss fortune and instalocks her without any hesitation and will call mid when someone has already called it. he does nothing about it and just runs to mid and starts playing. MANY people have reported him yet he still hasn&#039;t been banned\nhere&#039;s a summoner profile off lolprofile\n*link removed*\n\nthank you for reading my little rant about these stupid things\n\n- Pomarr","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-11T00:10:23.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like your links were removed for naming and shaming, but I agree, it's frustrating when instalockers completely disregard their team. Maybe these instalockers should be trolled themselves. I.e. just go mid and share the lane with them and last hit better than them.\nBut seriously, lets hope draft pick stays and blind pick is removed. As for the instalocker, if Riot had a person checking them out, they would get disciplined a lot quicker than the automation will do.\nI remember there was a guy on these boards saying that they would just instalock every game to test if the automation would even discipline him at all. I forget the name, but it would be interesting to see the results.","replies":[]}]}
