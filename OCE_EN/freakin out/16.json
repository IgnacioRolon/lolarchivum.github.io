I also watched a lot of LCS over the years, so can assist you with information on building a team comp/shot calling if required.\r\n\r\nI also have a working mic.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Rephrased","date":"2016-10-05T08:31:19.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, we're creating a silver-gold Ranked 5's team.
