I also watched a lot of LCS over the years, so can assist you with information on building a team comp/shot calling if required.\r\n\r\nI also have a working mic.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"SentineI","date":"2016-10-01T12:16:31.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a jungle main and if you happen to come across a team that needs someone I'd love to","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheKupo","date":"2016-09-26T11:33:52.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey champ you still looking for a team?","replies":[]}]}
