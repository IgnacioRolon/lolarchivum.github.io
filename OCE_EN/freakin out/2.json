It was taking ages so i alt+tabbed and noticed there was a pop up box in the background not telling me the game had crashed. So i loaded the game back up and the game was 5 mins in already, so i started playing  but my game was doing something weird so i had reset it.\r\n\r\n5 mins later i rejoined the game so i was gone for about 5 mins again, but played out the remaining 20 mins of the match and at the end of the game i was given a warning for leaving a game. I don&#039;t understand how this could be the case when i played the game, and the reason i was 5 mins late to join was because your game crashed without telling me. I&#039;m also a little confused as this is probably the first game I&#039;ve &#039;left&#039; in about 3 years of playing.\r\n\r\nSo long story short, i want to know why i received this leave buster warning and why i can&#039;t queue for 5 mins when i played the game majority of the game. The majority of the time i wasn&#039;t in the game was because your game crashed in the background without telling me and i had to restart to fix it.\r\n\r\nA frustrated player,\r\nJohnny","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-03-01T12:50:37.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your placement into a low priority queue suggests that this is not the first time that this has happened. \n\nHowever, idleness that the leaver buster system detects in ranked is treated more severely in other modes, so if it was a ranked game that this happened in, that could explain the swift punishment despite not recalling any games you have left.\n\nYou can read more about the leaver buster system [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).","replies":[{"poster":"Freakin Out","date":"2016-03-01T14:46:16.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to reply to me Princess.\n\nI'm not sure whats happened, but prior to this game i was on a 7 game winning streak, so everything had been going well - Not to mention I'm not someone who 'rages' nor am i someone who would quit a game, no matter how bad it was going.\n\nAnyway, i just wanted to come on here to vent as i don't understand how i got pinned with this when I'm not a leaver, never have been.

On top of that, my 7 game winning streak also come to an end purely because the game had a popup box in the background to say the game had crashed instead of notifying me. For all i knew the game was still loading and i was simply just waiting for the match to start.\n\nOnce i got into the game the game was doing weird things so it was clear it needed a restart. so i was out of the game for 10 mins purely because the game crashed without me being notified and in turn it forced me to restart to waste even more time. I then come back to play out the remaining 32 mins.\n\nSo in short, i have done absolutely nothing wrong here, how can i be held accountable for a game failing to notify me that it had crashed while i was waiting patiently for the game to begin? Am i the only person not alt+tabbing every game on a loading screen to make sure the game is still working?\n\nI also find it disturbing that I've been found to be a fair/fun/helpful player over the years of playing this game and none of it was taken into consideration. it was simply \"clearly this player is being unsportsmen like and need to be punished.\"\n\nClearly this situation is unjust and feel it needs to be reviewed to stop it happening to other fair and honest players.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Freakin Out","date":"2016-03-01T12:22:05.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the hell, i miss 10 mins of one 42 min game due to your game crashing in the background without notifying me and i have to wait 5 mins before i can queue for the next 5 games?\n\nIs this a joke? \n\nFor starters i did nothing wrong, it was your game that crashed without notifying me while i was waiting patiently for the game to begin and secondly does my good record over the last few years mean nothing?\n\nSeriously, lift your game..","replies":[]}]}
