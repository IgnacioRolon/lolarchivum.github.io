It&#039;s as though they think their players are dummies. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, nobody is in a position to judge if having remakes is a good or bad thing, unless they know what it does to all the MMR of all the players in the game. Please tell us who gains or who losses MMR, if anyone, in a remake.\r\nIf nobodies MMR changes then the person who quit gets no real punishment. If he does lose MMR then someone must gain it, the enemy team? Lord forbid, I hope the 4 players on the remake team don&#039;t lose MMR. That would be incredibly stupid of Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-01T03:04:22.576+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the other 9 players it's like the game never happened, the only person who is losing anything is the dc/afk","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-09-01T04:41:57.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Exactly \n [No MMR changes, no LP changes, only 3 minutes of your time wasted, and a neutral grey blip in your match history. ](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake)","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-05T21:25:01.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the Remake shows as a loss on websites like op.gg if it was your team that initiated said Remake.
