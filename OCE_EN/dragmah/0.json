At least inform the people what they'll be buying into.\n\nAlso Pakenham is in the middle of no where, why are you hosting the event at such a hard to access location?? \n\nSorry to say, but i think you guys are amateurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Dragmah","date":"2019-04-29T23:17:36.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback - we are gauging interest in the event and so that we can provide our board with evidence that an event like this would actually attract an audience (they do understand eSports, like the vast majority of people). Before we lay down tens of thousands of dollars to get this event up and running I need to convince my board to approve it - hence, cannot provide you with more information on the event until I have a concrete yes.\n\nThe survey actually asks about ticket pricing - once you answer the first question (with a maybe or a yes). We chose to use this branching logic as if you would never be interested in attending an event out our way then you would never pay for it. Happily accept your feedback if you believe we should remove the branching logic and ask everyone to answer all questions - was trying to save some people time.\n\nYes, Pakenham 50KM out of Melbourne city, but still part of Melbourne metropolitan area - and has its own train station which is walking distance to our proposed event. We are actually within the Casey Council and Cardinia Shire regions, which actually accounts for 8% of Victoria's total population - so although you might think it is in the middle of nowhere, there is more than enough people around to warrant an event of this nature out our way.\n\nI can appreciate your view that we are amateurs. This would be our first eSports event BUT not our first major event. We had a festival just last weekend with just over 30,000 in attendance over 2 days. We run regular events of this nature, from generic sporting events to music festivals and community engagement.\n\nI would love to hear any further feedback you have on how we can assure you of our capacity to deliver an event of this nature, and have even updated the survey to include a feedback section at the end - where you can identify this conversation and I can reach out to you personally and seek your advice - if you wanted that.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-04-30T09:05:10.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Before we lay down tens of thousands of dollars to get this event up and running I need to convince my board to approve it - hence, cannot provide you with more information on the event until I have a concrete yes.\n\nAdvertise the type of activities that will be available. On the survey, all i see is  you asking for $$$$. But still, what am i buying into. Are the seat comfortable? What else is there to do, aside from watching an esport cinema experience,  ETC...\n\n> which actually accounts for 8% of Victoria's total population - so although you might think it is in the middle of nowhere, there is **more than enough people around** to warrant an event of this nature out our way.\n\n1st. It doesn't seem like you are catering for people that is from the outer state. \n\n2nd. I don't mean out of no where as in,there isn't enough employees to run the operation. I meant, why should people go out of their way to an area with insufficient points of interest. And if it is interesting, i don't see any of it being mentioned.\n\n3rd. If the 8% you're referring to as potential customer. Then i would have to tell you the numbers of people that play league wouldn't made up 1% of it, and those that would even go the above and beyond to attend the event is even less.\n\n4th. Read some marketing tips. Make your product attractive, then ask for people's interest and THEN $$$. \n\nAll you are doing is hoping league as a game will sell itself. I haven't seen anything worth buying at this point.\n\n>  We had a festival just last weekend with just over 30,000 in attendance over 2 days.\n\nCite some source please. I'll look forward to reviewing it. 30,000 IN ATTENDANCE. wow. Am impress \"If it is true\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2019-04-30T02:48:43.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragmah.
