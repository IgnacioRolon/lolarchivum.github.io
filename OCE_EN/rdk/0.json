I also ping lane roams and objectives, I get harassed for seeing tower opportunity and helping push the wave and killing it, I get ignored when being invaded at a bad time by the enemy jungle that should result in a free kill for us or invading at a good time that should be a free kill/free exp and gold steal for us. I can&#039;t question people in or after the game because they just default to calling me toxic, trolling or harassing and that just frustrates me to the point of actually being toxic so I am asking here. Why do most of you refuse to play as a team? I feel like people don&#039;t identify things within the game and play accordingly even when someone else on their team identifies it and communicates it. It's like hardly anyone actually wants to try.. somehow in top 5% of players on this server and everyone is basically still low silver level, probably why our competitive scene is a joke compared to other regions whose competitive scenes are still somewhat jokes compared to the best teams in the world.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2017-06-17T07:48:17.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of what you are describing comes down to a toxic \"I must carry\" mindset.

Even someone who has a really good KDA I feel like can be lacking a lot sometimes - all applies to myself aswell. Have to say I feel like I'm aligned with that second link.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-17T07:48:01.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may not be in the top 5%, but what I do is type \"*name of jgler* top side\" or mid or bot side, whenever a ward catches them, or I know they're aren't in one place (i.e. when I'm their top jungle with everything still spawned), or sometimes if they've backed and I know they just cleared bot-side and top is very pushed. *This seems to work, since my team play safer or back off*.\n\nAlso, when I go for a tower after a gank, I spam ping it and, if the laner makes no effort to help me push and take tower, I tax and push the lane myself and get the tower anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"RDK","date":"2017-06-17T08:03:35.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Percival9,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=2Rw2tH3P,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-17T07:48:01.857+0000)\n>\n> I may not be in the top 5%, but what I do is type &quot;*name of jgler* top side&quot; or mid or bot side, whenever a ward catches them, or I know they&#x27;re aren&#x27;t in one place (i.e. when I&#x27;m their top jungle with everything still spawned), or sometimes if they&#x27;ve backed and I know they just cleared bot-side and top is very pushed. *This seems to work, since my team play safer or back off*.\n> \n> Also, when I go for a tower after a gank, I spam ping it and, if the laner makes no effort to help me push and take tower, I tax and push the lane myself and get the tower anyway.\n\nI type it often too - but I try not to type because people tend to clash in the stressful environment, myself included.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-17T08:38:09.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"An actual [summary](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/5-habits-of-stupid-people-that-smart-people-don-t-have-a7620941.html) of everything below diamond.","replies":[]}]}
