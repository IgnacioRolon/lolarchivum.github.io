(I do have a little bit more sensitive eyes than most people, but still)\n* The sounds are even more obnoxious than the previous client. I hated the old sounds, this is even worse.\n* It is difficult to find your way around, I found where everything is without problem but it has downgraded from simplicity to an over fancy mess.\n* It is lagged, a couple times I have gone to ban a champion, clicked the wrong one, then clicked on the champion I want to ban, hit the ban button and it will ban the first champion I clicked on, would hate for it to happen when I was picking a champion.\n* It hurts no one to have item sets while it does hurts people to delete them, they help me shop insanely quick and spend time looking at the map while I am healing up instead of sometimes standing in the fountain for 5 seconds trying to find an item which is especially bad if you are already fully healed up.\n\nCompare the forums to the client, dark but it goes without the super bright and overlapping bits which makes it not eye straining at all. This is not a friendly interface for me at all.","replies":[]}
