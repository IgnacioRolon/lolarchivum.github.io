The losing team tends to miss out on gold and experience while the winning team has a lot more room to gain gold and expeirence which creates a snowball effect **even when the losing team is playing correctly**.  I think this should be changed so that the weak instead of falling further behind have the ability to stay at the level they are behind the opponents when they are playing correctly.\n\nI believe this is where the majority of toxicity comes from so it could make the game healthier. People will still make mistakes and games will still snowball but it won&#039;t feel so hopeless if you are playing well when behind so less people will subconsciously and consciously give up.\n\nI am just making this post to bring awareness to the issue, the real number, map and other changes I have no clue about. I am not saying that the current way the game and ladder is doesn't work - it does work, just not as good as it could.\n\n**The correct way to play is to have the idea that there is no such thing as aggressive or passive, there is a way to minimise risk and still gain leads by playing off your opponents mistakes and not making any mistakes of your own. It&#039;s all about knowing everything you can and using it to determine what you do, taking advantage of the smallest oversteps, not overstepping yourself and executing it perfectly.**","replies":[{"poster":"RDK","date":"2016-12-28T04:56:22.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one agrees or disagrees?","replies":[]}]}
