NO PRIOR QUEUE IN BOTS","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last week i was playing a bot match because i was bored. Within 4mins of playing, my client disconnected. When i reconnected, it said that i have been off for a prolonged period and i got prior queue......... in bots. We shouldn&#039;t get banned from bot games because we are not playing against real people and without one person you can still win the match in bots.... very easily.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T10:27:44.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xXODINXx,\n\nWhile I can understand that it may be frustrating waiting 20 minutes before a game to start playing; however, it's less about a team being able to win without you, and moreso that you negatively impacted a match. Players aren't given Low Priority Queue for single instances of disconnects/AFKing, but rather for multiple instances. If you have any technical issues, you're more than free to come into the Help & Support sub-boards and we'll work with you to resolve any issues you may be encountering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shroom","date":"2015-12-09T08:52:54.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel  man.
