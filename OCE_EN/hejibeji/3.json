It isn't healthy and I think we all know it.\n\nIf you want to make the most of your games and push your performance up:\n\n1) Sleep. The amount you need differs from person to person. But if you're only getting 7 hours (which is a lot to some people) and feeling groggy during the day, up that number. You can also feel terrible after too much sleep, usually more than 8.5 hours will do that. If so, bring the amount of hours down bit by bit till you find what works for you.\nIt's also important to note, that if your bedtime and wake-up time change from day to day (or you just stay up way later on weekends, like me) then you'll always feel tired. I highly recommend fixing that if it's the case. I'm still trying but sleep discipline is not something I was raised with and it's hard to form the habit. When I can achieve it, I feel great.\nI don't have the data to back it up, but I do recall reading a post on Reign of Gaming (RIP) by someone who had been tracking their sleep patterns against their win rate for a while, and it did point towards more sleep translating into more wins.\n\n2) Take breaks, get up and leave your computer desk. Do some chores, workout, go for a walk/run. Gaming for long periods can really sap your energy, and if you know you should be exercising or getting work done but you use all the available time for gaming it can leave you feeling pretty miserable in my experience. You'll feel way better in game if you get up and spend some time out of game every couple of hours.\n[Someone did the stats](https://www.datallamalol.com/analysis4) on how long you should break for in between games to maximize your win rate. TL;DR:\n- if you lose, take a 20-30 min break\n- if you win, play again immediately\n- if you've won 3 games in a row, take a 20-30 min break to reset or you'll start playing on auto-pilot. It does argue that your 4th game will be almost as good as your 2nd, but if you feel like you need a break then you should take one.\n\n3) Follow Matsuzaka544's advice and drink water. You don't have to force yourself to drink a ton at a time. It's as simple as keeping a bottle of water on your desk, and you'll be surprised how often you take a sip and get through the bottle without it being a hassle. I'm not saying you can't have a soda or something else at the same time either, I just recommend not using it to quench your thirst to avoid those sugar highs and lows. Consider anything not water to be a treat rather than a thirst quencher.\n\nNow that I've publicly stated it, I should probably start taking my own advice. I struggle with (1), am getting better at (2), and have been doing (3) for years.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GreasedLightning","date":"2018-08-22T02:44:54.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know waters gona be a big reply here but can i just say ICE COLD, if you can handle that i know some ppl dont like it but it wakes you up forces your body to generate heat(increases metabolic rate/energy consumption) but if you have eaten enough energy is not the problem alertness is. sitting still makes our body go to sleep, ice cold water wakes it up\ndisclaimer just my opinion, works for me, no actual research done here","replies":[]},{"poster":"LORDCRUSHINGT0N","date":"2018-08-19T12:31:03.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Caffeine for the weak","replies":[{"poster":"LORDCRUSHINGT0N","date":"2018-08-19T12:32:10.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and who has a marathon gaming session with league ???????????","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-19T06:22:49.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alcohol","replies":[{"poster":"Hejibeji","date":"2018-08-19T06:27:06.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesnt that make u play worst?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-19T08:13:13.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hejibeji,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=J41hqqHY,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-19T06:27:06.417+0000)\n>\n> Doesnt that make u play worst?\n\nMakes me play better, and calms my nerves so i can 1v5 as illaoi no problems :^)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-08-19T06:47:19.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long are you planning to stay awake and playing game?","replies":[{"poster":"Hejibeji","date":"2018-08-19T07:00:23.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe just like a 4-5hour session....? haha xD","replies":[]}]}]}
