I&#039;d like to know why Riot believes players deserve to not only be demoted but to have their mmr drastically lowered if their teammates disconnect or feed. I now lose 25 points for losses, regardless of whether there was anything I could have done, and gain only 10 points for wins, regardless of how well I do. This removes much of my incentive to even play the game and it truly seems like Riot enjoys creating toxicity. Is there something I can do about this, or is it genuinely my fault if my marksman flashes into the enemy team, dies, and costs us the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-30T03:58:31.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what happens when you get boosted then decide to keep playing ranked...","replies":[{"poster":"The Dust Lord","date":"2015-03-30T04:07:36.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daejel,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EIbeFHty,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-03-30T03:58:31.481+0000)\n>\n> That's what happens when you get boosted then decide to keep playing ranked...\n\nAre you implying I paid someone to play on my account?","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-31T20:29:08.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why's your MMR so unbelievably horrible then?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-28T19:12:56.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, it's Riot's fault that you're bad at this game.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dust Lord","date":"2015-03-28T19:40:29.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daejel,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EIbeFHty,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-28T19:12:56.218+0000)\n>\n> Yep, it's Riot's fault that you're bad at this game.\n\nWhy do you think I'm bad?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-29T01:41:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dropped 7 divisions.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dust Lord","date":"2015-03-29T17:24:54.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EIbeFHty,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-03-29T01:41:44.513+0000)\n>\n> You dropped 7 divisions.\n\nSo I don't get any credit for rising to Gold, but I'm awful if I get demoted back to Silver? \n\nSidenote, I'm back in Gold already because I started getting competent teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-29T23:40:14.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too confident in your own ability and blaming bad team mates for losing, classic bronzie attitude.

But the reason I win those games is not because I landed the hook but because my teammates decide to follow up after I landed it. When they do nothing, my effort is meaningless.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-28T09:11:32.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito confirmed this season was gonna be really hard.\n\nYour MMR is wait for it...                             http://i.imgur.com/7tusIzp.png\n\n> Welcome to ELO hell","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-28T06:59:18.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Gold 3 to Silver 5\n\nYou dropped 3 divisions straight, I don't think it's entirely the system's fault, I doubt it is even half the culprit.\n\nSince you know, when you get d/c's the enemies get them too (not to mention enemies have more chances of getting d/c if you're not the one dropping out mid match), unless you're just that unlucky then oh well. \n\nIt's an online game, the company can not physically force everyone to stay once a match is started or check their net prior to play, it's just not possible. Then you have a few other factors in play, like their computer/router codition, the launcher's condition, the server's condition, the ISP's condition and the fact the match has 10 complete strangers from different places connecting to this one single match, therefore disconnections is and should be expected in solo queue.\n\nThis is why solo queue is half grind and half skill, and it's no surprise nor is it Riot's fault, it is just that way when you have a team game with solo queue. The grind portion is made up by d/cs, rage quits, trolls etc.\n\nIf you wanna avoid the grind bit completely, play 5s.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-28T08:15:54.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You dropped 3 divisions straight\n\nI think you miscounted.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-28T08:35:44.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're correct, my mind fked up and thought it goes like this from low to high S5=>G1=>G2=>G3.\n\nSo yes, he actually dropped 7 if I am not wrong again.\n\nOh well, I can say that I was just trying not to be too harsh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-03-28T06:54:03.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is funnelling out all the weak minded who cant stop themselves from ______.
