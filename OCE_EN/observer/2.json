{"poster":"Observer","date":"2016-03-13T11:13:24.143+0000","title":"Overpaying for Merch from the Merch store?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So,  \n\nSeveral days ago, the &quot;Might Braum Bundle&quot; went on sale. Naturally as a fan of the game I was excited to purchase it, but upon reviewing the checkout screen I found this:  \nhttp://i.imgur.com/2eM8trh.png  \n&quot;Tax and Duty&quot; to be paid was almost equivalent to the amount the bundle was worth. Tax and duty is paid to the country that the item is being brought into, and in my case, **New Zealand**.  \n\nIn accordance to [this website](http://www.customs.govt.nz/features/charges/feetypes/Pages/default.aspx?s=21), clothing incurs a 10% rate and toys at 5% (assuming the Figure and plushie fall under &quot;toys&quot;), but lets give Riot the benefit of the doubt and label the bundle as a &#039;clothing&#039;, so 10% duty, or 3.30 USD. Nowhere near the amount requested.  \n\nBut wait, there&#039;s more! [New Zealand Customs will waive collecting Tax and Duty if the amount to be paid to Customs is less than 60 NZD (~40.47 USD)](http://www.customs.govt.nz/features/internetshopping/Pages/tipsforinternetshopping.aspx). Since 3.30 USD is less than 40.47 USD, I don&#039;t have to pay jack for Tax and Duty for this bundle, but yet **they&#039;re charging me how much for &quot;Tax and Duty&quot;? 28.40 USD.**  \n\nWorried that other Kiwis may blindly order this and overpay for this bundle, I lodged a ticket through the Support system but so far their response has been irrelevant to the problem at hand:   \n\n> Thank you for contacting us about this. This may be due to the fact that we are required to report an actual value of the goods being shipped and not just the amount you pay for them, which would put the value of the shipment over 60 NZD. I am currently investigating to verify if that is the case, and I will let you know once I have more information.  \n\nOnce again, **NZ Customs charges waives duty if the _duty charged_ is under 60 NZD**, not if the item&#039;s worth is under 60 NZD.  \nBetween this time, I checked my checkout again about a couple of days ago and noticed the Tax and Duty has changed.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/wIHivUC.png  \n\nHowever at this point, I am more for the point of the principle that I should not have to pay for &quot;Tax and Duty&quot; when New Zealand Customs does not demand for it to be paid for this item, along with the question of who is pocketing ~~28.40~~ 10.75 USD.  \n\nAt this point I have left a response for Riot Games Support through their email response system, but I have not heard from them since, hence my posting on these boards. Hopefully someone in the know can address the relevant people in this situation, or at least allow me to understand where the &#039;Tax and Duty&#039; is being paid to.\n\nKind regards,  \nObserver\n\nTL;DR:-  \nBeing overcharged for &quot;The Mighty Braum Bundle&quot; in &#039;Tax and Duty&#039; at the checkout, when the delivery nation does not charge &#039;Tax and Duty&#039; for the price bracket the bundle falls under.

A few days ago, when I tried to order a couple of hoodies on their gear store, it showed me the tax would be around 20% of the total price, which is so ridiculous. And their support just said it was about to be correct, then closed my ticket. :)  Great, the only way to solve this is not to shop there.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-21T23:14:27.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!

Beyond this, I can't provide an ETA or any additional information as these aren't pieces of information that I'm privy to at this time. If you have any further concerns, please do not hesitate to let me know and I'll do my best to follow up. \n\nWuks","replies":[{"poster":"Observer","date":"2016-03-14T06:54:01.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given the situation, if I order the bundle as is right now, and lodge a ticket would it be possible to get reimbursed for any overcharging later on?

My suggestion would be to keep trying with support (but don't add to the ticket until someone responds cause it'll drop you back to the bottom of the queue, creating a new ticket will do the same) and wait till the last day of the bundle if you can. \n\nSee if you can't work it out with support before then, and if you can't, they might be able to reimburse you with RP or something but I wouldn't count on it. Basically, hope but don't expect in that regard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
