So to counter this conflict I had an idea of a Hide n seek where there are no winning teams. \r\n\r\nIt sounds pretty weird, but I think it&#039;ll work out. The idea is, that there is no death cap for the hiders. The only goal is to play til 40 minutes and have fun. This would remove the competitive feeling of the game, and create a more relaxed, fun, and calm feeling. So when you feel like having a soothing game of Hide n seek after a lame game of Normals, you don&#039;t have to deal with the constant stress of arguments within the chat, trolls, and people who haven&#039;t  had a good day.  \r\n\r\nThis also encourages people to try out new champs for hide n seek, and for more funnier and stupid plays for you to laugh at, knowing it will have no effect on your deaths. \r\n\r\nIf you agree with this concept, please upvote and try this out in custom games! I am going to be hosting a few of these if I have the time.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR - No death cap on hiders, for a more fun game without fights and stress.**","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2015-05-31T13:10:43.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll still play Hide & Seek with a death limit, but this is a good idea, as some people are just so wound up from normals (from that marksman that is allergic to dark passage or teemo that lets nasus get 500 stacks before 10 minutes) and don't even feel like hide and seek, I'll have to bring this one out!\n\nMy friends and I have all agreed that we bend the rules to make it more fun and fairer for everyone, depending on the situation. e.g. let the guy who got out at 10 minutes have another few lifes, it's better than him trolling for the next half an hour!","replies":[]}]}
