If anyone knows how to get rid of this, please post. Thanks\n\nEDIT: I think it has something to do with Suprasavings or something similar","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-01-03T07:07:02.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AdBlock.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-03T06:49:53.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look through your chrome extensions, if there's anything you don't recognise then go into 'programs and features' in control panel and delete that sh!t (alternatively use system restore). Best to check in 'programs and features' for anything you don't recognise anyway (which it seems you are already doing). I don't know if it would work but you could try re-installing chrome. If all else fails you could try restoring your comp to factory settings (wiping everything other than what it came with) but I seriously doubt you'd want to do that.","replies":[{"poster":"Gummyjacob","date":"2015-01-03T07:01:06.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I uninstalled a few programs and I think it worked.
