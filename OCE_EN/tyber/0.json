Every time I am in a match, any kind, I will be stuck attempting to reconnect for 5-60 seconds or permanently until I disconnect and reconnect. When I have these issues my ping is fine at around a stable 30ms. I suspect it may be something to do with packet loss or the league servers itself as I have absolutely no issues with other games and programs. For example after the game where I disconnected at least a solid 7 times, I played a game of counter strike with no lag at all, I suspected that my ping was normal again so I played another game of league and to my surprise, I was constantly timing out again. I have tried using the fix tool and reinstalling but nothing seems to help.\n\nIf anyone has a solution please link me to the thread\ncheers.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-11-04T06:24:24.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
