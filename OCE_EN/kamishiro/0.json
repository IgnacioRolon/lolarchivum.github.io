Players who do manage to reach a perma-ban tend to have an extremely low reform rate (about 1%, if I'm not mistaken), and as a result it's far from practical for Riot to revoke perma-bans. You can feel free to appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option), but that will only result in a change if the punishment was issued in error, which I would doubt is the case here.\n\nI think you'll understand it's reasonably self evident which parts of the logs are problematic, but generally things like insulting team mates, consistent negative attitude, \"name and shame\" type mentalities, and threatening reports/bans are all behaviours that can contribute to a punishment, and if this is what your logs usually look like then the ban is likely to stand.\n\nIf you are having difficulty in taking steps towards reforming, you can always look for help from people all around you. You can feel free to ask for help on these boards, and I'm sure several people will be happy to provide advice that may be helpful for you. It'll likely be a tough task, but I think it's safe to say you'll start feeling a lot better in yourself after you've made some progress.","replies":[]}]}
