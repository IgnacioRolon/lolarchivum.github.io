Certainly a lot of us have felt the sting of performing as good as can be expected and still having to swallow the negative LP and having some kind of buffer that would reduce that for performing better is definitely appealing...\n\nI think the biggest problem now that I think about it is this: If it looks like my team is losing but I've been playing well so far, it would incentivise me to actually avoid helping the rest of my team. If I tried to make risky plays and joined every team fight it might ruin my KDA ( and my mastery score). It becomes better for me to just farm an empty lane and keep a low death count. \n\nCould be an over-reaction but it's the kind of thing you have to think about in terms of trying to promote team play as much as possible, especially with a team that's losing (meaning potentially salty/aggro players).","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-08-11T06:03:51.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're saying, but I believe that this proposed system would work much better than the current one in place, just because if you have a low kill participation your grade will still not be as good as normal, making your LP lost be still even, and every system could use some tweaks, if you have any suggestions don't hesitate to add them.","replies":[{"poster":"CptFurious","date":"2015-08-11T06:41:08.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a system that took into account a whole bunch of factors would be interesting. If it was a combined score based on your mastery score, how close the game was, what the rank of other players in the game was, wether you were on a loss/win streak - and came up with a modifier from that.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-08-11T12:01:49.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, like the gold count and times the towers were taken. I mean the system could be improved amazing amounts, I suppose it's limited just by how Riot can code it. I hope to see an improvement in the LP system however.","replies":[{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-08-17T13:54:47.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had an idea a couple of weeks ago that involved small increases of LP(like 4) for having the highest wards placed and wards destroyed, damage dealt, healing done, objectives taken and so on but only for your team so you are not competing against a winning team that should actually be doing more. just so you can soften the blow of lp loss from say like 25 and if you get 2 awards can lower it to say 17 for example and if your team wins go from 25 to 31 cuz you gotten 2 awards as well. \n\nhope this makes sense but yea on small bonuses","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"i am not noob","date":"2015-08-17T11:48:24.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only this were to happen :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptFurious","date":"2015-08-11T06:57:04.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy also had some interesting ideas: \nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iFdEkXnp-riot-oce-update-and-qa?comment=002700000000","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-10T19:57:07.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good play is reflected in a good winrate in the longrun, basing LP gains on anything other than win/loss is pointless. If you think it would be beneficial its probably because you're better than average at the more noticable things like laning/farming/mechanics and worse than average at the less obvious aspects of the game like decision making/map movements/interaction with teammates, which also contribute heavily towards actually winning games.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-08-11T06:06:21.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that, currently I am on a 10 ranked win streak from Silver 5.
