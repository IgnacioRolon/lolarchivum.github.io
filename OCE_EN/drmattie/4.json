Mana Cost and CD stay the same.\r\n                 Blind Time: 1/1.25/1.5/2\r\n\r\nReasoning: Teemo&#039;s blind has long been one of the most hated abilities of him, with these changes involved it would make him less of a dominating top laner, while still having his late game damage. Giving the ability a skill shot also increases the skill cap you need to play him, also it allows for him to be able to be countered by dodging and kiting, which would make all ADC mains happy. Also decrease the blind time because generally late game when you get hit by a Teemo blind he has the ability to burst you down before you have a chance to Auto Attack.\r\n\r\nE: (Passive): Teemo&#039;s AA&#039;s Deal Magic Damage on hit and overtime.\r\n\r\nChanges: Damage Over Time: 5/10/16/22/30 (10%AP) \r\n                  Impact Damage: 7/19/26/37/50 (27%AP)\r\n                  Duration: 3 Seconds\r\nReasoning: Teemo&#039;s poison allows him to be able to still kill his targets even after his death, much like a mini-ignite, much to people&#039;s hate. These new changes tone down the damage over time and the impact damage, however also decreases the duration, making it less likely for low health targets to be saved by a last minute heal. The changes to his poison still make him viable and only decrease the damage minimally. The decrease of the damage also lowers his early game poke making it easier for champions to farm and not have to back every five seconds.\r\n\r\nR: Ultimate: Teemo places a mushroom trap on the ground for 10 minutes, which stealths and arms after 1 second. While armed, the traps grant vision in a 212.5-radius.\r\n\r\nChanges: Magic Damage Per Second: 35/78/108,5 (+11.5%AP)\r\nDuration: 4 Seconds\r\nShroom Timer: 4 Minutes\r\nSlow: 20/30/40%\r\n\r\nReasoning: Teemo&#039;s shrooms are always the most feared trap on the map, with their long duration, high damage and high slow. The fact that they last ten minutes to me is absurd. Nerfing the amount of damage, duration and slow percentage allows people to roam around freely especially since the limit on pink wards was rolled out it really made teemo a very optimal pick. \r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this, sorry about format errors this is my first time in the suggestions page.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-26T12:59:26.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Q: ACTIVE: Teemo shoots a dart at an enemy, dealing magic damage and Blind icon blinding them for a few seconds.\nChanges: 60/110/170/215/250 (+70% AP) Also Ability is a skillshot with 600 range. Mana Cost and CD stay the same.\nBlind Time: 1/1.25/1.5/2\n\nOk, since this is a blind ability I'm going to compare it to the only other blind ability in-game: Quinn's Blinding Assault.\n\nFirst off, damage. You have Teemo's 60/110/170/215/250 (+70% AP) on a single target skillshot vs Quinn's 70/110/150/190/230 (+ 65% bonus AD)(+ 50% AP) AOE Skillshot. Lets just assume they both have 2 items with the highest AP/AD respectively and calculate total damage from there. That means Teemo hits for 418, before defences, on one target and Quinn hits for 334, before defences, on one target *but* will usually hit 2-3 if used correctly meaning damage is 668-1002, before defences. Teemo 0, Quinn 1.\n\nNext, range. You have Teemo's 600 units vs Quinn's 1025 units, and Quinn's hits multiple targets (as many as 5 enemy champions for a well placed shot). Mind you this is reduced to 0 when Tag Team is active, but that's 20 seconds, at most, every 80+ seconds **after** level 5. Teemo 0, Quinn 2.\n\nDuration. I'm going to assume you meant it to be \"1/1.25/1.5/**1.75**/2\" rather than what is stated. So you have Teemo's 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 vs Quinn's 1.5 which, for early ranks, goes to Quinn but comes out for Teemo in later ranks **but**, and I am bringing this up again, Quinn's is AOE. Teemo 0, Quinn 3.\n\nCooldown. You have Teemo's 8 seconds vs Quinn's 11/10/9/8/7 seconds which, for early ranks, goes to Teemo but Quinn's actually reduces *and* becomes less than Teemo's. Teemo 0, Quinn 4.\n\nAnd then we come to mana cost. For all these nerfs you want Teemo's Blinding Dart to cost 70/80/90/100/110 mana while Quinn is down in bot lane laughing about her 50/55/60/65/70 mana for her *AOE* blind. Teemo 0, Quinn 5.\n\nHonestly, I have no issue with Teemo's Blinding Dart being changed but you have to consider that the ability still needs to be comparable with others of the like which, with the changes you've suggested, it isn't. As it is now though it has it's advantages over Quinn's Blinding Assault.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-26T21:10:39.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make a fair point, the main reason I just want Teemo's dart to be changed is just so we can stop it being a lock on ability that just counters all ADC's, Thank's for your criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-27T00:06:48.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"daveeyx","date":"2015-05-26T11:55:47.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I don't think Teemo is overpowered at all, he's just a situational pick. When he _is_ played he's picked to lane counter the enemy and that's why you'll often find Teemo wins games especially at lower elos, but honestly, he's pretty easy to counter.","replies":[{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-26T21:13:21.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose you are right, I just have really big problems with his shroom time and the fact the blinding dart isn't a skillshot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-26T11:07:51.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But teemo isnt op? so these changes arent to balance?
