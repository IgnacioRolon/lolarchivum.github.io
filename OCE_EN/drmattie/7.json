He does do giveaways regularly, viewer games. He is currently Plat 1 and  was diamond 5 in the preseason. He speaks to his viewers unlike many big streamers that ignore chat. It would be appreciated if we could show some love. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"duckyy","date":"2015-02-10T09:01:42.053+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the post man, couldn't do it without you guys ","replies":[]}]}
