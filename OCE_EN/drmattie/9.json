Whilst I was originally loading in my client crashed and said I wasn&#039;t connected to the internet, rapidly I clicked rejoin hoping to be able to get in and not be behind in laning phase. HOWEVER after it taking about 6 minutes for it to load me to 100% it then again came up with the same error message. Feeling extremely frustrated at this point I restart my LoL, bare in mind that I&#039;m using google and skype at the same time so it is not my connection. \r\n\r\nAnyhow after taking about 15 minutes for me to be able to click the reconnect button it actually worked. I start playing 20 minutes in and everything was going fine I was farming catching up, however every 1-5 seconds My FPS would drop to about 3. After about 5 minutes of this my game crashed, giving me a bug splat. Following this I restart my client and try to reconnect however it says the game is already done, so I get to the end of lobby screen and what&#039;s this. 20 MINUTES low priority queue for 5 games, for something the CLIENT caused.  This has happened to me before and it always the same message popping up and the results are almost always the same, low priority and a pissed off Mattie.\r\n\r\nRiot Please Fix Your Shit Because I Cannot Deal With Waiting Again.\r\n\r\nRant Over.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-27T09:41:09.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]}
