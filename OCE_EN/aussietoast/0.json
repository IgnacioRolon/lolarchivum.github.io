Of course to fit the same amount of info into a poem that is in a novel you're going to need more pages, or in the case of lol take up more of the screen space (old HUD) but thats much better than having important info being difficult to read. \n\nalso the monotone blue of the menus, HUD and minimap make it feel like there is a haze over the entire screen and it actually is very uncomfortable on the eye.\n\noverall the new HUD is visually more appealing, but the old one is much better for readability and accessibility of information.\n\nso it just comes down to Form over Function. or Function over Form, whichever you prefer, \n\nobviously RIOT prefers the Form over function option, which is very good on skins and VU's etc but when its information, i think readabiltiy is key.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-23T13:07:04.260+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WLkYWigq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-07-23T10:16:07.029+0000)\n>\n> I am a graphic designer and this is my unbiased opinion:\n> \n> overall the new HUD is visually more appealing, but the old one is much better for readability and accessibility of information.\n> \n> so it just comes down to Form over Function. or Function over Form, whichever you prefer, \n> \n> obviously RIOT prefers the Form over function option, which is very good on skins and VU's etc but when its information, i think readabiltiy is key.\n\nTotally agree. I prefer function over Form. If you want form, buy skins,  and leave it at that. I heard today that people on 4k monitors find it straining their eyes also.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Master Namer","date":"2015-07-23T18:26:02.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything you just said in cons will be fixed by time and is in the cons section because you havent given it time to settle in...\n\nGive it time.
