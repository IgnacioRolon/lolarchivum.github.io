The issue I have is that I went to order it but after getting onto Paypal I had to deal with dogs going crazy. I came back after a while after finally settling them down and Paypal had refreshed so didn&#039;t have the order.\r\nI then went to order the hoodie again and couldn&#039;t because it said it was already redeemed. It isn&#039;t in my shopping cart or order history and I have checked my Paypal and it hasn&#039;t come up as paid through it or in that history.\r\n\r\nI have seen a few other posts about this issue and should be rectified asap.\r\n\r\nI can provide screenshots if it helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-12T09:50:54.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a support ticket and if they ask for a picture or something then please do so.
