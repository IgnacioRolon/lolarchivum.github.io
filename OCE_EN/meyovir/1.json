It's the only way you'll improve.

If you do, even Silver/high-Bronze players will outclass you (not to mention flame the heck out of you), and you'll quickly end up in Bronze V with a garbage win-rate, after which you'll fill the Boards with posts complaining about how unfair matchmaking is, or that you get trolls every game, etc.\n\nA little tip: typing \"**/muteall**\" in chat is 100% effective against being flamed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI just looked at your OP.GG... Almost your entire match-history is *Intro Coop vs AI*. Not even Beginner or Intermediate Bots. The games you did play PvP were completely bad. You were averaging around  1-2 CS/min as an ADC and just spent your games feeding. **You are 100% NOT ready for Ranked**.\n\nThere's also the fact you are rarely, if ever, taking Flash, which is a core Summoner spell on almost every champion, and your item builds are all over the place.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince you like Xayah {{champion:498}} , I'm guessing you're thinking of perhaps playing ADC? There are lots of coaching videos online that would really help (for ADC, I would strongly recommend **xFSN Saber** on YouTube).\n\nBut, personally, given that you have no PvP experience, I think these videos might be a bit out of your comfort zone.\n\nFor a proper build with items, runes and Summoner spells, check out OP.GG or Champion.gg and search up \"Xayah\" {{champion:498}} . It would also be helpful to look up some Xayah guides to see how she is meant to be played.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Also, I'll say this again...

You should be warding almost on cooldown at first until you develop an understanding of where and when you need vision. Buy a control ward each back if you can.\n\nTry to get into the habit of checking the minimap whenever you have a second free; with the vision you got earlier you should be able to see ganks coming.\n\nTry to get used to your opponents' lane habits - if they've been playing passive then suddenly start going aggressive on you that's a good sign there's a gank on the way.","replies":[]}]}
