It counts as a projectile and the raising from the ground you see is just the animation. Same with azir sand soldier they are coded as projects. Same reason why braums unbreakable will stop Taliyah’s ult. Now the reason wind wall doesn’t stop final spark is because it’s not coded as a projectile but it’s coded as a beam. That goes that full distance instantly. Same reason why xerath q and vel’koz ult won’t be stoped by wind wall. They are beams, not projectiles.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSteel","date":"2018-07-27T00:43:06.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your saying is that beams or not projectiles \nSo that would make sense for {{item:3146}} as well?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-07-27T03:16:49.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackSteel,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mjoAzZNe,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-07-27T00:43:06.492+0000)\n>\n> So what your saying is that beams or not projectiles \n> So that would make sense for {{item:3146}} as well?\n\nAs far as I’m aware gunblade is coded as a beam so yes wind wall can’t block it.  As for azir soldiers I’m pretty sure that they can attack through wind wall. But they can’t move through wind wall when using azir q. As for why is because wind wall is coded to stop moving abilities and that’s what the soldiers are when you use your q","replies":[{"poster":"BlackSteel","date":"2018-07-27T06:23:41.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What i am trying to say that it might be coded that why but why?\nWhen {{champion:268}} q's forward, why is that a projectile? \nWhy is it coded as one?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-07-27T06:38:12.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackSteel,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mjoAzZNe,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2018-07-27T06:23:41.955+0000)\n>\n> What i am trying to say that it might be coded that why but why?\n> When {{champion:268}} q&#x27;s forward, why is that a projectile? \n> Why is it coded as one?\n\nYour asking the wrong guy about coding.
