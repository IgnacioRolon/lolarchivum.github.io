By marking him you either make him a bit scared of counter jungling, or if you have a fight over your first mark, you are likely to get at least 1 mark out of it, wether it's from him or from the monster. \n\nI start Gromp, (smite gromp as soon as it spawns) you need a leash if you want to get to your mark before the enemy jungler. Then do blue, smite will come off cooldown during blue or wolves, DO NOT smite blue or wolves, its tempting because you want to clear the camps to get to your mark faster and with more HP, but its way better to save it to contest your mark. \n\nYour first mark will always be the enemy raptors or on elf the two scuttle crabs, ( i don't know if its programmed this way, i havent checked, but from memory, my first mark has never been on any other camp, and I've played kindred A LOT) If its the scuttle crab then go for it as soon as you're finished wolves, if its the scuttle on your blue side, you should be able to get it no problem, if its on your red side theres more of a chance that you may either meet the enemy jungler there, or they have already taken it, but rush there regardless.\n\nIf the mark is on raptors, then its fairly safe to head there straight away, you have a pretty easy escape route and your mid laner is there to help bail you out if it comes to that. Usually you can beat their jungler there, or catch them in the act of taking it, if they are there, then jump in and smite it if its low enough for you to kill, if it isn't then just hover there waiting for it to be low enough, sometimes they will get scared and abandon the camp and run away, then you can just finish it off and leave, if they do turn around and fight you, fight them back (unless its obvious they are going to demolish you) but your priority is smiting Raptors mid fight, after you have done that, then you make a call wether to gap it, or to fight to the death. Kindred is strong at lvl 3 so there are quite a few junglers that you can get double marks from at raptors, but never count on it. \n\nIf the jungler is not at raptors when you get there, then ward the bush next to the camp and stay as far away from the camp as you can while still being able to kill it, incase you need to make a quick escape, remember that the person who comes late to the fight wether its you or them has the advantage, because the person attacking the camp has lost some HP and some of their abilities are probably on CD, if you find them at the camp then i would recommend going for the kill while keeping an eye on raptors ready to smite, but if they find you at the camp, i would recommend retreat (but doing your best to get raptors as you leave) \n\nALWAYS keep an eye on mid lane when doing raptors, if they make any sort of move towards you when you're taking the camp you get ready to gap. A smart mid laner will ward raptors as soon as your mark appears on it, so always be aware that you may be visible to everyone. But often mid laners have already used their ward or haven't noticed where your mark is. So its not 100% certain. \n\nyour early marks are the most important, especially because kindred is a great early ganker, and you want to get ahead as quickly as you can to give your team the best advantage. \n\nOnce you have retrieved the mark from the enemy Jungler (or decided that they are too strong for you and you don't want to tango with a 3/0 Vi) , you have to think about who your next target is, when kindred ganks, she relies heavily on her laner for CC, she has a slow (a pretty meaty one) but it wont stop champs like LB, or give you enough time to take down titans like garen, so if your top laner is VS a Garen, and he is playing someone like Mordekaiser who lacks CC, you are less likely to secure that kill in a gank, and so are less likely to retrieve your mark, however if your bot lane is a Leona and Jinx, who have CC to the max, you are more likely to secure a mark and a kill for your team. Don't forget about poor morde up in top lane, but just don't prioritize marking a champ that you are less likely to get a kill form.\n\nOnce the laning phase is over and ganking gives way to team fighting, you also have to be selective about who you mark, many kindreds make the mistake of marking high priority targets thinking 'ok now i have to kill that person' Often the high priority targets are the ones that are fed and causing mayhem in your team, if Fizz is 7/0 yes your team needs to kill him as quickly as possible, however, from the looks of it they have tried 7 times already to kill him and it hasn't worked out so far, so even though he is high priority, theres a good chance that he will escape again and you wont get your mark, its far better to mark targets that are more likely to die, if fizz is 7/0 and nami is 1/5, Nami is more likely going to die in a teamfight, so even though you're focusing Fizz as a team, Nami is more likely to be caught in the wrong plaice (as she's already made 5 fatal mistakes before, as opposed to Fizz who has made 0, so she's more likely to make another one than fizz is.) Remember a mark is a mark, it doesn't matter who you got it from. \n\nBe aware of the difficulty of each camp that is marked, Scuttle crab is the easiest, always go for it whenever you can, Raptors is next, they are close to your jungle and offer an easy escape route, krugs are harder, they are deep in the enemy jungle, only go for them if you know where the enemy jungler is and that he wont make it there in time to kill you. Alternatively you can go for them if your laner on the krugs side of the map is pushed right up against the enemy turret, because then, even if the enemy laner stops protecting their turret to come and kill you, your team can take the turret (which is very worth). Krugs also offer a neat escape route if you get caught out, you can jump over the little wall behind them with your Q and that buys you lots of time while they have to go all the way around to chase you. Gromp is the hardest camp, its easy for the enemy laner to close off your escape, and if someone comes from either direction it makes it almost impossible to escape, only go to gromp if you sure there is no one near it that can get you, or you're super fed and know that if they do come you can just kill them. \n\nI aim to get all 6 jungle camp marks by 15 mins (20 if I'm not doing so well) \n\nbut yea, have fun playing one of the best looking, coolest sounding and best themed champions of the game!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-20T23:31:17.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle:\n\n* Upgrading spells early: First 3 levels = Q, W, E.             \n* Rest of game spell leveling = max Q, then E, then W (upgrade R whenever possible)\n* Don't rush for marks on neutral monsters unless they're on the scuttle crabs. Running into the enemy jungle is very dangerous depending on who you verse. One exception is: If you see the enemy jungler away from the mark, you can rush to it and get that mark. Wraiths are relatively safe to steal, gromp is a bit risker but possible... Wolves almost always cause conflict.\n* Mark the lane you want to gank about 1-3 minutes before you gank it. Marking them as you gank will increase their awareness and make them harder to gank, or you'll kill them before the mark locks.\n* Make sure you're kiting jungle monsters. I usually just do a sort of circle path to kite. You can do red buff without taking a single hit from the big monster (With small golems buff).\n* With 2-3 stacks you're capable of killing dragon easily. Hop over the rear wall if you're on the bottom team, that way scuttle crab wards can't see you.\n\nADC:\n\n* If the mark is on your bottom scuttle crab then ask your support to help you get it.\n* If the mark is on the top scuttle crab, get it on your way back to lane via a detour and maybe even gank mid lane while you're there.\n* Order of priority when marking enemies during laning phase.: ADC, Support, Jungler.\n* Overall you need to learn to save q for dodging spells in lane, so don't farm with it unless you can last hit multiple minions.\n* Mana is important, try not to spam unless its a trade or all-in kill.\n\nGeneral Tips:\n\n* If one of your allies and enemies is low. Don't just ult unless you're sure you can get the kill AND save the ally. A lot of the time ulting causes the enemy to get his team in the fight and actually causes it turn for the worse.\n* W and Q together are great for catching up to enemies running from you.\n* W makes you a slippery target by reducing the cooldown of your Q to 2 seconds.\n* COMBO: E, AUTO, AUTO, Q AUTO, W, AUTO, Q... etc.. (The reason you auto twice first is because your q is good for gap closing after the slow wears off the enemy.\n* If you aren't getting marks, it's frustrating but don't build around the passive in that situation... Change your build to a more damage heavy, tanky or life-steal build. \n\nFinally, enjoy her and understand that it takes time to learn her mechanics. You need to learn to kite and stutter step.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-20T21:46:54.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, what you want to do is go Jg first\n\nUpgrade your wolves second after your buff\n\nGo over to the siding of the enemy wolves or raptors (depending on where their enemy jg started) put your wolves territory over them and the camp\nNow wait until they die to camp for your free kill\n\n#only works against bronze and crap jglers","replies":[]}]}
