Using a VPN would force your traffic to take a different (working) path\n\nCan you test something for me:\n\n* You'll need to use  [telnet](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/telnet-faq#1TC=windows-7) to test access to the League platform.\n* Start with your VPN **OFF**\n* Open a command prompt and type _telnet prod.oc1.lol.riotgames.com 2099_\n * If it works, you'll see _Connecting To prod.oc1.lol.riotgames.com..._ very briefly, and then the prompt will go away (you can just press spacebar a few times to get it to close out the connection).\n * If it fails, you will see something like _Could not open connection to the host, on port 2099: Connect failed_\n* Try the test again with your VPN **ON**\n\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2016-04-02T07:29:29.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Final reply: If you guys changed something network-related in the past 12 hours from this message, it fixed whatever happened.
