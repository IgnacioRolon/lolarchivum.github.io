A majority is a majority, that&#039;s the way it works in real life. Whether you own 99% of a company's shares or 51% of a company's shares makes no difference. Why is a duo able to overrule 3 other people?\n\nIf 3 of the team of 5 don't want to continue the game, they should be allowed to end it","replies":[]}
