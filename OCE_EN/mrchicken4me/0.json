I was wondering about how long until the leaver buster penalties go down or reset?\r\nStory if anyone&#039;s interested :P \r\nSo previously I&#039;ve had a string of events which lead to a few minutes of being AFK, I admit it isn&#039;t good but when your isp dies or your computer all of a sudden has a heart attack there&#039;s nothing I can do.  The first low priority queues were reasonable but after 20+ games of not having a single problem I had to leave for 5 minutes because someone who was trying to sell their paintings came knocking on the door. After going back in closing out the game I had no idea I have to wait 20 minutes before my next five games. \r\nI love this game but i honestly feel like quitting if I have to put up with this ;_;","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-09T12:00:48.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They gradually decrase over the course of completed games.\nThey do not reset after 5, even one is enough to start the decay - but there is no fixed reset point. The more you were leaving before, the more you'll have to play before the system resets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-09T10:54:55.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They reset after 5 games, time is not a factor.","replies":[]}]}
