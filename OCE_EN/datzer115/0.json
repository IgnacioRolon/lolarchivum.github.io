My friend did the same thing and he got Red Card Katarina. I was just wondering how rare they are and if they have been able to be bought since the 2010 FIFA World Cup.","replies":[{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2015-12-19T05:19:15.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have All-star Akali as well, bought it when it was available for a limited time only way back in 2014, during the world cup football fever. But like always, it was overshadowed by the newer striker skins, and I doubt anybody bought it. (That was my plan, what makes it so rare, is that hardly anyone bothers to buy it because it actually looks terrible in my opinion)\n\nI assume that in 2018 in the next World Cup, the skins will be available again for a limited time. So sit tight, only 2 more years to go...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-19T05:19:07.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure they were on sale again during the 2014 world cup when the new soccer skins were released.\n\nBut other than that, no, they don't get sold much so they are fairly difficult to get your hands on I guess.\nNot super rare, but not common.","replies":[]}]}
