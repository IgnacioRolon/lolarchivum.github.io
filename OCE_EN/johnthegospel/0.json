What do you think?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So in my last game, I was playing Renekton {{champion:58}}  top against Illaoi {{champion:420}}. It was my first time playing against her and I found it quite easy. Jarvan Jungler ganked and gave me a lead BUT when i returned, she had bought two long swords and was smashing me. I was huddled against my tower while she landed her shots. Jarvan came again to help, we killed her, yet she still was dominating me. \r\n\r\nI was building a Black Cleaver for the damage cause I figured that I was beating her in lane. However, she still dominated me.\r\n\r\nWhat i hate that in team fights, we all focus on her but then she just draws her ultimate and goes berserk. \r\nOne teamfight, Jarvan {{champion:59}} , Poppy {{champion:78}}  and MF  {{champion:21}} were left with decent health and Illaoi was with  just over half health and they went all in her but guess what? She STILL killed them all with her ulti, like wtf......\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}  (Honestly, I would think I know how to play defensively with a Renekton but it could just me sucking)\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? DO YOU AGREE? SHOULD SHE BE NERFED??????","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-10T11:36:58.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodge her stuff? its pretty easy, especially with Renekton who has 2 dashes.\n\nIllaoi is actually kinda bad...","replies":[{"poster":"JohnTheGospel","date":"2016-04-10T11:46:56.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am I that terrible?

They just give her abilities so much damage because she has like a 1s wind up on all of them so her main damage is pretty easy to dodge.\n\nI mean, i've seen Illaoi's 1v5 pentakill when they are fed because they got a good ult off. But no, she isn't OP.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-04-10T20:33:42.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes the kind of champion that can dominate and 1v5 against people who don't know how to play against her properly, but has very exploitable weaknesses and can't really do anything if you play against her right. Understanding how the tentacles work gives a lot of counterplay opportunities","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-04-10T16:16:19.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with Illaoi is she needs to get into a team to get her damage off. Good focus and peel of her really destroys Illaoi's capabilities. Yes she can most certainly do well when her abilities all hit, in fact she's incredibly strong when surrounded by walls and getting good ultis off. But due to her kit relying on the tentacles for damage (which are also uncontrollable by her) it allows counterplay. \n\n* Standing well away from walls and learning the patterns at which her tentacles attack will allow you to completely deny her of something core to her kit and a major form of her sustain. \n* Dodge the skillshots. Nearly all of Illaoi's regular (non-ulti) damage is frontloaded into her 2 skillshots. Both which have weaknesses in-lane. Her E has a  COOLDOWN: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 try taking advantage of this period more against her. Her Q on the other hand is a low cooldown but higher manacost. If you can bait this out of her a couple of times without her hitting you it will drain it a fair bit.\n\nChampions with knock-backs work EXTREMELY well against Illaoi, as she will generally only have a small window of opportunity to be able to enter a fight effectively. Try to coordinate with your teammates to get some champions with knockbacks to keep her out of the fight! Some great examples are:\n{{champion:78}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:12}}.\n\nIt's also quite easy to know when Illaoi will go into a fight. Her spell ranges and initiation potential is significantly shorter than a Malphite's Unstoppable force. So be ready to telegraph when she's going to go in (Pretty much if she can hit multiple people grouped tightly, she will go in like any other initiator!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im a CAT","date":"2016-04-10T14:28:23.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLiTGQML3pI\n\nLet Dong Huap teach you how to play against an Illaoi :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-04-10T11:51:55.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think judgements should be made to nerf a champion over one or two games personally. If you play against an {{champion:420}} correctly, you can dominate her.

(the spirit she pulls from someone counts as an extra champion for that 6th tentacle)\nKiting around her skill shots and not letting her get near you when you're grouped up leaves her feeling very weak.","replies":[]}]}
