Did they like, forget about him?\r\nWhy doesn&#039;t he have an AMAZING skin? Like wtf Riot. \r\n&#039;Sad Robot&#039;\r\n&#039;Emumu&#039;\r\n&#039;Surprise Party Amumu&#039; and he is barely even apart of that splash art\r\n\r\nSo why don&#039;t we give Amumu just ONE day to feel appreciated. \r\nHe&#039;s like a mummy which makes him, immortal? So his gonna live a never ending life of never ending sadness?\r\nI was thinking, on Amumu Day, something simple, something noticeable, something for the boy with no heart.\r\n\r\nLike a splash art, doesn&#039;t have to be a skin. A splash art of Amumu surrounded by other Champions, comforting him.\r\n                OR \r\nIt could be like a remake of his classic, him on that wooden pole. But rather than the frown he held for so long, a \r\ndelicate, fragile but sweet smile. \r\n\r\nor maybe even both. \r\n\r\nIf Annie were really friends with Amumu, then where was she in his lore or where was he in her lore?\r\n\r\nJust for the Sadness :\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nEvery child in Valoran has heard the tale before,\r\nAbout the cursed mummy boy who felt his heart no more.\r\nSo sad and lorn, the helpless lad, Amumu was his name,\r\nHe ventured out to find a friend and learn about his bane.\r\n\r\nFor many years, young Amumu traveled through the lands,\r\nDetermined to make friends, if only they would understand,\r\nBut even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home,\r\nHis hope would disappoint him, and he would remain alone.\r\n\r\nBut then the curse began to whisper in his ear,\r\nAnd would confirm what was Amumu&#039;s biggest fear,\r\nIt pledged that never shall someone become his friend,\r\nIt pledged that he shall be alone until his end.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow and despair,\r\nBecame too much to bear.\r\n\r\nYeah!\r\nThe moment when Amumu realized what he had done,\r\nToo late it was, for him, for them, the evil curse had won.\r\nThe anger and the anguish overwhelmed his fragile soul,\r\nAnd caused a wicked tantrum that he never could control._\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&quot;The worst kind of Sad, is not being able to explain why.&quot;\r\n                                                      \r\n -Curiano.com\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[]}
