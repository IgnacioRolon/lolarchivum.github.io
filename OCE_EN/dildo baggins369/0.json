Been happening for a couple of months now.\nPing is fine, although more jumpy than usual (usually sit on 40, but recently sit on 50 jumping to and from 80 + everything in between when it's playing up).\nHowever I&#039;m suffering horrible lag. It&#039;s not a constant delay, but more of a 1 second instant where things don&#039;t happen.\nEg, last hitting minions in lane, everything fine, Nek minnit I&#039;m in a nami bubble with a few flashing colours, with nothing leading up to that point.\nSo abilities and things don&#039;t seem to show properly. Same happens with auto attacks, attack a minion, animation happens, but no projectile, and minion will die and not show gold from kill for a second or two.\n\nreal choppy game play is the best way to describe it I guess.\nI know it&#039;s not FPS lag, Frames don&#039;t drop below 60, and have a 7950 with a decent enough cpu, and after a pervious thread, which died, it sounded as if my problem was packet loss. I've called my ISP and had them do tests on my line but didn't find any excessive jitter or packet loss and so on.\n\nHave attached the diagnostic test results.\nI hope someone can provide me with some sort of insight into what the problem is. :D\n\nThank you all very much for your time!\n\nP.S ISP = DODO (lel)  and happens between ~5pm and midnight. So really the main times a normal person can play League :(\n      And a friend has the exact same problems at the same times. He&#039;s with iprimus I believe","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T01:40:40.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a severe form of packet loss. That would result in the situation you described; only slightly higher ping but sometimes actions in game don't actually occur/occur but you only see their effects way after they were executed.\n\nI just finished reading the rest of your post and see that you've already gone over the fact that it may be packet loss, and that your ISP claims that your connection is fine. That was a test performed by them, though. Did they do it on your exact computer? It could be that something on your computer is prevented bits of data from reaching League's client. Also, if you're using a VPN or proxy, then any tests that your ISP does would mean nothing.\n\nAlso, I've heard that Dodo specifically isn't the *best* ISP out there, but I could easily be wrong. Have you tried playing League from something like a mobile hotspot or a friend's internet connection? Just to see if you get the same issues, so that you can elminate the problem either being on your computer or because of your connection.\n\nIn the meantime you can try the following: [use a different DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5), [renew your IP and flush your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq10), turn off any VPN or proxy you may be using, uninstall (even just temporarily) any firewalls/anti-viruses you may have, [reset winsock](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq3) and disable IPv6.\n\nIf you need help with any of the above, just ask.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
