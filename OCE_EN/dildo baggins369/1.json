Started in the last few weeks I guess.\r\nPing is fine, although more jumpy than usual (usually sit on 40, but recently sit on 50 jumping to and from 80 + everything in between).\r\nHowever I'm suffering horrible lag. It's not a constant delay, but more of a 1 second instant where things don't happen.\r\nEg, last hitting minions in lane, everything fine, Nek minnit I'm in a nami bubble with a few flashing colours, with nothing leading up to that point.\r\nSo abilities and things don't seem to show properly. Same happens with auto attacks, attack a minion, animation happens, but no projectile, and minion will die and not show gold from kill for a second or two. \r\n\r\nreal choppy game play is the best way to describe it I guess.\r\nI know it's not FPS lag, Frames don't drop below 60, and have a 7950 with a decent enough cpu.\r\n\r\nHave attached the diagnostic test results.\r\nI hope someone, could provide me with some sort of insight into what the problem is.\r\n\r\nThank you all very much for your time!\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S ISP = DODO (lel)","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-09T03:53:00.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Guys,\n\nSo based off what you have mentioned and the log file you have attached, it sounds to me like you may be experiencing packet loss.\nHorse of Force is correct, I would suggest contacting your ISP (Dodo) and asking them to check your connection and perhaps run some tests on your line, such as a jitter and noise test.\n\nLet them know you believe you are getting packet loss and see what their engineers are bale to determine.\n\nPlease let us know how this goes and if possible we can reach out from our end as well.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"dildo baggins369","date":"2015-03-19T04:17:46.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been around for a while.\nJust spent an hour on the phone to dodo. He did a line test and said everything seemed good and then we spent ages running around doing all this random stuff (checking phone dial tones, disconnecting all other devices from the modem, etc) before he randomly claimed he couldn't hear me and then hung up haha So I guess he thought I was wasting his time or something lol\n\nAnyway I tried doing a pathping to what I think are your servers, I'll attach the txt file. I noticed there's 100% Packet loss to 4826.syd.equinix.com [202.167.228.74]\n\nCould that have anything to do with the problem? Or did I pathping the wrong ip?\n\nAgain, sorry for disappearing for a while. Hope you're still around :P\n\nThanks,\nAndy\n\nEDIT: I recently noticed the problem only occurs during the day, once it hits about 11pm-midnight things are usually okay\n\nEDIT2: I also just did a ping to the previously mentioned equinix address with 4 time outs. I can't add another attachment so I'll copy paste. #OverKillingIt\n\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]\nCopyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation.

It could be that the ports that League uses aren't properly configured with the ISP. And if you find that it *is* happening in other games, and you've scoured your configuration to make sure nothing was wrong/intentionally slowing your internet, then call them about it. They gave you a service in which you should be able to use the internet at a moderate speed, and 100+ ms of ping is slow.\n\nLastly, could you make sure that when you're playing League, no other applications are open? It could be as simple as another program using the internet to do something, eg. Skype calls or Steam downloading.","replies":[{"poster":"dildo baggins369","date":"2015-02-10T09:05:59.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps for all the help man, making me all tingly inside :')\n\nI'll give it a dabble without skype and itunes running (this'll be a first lol)\nWill Holla back with results at a later date","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-10T23:04:27.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think iTunes does stuff like download podcasts in the background without telling you, so that might do something.\n\nAlso, on Windows specially, if it's downloading a huge update (so much so that it doesn't download within the time that you have the computer on for) then it will reset every time you interrupt it, causing near infinite lag.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dildo baggins369","date":"2015-04-13T11:45:58.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"dildo baggins369","date":"2015-04-12T11:36:19.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump \nPls help someone, league is unplayable 5pm-12am :(","replies":[]}]}
