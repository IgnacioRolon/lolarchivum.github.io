And a speed-test to a different server doesn't really tell us anything.\n\nYou can ping the League servers directly using a command prompt, if on Windows. To do so, press Winkey+R to open up the Run app. Type in \"cmd\" and hit Enter. This will bring up the command prompt. Copy the following text (excluding quotation marks) \"ping oce.leagueoflegends.com\", right-click the command prompt and click Paste. Do not use Ctrl+V, it will not work.\n\nAfter a brief moment of pinging, something along the lines of \"Minimum = 50ms, Maximum = 60ms, Average = 55ms\" should be shown. Tell me what that is for you.","replies":[{"poster":"ReinxX","date":"2015-01-11T08:39:36.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is it","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T09:55:47.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"13ms.\n\nWhat the hell; I live in Victoria but the best I get is 48ms.
