Been playing about 4 days and at level 7. As I&#039;ll probably be a casual player in SoloQ who likes variety, I figure I need to save all my IP for Tier 3 runes. So I was looking at an RP purchase to get some of the champ bundles otherwise it&#039;ll be months before I earn IP to unlock any if I&#039;m saving it for runes. \r\n\r\nSo, my question is, given flexible bundle pricing and that I have no champs purchased yet, what would the total RP cost be for the starter, champion, and digital champ bundles be? Will the 4650RP pack cover the cost?\r\n\r\nIf it&#039;s close but not quite enough, which champ(s) would I need to unlock with IP to get the total under 4650RP? I can&#039;t find a formula for the discount amount of owned champs. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot","replies":[{"poster":"Idus","date":"2015-05-22T21:00:41.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I said though, I'm a casual player. 8-10 games a day is impossible. 10 a week might be my limit, and if I only wver play the free rotations, I'll  never get to understand any of them. True buying the bundles means I'll probably buy heaps I never play. I really want the champion one the most, but the $20 IP bundle doesn't even cover the cost of it, and the $35 is close to covering the cost of all of them.\n\nThe idea of buying one cheaper champ with IP, and then seeing how it affects the bundle price is a good idea.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-22T11:25:59.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO you should just buy the 450 IP champs that are in the mutliple bundles {{champion:1}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:22}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:11}}  with IP and see how much the bundles cost.\n\nIf you take into account the First Win of the Day bonus, you can get enough IP for those champs in like 3-4 games.\n\nBasically the only champ left in the Start pack is {{champion:86}}. Save the $5 and don't buy the starter pack. Believe me when I say, IP comes pretty fast if you play 4-5 games daily.\n\nTook me like 3-4 months to get my account to level 30. So you have plenty of time to get IP.\n\nIf you can average 8-10 games a day, that about 1000 IP a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-05-22T08:19:44.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally believe you really shouldn't worry about runes so early into playing. It wil cost you more than $50 for all those bundles and I personally believe you shouldn't invest so much into the game when your only lv 7. You may not even like the champs in the bundles so I personally you shouldn't get them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-22T01:36:02.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My opinion, buy the Digital Collectors pack and the Champion Bundle. The boosts in the Starter Pack are not necessary. \n\nAlso, to fill out both rune pages with generic tier 3 runes, it will cost around 15,000IP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2015-05-22T01:25:51.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go into shop select bundles then add the cost of them together and that will give you your answer, or close to it","replies":[{"poster":"Idus","date":"2015-05-22T01:31:33.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I'm trying to find out is how much they will be reduced due to the duplicates in each bundle. \n\nThe total cost of all 3 is 520+3410+2520 = 6450. But my understanding is you get a discounts rate for each champ you already have? So I'm guessing the champion bundle should be reduced due to Ashe, Master Yi and Sivir being in the starter bundle, and the digital collector set reduced due to Annie, Nunu, Ryze and Warwick overlaps, or is that not how it works?\n\nI want to buy as little RP as possible needed to get these 3 bundles.","replies":[]}]}]}
