I have my Drivers up to date. I don&#039;t know what to do. i am losing interest in playing knowing 100 minutes of my life waiting to just start a league queue is wasted because of a failure that isnt my fault. I have a friend who has also had this problem. In the link provided there is a photo of the error, the leaverbuster because 0f it a screenshot in client of the 3 games i played before without problems and the same in OP.GG showing the time between the games i have been playing. When this happens i cannot reconnect to the game what so ever, if i restart my client, restart my computer and even trying on my laptop instead of my desktop i still cannot reconnect. then it goes back to normal the next game and i have no issues connecting and playing. \r\n\r\nIs there anything i can do to try and fix this issue (don&#039;t suggest updating my drivers as they are all up to date as of 27/1/2018.). Is this a known issue and you guys are working on a fix? i dont find it fair i have to put up with low priority queue because of something thats not my fault..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-28T01:39:01.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's direct X issues try reinstalling Direct X:\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx\n\n_**Never** download anything Direct X related from anywhere except Microsoft themselves_","replies":[]}]}
