Multiple members of this team have had previous tournament experience and will be looking to take this team to the OOL (Oceanic open Ladder ) in aim of reaching the OCS ( Oceanic Challenger series) with long term goal of the OPL ( Oceanic Pro league ). Communication will need to be a strong point, you need to be able to make you call outs in a game, Communication is the key to a well rounded team. We as a team want to be able to make strong independent Players that Exceed in their role in solo Queue and make them into Strong Team players.\n\nWe are currently on the lookout for:\nADC\nTop lane\nSupport\nMid lane\nJungle\n+ two subs\n\nIf you role is Already filled Don&rsquo;t Worry, Because you can always apply for a Substitute role, this does mean you will need to be versatile in many roles. Two or Three roles that you can exceed in would be good for this. As a Substitute you will still be getting the same treatment as the team, you will participate in scrims, practice, and tournaments.  \n\nWe will be trialing new members, to ensure they work well with the existing team and to make sure we make the strongest team possible. We aim to create a friendly, competitive atmosphere and will not consider you if you are toxic. Please also ensure you have stable internet as we do not want to have to deal with low priority queues.\n\nWith the Current Dynamic Queue it is abusable and we can climb heavily for our solo queue ranks to build our team synergy and prepare us for more controlled environments. For example we can have a 5 man Dynamic Queue and go into a Solo Queue game. We will be able to control the pace of the game this way with our communication, knowledge of how we all play and control. This will be good Synergy practice for the team.  \n\nIf your application is accepted and you are moved into Trialing, you will be watched, tested and observed  in multiple games. in these games who you chose to play will be up to you, I suggest you play your best champions and let your talent shine. For example if I was on a trial, I would show off my Renekton top lane or my Rek&rsquo;sai jungle. \n\nCopy-paste and fill the application:\n\nName:\nAge:\nSolo Queue Rank (+peak last season):\nSummoner ID: \nRole(s):\nPool in each role:\nAvailability:\nWhat distinguishes this team from others that makes you want to join?:\nPrevious Team Experience:\n[](http://oce.op.gg) Link: \n \n Reasons of denied application ; \n\n* You don&rsquo;t have access to a Microphone\n* You Don&rsquo;t Communicate\n* You are not of a sufficient rank/skill level\n* If you have Abusive tendencies \n* If you don&rsquo;t take scrims, practice or tournament games seriously\n* You do not dedicate enough time to the team\n* If there is no synergy\n* Your Availability ( This means if you can only play 1-3 days a week.
