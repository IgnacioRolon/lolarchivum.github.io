The best strategist looks not only at the enemy team but at his own.\nFor example: Your proposed team has no tanks and is AP heavy, and the support still wants to pick Brand supp. \n\nLets take a look at Brand: Brand is a squishy immobile AP mage, he has no CC except 1 very unreliable stun, and ALL his abilities (and build path) burn the target, he has no shields/heals/allied-champion-buffs etc etc. \nIn other words, Brand can not be relied upon to land his Stun accurately or quickly (like Leona can) he can not reduce the enemy's damage in any way, AND his burn gives the very real possibility of stealing the ADC's kills (Which is not good considering the ADC is your most valuable source of damage). And unless he is fed (and you don't really want your supp fed instead of your adc) All he is good for is landing his 1 unreliable stun. He is a champ that relies heavily on damage, and as Support, he is NOT going to get enough damage (not they you want damage as a supp) to be as viable a pick as proper support champions with proper supp abilities.\n\nSo strategically, you are more likely to win if you prevent this player from taking Brand support, and force him to pick a different more valuable support. After all, the banning phase is about giving you the best chance you can of winning the game, and **sometimes preventing your own team mate from doing something dumb, is better than preventing your enemy from doing something smart.** _Strategy._ \n\nWhy they banned Riven for you, i don't know. \nPerhaps your team had no tanks and it was irresponsible of you to pick riven in that situation? Maybe it was a mistake, i don't know.\n\nJust remember, the banning phase is NOT about making sure the enemy doesn't play OP champs, It is to give you the BEST chance of winning. \nSometimes they are the same thing... but sometimes not.\n\nPS. An analogy would be the army: A soldier's friend is shot, and this soldier wants to run back out into no-mans-land to save his friend, but his superior officer holds him back, because the officer knows that it is a bad idea and will likely get the soldier killed. The soldier may not think it is a bad idea at the time because he wants to do it, but other people know better, it isn't 'fair' because it is stopping the soldier from doing what they want and that isn't fair, but it was the best thing for that soldier, even if he didn't know it at the time.\n\nI would much rather have a team mate thats angry at me and Win, than make him happy and Lose.","replies":[{"poster":"callmerob","date":"2016-07-13T19:15:41.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg i did not expect or even realise league of legend had such intelegent players online.\n i thank you for your feed back and constructive criticism and i now understand that in many cases YOUR ALLIE MID LANERS A DOOSH but that in some cases he may be making a decision he thinks is right based on the information he had.\nseriously though thank you.\nyou gave me a lot of insight to my own actions","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-15T10:04:47.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"_\"So strategically, you are more likely to win if you prevent this player from taking Brand support, and force him to pick a different more valuable support.

Strategy.\"_\n\nIf the Brand is set on playing Brand, and even though you don't think hes a good pick, you need to get it through your \"strategic\" skull that some people are good at certain champs and you can't force someone to pick something they aren't good at. For example:\n\nI am a Twisted Fate one trick. I can play him Top, Mid, Jungle, ADC, even support if I had to. Let's say we had a:\nLissandra Top\nDiana Jungle\nLeona Support\nCorki ADC\n\nEven though our team needs more AD, it is a much more likely win if you let me play Twisted Fate than any other champion in the game. Same with every person who mains a few champs. They are most likely the same style of champion even if you aren't a one trick, so banning that particular champion is just dog and thirsting for a loss.\n\nThe only exception to what you say is if your guy is 4th or 5th pick and the champion they want to play is very popular. Then banning Malz, Vayne etc might be okay. BUT YOU SHOULD ASK THEM FOR PERMISSION FIRST. It should be reportable to ban a player's champion when you know they want that champion against their will.\n\nIf someone banned Twisted Fate when I got mid I might as well AFK cause that is about as useful as I am to the team. Maybe I'm exaggerating a bit as I can play other champions, but you get my point. You don't ban a champion that your teammate wants to play, unless opportunity calls.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-15T20:35:17.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny, I think you'll find that people who play more than 1 champ are more open to banning champs on your own team... Funny that.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, if you pick twisted fate while you have a full AP team with 1 tank. Against a team with 2 or more tanks, when that game reaches late game, you will lose. It doesn't matter how good you are at TF you can't take down a Voli and an Alistar who build full MR.. You just can't, and what if vayne is their adc, her invisibility makes your point and click targetability (and your slow skillshot) completely useless. \n\nSo because you were too stubborn to pick a champ that aids your team, you are now useless against 3 of the enemy team.\n\nIf we had no tanks and you were going twisted fate top or something, I would ban him for sure.\n\nBack to the topic of brand support, a bad supp Alistar, is going to be more useful to the team than a good brand support. Because regardless of skill level, a supp brand is good for 1 thing: a very unreliable stun. Where an Alistar even if he is bad has a heal and a knock up, a knockback and is virtually unkillable for a few seconds (none of which require any aiming whatsoever).\n\nIf we had a Voli top a rammus jungle and a Galio mid, I would think twice about banning brand supp. But if we had a teemo top, Diana Jung and xerath mid, I would ban Brand in a heartbeat. \n\nPlaying 1 champ like TF in all positions regardless of strategy is never going to get you far. (If you want proof, think about how many pro's get to where they are now by disregarding strategy to play just 1 champ each time) \n\nSkill is very helpful in this game, but it doesn't count for everything, you can be a prodigy TF but you still can't get through a ful MR volibear.\n\nPretend you were an absolute marksman with a handgun, you can shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, but you'll still lose to a guy with a bulletproof shield and a pocketknife. No matter how accurate your bullets are and how much skill you have, you can't get him behind his shield.\n\nMy advice to you would be to think about the team and not yourself. \"I'm only good with TF therefore I'm going to play TF.\" Is a very selfish view. So unless you have a 100% win rate with TF in every situation. You need to learn other champs and learn to pick chanps that go well with your team-mates chamos and well against the enemy's chanps.","replies":[{"poster":"callmerob","date":"2016-07-13T19:11:49.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your like rosting everyone its unbelievable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-16T00:29:20.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaclone, Trick2g, Tyler1, Gross Gore and that guy that played Heimerdinger to challenger.

Taking a single champion and learning them in every position to the point that you can beat the \"meta\" at their own role allows you to have a much greater understanding of the match ups and what you need to do to win games.\n\nI mean, the guy that played heimerdinger to challenger rank 1. That not only takes immense knowledge about every counter pick he has (read: a lot) but become very VERY creative in order to win games.

They are more like towers, barons, camps, dragons, and the nexuses, and the inhibitors. I do think of league like chess but champions have nothing to do with it. In chess you master all the pieces, but you don't grow any more hands.\n\nThis isn't chess bro, this is league. You may be a player who can play every champion every lane decently. You may be a player who can go many champions but only 1 or 2 roles. Or you may be a player who can play one champion in every role, and win under any circumstances.\n\nBullshit you are only good at a tiny part of the game. Even professionals stick to a few champions per patch. If I can play TF and beat a full team of tanks and counters, which I have many times, that means I can beat every part of the game. And just because I am a TF one trick, it doesn't mean I can't play other champions. I could literally have a spiritual connection to them, etc.\n\nDon't go on about situational playing. If anything it makes you a better situational player if you can adapt to any team comp as one champion and never fail. And by the way, your last statement I see where you were trying to go, but it's kind of lack luster when you realize that:\n\nSticking with one champion from Bronze to Challenger and not changing no matter what team comp, especially if that champion is out of meta, far out ways picking counters and strategic champions, even if that is how LCS works, it's not dynamic queue.\n\nPlus it is just basic knowledge that if you main one champion you are going to be better at that champion 100 fold than if you played a vast variety of champions and roles. This is not about screwing up your team comp or only been able to play one champion, it is about PLAYING one champion, and playing them damn well.\n\nAnyway, in contrast to your last statement, I will leave you with this. \n\nWho do you think is better? The player that plays the OP and in matter picks and sacrificing roles to do so? Or the player that sticks with a main through the hard patches, and the good patches, and is able to adapt to any situation even when their champion gets countered? \n\n{{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}}{{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:4}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-16T11:06:12.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chess pieces are a lot like champions, each has its specific role, it is good in certain situations and very bad in others. No one piece can conquer the board, just like no 1 champ conquers all other champs. Each has their place, you cant win a game with all white-square bishops, just like you cant win a game with all ADC's \n\nPro players have a large range of champs that they play, and like most people (and i hate it and don't do it myself but thats just me) they play the strongest champions at the time. Azir for example, in other seasons he wasn't picked much and was outclassed by the popular assassins that can get up close to him, but now in this tank meta  where tanks (which he is good at fighting) are everywhere and the assassins that troubled him are not the best pick against those tanks don;t get picked as much (with the obvious shadowy exception) and so he is very powerful, and guess what... Lots of people (including the pro's) now play him. They adapt because they want the money and fame of winning, and they aren't going to put all their eggs in 1 basket by playing 1 champ only and in every position. \n\nIts not basic knowledge that playing 1 champs will make you better 100 fold than if you played multiple champs in multiple positions! Another analogy using a hammer to build something, someone who has spent 50 years using only a hammer, will have no more skill than someone who has spent 10 years only using a hammer, because there is only so much knowledge required in using a hammer, and eventually you reach a plateau, and no matter how much more time you spend on it, there is nothing more to learn about using a hammer. \nSo if each person spends 50 years in the building industry, the one who uses only a hammer will reach a plateau after 10 years and will not improve much after that. Where the guy who only spends 10 years learning the hammer, reaches the same plateau skill level, AND now he has 40 years to learn the nail gun and the saw and the drill, and eventually he will far surpass the guy who only uses the hammer.\n\nThe same is true for lol, theres only a certain amount of things that each champion can do, and eventually you get to a point where you don't stop learning (the learning process never stops) but it slows down considerably, and it becomes more efficient to learn another champion. Its better to learn 80% of a champion in 1 year and then spend the next year learning 80% of a new champion, than it is to learn 86% of a single champion over 2 years.\nThis skill plateau exists in ALL sports, and E sports are no exception. (like seriously talk to ANY sports coach)\n\nAnother advantage of learning in depth more champions, is that it betters your knowledge of playing your favourite champion against them. If you're a master of TF and Zed, you will be able to play TF better against a Zed than a Grand-master TF (who only plays TF) could play against a Zed, because you know every little secret that Zed has, and more importantly, you know exactly how Zed players think and can far more easily predict and outplay them. \nFor example, if the enemy team picks TF, you can play against a TF very very very well because you know exactly what is going though their minds at every second of the game. You will be able to play against a TF far better than someone who CAN play TF but only really plays Syndra or another champ, because you know TF better than they do. Its the same for them, if you pick Syndra, they will tear you apart, even though you CAN play Syndra and not only TF, you don't know her like they do, and they will know everything you are thinking, and everything you can and cant do, including exact CD's with and without CDR and the levels of damage you will have at exact times in the game, along with power spikes and dips. \n\nAs to your last question, i personally Abhor picking only the champions that are OP at the time, i think its like selling yourself out to the highest bidder, and i admire people who stick to a few champs the whole way through. However picking the OP champs and picking/banning them to your advantage is by far the most strategic move, if you can play 70% of an OP champ whenever they pop up, its better than playing 80% of the same champions all of the time, because even though you have less skill with that champ, their OP ness gives you that extra % you need. \n\nMy favourite champions are Azir, Aurelion Sol, Kindred and Shen. I am not the best with Azir even though he has been my main since the day he came out, i am actually better with Shen even though i probably have played well over triple the games with Azir than i have all the other champions combined. But he is still my favourite. \n\nI will pick both Azir and Shen into counters (just like you do) because i am more confident in my skill with those two than i am with the counter of the champion that is countering me. But i will not pick them when they will detract from the viability of my team. If we have a top Singed, jungle Zac, ADC Corki, and Brand Supp, i will NOT pick Azir because then the enemy will only build MR and that will not only cut down my damage but the damage of EVERYONE in my team, so instead i will pick Yasuo, who i am not as confident with as Azir but still know very well. This not only makes Zac and Singed's knock ups far more deadly, but will also force the enemy team to sacrifice some MR for armour, which means both me and my entire team will do more damage, than if i picked Azir. \n\nI have a small pool of champions that i know very well for each Top, Mid and Supp, i only have 2 or 3 for Jungle, and i cant play any ADC's very well. \n\nYou may be able to use TF to 95% of his potential, and every other champ to 40%, but i know Azir, Sol, Kass, Syndra, Yasuo, Anivia, Vlad, Karthus, TF, Poppy, Shen, Gnar, Kindred, Leona, Taric, Nami, Bard, Zyra and a few others to between 70-80% of their potential, thats only 15%ish less than your TF, yet i know 17 MORE than you. \nYou sacrifice 17 champs for that extra 15% on TF. So in a 1v1 you will probably destroy me most times, but i will be able to synergize much better with my team than you will be able to with yours. If your team picks Yasuo, you wont be able to help him, if My team picks Yasuo, i will pick Azir, now i still lack your 15% extra skill with my champ, BUT i just shot Yasuo's potential through the roof, which more than makes up for it. After all its a 5v5 team game. \n\nYou talk a lot about never failing, and you say you have beaten teams of full MR tanks with TF, and i believe you, BUT i bet you it doesn't happen every time (if you won every game, you'd be kicking Faker out of a Job) and thats where your 1 trick pony falls down.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-16T12:37:13.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can agree with you there.\n\nAlso I meant that you could sacrifice a tower to get an inhib and stuff like that.
