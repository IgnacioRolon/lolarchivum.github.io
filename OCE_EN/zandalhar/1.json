I've played over 3500 ARAMs, why am I not matched with players with similar stats? I'm constantly being matched with people who have less than 100 ARAMs TOTAL. It's a different game mode and requires different gameplay that these people who do it \"for fun\" don't understand. When will that be fixed so I'm actually playing with/against people of a similar ARAM skill level.

Even so, not everyone has every champion/a large champion pool so someone with a similar skill level may only have achieved so in ARAM by mastering a small champion pool which they \"luckily\" get everytime(e.g. good poke champions like kogmaw, ziggs or aoe/global ults) and in doing so just makes it harder when they play a champion they arent very good at (like someone from the free rotation (lol ocean week) or a champion they recently purchased).\n\nEven at an equal skill level ,one team can just dominate when they have a good team composition. Just be happy that you're better than players who only main a few champs :p","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-01T13:12:58.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talking about random-number-generator based mode, refers to skill...
