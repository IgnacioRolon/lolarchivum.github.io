{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-25T03:19:35.917+0000","title":"Gemini - Champion Concept","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Champion Name: Gemini \nPronunciation: (GEM-IN-EYE) \n \nShort Champion Summary: \nShe was originally meant to just be a mage; but as I got further into designing her, I wanted Gemini to be able to play more than just the one role. Her kit gives so much utility that she could be an aggressive support or even a sustain top lane. \n \nChampions Statistics: \n\nBase Health: 495 Health \nHealth Regeneration: 6.7 Health Regeneration per 5 Seconds \nBase Mana: 260 Mana\nMana Regeneration: 5.8 Mana Regeneration per 5 Seconds\nAttack Damage: 50 Attack Damage \nAttack Speed: 0.640 Attack Speed \nArmor: 18 Armor \nMagic Resistance: 30 Magic Resistance \nMovement Speed: 330 Movement Speed \n \nChampions Passive(s), and Ability(s): \n\n**Passive: **\nGemini can hold up to 3 gems safely; however in total can hold up to 5 gems. With each additional gem after 3, Gemini loses movement speed drastically. For each gem, Gemini holds she gains increased magic damage. Gemini can only have a maximum of 3 gems on the field at once.\n \nIncreased Magic Damage: 4/5/6% Increased Magic Damage \nReduced Movement Speed: 20% per Gem \n\n\n**Ability One:**\nFire Gem: \nGemini can either place the Fire Gem on herself or in the field of battle. If the gem is placed on herself she gains magic damage on her auto attack which deal damage over time. If the gem is placed in the field of battle, it deals magic damage to all nearby enemies. Gemini can pick up the gem at any time by right-clicking on it. If Gemini is holding a fire gem already the cooldown is halved and she loses the fire gem she is holding. \n \nCasted on herself: \nMagic Damage: 5/7/9/11/13 Magic Damage per Second per Gem \n \nCasted in field: \nGem Health: 4 Hits \nMagic Damage: 35/55/75/95/115 Magic Damage per Second + (0.1 AP) \nAbility Range: 450 Units \nGem Range: 175 Units \nMana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90 Mana \nCool Down: 8/7/6/5/4 Seconds \n\n\n**Ability Two:**\nEarth Gem: \nGemini can either place the Earth Gem on herself or in the field of battle. If the gem is placed on herself she gains increased armor and magic resistance. If the gem is placed in the field of battle, it snares the nearest enemy champion. Gemini can pick up the gem at any time by right-clicking on it. If Gemini is holding a Earth Gem already the cooldown is halved and she loses the Earth Gem she is holding. \n \nCasted on herself: \nIncreased Armor: 5/7/9/11/13 Armor per Gem \nIncreased Magic Resistance: 5/7/9/11/13 Armor per Gem \n \nCasted in Field: \nGem Health: 4 Hits \nMagic Damage: 65/85/115/155/205 Magic Damage + (0.3 AP) \nSnare Duration: 1.5 Seconds \nAbility Range: 450 Units \nGem Range: 175 Units \nMana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90 Mana \nCool Down: 8/7/6/5/4 Seconds \n\n\n**Ability Three:** \nAir Gem: \nGemini can either place the Air Gem on herself or in the field of battle. If the gem is placed on herself she gains increased movement speed, and her first attack will slow the target. If the gem is placed in the field of battle, it reveals all stealthed targets and removes debuffs from any nearby allied champions. Gemini can pick up the gem at any time by right-clicking on it. If Gemini is holding a Air Gem already the cooldown is halved and she loses the Air Gem she is holding. \n \nCasted on herself: \nIncreased Movement Speed: 2/4/6/8/10% Movement Speed per Gem \nSlow Amount: 20/25/30/35/40% Slow \nSlow Duration: 1.25 Seconds \n \nCasted in Field: \nGem Health: 4 Hits \nAbility Range: 450 Units \nGem Range: 300 Units \nMana Cost: 50/60/70/80/90 Mana \nCool Down: 8/7/6/5/4 Seconds \n\n\n**Ultimate Ability:**\nGemini explodes all her gems, dealing magic damage to all targets wherever her gems are bound too. Gemini loses all gems she is holding and the ones that are placed on the field. \n \nMagic Damage: 60/100/140 Magic Damage per Gem + (0.2 AP) \nExplosion Radius: 200 Units \nMana Cost: 100/110/120 Mana \nCool Down: 120/105/90 Seconds \n \nWhy I think this champion is unique: \nThere are so many different options on how you can play, and react with Gemini. She can be played as a sustain, support, mage, possibly even in the jungle. Best part about her is she has so much outplay potential but she would be very difficult to play.","replies":[{"poster":"i am not noob","date":"2015-10-31T12:18:45.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the ult needs to be  120/230/340  + (0.8 AP )  other wise her ult will have no dmg late game","replies":[{"poster":"i am not noob","date":"2015-10-31T12:19:24.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=i am not noob,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Ek0Jrosd,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-10-31T12:18:45.819+0000)\n>\n> I think the ult needs to be  120/230/340  + (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 AP )  other wise her ult will have no dmg late game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-25T05:00:00.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath\nPronunciation:  ZER-ATH (ITS NOT X-ER-WRATH)\n\n(because having 100% reduced movement speed is a good idea(NOT))\n\nthat e is stupid, she gets a 10% movespeed buff just to get a 20% slow? genious\n\nthe e invis reveal aura should be like 500-750 otherwise its pointless","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-26T11:55:12.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure sweeping lens has 600 range and reveals invisible wards, and yet people still buy it over upgraded yellow trinket.\n\nSure, the 100 gold worth item has a huge range, but having a pink ward every 8-4 seconds is really OP, not even green wards from upgraded 200 gold yellow trinket recharge this fast.\n\nI think to use it to counter roam-invisibility champs like Shaco and Twitch (just get close to Evelynn), you'd need to stack it twice.\n\nIf it needs a buff, I'd recommend letting the gems come in charges, like a secondary bar instead of mana, and making her able to sacrifice extra gems to bypass cooldowns (activating early removes an extra gem per 2 seconds or something, out of the maximum of 10 gems, idk) for those sub-optimal yet versatile counters to champion abilities. This would let her be like Taric except more outrageous, allowing her to burst by spamming fire until she goes OOG (out of gems), then she'd be super vulnerable.","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-27T01:40:39.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice idea thank you. i was considering that when i was making her, but i wasnt quite sure if that would be considered too strong in teamfigh situations, and then would kinda make it not worth having the nuke on her ultimate. but thank you","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-27T12:25:51.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well obviously they should follow the rules Syndra and Azir always follow:\n\nMultiple instances either don't stack or do so inefficiently\n\nAnyways, at max ranks, if we made no cooldown cost 1 gem, then casting an ability twice at once would cost 1+(1+4/2)=4, so that would be nearly half her pool. So it sort of turns her extremely risky and her most reliably source of burst would probably require her to commit fully to killing an enemy by emptying her gems and leaving her vulnerable. I'm not sure how to balance this stuff, however. You'd need to higher the maximum gems allowed on the field though to increase flexibility.\n\nShe looks like a mix of Orianna, Heimerdinger and Sona, so people would probably find her reallyyy annoying\n\nAlso, how do you gain gems? The passive is a bit unclear, so you place them down, up to 3, and when you pick them up the immediately get used up and half the cooldown?","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-27T22:51:21.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i didnt make the passive that clear; but i wanted the animation to look when you pick them off the field, she like slowly absorbs them and then they like grow out of her body getting ready to be used again. but i can see what you mean by being able to hold more gems. ill look into it again :) thank you","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-25T06:47:42.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the e has a radius of 300 units thats 600 units in total in diameter. and it removes all debuffs and shows invisiblity. please explain to me how makin that have 1000 units in diameter a smart idea. not many things remove all debuffs from a champion and so for what that ability gives you dont want to make it op","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-25T08:02:40.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because no1 is going to stand in a 175 radius truesight thing invis, all other truesight spells and items are 500-1000+ diameter","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-25T08:10:25.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please read over it again, it has been edited atleast 4 times since its been made. and still youre not considering every other effect it gives. dont want too much gold value for a single ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-25T09:51:53.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you read over it again, I said the invis sight","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-25T09:53:44.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"youre making no sense. i think the way i put that ability is more balanced then the way youre. thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-25T23:56:03.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im over this, you obviously don't have half a brain.
