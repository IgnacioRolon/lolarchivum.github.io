Rohnen would be used as a support, mage or even a tank top lane. He would be hard to play but I think learning his mechanics would be fun.\r\n\r\nChampions Statistics:\r\n\r\nBase Health: 523 Health\r\nHealth Regeneration: 6.88 Health Regeneration per 5 Seconds\r\nPositive Charges: 5 Maximum\r\nNegative Charges:\t 5 Maximum\r\nAttack Damage: 54 Attack Damage\r\nAttack Speed: 0.670 Attack Speed\r\nArmor: 21 Armor\r\nMagic Resistance:\t 31.25 Magic Resistance\r\nMovement Speed:\t 330 Movement Speed\r\n\r\n\r\nChampions Passive(s), and Ability(s):\r\n\r\n**Passive:\t**\r\nRohnen gains different abilities depending if he has more positive or negative charges. Rohnen can have a maximum of 10 charges, 5 positive and 5 negative charges. If Rohnen have the same amount of charges or the maximum amount of both charges, he depletes one of the negative charges on his next attack, dealing increased magic damage and stunning the target.\r\n\t\r\nMagic Damage: 30/50/70/90 Magic Damage + (0.2 AP)\r\nStun duration: 1 Second\r\n\r\n**Ability One: **\r\nIf Rohnen has more positive charges, he attracts all nearby allies, both gaining an increase in movement speed, decaying over 3 Seconds. If Rohnen has more negative charges, he attracts all nearby enemy champions, dealing magic damage and slowing them for a short period of time.\r\n\t\r\nIncreased Movement Speed: 25/35/45/55/65/75% Increased Movement Speed\r\nSlow Amount: 25/30/35/40/45/50% Slow Amount\r\nSlow Duration: 1.5 Seconds\r\nMagic Damage: 70/90/110/130/150/170 Magic Damage + (0.4 AP)\r\nCharge Cost: 2 Charges\r\nCool Down: 10/10/9/9/8/8 Seconds\r\nPull Range: 400 Units\r\n\r\n**Ability Two:\t**\r\nIf Rohnen has more positive charges, he grants himself and nearby allied champions a health shield. If Rohnen has more negative charges, he lunges forward dealing magic damage to all targets, If Rohnen can cast more than lunge, it&#039;s cool down is completely refreshed.\r\n\t\r\nShield Amount: 70/85/105/135/175/225 Health + (0.2 AP)\r\nMagic Damage: 60/80/100/120/140/160 Magic Damage + (0.3 AP)\r\nLunge Range: 300/320/340/360/380/400 Units\r\nShield Range: 500 Units\r\nCharge Cost: 2 Charges\r\nCool Down: 8/8/7/7/6/6 Seconds\r\n\r\n**Ability Three:\t**\r\nPassively Rohnen gains increased magic damage on his auto attacks. If Rohnen has more positive charges he places a positive counter on the target. If Rohnen has more negative charges he places a negative counter on the target. Once the target reaches 3 charges, if they have more positive the target is stunned for a short period of time. If they have more negative the target takes increased magic damage.\r\n\t\r\nMagic Damage (on AA): 15/25/35/45/55/65 Magic Damage + (0.06 AP)\r\nStun Duration: 1/1/1/1.5/1.5/1.5 Seconds\r\nIncreased Magic Damage: 40/60/80/100/120/140 Magic Damage + (0.2 AP)\r\nCounter Cool Down: 5 Seconds\r\n\r\n**Ultimate Ability:\t**\r\nFor each nearby ally champion Rohnen passively gains a positive charge. For each nearby enemy champion Rohnen passively gains a negative charge. If Rohnen is by himself we will passively have a chance to gain a negative or positive charge. Rohnen can activate this ability to increase the amount of charges he gains drastically.\r\n\t\r\n(I wanted there to be an interaction with nearby characters, like a lightning tether of some type, which would show you who you&#039;re gaining charges from)\u000b\r\n\t\r\nPositive Charge: 1 Positive Charge per Ally per 3 Seconds\u000b\r\nNegative Charge: 1 Negative Charge per Enemy per 3 Seconds\u000b\r\nNo Nearby Champions: 50% Chance\r\nIncreased Charges: 300%\r\nCharge Range: 500 Units\r\n\r\nWhy I think this champion is unique:\r\nThere isn&#039;t any champion in league of legends which uses the resource system Rohnen has, or the interaction he has with enemies or ally champions. I think depending on your play style would depend how the abilities end up and I think he could be used very strategically.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-27T13:51:14.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove the chance from his ultimate, RNG is annoying. Also, his playstyle encourages unintelligent play. \"Oh hey we outnumber them, but now all I have are buffs to keep us alive just in case they pull out a miracle.\" \"We may be outnumbered, but I have a bunch of nukes so prepare to die from my 2v4 powers!\"\n\nAnd his passive, when he has even charges, how does he determine what abilities he has to attack with in the first place? I think it's be better for the system to be a 13 charge maximum, losing or gaining one charge means losing or gaining the other to keep the number at 13 total.\n\nMake his negative charges increase escape ability while his positive charges increase chase ability.\n\nAlso, we have no clue how he looks like or what his lore is. I don't even know if he's a guy.\n\nAnd finally, LoL always uses linear scaling. Cooldown should always be -1 , -1, -1 and not -0, -0, -1, -1 per rank. His scaling is also reaaaally bad in terms of ratios so I'd hardly recommend using him as a Mage. Soraka's has better ratios and brings more with a mid and not support build","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-27T22:48:25.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think RNG is annoying i know some people do; but i think it adds a chance to play differently. and i dont understand what you mean about the passive. i think its cool how you different charges depending on your positioning. but i cant understand the cds but with 6 points in each one i didnt want them to end up to low.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-28T08:28:31.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abilities always give the same stats per rank, it's never an increase right in the middle and nowhere else.\n\nRNG rarely ever does that... It only appears in crits which are core to ADCs, but rarely ever abilities. It tends to blur the line between skill and luck, unless it's an out of combat RNG, in which case it's just really annoying and your use encourages players to spam their low cooldown skills until they get lucky and get a lot of the charges they want while walking to lane or something","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-10-28T08:44:22.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"valid point. idk i play pokemon and its all about RNGS so i guess thats why i dont see the big deal in it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-27T03:13:58.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In League, champion design is typically based around comboing spells, and them working well together, in this kit I can't clearly see any type of fun combo anyone can do, possibly edit is so there is a combo somewhere in there to make him playable?
