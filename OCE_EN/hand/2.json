Though Reggae was designed to be a support, another option for him could possibly just be a shut down lane, a carry blocker which makes him viable for top and mid lane, potentially. \n \nChampions Statistics: \nBase Health: 495 Base Health \nHealth Regeneration: 7.2 Health Regeneration per 5 Seconds \nBase Mana: 280 Base Mana \nMana Regeneration: 6.8 Mana Regeneration per 5 Seconds \nAttack Damage: 56 Attack Damage \nAttack Speed: 0.660 Attack Speed \nArmor: 24 Armor \nMagic Resistance: 30 Magic Resistance \nMovement Speed: 320 Movement Speed \n \nChampions Passive(s), and Ability(s): \n\nPassive: \nEvery third ability Reggae casts gains bonus effects. A champion cannot have more than one riddle placed on them. If a riddle is casted onto a champion who already has one, the first riddle will lose affect and the second riddle will take its place. \n \nAbility One: Target is also granted attack speed which lasts for the duration of the ability. \n \nAbility Two: The increased damage is doubled. \n \nAbility Three: This ability can only be passed through my allies now, and does not have a cool down before re-entering the portal. \n \nUltimate Ability: The duration is extended and the controlled target can use portals. \n\n\nAbility One: \nReggae reverses the type of damage which is dealt and dished out to a champion target, for a short duration. This can be cast on an ally or enemy champion. True damage dealt will remain the same to and from the chosen target. \n \nPhysical Damage Changes to Magic Damage \nMagic Damage Changes to Physical Damage \nAbility Range: 475 Units \nMana Cost: 60/70/80/90/100 Mana  \nCool Down: 10/9/8/7/6 Seconds \n \nPassive Bonus: \nAttack Speed Increase: 20/30/40/50/60% Attack Speed Increase \n\n\nAbility Two: \nReggae inverses all movement and targeted spells casts from a champion for a short duration. While this riddle is in effect, the champion gains increased damage for the duration of the ability. \n \nAll Movement and Targeted Spells will be in the opposite direction. \nAbility Range: 475 Units \nIncreased Damage: 6/9/12/15/18% Increased Damage \nMana Cost: 80/90/100/110/120 Mana \nCool Down: 14/13/12/11/10 Seconds \n \nPassive Bonus: \nIncreased Damage: 12/18/24/30/36% Increased Damage \n\n\nAbility Three: \nReggae creates a portal to a targeted destination, which any ally or enemy champion can pass through. The portal cannot be used for a short duration after passing through it. The portal will remain open for 3 seconds. \n \nAbility Range: 500/525/550/575/600 Units \nAbility Timer: 1.5 Seconds \nMana Cost: 80/90/100/110/120 Mana \nCool Down: 15/14/13/12/11 Seconds \n \nPassive Bonus: \nEnemy Champions cannot access the portal. \nNo ability timer. \n\n\nUltimate Ability: \nReggae gains complete control over a single targeted or a short duration. While this is in effect Reggae cannot move, basic attack or cast any spells. \n \nAbility Range: 500/550/600 Units \nDuration: 4 Seconds \nMana Cost: 100/120/140 Mana \nCool Down: 180/150/120 Seconds \n \nPassive Bonus: \nIncreased Duration: 1.5 Seconds \nTarget can use portals \n \nWhy I think this champion is unique: \nThere isn&#039;t any champion in league of legends right now that doesn&rsquo;t do any damage with any of there abilities. Reggae ability can result in damage but none of them do direct damage or death. Reggae is meant to manipulate the battleground and make team fighting a lot more interesting.","replies":[]}
