Depending on the order she uses her abilities will determine the end result in her combo. Her ultimate is available from level 1. Lilly does not use are mana or attack speed, or any kind of resource.\n\n*Just to make this clear, the order in the abilities don&rsquo;t have to be like this for example: ( Q Q W, or W W Q ) to get the second effect. As long as you reactivate the ability again before the timer runs out you will be able to use the second part of the ability, no matter the order. AND to anyone who says no champion could work without having auto-attacks, i made a champion which could only choose one ability at the start and everybody called it rubbish, and then Azir came out a few months later and people love him. SO DON'T BE CLOSE MINDED ON THE CHANGE.\n\n**Champions Statistics:**\n\nBase Health:\t515 Health\nHealth Regeneration: 6.90 Health Regeneration per 5 Seconds\nAttack Damage: 54 Attack Damage\nArmor: 22 Armor\nMagic Resistance: 31.25 Magic Resistance\nMovement Speed: 335 Movement Speed\n\n**Champions Passive(s), and Ability(s):**\n\nPassive:\tInstant Combat\nWith each successful blow on any target, Lilli abilities have their cool downs reduced significantly.\n\t\nCool down Reduction: 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8 Seconds\n\n**Ability One: Typhoon Punches**\nLilli punches in the direction she is facing dealing Physical Damage.

This concept is very interesting, strategic and creative, literally. Though having no basic attacks hurts her early game terribly, being unable to efficiently farm and since she doesn't have {{item:1027}}  and {{item:1042}} , these stats in some items {{item:3078}}  become useless and if you have pretty terrible aim, you're going to have a heck of a bad time. However, since she doesn't need any {{item:1027}} or {{item:1042}}, her build path is more straight forward which allows her to focus in little stats instead of trying to balance out stats evenly. She's also got that untargetable thing from her Aerial Advantage and ultimate which allows her to safely escape danger or jump into the fray and over {{champion:268}} walls. If you have a good aim, you're going to have a wonderful time spamming your abilities. That passive is pretty much {{champion:13}} 's old passive but you need to hit things like {{champion:81}} 's Mystic Shot.","replies":[{"poster":"Hand","date":"2015-11-09T00:45:34.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks alot. i think this champion would have heaps of potential in competitive play.","replies":[]}]}]}
