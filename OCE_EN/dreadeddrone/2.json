I and many others in the game are finding it hard not to type abuse to each other during the heat of a battle. Unfortunately typing abuse can lead to account bans. I proposed an option players can choose to limit in-game chat themselves saving them from bans if they get angry and type abuse in game. People pay money for skins and many other things in game and having their account deleted isn&#039;t what they want to happen. Giving players the option of limiting their in-game chat ill help improve their behaviour, enjoy the game more as they can concentrate better &amp; not worry about losing their account. I know that hen I had a chat ban my behaviour improved immensely as I only as able to type 5-10 times during the game, not allowing me to get into arguments. If all players, especially those having trouble not arguing with other players, could limit their chat to only 5-10 lines during a game, the account bans ould not be necessary. To anyone at Riot, please pass this thought onto the right department.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-02-18T05:36:18.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings DreadedDrone,\n\nIts an interesting idea to have the option of setting a chat restriction on yourself, and it would come with its own set of pros and cons. If I may let me chime in my thoughts on how this may effect league.\n\n---\n\nOne of the key things to keep in mind is that with some people that are really toxic, no matter how often or how little that they can type in game, they will find a way to ruin the experience for other players in the way that they talk. At this stage this is where from my understanding account bans come in so that they can understand that this sort of behaviour ins't ok.\n\nNow if we look at it from this perspective, chat restrictions are there as a warning from Riot to start people on the path to reform. You are correct in the fact that it is hard to argue when you have limited chat messages, however the argument could be stated that putting this on yourself is a slight disadvantage because of how important communication is to the game. \n\nCommunication is a key part of every game, from calling out what objective to go for next, who to target in team fights, calling out wards, summoner spell timers and etc. In this sense ideally chat restrictions shouldn't be put on unless a summoner needs it to reform.\n\n---\n\nIt is interesting because Riot needs to find a balance with what is a good way to start people on the route towards reforming. If it's the case that you feel like this would be useful to have the option to have their chat restricted, they could always try to teach themselves habits mentally so that you think more about what they are typing and type useful information to your team along with positive encouragement/feedback. \n\nWith the system set up in the way it is with chat restrictions, I feel like this is what Riot is trying to achieve, to teach yourself these mental habits when typing during the chat restriction, that one once it ends these habits stay with you letting you apply it regularly in your games. One of the key ways I think this really sticks is because of the nature that someone has received a chat restriction, (in being reported) it really helps a person understand that what they are doing ins't ok according to the community around them. \n\nAs opposed to putting on the chat restriction yourself, while it may work for quite a few that have the right mentality towards it, people could always turn it off since it would be an option and go back to their old ways if they get frustrated because of it.\n\n---\n\nAll up, those are my thoughts on a system like that, I am curious your thoughts on the points I have brought up. If there is anything I can clarify on let me know and good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"DreadedDrone","date":"2017-03-08T04:50:54.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rubbish, restriction of type stops players, not matter how toxic, of typing abuse during the game. Abuse doesn't happen straight away, it happens after the player has typed a greeting and a fe nice comments at the start. The real abuse happens in game when a player fails to help during an important part of the game, or leaves the game because they are getting owned, leaving it a 4v5. There are many other instances here abuse can happen, these are just a couple of examples. Rarely does abuse happen at the start of the game except for a player ho maybe came into the game angry or had a bad last team/game. The main way a player ruins the experience is to be toxic in game chat, this is why I put forward my idea. Fair enough they can also ruin the game by feeding or going AFK, this is also reportable and their decision. But toxic typing in-game happens far more often making it a far easier thing to get in trouble for. I feel it is the best interest of the users of your game to be allowed to restrict their chat hen they feel others in-game a ruining their on experience helping to kerb the repercussions of replying angrily to a toxic player. It takes two to tango, sometimes more, it only takes one player to call another out for a misplay or not helping for two or even more to start at each other. This behaviour isn't reformed from banning their account, it makes no economic sense either as you're just losing player base. My point is that you already know chat restrictions work in stopping a player to be toxic so there is no harm in allowing these toxic players to restrict their on in-game chat to stop them from getting in trouble, this makes Riot look like the bad guy, and so you should, for not allowing players to reform with such an option as self-restricted in-game chat. TYPING/COMMUNICATION is NOT important in-game, in-game pings are important, by the time you've typed hat you plan to do in game its already too late, everyone knows this, thats why the top players use headsets in ranked 5s, but in solo queue there isn't much point. Chat restriction isn't about restricting hat other players are typing or shift-clicking, its about a player restricting the amount of words he can type in game as to stop being abusive. The players who turn of my idea of personal in-game chat restrictions and then get a warning can turn back of in-game chat restrictions to help them reform again. In-game chat restrictions works, the problem of toxic players rises again when the restriction is removed and players again have the freedom to type their mind, be it good or bad. You're not getting my point at all. People understand why they got the ban, but it doesn't reform them because theres so much toxicity in games as people get angry for a win, or are after the first win of the day yet they're losing etc. I've read all your points but they aren't valid in implementing the option of players having the choice to help them keep the account of their favourite game they love and feel very passionate about which is hat at times can lead to them becoming annoyed in-game and venting it through in-game chat. I beg you to seriously think about the implementation of my idea, even a trial, to see how it affects in-game abuse.","replies":[]}]}]}
