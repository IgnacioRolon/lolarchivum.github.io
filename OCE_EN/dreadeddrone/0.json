This along with a {{item:1056}} is enough to sustain mana for a decent amount of time. Running {{summoner:3}} against bursty mid laners is really useful for keeping him safe in lane, as well as turning trades due to the movement speed slow making your Q easier to hit. {{summoner:12}} Offers you bonus global presence with teleport ganks/cleanups or simply farm up items quicker/have safety and keep pressure in your lane.\n\n{{champion:30}} outranges many champs along with having short cooldown on his q. You always need to be ready to poke the enemy when they have cooldowns because Karthus effectively has nearly none in laning. \n\nHis power in the mid-game comes from your map awareness and communicating with your team to **Help** kill people. (Not necessarily hold for kill-stealing, but using it in a close fight or tower dive scenario in another lane in order to secure the kill without any casualties. Being able to have global presence as well as heavy pushing power/poke in sacrifice for little CC until the late game means you have to make the most of the strengths of his kit as explained above.\n\nHis W is a GREAT initiation tool in the late game. (When farming right you'll typically be ahead in levels (as well as due to global kill XP.) Its a huge slow which is great for catching a team that is overextended in conjuction with a good flank/hard initiation followup from your teammates. \n\nIn regards to being a squishy champion, this can definitely be adjusted with buildpath. Rod of ages/Seraphs both give him some  great HP stats/Shields with mana sustain for spell spam. Other common items are Rylais for the AOE slow (which has been buffed for his Area of Effect on E rather recently!) Your role of being able to position in their team and create a zone of pure damage and slows can seperate a team or deal massive damage, which realistically is your role.  Zhonyas even works well here for a flash bait into zhonyas for sustained E damage. Remember, your passive is an amazing ability when positioned right, but if positioned wrong it may come off as near useless without a good opportunity to Ulti. \n\n{{item:3003}}  Or {{item:3157}}  Or {{item:3027}}  Or {{item:3116}} Or  {{item:3001}}  Are all viable choices and can be picked up situationally. Abyssal/Zhonyas versus heavy burst/damage. Rylais to help CC/Kite and give HP, and either Rod of Ages/Seraphs Embrace as a Mana/Damage/Effective HP item\n\nThere are obviously many aspects of Karthus to learn and he is considered a hard champ to master. Give it some time and try some of the tips. If you've got any further questions I'd be happy to try and help.","replies":[{"poster":"DreadedDrone","date":"2016-05-22T02:55:27.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he has range, but has no defence vs melee and is killed always by melee in team fight. you're really only talking about karthus having a strong lining phase, but when it comes to team fights, he's just aimed and dies. His main damage is Q, but its a skill shot, like ezreals Q (kind of) and it misses more than it hits meaning your main damage is ineffective. \"Poke\" means nothin vs a champ that can dive on you, talon, yas, akali, the list goes on. Most of the time i use earths or play with a karthus on the team its a loss. Even with E up when getting dived on it doesn't save you from dying, also how does his Q compare to and ADC auto attacking you, well it doesn't, they just dodge your Q and keep shooting while out of the range of your E. He's not a champ you can just pick up and play, nor  is he a champ you can own on when learnt, I have played him heaps, hence this post as to even when mastered he is too easily beaten after landing phase.

His slow is pretty strong.\n\n> He has no hard cc meaning he is killed easily 1v1 and in group fights\n\nKarthus isn't meant to 1v1. He's a zone-control mage, so he controls the zone and forces teamfights the way he wants. Even if he dies in the process (as long as it's not straight away), he still has his passive in which he can nuke an entire enemy team, and his passive itself zones people away.\n\n> He can&#039;t farm as he is always pushed out of lane by any other mid lane.\n\nThere are 2 ways to play Karthus. Either complete man-mode as seen in Jensen's video (can't link atm), or smart and safe as seen in Easyhoon's games. Karthus has a lot of bad matchups but he can still do well if you know what you're doing.\n> Reasons why I want him made more viable:\n> \n> His passive and ult are a good idea, but his other kit, his QWE don&#039;t work with them to secure kills.\n> \n> He needs to be made tankier, more starting health and armour.

Why would riot make earths such a lame champ!?\n\nI'm not sure who Anita is, but Anivia's wall doesn't slow you for an enormous amount and reduce your resistances. Karthus' wall fits his kit just as Anivia's fits hers.\n\n> Make this a priority riot as karthus ult makes people want to play him, but when they get him in game he&#039;s fizzes away to nothing.  At the moment he has no early to mid game making it impossible for the game to get to late game where he may impact.\n\nThe problem people have with Karthus is he's difficult to learn. Everyone thinks it's just sit in lane until 6, press R and win the game because of all the old memes from way back when. If you watch someone who doesn't have great knowledge of Karthus and then compare him to someone like Easyhoon, who has experience with him, then you can clearly see all the little things that they do differently. Karthus has never been in a great spot but he's not a bad champion.","replies":[{"poster":"DreadedDrone","date":"2016-05-22T02:28:24.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I have played karthus heaps, hence my observations from so many losses on him even when I win the lane,.

Control the area with your enormous AoE damage, Q range and Great Wall of China. You do that, even if you do die you should be able to kill or do mass damage to the other team since you've got another 4 or 5 seconds (7 if you don't ult) after death on top of what you should have done while alive.
