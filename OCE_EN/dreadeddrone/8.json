When making a new rune page. riot, can you make it so that when I click the their 3 box only, that when I log on next time it stays that way. Its so annoying having to click on tier 1 and their 2 select boxes to remove those runes, every time I want to make a new rune page. Since I am level 30 I have no need for tier 1 or 2 runes so I don&#039;t want them showing up when I am making or redoing a rune page. The rune page would be a lot nicer to use then. Or maybe deleting runes with tier 1 and 2 completely when I hit level 30. Or even removing their 1 and 2 runes from the game , allowing only the use of the tier 3 runes, just calling them runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-08-31T18:10:06.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd also seriously love to be able to delete or sell runes. Why the hell do I need to keep looking at my crappy Teir 1 runes all the time? The fact that I only have a few of them as well and not enough to fill a whole rune page also triggers my OCD.\nPls let us delete these things!\nOr remember the option to hide them so I can pretend they don't exist\nThankss Rito ^^","replies":[]}]}
