Templar Iytsuna refused to help me in regards to my account suspension.  When I asked for a chat ban to be placed on my account so I can&#039;t get in trouble typing and save my account getting deleted Templar Iytsuna said its my fault if my account gets deleted.  This is not a suffienct action made by a paying customer.  I admit it can get heated in ranked games, especially with feeders, fakers and abusers, but I see the error in my ways that my typing to these players can get me into trouble which is why i asked for an option to switch off or reduce the amount or typing I can do in-game to save me from more reports.  It&#039;s a simple enough request.  Firstly I had my account chat limited and I noticed a marked improvement since I was unable to flame towards bad players. Now that I have full chat back in game I am worried I could flame again at another player and lose my account that I&#039;ve spent hundreds of dollars on.  As a paying customer I think the game should have the option of turning off in-game chat so I can&#039;t get abused and then in return abuse which is very easy to do in the game.  I do not want a reply from Templar Iytsuna as he/she gave me no help of any form.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T03:44:51.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As for turning off your chat, you can either /mute all when you get in game, or you can move your chat off screen where you can't see it.\n\nAs far as suspensions, unless a suspension is made in error it will not be revoked. Except in extreme cases, you will go through a chat restriction, then a longer chat restriction, then a 14 day ban, then onto perma. As I understand it it takes 3 months to drop a punishment tier. \n\n> Templar Iytsuna refused to help me in regards to my account suspension.\n\nSupport cannot help you, a suspension will not be revoked unless it was made in error. The support have no control over your client side settings and thus cannot turn off your chat for you. You and you alone are responsible for your behaviour in game.\n\n> I am worried I could flame again at another player and lose my account that I've spent hundreds of dollars on. \n\nIt is your responsibility to control your behaviour, if you have reached a point where you are being punished my a system that many consider to be lax, you need to take a good look at your behaviour and more importantly work on making it better. The whole point of RP is that once you have converted real money into RP it no longer has monetary value. You agreed when you bought the RP, and every time there is a patch with a new version of the ToS that if your account gets suspended you have forfeited the right to any and all content available on that account.\n\nIf you are worried you will lose your account, fix the problem. Riot cannot fix your behaviour for you, that is your responsibility and yours alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-05T06:43:34.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wtf am i reading.....this is like wanting riot to take away the knives in your house cos you think you'll stab people with them.....smh....","replies":[]}]}
