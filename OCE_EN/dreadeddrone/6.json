It&#039;s boring to clear and doesn&#039;t offer those lovely smite buffs that we got from jg camps in the old jg. THIS IS NOT AN IMPROVED JG! Anyone who agrees, please feel free to comment and hopefully we can get Riot to rectify this horrible changes to the jg.  The only buffs we get are from red and blue camps, jg clear lacks diversity. Also why remove Vision ward, thats how we actually beat the invisible champs!!?? STUPID CHANGES!\r\nP.S. The plants suck, so does the Talon and Rengar rework. This is for another post though.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-11-11T11:14:11.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah the plants are sorta boring, im ok with keeping them tho just give us back the smite bonus pls","replies":[{"poster":"DreadedDrone","date":"2016-11-13T05:04:17.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree. Getting jg camp buffs was very tactical for the jgler. You had to decide which camp to save smite for depending on the situation. Bird smite for ward sweeper. Smite kruggs to save health during jg camp clear etc. Do you smite this camp or save smite and go for dragon. It worked, I dont know why they changed it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"wheat ","date":"2016-11-11T14:10:06.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"game is fucked","replies":[]}]}
