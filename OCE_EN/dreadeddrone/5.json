Theres nothing that can be don about the crashes I know that, my problem is that I am unable to report abusive/negative players at the end of the game and they will keep getting away with it. I would like to see a system in place to make it possible to report these players after the match from the home screen. This means they won&#039;t keep doing their bad sportsmanlike behaviours even if my game crashes as I have the ability to report them out of end game stats page. Please do this riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-30T12:42:09.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried repairing yout client?
