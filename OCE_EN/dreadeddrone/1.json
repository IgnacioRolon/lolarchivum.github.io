I, and many players I&#039;ve talked to in-game are sick to death of you changing which runes and masteries work best with our favourite champs after every patch. I spend many games in normals working out which runes &amp; masteries are best on my champs so I can comfortably play them in ranked but then Riot changes the champs after most patches making me lose. Fair enough buff &amp; nerf champs to suit, but dont go changing the champs so much that I have to redo masteries &amp; runes after every patch. This affects my ranked climb as these rune &amp; mastery changes affect my game too much making me unfamiliar to the champs I&#039;ve played for so long. Those of you who read this please speak up, this is beyond ridiculous! I am really angry about this.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-24T13:44:51.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">but dont go changing the champs so much that I have to redo masteries & runes after every patch.\n\nUmmm, you have problems with your rune's/masteries setups, because i only change mine every few months, and can't think of the last time i had to do a major change to Rune's (and masteries you can simply tinker to suit each game anyway.)","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-24T14:02:55.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=gxHWzlAJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-24T13:44:51.613+0000)\n>\n> Ummm, you have problems with your rune&#x27;s/masteries setups, because i only change mine every few months, and can&#x27;t think of the last time i had to do a major change to Rune&#x27;s (and masteries you can simply tinker to suit each game anyway.)\n\nditto","replies":[]}]}]}
