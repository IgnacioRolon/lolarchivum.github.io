I don&#039;t disagree that I have typed some negative comments during a heated discussion towards others negativity including abuse, afking during a game, but this is what happens during some games.  I have requested from Riot to switch off my in-game chat to prevent me from typing negatively during a heated discussion in-game so I can&#039;t get myself in trouble. My problem is that Riot won&#039;t honour my request, a paying customer, who doesn&#039;t want their account deleted for some in-game banter.  They&#039;re happy to not restrict my chat and delete my account the next time I get reported. They prefer deleting my account as they get my money meaning if I want to play the game again I must start a new account with nothing and re-spend the hundreds of dollars to get the new account up to the stage my previous one was.  Quit the blatant revenue raising Riot and help a paying customer out by allowing the option of turning off in-game chat so they don&#039;t get themselves in trouble.  Just muting everyone before the game starts is such a waste of time, this also doesn&#039;t stop a player from feeding or going AFK. I have only heard of account deletion for people who have typed negativity during a game, what happens to people going AFK or feeding?! Nothing, I know of several troll players like this who go on doing this game after game with no repercussions. Whereas my problem only is typing negatively in-game (always towards the afkers and feeders) and Im on the verge of getting account deleted and they go on ruining the game for others.","replies":[{"poster":"Tim Tahm","date":"2016-02-04T00:35:10.505+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want chat disabled? Type /mute all when the game starts. Mutes everyone in the game so you don't see anything, alternatively I think you can drag the text box to the edge of the screen so you won't actually see it.\n\nBut no, this is not revenue raising by Riot. You don't have to pay a single cent to play this game. Any money spent is 100% your choice.\n\nAlso, report the players that AFK/Int. feed and if they get reported enough, they will be banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-04T00:32:51.514+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot most likely can't do something like that, even if they wanted to. Thing is, your behaviour is your responsibility, if you want to turn off your chat, then either mute everyone when you get in game, or change your settings so the chat is unreadable. Riot's only responsibility with regards to your behaviour is rewards for positive and punishments for negative. You and you alone are responsible for what you say in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emblade","date":"2016-02-04T00:32:49.844+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should Riot have to restrict your chat when you are fully capable of doing it yourself. There is an option in the menu which allows you to not see 'all chat'. Also there is a mute button in tab which restricts you from seeing any text. \n\nReal question is, who really is the opposing force here? You are capable of controlling your anger. I agree that afk'ers, trolls, salty people get on my nerve, you shouldn't be 'reactive' towards that type of behaviour. By doing so, that just makes you as low as they are. I generally mute as soon as I see a salty player, or troll or whatever. This also affect my gameplay and by doing so, my consistency has improved greatly!","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-02-04T02:06:31.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish I could add value here but both Tim Tahm (must be my new favourite Oz summoner name), Seras Dragon and Emblade have covered it perfectly.\nJust want to clarify something: while we really appreciate support from paying players because it's the only way for us to keep developing the game and create cool stuff for our players, in front of Riot's eye, there is absolute no difference between paying and non paying players therefore no difference in treatment will ever be granted.\n\nAs the other have stated: you are a grown person and fully responsible of your actions.","replies":[]}]}
