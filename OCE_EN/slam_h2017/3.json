That way it is still easy for solo laners to take the turret and open up the map but the base will still be protected with the barrier turret. \n\nAgree or Disagree?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-08T04:11:43.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea behind it is to make laning phase last longer, not about protecting the base. Rather than getting pushed out of lane, then when you come back you get ganked and thats it, your towers gone, hopefully they can last longer.\n\nIt is a tricky balance between rewarding a solo laner for smashing their lane and not letting towers fall due to 1 play. Which is why when you destroy a section of the new amour you are granted local gold.\nAlso the armour falls off after a certain amount of time, so it will hopefully not make the games take too much longer overall, but allow people to play in lanes a little longer.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/NPBRPjqf-preseason-dev-update-number-3","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-11-08T10:18:15.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another way to put, is normally when first tier towers are up, the tower facilitates bouncing back minion waves, allowing denial and lane dominance. When a tower goes down, it exchanges the ability to more safely and easily deny a losing laner the minion wave, in exchange for opening up the map, teamwide gold and the possibility of roaming and pressuring other lanes.\n\nBy adding a buffer to the first tier tower that is worth considerable solo lane gold, laning phase is extended, and winning lane becomes more profitable, since you can get alot of gold from the buffer, whilst also denying your laner gold and xp advantage by crashing and resetting freezes of minion waves. Creating a larger gap between the losing laner and the winning laner, whilst also keeping laners in their lanes and delaying the arrival of midgame teamfights.\n\nImo this shift feels alot more like DOTA2.","replies":[{"poster":"Slam H2017","date":"2018-11-08T21:50:25.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sort of sounds like even if you win lane and get a few kills you will just be spending the entire laneing phase hitting the tower, if you roam to another lane or something like that you will be missing out on a lot of gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-11-09T01:32:22.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you deny the enemy laner xp and gold, you eventually become able to towerdive them fairly easily. A longer laning phase actually creates a larger difference between the person who won lane, and the person who lost lane. \n\nRoaming has impact too if you roam to a lane, kill that laner, and then break 1 of the turret barriers. It can mean more gold as well as spreading your lead, but yes, it seems this change is intended to increase the focus on laning phase in the next season.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
