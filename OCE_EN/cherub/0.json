However it still says that I&#039;m still silver 2 100lp with no games played in my series, which I initially thought was just a bug and it hasn&#039;t updated yet, but it&#039;s been a few hours now and I&#039;m a bit concerned. Should I be worried about this? What can I do about it?\r\n\r\n-Thanks (:","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T03:14:15.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAccording to op.gg you're still currently in your series with 1 game left to complete.\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=cherub","replies":[]}]}
