Thinking about quitting after over a decade.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I&#039;m a very old-school MOBA player. I&#039;ve been playing MOBA&#039;s since the original Defense of the Ancients back on Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos in &#039;04. That makes me a longer player than many of our youngest players have even been on this Earth. And not once in that 14 year time span have I ever seen toxicity levels like I&#039;ve witnessed in the past few months. I&#039;ve been casually sitting around Gold V this season trying to push my way to platinum, but game after game over the past few months filled with horrible nastiness has seriously discouraged me and put me off.\n\nNow don&#039;t get me wrong, 14 years of playing in one of the most toxic gaming scenes has given me a pretty thick skin. Worst case scenario, there&#039;s mute buttons. Where I draw the line is when toxic players start deliberately throwing matches because they&#039;re more interested in excuses to flame people than actually winning. I mean doing things like deliberately sabotaging teammates by purposely hanging back in skirmishes or withholding support or disabling moves so that their teammates die and can then be flamed. For what&#039;s supposed to be a competitive team game, I&#039;m finding a lot more opposition from my own teammates than the actual enemy...who weirdly tend to be nicer and more sympathetic about the whole thing. I&#039;ve often found more support in the ENEMY TEAM!\n\nI&#039;d be inclined to just move on to Dota 2 (which I also know how to play), but fact is...that community isn&#039;t ANY better. It could be the end of an era for me...maybe I&#039;m just too grown up and mature now, don&#039;t have the patience for this shit anymore. But if something doesn&#039;t change, I&#039;m out. I always expected I&#039;d stop playing MOBAs because I&#039;d get bored of them, not because the community would get so nasty that I couldn&#039;t stand being around it anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"iliekboobs","date":"2018-10-16T13:30:39.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a Morde int after doing badly in lane. Ended the game with 15 deaths. Reported him. Nothing. He keeps playing the next day. It's a joke.

Been playing the last 5 seasons and this is by far the worst the community has ever been. Its a complete joke how disgusting the game has become. No teamwork, everyone trolls the game and there's no repercussions. Good bye riot. You have failed another player. I have played the entirety of the last season between plat 1 and plat 5 and its no different at all form either ends of the spectrum.\n\nYou practice, you play your role to the best of your ability, you carry the most part of your games, and there's still people who sit in brushes watch everyone have to play 4v5 and just absolute ruin the game with no consequences.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-10-17T00:05:33.285+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's because riot is more worried about what people say than how people play. \n\nYou can have 2 guys in every game for 30 games straight int your games and you have to stay cool and hope to have that 1 report you send have them banned but the second you lose your shit riot bans you, you try to explain it on boards and everyone says you have issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sw4g3ttiYoL0n4yz","date":"2018-10-20T12:12:04.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest it feels no better or worse now than it always have. Mute all and leave pings open every game, seems to work fine and everyone just assumes you can't speak English.\n\nNot a very social way to play but surely the only way to avoid these types of comms in MOBA or any other MMO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Xenos","date":"2018-10-17T22:49:58.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had two ARAM games in a row with toxic players. Just lovely...my efforts to be diplomatic and at least rally everyone else can sometimes pay off, but seriously...I get tired of people who have decided the game is over by level 9 and flame everyone about \"wasting time\" like \"native [sic] kids\", when ARAM is the most comeback-friendly game mode due to all the free gold you get. Trying to win a 4.5v5 because one of your teammates is half-assing it is a serious exercise in frustration that I shouldn't be experiencing while trying to have fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2018-10-16T16:12:09.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also played DotA since Reign of Chaos. I stropped playing it after they started changing the map, now been playing League for 3-4 years, I may not be good on LoL compared to what I am at DotA but I feel like DotA had less toxicity compared to what I have encountered this, but they won't do anything, while they are too busy changing everything else","replies":[]}]}
