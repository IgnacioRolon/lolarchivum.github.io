We love the implementation of the new champion select, being able to pick our 2 rolls we want to play and playing with more than 1 person. This update in my opinion is one of the best ideas Riot has implemented in to League of Legends and I hope for more to come. However my friends and I ( playing with a 4 man ) have encountered a common problem people have discussed in the past - AFK&#039;s. In one of our games our Udyr didn&#039;t connect to the game at all, we were 4v5 for the whole game. It&#039;s inevitable that we eventually lost. Through this my friends and I discussed about how Riot could do to improve their AFK system. This is why i&#039;m writing this.\n\nOur discussion was short and quick. We had 1 main idea that Riot could include in to their system although there are many variables that we don&#039;t know, which might affect this idea. However we thought it is a good idea. Since our Udyr didn&#039;t connect for the entire game, we thought that: If a player on your team doesn&#039;t connect or are AFK for an extraordinary amount of time the game shouldn&#039;t count. It sounds like it will work because there&#039;s nearly nothing to exploit however as explained before many other variables many affect this, but we concluded that it probably will work. I know Riot is a great company and will continue to improve their game. \n\nSincerely,\ntomzhangisSoBAD","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2016-02-07T02:55:48.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so 9 people go for a 20 min game or more get nothing out of it and try again. Atleast 1 in 4-5 games has an afk so you the whole of the people playing in this game would get nothing? When you say the game doesnt count what happens to the other team?","replies":[]},{"poster":"unluckybunny","date":"2016-02-06T09:55:09.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe, you lose less LP if lost and not receive the original amount of LP if won ( of course you get SOME, just not as much as you were supposed to if it was a 5v5 ) Honestly, there should be a reward to the players who won for using their time to play ranks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tomzhangisSoBAD","date":"2016-01-21T05:45:03.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops, i think i posted this on the wrong board, first time posting.
