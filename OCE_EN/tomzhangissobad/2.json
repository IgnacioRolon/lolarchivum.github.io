We love the implementation of the new champion select, being able to pick our 2 rolls we want to play and playing with more than 1 person. This update in my opinion is one of the best ideas Riot has implemented in to League of Legends and I hope for more to come. However my friends and I ( playing with a 4 man ) have encountered a common problem people have discussed in the past - AFK&#039;s. In one of our games our Udyr didn&#039;t connect to the game at all, we were 4v5 for the whole game. It&#039;s inevitable that we eventually lost. Through this my friends and I discussed about how Riot could do to improve their AFK system. This is why i&#039;m writing this.\r\n\r\nOur discussion was short and quick. We had 1 main idea that Riot could include in to their system although there are many variables that we don&#039;t know, which might affect this idea. However we thought it is a good idea. Since our Udyr didn&#039;t connect for the entire game, we thought that: If a player on your team doesn&#039;t connect or are AFK for an extraordinary amount of time the game shouldn&#039;t count. It sounds like it will work because there&#039;s nearly nothing to exploit however as explained before many other variables many affect this, but we concluded that it probably will work. I know Riot is a great company and will continue to improve their game. \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\ntomzhangisSoBAD","replies":[]}
