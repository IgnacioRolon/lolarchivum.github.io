I just wanted to talk about your lack of appearance at this years Eb Expo. I am a little sad and disappointed at the general feel and things to do at this years Eb Expo being in general rather lack lustier and upon my boredom I looked out towards the old LOL space from last year only to be left standing myself alone :({{champion:32}}. I just wanted to share that had OCE riot been there it would have been al right and I think alot of people will agree with me that that giant hall is quite lonely now without the fire and passion of the previous years of League of Legends at Eb Expo. I am not here to fight or argue and I understand that you have your agendas with stand alone events but as someone who had bought tickets months before I can&#039;t help feel a little disappointed at this. But I hope for a brighter future to come.\r\n\r\nSincerest Regards \r\nAsada sann","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-02T10:49:03.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you not paid any attention to OCE RIOT this year?\n\nThey've only made appearances at their own events like the Lunar Park thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Rêverie","date":"2015-10-15T09:32:20.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that, and I have made mention of that in my post I am simply sad that they didn't come to the expo as they have done for 3 years.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-15T10:08:12.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EB Expo isn't anything special to them.
