I was even privileged enough to Coach a OCE challenger team, brief though it was as the team disbanded and I was unlucky in that I came in at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nAnyways, to my point:\r\n\r\nWhat is going on with the toxicity in this game, with regards to, how and why am I still playing every game with some toxic child? I&#039;m certainly not the first person to encounter them, and certainly not the first person to report them. I understand that at times we may type inappropriate things from the safety of our bedroom, but you as a player know when you come across a kid who acts like this every game. To the devs, don&#039;t you just read the in game transcript and click the ban button? I know I&#039;ve given detailed feedback that suggests this person should only be allowed to play with people alike himself, and on that note, how many chances do they get? Like i said, it&#039;s at the point where  every game now my poor mother is insulted by a fourteen year old kid :P (mum jokes don&#039;t offend) but regardless it&#039;s still a pain to play with. My brother wanted to play lol but left shortly after on the sole basis that the community is disgusting. \r\n\r\nNow I know I&#039;m preaching to the choir, but as I said, do these kids even get banned, or is it just a facade placed before us to think the community is being bettered? Perhaps it&#039;s just me, but I do not believe that with the toxicity of some player that there needs to be a certain number of reports to identify if the person is in fact a social outcast, and to be perfectly honest I&#039;m at the point where I don&#039;t think the devs actually care, but I hope I&#039;m wrong.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s time riot created this league of children server, wherein if you want to act like a child, you play with other children and have a storm of toxic rain, it would certainly make for some entertaining youtube videos. But perhaps that&#039;s my vindictive side coming out, but hey, I play lol to escape an unpleasant reality, as I&#039;m sure many others do, and the last thing I want is for someone to intentionally ruin that to sate some sadistic tendency developed from lack of social skills.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Senders","date":"2016-10-05T15:54:30.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think some people didn't quite understand what I was meaning with my post.\n\nFirstly, and this may be insulting, but there's no excuse for being toxic, to the level I was trying to describe. Defending yourself isn't toxic so telling someone off or asking someone to stop being or doing something bad is not toxic. I was trying to talk about the ones who are without a doubt intentionally there to ruin your time. That is the sole purpose of their playtime, and my question is why are their so many, and how are they still allowed to play?\n\nEveryone's got a story of hardship, I wont go into detail but long story short, I got crumped in the army, now I'm crippled. The country that I was fighting for abandoned me (Australia) and if it weren't for my mates I'd be dead. Now I spent my days doped up on painkillers, fighting for fairness. LOL is my passtime, and I don't like it being intentionally ruined. Despite my current position I am not toxic, rather helpful actually.\n\nSorry if there was this misunderstanding about the definition of 'kid' and the level of toxicity. My term for kid is \"stop acting like a child\" it's a maturity thing, not an age thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-05T09:05:22.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes me laugh when people call me \"kid\". \n\nBut I'll happily tell someone to stop feeding if they're feeding.

Last year I turned 16 and my mum decided to kick me out of the house shortly after that one of my best friends died I was stressed enough with trying to find a flat I even went homeless a few days so this year the start of the year wasn't too bad I got myself a mate to live with and school was going fine. I started getting bullied in school constantly by the same group of people you could say just tell the teachers well that's the thing I told the deputy principle and my school Councillor and they didn't do much other than tell them off but heres the thing too when they got told off then they would get their friends to pick on me and I'd get so enraged and I'd want to kill them sometimes and if id ever react for some reason id end up in more trouble than them I stopped going to school and started failing the year and I got expelled for not going to school anymore. I even went to see a psychiatrist and he told me I had severe depression I even have a letter from him to prove it so. I play league every night which I find a very fun game to spent time with my friends and some games I just can't help but get angry and toxic because of what happened to me and I try honestly I do try but some games I can't help it now I'm not here to brag about my life story but I'm just here to tell you there is a reason behind every players toxicity sure you have no right to be toxic I can definitely agree with you, but you need to keep in mind that no one is toxic because they find it fun being so. and yes players do get banned when they get toxic I've been banned so I can't play the game anymore.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is you shouldn't be hurt by toxic players all very much you have no idea what in the world they are going through, sorry to have to explain my story I really didn't want to I just want to get the community to know that yes you have no excuse for being toxic but they shouldn't be getting too upset over toxic players and they shouldn't take it to heart when they get angry at you.\n\nPeace {{champion:43}}","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-05T08:14:01.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

Forget restricted queue, bring in limbo queue, where guys that have terrible behaviour are only matched with each other, not the other players in ranked. Players that were in this queue would only escape if they improved their behaviour.\n\nOf course this won't happen though because the result will be a bunch of badly behaved kids raging more at each other before quitting the game for good, bringing down the playerbase and therefore not buying more items from the shop. Great for the game, but not good for RIot's business = not gonna happen.\n\nAs a side note, for all of those players who use all kinds of excuses (mental issues, bad homelife, poor education) to defend their toxicity, don't bother.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-10-06T06:33:12.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes me laugh when people hyperbole the toxicity of this game.\n\nI am one of these 'toxic' players that you're taking about.

Maybe you could try managing your illnesses instead of using them as an excuse for your behaviour.\nThat you are making *your* problems the problems of people forced to play with you is inexcusable. Your problems aren't ours so stop making them ours. That's just selfish and self-indulgent. \nI really don't give a shit what's going on in the lives of the people I play with. Their stories mean less than nothing to me. I'm not here to hold their hand and play councilor. I'm here to play a game and, win or lose, at least get something positive out of it so next game is a better game for me.\nAmongst other things that creates a losing atmosphere, it pisses me off when people allow personal mental issues that exist outside the game to influence what happens *in* game. If you can't leave your crap at the door, crap that can affect the outcome of the game, then don't play. Full stop. \nThis may be news to you, but the game isn't just about you, or just for you. Go play a single player game and stop deliberately screwing over people playing games where the outcome relies almost totally on team cooperation.\nSometimes you just have to accept your personal limitations, like them or not. No one ever promised a fair life.\nYou might think what I've said to be harsh but consider this:  People don't hit 'Play' so they can have your issues and the issues of others like you forced upon them. I can promise you it's **not** what I play for. \n\nSo why do you think is it OK for you to force your issues upon us? Especially considering Riot themselves have told you on numerous occasions, by banning account after account you have created, that they don't think this game is right for you?\n\n**If you know full and well you have uncontrollable mental issues that often affect yourself and, by association, other people playing with you during competitive gaming sessions, and you insist on continuing to play those games, then you are the posterchild for what this community does not need or want.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-06T07:54:11.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend you find treatment for your illness. \n\nIssues like this may escalate if left untreated or remain for extended periods of time (which will greatly impact your life).

Just scroll down the PB board and you'll find countless posts, either people complaining about their ban, or asking how to reform their behaviour.\n\n\nYou also said:\n\n_\"I do not believe that with the toxicity of some player that there needs to be a certain number of reports to identify if the person is in fact a social outcast\"_\n\nThe system doesn't really work like that, I'll clarify briefly here:\n\n + Bans by the IFS don't require multiple reports for punishment (although multiple reports in a row is a warning sign that something is wrong). Instead of report quantity, the IFS is more focused on evidence. \n\n If you report someone and their chat logs show clear evidence of unacceptable behavior, then the system will issue punishment. Even if that player has never been reported before.\n\n__*\n\n_If the Instant Feedback system working well, why do I still see \"toxic kids\" in every game?_\n\nGreat question! There's two main reasons for that:\n\n+ You actually touched on part of the answer when you said this; _\"I understand that at times we may type inappropriate things from the safety of our bedroom\"_.\n\n Your average League player might only flame once or twice a year, and maybe get very salty 5 - 6 times a year.\n\n The issue is that in the space of only 10 - 11 games you'll encounter almost 100 different players. Suddenly the chances of encountering a toxic player at some point become really high.\n\n This is where the majority of League's toxicity comes from, just people having a rare bad day. The really \"toxic kids\" only account for around 10% of toxicity. \n\n\n+ [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) also plays a big role here.\n\n Even though you claim you're _\"playing every game with some toxic child\"_, I know you're just exaggerating. It might seem like that some days, but that's only because the impact of negative experiences is greater than positive ones.\n\n If I just think back to early childhood, I instantly recall more negative experiences. League is the same, when you look back on the previous day you're more likely to remember the toxic game, than a game which went smoothly.\n\n  Our fellow Emissary **Sera's** has a really cool exercise you can do to track your Negativity Biases. Check it out [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/xvZeJNIU-riot-please-try-to-fix-your-community?comment=000100000000).\n\nI hope that clears things up, feel free to reply with any comments or questions.\n(Also your military service experience was very touching, thank you for sharing it with us :D)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2016-10-06T02:45:49.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the toxicity in this game has been nowhere near as bad as I'd expected. I'm a total noob, still a few levels off 30 and terrible at the game, so I don't know what it's like in ranked, but for the most part in normals it's been okay 80% of the time.
