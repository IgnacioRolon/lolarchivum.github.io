Here's what I think you might enjoy playing anyways though.\n\n1. Viktor. He has a lot of damage, and scales really well at all stages of the game like Azir.\n\n2. Heimerdinger. His turret mechanics are a basic version of Azir soldiers in a way. He also has a super dominant laning phase against melee champions, like Azir.\n\n3. Lee Sin. He's not a mid-laner but he has similar play making combos to Azir's Shurima Shuffle. Look up \"insec combo\".","replies":[]}]}
