And that could get confusing for people who don't play against Vel much.\n\nI suppose it works a bit like Graves's ult, it fires in a line, but spreads out at the end (just like Vel's one), and Graves's ult doesn't have an indicator. \n\nWhere Zac's one is very similar to Aatrox's Q, which does have an indicator. \nThat is my speculation.\n\nVery few non-charged skillshots have range indicators, which would made Vel's Q the weird exception, until it was taken away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-12-14T01:28:39.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"velkoz q is a lot easier to dodge","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-14T01:35:20.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which has 0 to do with the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-14T01:46:26.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=QHQ94RY7,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-14T01:35:20.330+0000)\n>\n> Which has 0 to do with the issue.\n\nbecause unlike fizz e and hecarim w and zac e, the animation clearly follows the path of the damage, while zac e and etc he player couldn't accurately determine the damage zones. Plus, if vel q had an indicator, it would literally be impossible to hit anything other than a complete retard as the delays on the spells motion are so long as it is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-15T00:09:54.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because you dont get hit by a velkoz Q from the other side of the map out of fog of war, it doesnt knock you up and is way less impactful than getting hit by a zac jump. its also much more predictable i mean its a line you know its gonna be splitting from the original skillshot line. also it landing does not gaurentee the rest of velkoz abilities are going to land like zacs ability sets him up for. sure it slows and helps him hit the rest but its not a gaurentee\n\nhope this answered the question for you=)","replies":[]}]}
