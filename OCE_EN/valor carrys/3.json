But his clear speed of the whole jungle is phenomenal!\nHowever this clear speed along with the slow respawn times of camps, means that in a game where all 3 lanes are pushed, you can do literally nothing!\nYou have to wait ages for the camps to re-spawn, (falling behind on gold and xp the whole time), you cant even use this time to effectively counter jungle, because you can only really conure jungle when you have smite, and even then, you can only take 1 camp because if you run into Lee Sin, you're actually fucked. \n\nIvern also loses out on creep score when taking Krugs, because he cant explode them into smaller ones, he is only gets 2 CS instead of 10. (and i think he gets less gold and XP too. but I'm not sure)\n\nI find the scrying plants useful, ward denial is a useful tool. But the other plants seem a little pointless imo. The honey fruit is useful, but is 100% luck, and its main purpose is to give a extra boost to counter junglers crossing the river (and in my opinion counter jungling is already too strong).\nBut I hate the exploding plants, all they do is give champs who couldn't usually chase you over walls, an easy way to get over the wall, which in a way, nullifies the advantage champions with a dash have over champions without a dash. \nThe exploding fruit also is more a tool for counter junglers than anyone else, when they get caught out, they can easily escape into the river or dragon pit, and leaves the team that caught them out, with nothing (less not nothing actually because they lose out on lane farm and xp, chasing the invader)\n\nSo, imo there are a few good things in the new jungle, Krugs and raptors are great in mid and late game for some quick gold, for a team that cant afford to push. \nBut I think the new jungle helps counter junglers too much, and imo, those are the champs that don't really need any help.\n\nJust my 2 cents, from a mid laner  haha xD","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-12T00:41:41.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I find the scrying plants useful, ward denial is a useful tool.\n\nThe issue again, is what they replace, now you only have to use 1 auto to take an enemy's vision denial/gaining instead of going into the enemy jungle to use a smite.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:20:46.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i prefer'd smite buffs for wave clear as they gave more strategy, if i think they r invade, wolf smite, if im low mana, clear blue and smite it early so i have mana to clear it with, am i low, red smite heal, do i need auto power against monsters (or pushing a lane) krugs, (gromp was pretty useless to me) now we got heal, jump, and see, eh, doesnt feel that fun, all they did was add more troll potential","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-10T15:25:45.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The buffs are fine, but the krugs and raptors basically demolish anyone without fast clear aoe clear speed. It's not a question of whether or not a jungler is viable but rather is it effective and the answer generally rests on a jungler's clear speed. \n\n\nMost junglers can easily do blue side without any leash nowadays but when it comes to the red side a rather large number of junglers will find it's only efficient to clear the red and then just recall, scuttle or look to  gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-11T05:13:51.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just miss raptor buff and also not getting near executed by the jungle if I try to powerclear on certain champions. You used to be able to decide how to clear depending on the game type but atm if you're not well versed in your jungle champion and their clear kiting patterns, you'll need to take a break to get a honey fruit (which can be quick or very slow) or risk getting very low in the jungle. \n\nNow some junglers can clear the new jungle exceptionally fast and with almost full hp and mana but other poor clearing junglers and non-meta junglers can have a pretty hard time if they start bot, especially now that they can't hit lvl3 off kruggs  (now I know having the jungler at lvl3 whilst laners are about to hit lvl2 is stupid broken) which means they have to try to fight raptors at lvl2 or skip them. Skipping them means you'll have to go back for them later on farm junglers and also means you'll be tackling blue buff without a smite which is risky if the enemy jungler invades.\n\nI don't have too much issue clearing the jungle since I generally play champions with excellent clear or the champions I play with poor clear, I'm well versed in how to kite with them but I've seen alot of people get executed, even in silver-gold level ranked games cause the jungler tries to take raptors and doesn't have an indepth understanding of how to clear efficiently on their champion, or the damage that raptors can put out if you don't have the correct runes.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-11T05:26:05.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if you miss Raptor buff you should have used it more.\n\nThe reason on smite buffs were removed was because come mid to late game (even late early game) the buffs weren't being used or taken.\n\nAnd even in the rare cases that they were being used it was always Raptor buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-11T05:33:05.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the issues where kruggs buff wasn't really necessary later on the in the game since most junglers could easily clear by then.

So I guess riot was right when they said the community didn't know what smite buffs did.
