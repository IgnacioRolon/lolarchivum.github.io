We aren’t looking to censor anyone, especially if there is feedback for Riot. \n\nWe want the boards to be a place about discussion and shared interest in league of legends. Not a place where we just hate on others. There are other avenues to report players such as player support and the end of game lobby.\n\nIf you want to have a discussion about behaviour or systems, make it an image and as untraceable as possible to illustrate your point. But please do not just straight up post a player's info or start a discussion to hate on a player, that’s not what the boards are for.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/vzZ3f\n\nAs soon as threads start to become witch hunts instead of discussions we will look to delete the thread or comments in the thread.\n\nIn this scenario we overreacted as after the clean up of the image players were still pointing out that it was easy to find the accused player.

The amount of absolute newbies. I'm not talking about your average bronze 5 player, I'm talking about your average level 1 player - IN RANKED! That's right, the number of people that have bought a level 30 account this season to jump straight into ranked is astounding!\n\nHow do I know? Well for a start, these players don't farm AT ALL. I'm not talking about 30cs at 10 minutes, I'm talking 10 cs at 20 minutes!\nThey also walk around aimlessly as adcs and attack the first target they see. They have no clue how to build. In one of my recent games we had a Sivir in the mid lane with courage of the colossus mastery and built tank items. It was by a great fluke (no, not skill) that our team won the game.\n\nThese players don't even know how to communicate with the team by even typing or pinging. These players don't have a prior seasons history on op.gg. They don't have proper runes or masteries set up. And they know nothing about the game.\n\nI guess when you can just buy a level 30 account for $10 at sites like PA (that's right its not naming or shaming, its a pseudonym - don't remove this post), and there's over 500 accounts to choose from in the oce region you know that a couple of things haven't happened.\n\n1. Bots are not being killed fast enough (hire someone to do it!).\n\n2. Account trading sites that display full summoner names are not being shut down properly (hire a person!).\n\n3. Matchmaking is pathetic. I've been a silver support main the past couple of seasons and placed 2-8 in placements = Bronze 5. Climbed to bronze 4. And now its 50% win 50% lose, depending on these newbies in games. And it seems to me that although the opposition sometimes get these newbies also, that more of the time our team has them (would say 80% of the time). Is that Riot's way of saying that you have to carry because you have silver mmr, even though you are a support main?\n\n4. Boosted bonobos haven't returned to their rightful levels. So many Gold 5 players that are absolute trash, like worse than your average bronze 3 player. How I know? I'm a former analyst for OOL and OCS teams. So don't criticise my rank, mechanics have nothing to do with my understanding of the game. I guess this is because its going to take a long time for these boosted bonobos to calm down from their dynamic queue boost.\n\nHOW TO FIX THIS?\n\nHire someone to activity be paid that goes around nuking bots for one, closing accounts that are in the process or being sold secondly, and deleting those int feeders from the game.
