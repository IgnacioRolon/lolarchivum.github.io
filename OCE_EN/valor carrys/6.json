And I don't know who the girl on the far right is supposed to be, is she Poppy or Taric? Either way, she clearly isn't of the same species or sex as the characters. Not to mention, if you look closely, none of them are wearing body-wears belonging to the champs beyond their icons (Ashe's bow and arrow for instance).\n\nThey are not supposed to represent the champions themselves, but the players who fancy them. Think of them as cosplayers if you will.
