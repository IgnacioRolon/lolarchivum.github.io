Although I also think some players struggle differentiating very formal responses from a copy-paste. For example [this guy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/7bM8XRPq-does-riot-never-fix-their-bugs?comment=000100000000). \n\nIf Riot really did just slap a copy-paste on you for a legitimate question, then calling them out here is a good idea. The 'naming and shaming' rules don't apply for un-satisfactory Riot Support service :D","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-22T01:13:28.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That guys thing that you linked, is clearly a 2nd-3rd response.\n\nI put in reports constantly, and am constantly given copy paste answers, some that are even irrelevant to the question i have asked, simply cause i have hit a key word early.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-22T02:48:14.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, but he said he _\"never\"_ got an actual response. Yet it's pretty clear that the message he received was in fact a handwritten response and a not copy-paste, but it seems he couldn't tell the difference.\n\nEither way, what you're saying sounds pretty bad :( I've never heard of someone getting an irrelevant copy-paste. I'd be happy to bring it up with some of my Riot Support contacts for you if you want though. I just need the [ticket ID](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests) to send them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
