They talked about how compared to other game modes normal draft didn't actually have that many people playing it which would often lead to bad game experiences. \n\n---\n\nAlong with this I think that the main reason that we don't have draft pick in OCE is because of our small play base. Currently if Riot were to give us draft queue that would split up the player base more than it currently has game mode wise and make queue times even longer. This is a difficult issue to handle, while I am sure you want to play these game modes, we don't want people waiting for minutes on end just trying to find a game. With it set up this way Riot has done a lot of research and testing to find a good middle ground between the game modes that are the most popular and queue times.\n\n---\n\nAs for facing the same champions every game, in my personal gameplay I rarely run into the same champions twice in a row when I am playing blind pick with friends. Yes there are flavor of the month champions that you will run into more often, but this can be a good thing as it is good practice to vs them in case you have to go up against them in ranked. Along with this normals is a much less stressful environment, so it lets you experiment with ways to counter these champions as well. \n\nSo in my opinion while yes you will run into a lot of people playing strong champions in normals, its not every game, and if you have the right mindset it can be a good learning experience for when you play ranked.\n\n---\n\nAs a side note, you noted that you don't want to play ranked during the school holidays, may I ask specifically your reason behind this?\n\n---\n\nAll up I hope this helps give a bit of insight into the reasoning behind why this is the case with not having draft queue on OCE. If there are any other questions I can answer or any other ways I can help let me know. Good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-15T11:23:16.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What's so bad about Draven besides his damage?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-01-15T10:02:29.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"real talk uninstall my dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-15T00:12:04.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"they have removed Draft Normals from most other servers.
