Joking about suicide, illness and provoking said issues is a real problem in the community. This goes beyond bullying and more into encouraging self harm. The community is so large that it can never be stopped entirely. I also tried to post this issue on a Facebook page but it was taken down due to the sensitivity of the problem. All I am saying is that there needs to be more of a solution than the mute button.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-14T07:22:50.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the solutions (other than the punishment systems Telecasterdude mentioned), is to play in a premade 5man team. If you play in a premade 5man group, you are less likely to have a troll on your team.

For me it doesn't happen often but when people are just extremely over the top toxic it stops being a game and just starts being a violent bully ground where people just try and hurt others as much as possible. I usually just try and get people to calm down or defend someone who is getting picked on. Although I admit a few time I have just muted someone and kept playing my lane. I do think something needs to be done. Seriously I wouldn't mid having an option to just kick a player, I mean we would loose but at least we wouldn't have to put up with them. but there would need to be safe guards to make sure players didn't kick someone who was just having a bad day and messed up resulting in a fed fizz or something. It would need to check for curse words and maybe even send a report to a person who could look and see what was going on. I thought a cool Idea would be to go into a separate queue to get subbed into games that had people kicked out, you would start with the same champ that was being played, in the same position, and try and make the best of it. I am sure there are many problems in this and I am sure people are gonna be like ooo stop giving your stupid ideas... and such like, because that's just people. but for the ones who actually care and are interested :) have a good day! .. night... or whenever you read this :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-14T06:52:50.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current automated punishment system we have right now, is actually very effective at picking up on verbal harassment.
