Now if you see him pushing it is with Banner of Command in a norms or if someone is trolling etc. He is only really good for peeling and disengage with some kill potential in lane. Max HP scaling, which is a part of many champions (not just Zac) e.g Braum, Taric, Voli and others... would greatly benefit Alistar's jungle clear. \n\nMy suggestion, take it or leave it... is Max HP scaling on his passive (even if it was negligible), slightly lower AP ratios on his Q + W, and instead of 70% reduced dmg- 70% increased armor/MR for the duration or something.\n\nHis passive, Trample, implies he is running his enemies afoot which doesn't really make sense to deal more damage from him building Ability Power... if anything his health which could equate to his toughness/size/constitution would make his trample more devastating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-18T02:29:45.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alistar wasn't made as HP tank like Zac, he was simply made as a cc machine.\n\nHe was originally classified as a \"pusher\" who excels in taking down turrets, hence to why he is given aoe heal, knockback, aoe knockups and cc removal with bonus ad with some tankiness.\n\nHe was made as a minion wave gatherer and a turret diver, instead of an hp sink or damage dealer.\n\nHe has Some AP scaling but they aren't consistent enough to become his highlights, unlike his cc potential, but they're there though and I think bruiser Alistar is still viable in the right hands. \n\nI don't think he needs an hp scaling on his passive, I don't think people generally stack too much hp on him either, mostly some hp, cdr, mana and some ap with sheen or other support items I think.","replies":[]}]}
