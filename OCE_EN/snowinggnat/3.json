My proposition is to change that to 7 + (1 x his level) (+1.25% of his HP) magic damage. \r\n\r\nNot only does this make more sense as he is meant as a tank more so than a mage but it gives him back some of the strength he lost so long ago (mainly to get back into the jungle).\r\nIf people think this is too much think about how it currently works... if Alistar builds full AP then it does A LOT of damage and since his combo primarily consists of 2 abilities (of which are CC) you can't really do anything about this damage, you just have to take it. If Alistar builds tank/support/AD then it does next to nothing and may as well not even be there.\r\n\r\nWith this change it will enforce the idea of 'get the hell out of his way' further which in my mind is how he should be treated. \r\n\r\nPossible but not entirely recommended changes to his kit could be:\r\n-slightly higher mana cost on his Pulverize ability (Q). \r\n-his Triumphant Roar (E) could increase allied minion movement speed as well as heal\r\n-it could also fully reset CD if an enemy champion dies nearby rather than just the normal 2 seconds\r\n-reduce the AD buff on his ult 60>75>90 to 50>70>90","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Kotekar","date":"2015-01-20T07:24:30.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IIRC Riot is already working on a change like this?
