Please, pretty please change his passive scaling from AP to Max HP scaling. My thought process behind this was not only that it would enhance his gameplay as he is meant as a tank (sorry to all those who think otherwise but it's true) but also it would make sense i.e if health means that you are somewhat 'bigger' (in the case of Zac it is) then his larger size (his health) should equate to his trample being more deadly. If you kinda see where I'm coming from or like the idea please comment and upvote etc. I really like Alistar and his update is the sex but I really dont like the spot he is in right now which is either full support or mage cow.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-03T09:42:27.794+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"More health, I suppose you could say...
