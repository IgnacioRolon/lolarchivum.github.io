If you were to be trampled on, would it hurt more if the thing trampling you was bigger or smaller?\r\n\r\n2. If you could attribute HP (health) in LoL to one of the following words which would it be? [Size, Strength, Toughness, Other]\r\n\r\n3. Why is it that Sejuani, Braum, Taric, Maokai, Malphite, Nautilus, Shen and Zac all have HP scaling?\r\n\r\n4. Does Alistar strike you as a mage/wizard/sorcerer/magic user? Or as a juggernaut/tank/meat shield/marauder/bulldozer?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you answered:\r\nBigger. Size. Because max HP is a relevant stat to them and it helps their kit (or something along these lines). Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nThen you know and respect Alistar as I do. And would love to see him have his passive reworked from AP scaling to max health scaling.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to hear ALL criticism/feedback as I am passionate about this change.\r\n\r\nxoxo","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-16T05:11:08.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
