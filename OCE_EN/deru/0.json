We won 6 lost 4 and I got placed bronze 1 and he got placed silver 4. Neither of us have done 3v3 placements before so can someone explain why he got a higher rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-18T11:51:34.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given that Riot's calculations are hidden it could be a few different things. As far as I know though your initial TT ranked mmr is tied in some way to your SR ranked mmr as a starting point instead of starting with fresh mmr since the queue isn't up much.\n\nI got placed into G5 in TT with average win loss which makes sense from my SR rank but not from a fresh ranked (Silver 3-4).","replies":[]}]}
