I played my 5 games, wasting a total of 25 minutes being in queue when I could be playing with my friends. I play about 10 games, when then, I get a internet blackout where it&#039;s my internet provider&#039;s fault. Even though I&#039;ve played 10 games, which is quite a fair amount per se, I get yet another punishment of 10 minutes extended queue time for 5 games. I played those 5 games, a total of 50 minutes wasted. \r\n\r\nThe next time, after playing around about 15 games, guess what? Firewall error, I have to keep trying to get past it, I have to log out, restart my computer, fix my firewall when I realise restarting my computer doesn&#039;t help and then I finally try to reconnect. And I do, but yet, I get another queue time ban. Of 20 minutes. For 5 games. That&#039;s a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes sitting in queue. Doing nothing. \r\n\r\nThis type of punishment which leaver buster gives might help people try and not leave the game, in some cases, but to those who want to play the game, when they have less time to play as each year passes by, they want to just play it for fun. For the fun of it. Waiting in queue isn&#039;t fun. It&#039;s discouraging.\r\n\r\n I think it honestly that if something isn&#039;t changed, people who are affected by 20 minute queues might quit playing LoL. the amount of time waiting in queue is just undeniably too long.","replies":[{"poster":"Xelythia","date":"2015-05-22T14:28:24.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Alright, I think I've just about had enough of LoL, time to move onto another game.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-22T14:35:03.316+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xelythia,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sgyv7b4y,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-22T14:28:24.350+0000)\n>\n> Alright, I think I've just about had enough of LoL, time to move onto another game.\n\nyou won't be missed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-23T02:09:04.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that because we'll have one less leaver or because he'll be back by Monday?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-23T03:13:27.807+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not both?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xelythia","date":"2015-05-23T12:40:50.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't plan to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-05-23T09:09:59.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing video games for over 15 yrs.\n\ni've played wow, battlefield, star-craft, dota.. you name it i've prob played it.\nwant to know how many times i've had net issues that weren't my fault?  3!\n\nthat's right just 3. and i can even give you the reasons for those issues.\nand the total amount of net issues i've had combined i can still count on both hands.\n\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here, is that maybe you should be looking at what could be improved on your end before you condemn riot and their servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-23T16:13:42.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exhausted,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sgyv7b4y,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-05-23T09:09:59.281+0000)\n>\n> I've been playing video games for over 15 yrs.\n> \n> i've played wow, battlefield, star-craft, dota.. you name it i've prob played it.\n> want to know how many times i've had net issues that weren't my fault?  3!\n> \n> that's right just 3. and i can even give you the reasons for those issues.\n> and the total amount of net issues i've had combined i can still count on both hands.\n> \n> \n> The point I'm trying to make here, is that maybe you should be looking at what could be improved on your end before you condemn riot and their servers.\n\nHave you played warhammer?\nMagic?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-22T13:06:14.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Btw you can actually got to them and send em a ticket saying it is a mistake (WITH PROOF)","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-22T13:25:51.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes no sense.\nWhat sort of mistake would that be?
