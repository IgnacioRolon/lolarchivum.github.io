I find that i end up just being salty and tilted the entirety of the game due to the fact that  viable solution has been implemented to this re-occurring issue. Ranked queues had this problem and the option to choose a primary and secondary role that guarantees you a preferred spot was a great solution. In my opinion, i think this solution/concept should be used in Normals 5v5 queues. I would also like to hear your thoughts on this problem and whether or not you have had this experience.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-15T03:15:15.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"or you could just play a different role?\ninstalocking isn't a reportable offence anyway, and if you actually report for it you need to grow up and stop being a man child.","replies":[{"poster":"Flyby","date":"2016-04-15T04:57:56.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, i'm just asking if people have had the same problem.

It is frustrating as hell but as long as LOL is a F2P game, this will always be the case. You cant always get the role you want in this game, especially not in a community as nice as OCE. \n\nInstalocking isn't a reportable offence. If your team decided to have 2 jungles or 2 mids, then it should be considered as your team's 'strategy', if you lose, too bad. Some people like to play certain roles and don't want to fight for it. And let's be honest we've all instalocked once or twice whether you want to admit or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Flyby","date":"2016-04-17T08:08:56.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh never instalocked because i hate when it happens to me.
