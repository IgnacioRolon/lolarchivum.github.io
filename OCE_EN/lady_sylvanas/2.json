I have always been a fan of the League lore and that video just made me feel so much sadness and pain for Amumu that I decided he deserved a story.  Here&#039;s one of the chapters I&#039;ve written, enjoyyy~\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \r\n\r\n[[ &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very good at hiding,&rdquo; the young sorceress said quietly. \r\n\r\nPerched high on a branch wondering, the little boy Amumu peeked at her&mdash;as he had been for the past few week since she rescued him&mdash;perhaps she now regretted that action.\r\n\r\nThe girl was having a tea party. She sat at the head of a table made from a large tree trunk. She had arranged tree stumps, rocks and toadstools for chairs. Though they were charred at the edges, the set up looked quite inviting. Atop the highest pile of rocks sat her stuffed doll. Amumu shuddered at the thought of the monstrosity that was ensnared within the doll. He had seen its ferocity and flaming coat of fur, bringing only destruction in its wake.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t leave, join us, &ldquo; she said, louder this time, as if commanding him. Amumu panicked, it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to him that anyone would want to see him, talk to him, much less have tea with him. He hadn&rsquo;t talked to a person in centuries, will she be frightened? Will he hurt her accidentally?\r\n\r\nBefore he could sort out his thoughts, the sorceress shot a cone of fire at the base of the tree, instantly fraying a large portion of the trunk, the tree groaned in pain and leaned towards the girl, prompting the boy to leave. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me hurt you,&ldquo; she warned, a hint of laughter in her voice.\r\n\r\nA strip of bandage stretched out from the branch towards the ground.  Amumu slid down, the grass started to wilt as he walked, the branch he had been resting on had rotted and the tree bowed towards the ground.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she pointed next to her. Amumu approached apprehensively and sat, leaning as far from as he could from the girl. She placed her palm above the teacup before him and produced a small ring of fire, the tea bubbled excitedly.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;There, warm yourself up,&rdquo; she chirped, she was very curious about her bandaged guest. She hadn&rsquo;t encountered many people since her family had fled Noxus and she was desperate for a new friend. \r\n\r\nAmumu managed a weak smile. &ldquo;Th.. thank you,&rdquo; he squeaked.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who are you,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;Why are you here, why are you following me?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s sudden barrage of questions shocked Amumu, she leaned in close, her eyes narrowed, &ldquo;Are you from their side?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAmumu gasped and hopped backwards, she was too close.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near. I .. I am A.. Amu.. &ldquo; the boy stuttered. \r\n\r\nA harsh caw interrupted him. \r\n\r\nA giant raven swooped down, it bore three crimson eyes on each side. The girl waved her hands to shoo the unwelcome creature away but it screeched loudly and cocked its head at her. The girl flung a pebble towards the crow, it took off, knocking her stuffed doll off its throne. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You wretched bird!&rdquo; she shrieked, shooting several bolts of fire at the bird striking its left wing. The raven cawed loudly in pain before crashing into the trees, several black feathers fell off, their velvety texture now burnt to crisp.\r\n\r\nA chorus of caws echoed through the forest and a deep rumbling was heard, the ground started to tremble.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Annie! Annie!&rdquo; A pair of voices were heard. \r\n\r\nAmumu, terrified by the events scrambled to hide amongst the trees. Two adults burst into the clearing, he recognized the lady, she was there when Annie had saved him. The man, he did not know. He was tall, dressed in black robes with gold trimmings, and a white cravat. He had a staff affixed to his back and several colourful bottles of liquid resting on his belt. His had a kind but worn-out face. Amumu suddenly felt safe in his presence.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you hurt child?&rdquo; The man asked gently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; she snarled while caressing her doll, &ldquo;A stupid bird hit tibbers.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Describe this bird,&rdquo; The man said calmly.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Really big and black and many ugly red eyes!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe man exchanged glances with the lady, &ldquo;The tactician,&rdquo; he murmured. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;We must go, now.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe man took drew his staff and fired a series of blue bolts into the sky. A loud roar resonated from above as a black winged stallion materialized galloping down from the skies. The three of them mounted the great beast and it vanished as quickly as it arrived. The boy stared in wonder.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGregori commanded his familiar to bring his family home. He realized the town&rsquo;s protection barrier had been shattered. Smoke was rising from the direction of their home, loud crashes could be heard as they drew close. His stomach felt sick, he never enjoyed battle, why couldn&rsquo;t all disputes be settled with diplomacy?\r\n\r\nThe town was in disarray, up above, wyverns were burning their buildings down; on the ground, hounds, ogres and all manner of ferocious beasts were terrorizing the townsfolk. Spells from other wizards were flung dangerously, some narrowly missing Gregori and his family. \r\n\r\nA homing arrow from the enemy struck Gregori&rsquo;s familiar from the side and broke his familiar&rsquo;s spell, returning it to wisp form. Annie plummeted to the grounds, screaming as she plunged, Gregori quickly chanted a spell for her to hover in the air. General Therrien, charged forward and leapt off his wolf to catch his prize.\r\n\r\nBefore she could recover, Annie was bound and gagged in magical ropes, her magic sealed and fastened onto the back of a giant grey wolf. General Therrien shot a wicked smile at Gregori. A stampede of wolf riders followed the general and surrounded the warlock. Gregori looked around, all was lost, they hadn&rsquo;t prepared for such an early attack. His child was disappearing into the distance, and his wife.. Where was his wife?!\r\n\r\nA loud crackling sound rang across the battlefield. Gregori&rsquo;s heart sank as he swallowed a nervous gulp then slowly looked up. A mass of black clouds had gathered to form a vortex, in the centre, was his wife. Amoline seething with anger had gone unstable, her body consumed in shadows. She unleashed volleys of shadow bolts below her. Gregori closed his eyes and prayed for the best. Amoline couldn&rsquo;t control her power in that form, her attacks were blind and struck at random.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the shadow witch, take cover!&rdquo; General Therrien yelled.\r\n\r\nThe bolts rained down and struck the wyverns, they screeched and collided with the buildings. General Therrien&rsquo;s grin quickly turned into a convoluted expression of pain as he was struck by multiple bolts of shadowfire.\r\n\r\nThe spell on Annie released as the general fell unconscious and she was flung off the wolf. She looked up in horror, this was the first she ever witnessed her mother&rsquo;s power. The town was barely recognizable from her carnage, she watched her people flee for cover but even the forest was destroyed. Instinctively, Annie conjured a ring of fire to protect herself.\r\n\r\nGregori reopened his eyes and saw his daughter wrapped in fire, a tree behind her started to collapse on her. He shot a summoning spell and pulled her into his arms.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Annie, my child! Stay with me!&rdquo; he hugged her fiercely as she sobbed in fear.\r\n\r\nThe storm began to recede, the spray of shadowfire came to a halt as Amoline&rsquo;s fatigued body fell, Gregori rushed to catch his wife, her body had taken a beating.\r\n\r\nBut the invasion wasn&rsquo;t over, an ogre surfaced from the rubble, spotting Annie left alone, raised its club to strike her.\r\n\r\nAmumu, who had been following them, rushed forward to block the attack but she was sent flying and slid across the ground. Annie groaned and stood up feebly, clutching her stuffed doll, her fear now turned to anger. She grit her teeth as blood dripped down her face and began to chant. The ogre roared at her, spraying spit everywhere and charged towards her. Her stuffed doll began to glow and emit sparks but the ogre was already upon her. \r\n\r\nAmumu howled and slammed the ground with his fists. \r\n\r\nHis curse unleashed. \r\n\r\nBandages flew out from him in every direction, snaking across the ground and gripping every life form it could reach. The ogre&rsquo;s legs were bound, stopping its charge and its body hardened. The cursed bandages travelled to Annie, her body froze as they wrapped around her legs, her horrified face preserved and her stuffed doll fell from her hands.\r\n\r\nThe trees, the wolves, the wyverns all suffer the same fate, the mummy&rsquo;s curse spared no living creature. Tears streamed down from his face as Amumu watched his curse consume Gregori and Amoline.\r\n\r\nEverything went silent.\r\n\r\nAmumu lifted his hands from the ground, the damage was done. He walked over to the lifeless Annie, and touched her face, his teardrops falling on her stuffed doll.\r\n\r\nHe picks it up and shakes it vigorously but nothing happens, the fiery bear doesn&rsquo;t emerge.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have to save her,&rdquo; he tells the bear while shaking it, some of its stuffing falling out. &ldquo;We have to save her!&rdquo; He repeats.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;WE HAVE TO.&rdquo; He yells in agony.    ]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To be continued! :D_\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T21:26:55.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ooh how interesting to see Annie's parents! Nicely told. Though I feel in the later parts of the story the focus kinda shifts from Amumu. This might've been your intention but I just assumed from the title that this was all about Amumu. Still, you really captured the feel of the MV well, especially the end where Amumu unleashes his power. Good read :)","replies":[]}]}
