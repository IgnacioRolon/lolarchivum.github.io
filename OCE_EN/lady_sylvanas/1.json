Surely you can give half LP to the winning team as well, surely you know that by late game 1 tiny mistake can destroy 40mins for good game play, much less an absent teammate. \r\n\r\nPlease, with a cherry on top, give some sort of compensation for at least ranked games with AFKs. It is tough enough climbing the tiers trying to communicate and cooperate with randoms and stay calm. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about punishment in normals but maybe HALF IP if you afk for the next few games?","replies":[{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-02-01T02:03:52.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think their gold should just be divided between the team","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-31T06:51:35.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't see why you can't give us a Loss Prevented or at least be more lenient in LP deductions when you clearly KNOW that someone on the team has gone afk.\n\n*Average player: \"Oh look, my team is losing. Lets get someone to afk so i get loss prevented/less LP loss.\"*\nYeah, no.\n\n> Surely you can give half LP to the winning team as well\n\nSo you'd punish the people who did nothing wrong? Well, I can say with confidence that I'm glad you don't have a say in how the punishment systems work.\n\nI agree that there should be something to compensate players who get an AFK/DC on their team but it's not as simple as 'loss prevented' or 'less LP loss' as both are too abuse-able. It would probably even result with AFKing being the norm in games people are losing, thus making the problem more prominent.","replies":[]}]}
