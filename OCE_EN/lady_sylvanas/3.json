And with such large Crowd Control ults, it&#039;s effective in making game-changing plays. It&#039;s sad that I can&#039;t build it anymore and because I tend to go fully tank to peel and support the rest of the team, I cannot swap out a defensive item for another CDR item. \r\n\r\nAs fun as the new Runeglaive is and the joy of openning up more possibilities for ap junglers, I would really appreciate a 5th enchantment like the previous blue enchantment for some CDR for AP junglers who are there to tank/CC and not be bursty/skill spammers like NIdalee/Fizz/Ezreal and the like. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-23T07:35:13.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tanky AP jungler?\n\nCinderhulk.","replies":[]}]}
