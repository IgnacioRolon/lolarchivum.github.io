Very frustrating and not a very enjoyable experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-25T05:34:24.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There comes a point where other players have to be considered over what should be rare occurrences for a single player, which is why you still receive LeaverBusters after a point, regardless of if the leave is intentional or not.\n\nIt sounds like you have some client issues going on though, and resolving those will certainly be the fastest way to get back into game smoothly. Two bug-splats in a row is unusual, and there's obviously something causing the client grief. My first recommendation would be to run a client repair, and if you still experience drama to ticket player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
