Someone on my team, usually my adc cuz thats where the rune is most popular will disconnect between champ select and loading in, meaning that usually the game would remake, instead because they have biscuits (the inspiration rune {{item:2010}} ) When they receive them which is before 3 minutes they're no longer counted as 'afk/disconnected' and we can't remake.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-07T10:23:34.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there are heaps of threads about this over on the Report a Bug Board (NA). \n\nThe short version is, the remake isn't failing because of the biscuits, it's just coincidence. RIot looked into it forever ago after a wave of player reports that biscuits were causing remakes to fail, but turned up that the biscuits weren't the cause. \n\nThe fact that biscuits get added at the same time as remake normally starts led to players assuming the biscuit was the culprit when it wasn't. Believe me, you weren't the first to believe this and I doubt you'll be the last.\n\nGenerally, when a remake fails it's because the player *did* connect, but disconnected shortly after causing the remake to fail because they technically made it into the game, though there are other scenarios that can cause the remake to not trigger.\n\nThe remake system is, unfortunately, a system of compromise, and there is no perfect solution.","replies":[]}]}
