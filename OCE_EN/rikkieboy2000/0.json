Sometimes i can play a full length game other times i just dc while having internet and 14 ping. When i just alt+f4 and relog in my league client i sometimes get another connection error where i cannot login as it tells me i dont have internet, but everything else works. The only thing that sometimes resets it is the ipconfig /release renew and flushdns but even then i generally are dc for 5-10 mins. I can barely play the game at this point. Riot pls fix whatever the problem is bc my internet is fine the only game that isnt is league","replies":[]}]}
