Why is that riot? This game lost it&#039;s story completely... now it&#039;s just a simple game where you bash qwerfd and hope that you get a kill or two.\nWe all remember beta, season one and two, these were good times, swain ad was a normal thing and no one would flame you for picking ashe mid, the game had a lore, something we could build up on, and now it&#039;s all lost. I understand that you want to focus on getting money from kids and you want to make LCS even bigger thing but come on, don&#039;t just dump the story of this game, some of the skins you make are just disappointing, they have nothing to do with league lore but you still release them... where is the logic in that? I demand you to give us back the story, and the good old gameplay we used to be able to have... :c\n\nI would like to hear your opinion people, what do you think about all this?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-23T01:08:09.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man!\n\nGreat to see you're interested in the Lore behind our world.

The discussion is really nice and well... all the things I could think of are mentioned there. I mean come on riot... we can't have champs just popping up from nowehere for no reason, with random op items that came out of nowehere like the ekko's time thingy. I get that you want to build up the story over time and join some of the characters together but come on... what the fuck riot, you can't just drop a champ into the league. Give me a reason why would Ekko fight in the league... why? what is his purpose? and where the fuck did he get the time shitznit from?!  Okay I read his lore and apparantely he is a clever lad that made it himself.. fair enough, But I still don't get why he is fighting in league? My best guess is that well idk.. since it is mentioned that he will do anything to protect his friends, there could be some threat from other dimension since Ekko can travel between those... but still, other dimentions? Who is his enemy? at least give us some info about it, you don't have to say who it is straight away but at least give us a hint...\n\nWhy can't you make lores like the ones you made for the old trundle.. or connections like you made between Nocturne Zed and Shen, you didn't give us all the info, but you gave us enough information to allow us to make guesses and leave it mysterious, and this is what we wanted, I think that champs appearing from nowehere for no reason is just too mysterious and dumb...\n\nOh yeah where the hell did the newspaper go? :c I didn't read the dev blog so sorry if my question was already answered there.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-24T15:44:03.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read the dev blog most of your points are answered there! but here is a little exerpt about why we moved away from giving every champion a reason to join the League. We moved away from connecting a characters story to the game itself because it limited the potential stories we could tell.\n\n\n> In the early days of League, we created a fictional background that would justify how players could control champions during games. We came up with concepts like Summoners, Fields of Justice, an Institute of War, and indeed, the League of Legends itself – all in an attempt to provide fictional context for in-game action.\n> After a while, these early choices began to create unexpected problems. Every new champion needed a reason to join and remain in the League, and as their number grew, the net result was that over time the world started to feel, well, small, and eventually less interesting. The institutions we’d designed fostered creative stagnation, limiting the ways that champions, factions and Runeterra itself could grow and change. Furthermore, the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers. The background we’d created to explain in-game action was ultimately restricting the potential narrative development of the game’s defining characters.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-23T06:55:38.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could go Ashe mid in the beta because it worked back then, and there wasn't anything that even remotely resembled a meta.\n\nAshe mid doesn't work anymore, there might be a few cases where she faces someone who she can thrash, but the majority of champions that are played in mid will utterly ruin an Ashe in a 1v1.\n\nI had a duo premade go bot lane last night as LeBlanc and Karma, Karma refused to play like a support apart from buying a {{item:3303}} and the two friends just ended up feeding all game.\nIf you're on my team I expect you to go AD Marksman and Support in bottom lane, why? Because that's what the enemy team will have, and it's the most reliable choice to fight it with.\n\nI don't want people to conform to the \"current meta\" just the \"general meta\".

Don't you think that it was nice to be able to choose whatever you want and try new things without getting flamed? Today even if you will pick heimer mid  you will get flamed because its not in the meta. The reason I mention the whole champs thing is because people lose the point of this game, they all get greedy for victory, it is kinda riot fault for not reminding people that this game has a back story to it and it's not just about victory...","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-23T07:28:48.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a game designed purely for PvP.

And idea of separating lore from gameplay is stupid imo. Im not talking about any direct impact of the lore on gameplay because that would never happen, but I just don't like the fact that the champs that are made are just \"empty shells\" that will probably never be filled up.
