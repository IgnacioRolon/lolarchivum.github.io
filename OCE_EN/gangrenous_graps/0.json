In general, I would not start playing ranked until at least 500 normal wins, where you have covered most of the match-ups for your main roles, and are familiar with the kits of all of the champs (even ones like Urgot that wreck face when they pop-up, because nobody knows how to vs them). \n\nI have a lot of rune pages (at the moment 16) but only use 2 of them. \nFor a starter like you, I am going to suggest some incredibly basic ones (the ones I use) that are made up of the cheaper essential tier 3 runes:\n\n* AD page (cost all up= 8,610 IP)\n**Quints** (big ones) - 3 x attack damage\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9x armour\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x attack damage\n**Glyph** (blue) - 9 x magic resist\n\n* AP page (cost all up= 10,455 or 12,300 if you go for AP over MP)\n**Quints **(big ones) - 3 x ability power\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9x armour\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x magic pen\n**Glyph** (blue) - 9 x magic resist or ability power\n\n* Tank page (cost all up= 14,145 IP)\n**Quints** (big ones)- 3 x armour\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9 x HP\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x armour\n**Glyph** (blue) - 9 x magic resist\n\nPersonally I would sneak a few AD marks into the Tank page, but it is ultimately up to you. \n\n* Utility support (Utility page cost= 15,990 IP)\n**Quints** (big ones)- 3 x AP or movespeed\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9 x HP\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x armour\n**Glyph** (blue) - 9 x magic resist or scaling CDR or a mix of both\n\nI usually just run my standard AP or tank page for my supports. \nYour AD and AP pages are absolutely must have, #1 priority. \n\n\n>Note: all prices are estimates due to me using a S4 rune calculator\n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]}]}
