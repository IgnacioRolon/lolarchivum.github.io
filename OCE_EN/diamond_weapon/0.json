With what she can do, super tanky can heal herself back up and do stupid damage. It&#039;s just wrong. Sure, you can just run when she ults but when do you get a team that can change focus like that during a team fight and run. Plus, if she gets on the slightest of rolls then there&#039;s no running. She&#039;s the most OP bullsh*t champ I&#039;ve ever seen and she needs a huge nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-19T13:51:37.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is that why no one plays her in Worlds?\n\nShe's pretty useless now unless some guy is a Illaoi god.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-20T23:15:42.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-21T01:26:47.130+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"and even then you could just bring ignite toplane (sure no more tp plays botlane but be honest how much do you really do this?) to shut down her healing and also put alot of early kill pressure on her to force her out of lane, or pick a tanky lanebully duelist since early-midgame you can just shut her down.\n\nOr if all else fails just play safe and freeze lane and force her to overextend and then hope either your midlaner or jungler will roam top and isn't a potato. Or if your adc picks someone mobile and builds a bork. With her reworks they made her less hit or miss snowbally and so feeding her a kill doesn't necessarily make the lane a lost cause and she's easier to fight than her previous states and right now she just doesn't perform well against things like irelia, darius, garen, tryndamere, pantheon, graves, teemo, ekko, yorrick and poppy, since she just can't keep up with their early aggression and dueling power.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-10-21T00:31:21.215+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please watch this video carefully and it will help you immensly against illaoi : \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLiTGQML3pI\n\nknowing what your opponent does is one of the most basic \"keys\" to victory ... ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-10-21T06:18:06.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shut up lul","replies":[]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-20T23:15:21.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have got to be joking me, Illaoi is strong but she is not even near broken dude. Get an illaoi behind and she's gone. Dude she has no escapes which makes for easy ganks whenever she pushes up, she is so low mobility so champs like fiora, yasuo. Its so easy to beat illaoi legit. When she ults, just walk away. When her tentacles go down (that spawned from ult) go in, she's powerless. Dude you forget to mention that illaoi is FULL AD ALL HER ABILITIES ARE AD. IF U WANT TO BEAT HER IN TEAMFIGHTS JUST GET UR TANK TO BUILD ARMOR I mean seriously your making it seem like Illaoi is the Malzahar of like 10 patches ago when he was mega broken. She is nothing like this. You know if she was broken, why isn't she being played in worlds? Do you have an answer for that? Nah didn't think so.","replies":[]}]}
