In fact, the only time I was ever banned was because I was using personally offensive insults towards another player.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like as long as you don&#039;t say anything racist or tell someone to commit self-harm you will rarely ever get banned. At least that&#039;s what it seems like to me, (also note most of my toxicity is directed towards the enemy team).\r\n\r\nAt least that&#039;s how it seems to me, it would be helpful if anyone reading to post about their previous experiences with the player tribunal so I could better understand the way in which the LoL algorithm detects toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-10-19T10:10:32.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, since my last ban i haven't done anything the same, im still toxic, i just don't use the trigger words, still waiting for riot to grab me over racist comments (mostly directed at the asian community).\n\nIn my experience the easiest way to get away with trash talking (because its automated and every automated system is beatable if you know what you're doing) is to passive aggressively talk to people.\n\nim honor 2 and still the most toxic player in my friends group (and one of us has 4 perma'd accounts)\n\nthe rule that applies to beating the ai in a game, applies to the automated system, if you know its patterns (ie. the trigger words) you can beat it without a problem, 100% i'll be honor 5 next year, and still be one of the most toxic players on the server, because automated systems don't work, never have never will, and until riot works it out, anyone who knows what they're doing can get away with anything \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-10-23T00:05:19.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love to make a bet and play a game with you on \"most toxic player on the server\" my friends call me T1 of OCE because my name starts with T and i have officially been permi banned for chat related issues more then tyler 1 himself im not proud saying that and never will be but it is kind of funny","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-10-22T23:51:56.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot don't know the difference that's why you can be banned and even permi banned for simply calling someone bad and or trash","replies":[{"poster":"CatchandKiss","date":"2018-10-26T11:49:33.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You absolutely should be banned for calling someone trash.

Those who get away with it need to be at least chat banned for 5 - 10 games, on the rift (from the message I got when I got perma'd) \"Everyone Deserves Respect\" (and 0.006% have learnt the hard way).","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-19T09:50:08.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of legends motto\nYou chat?
