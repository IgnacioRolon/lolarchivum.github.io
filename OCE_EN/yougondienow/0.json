Its all on your end and all the posts I&#039;ve found on it have no answers or help from you as far as a know. Any support would be great, I tried to submit a ticket but your support service is hands down the most complex thing ever created considering I log in but get signed out straight away! I do not wish to have a leaver penalty on my account for something thats completely out of my control. Get back to me please.

Before we start looking at factors that may be causing these issues on the ISP end, I'd first like to confirm that the issue does not lay on your end of things. Can you try as many solutions as you can that are provided in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article?\n\nIf those solutions don't work, let's start looking into the diagnostics and see where the issue may be originating. To do this, we'll need you to provide some information for us: \n\n1. Confirmation that you've tried the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article\n2. ISP that you're using\n3. Region and/or State\n4. Trace Route (Tracert) - If you're unsure how to do this, check out [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)\n5. When did these issues begin occurring, and how often?\n6. Additional information you'd like to provide\n\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Yougondienow","date":"2016-03-16T00:16:23.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for getting back to me so soon. I've had the problem since the 14th 03/16. Worked fine the night before then just wouldnt load into game after character select the next night. I;'ve had the same problem in the past, i just stopped playing for a few months (after repairing, uninstalling/reinstalling, re-repairing, rinsing and repeating), came back, patched, and it seemed to work fine again. My firewall has never caused issues. DNS has been configured to the 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 and cleared etc. No packet loss. Ports are good. Im with Vodafone NZ. I've just run Tracert, but becuase this isn't a ticket what should i do with it?
