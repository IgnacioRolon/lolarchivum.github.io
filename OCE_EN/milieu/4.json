On these days we will be doing reviews and scrimming once the teams synergy has vastly improved. \r\n\r\nCurrently the 3 of us have a wealth of experience from either a coaching role or playing role within the 5&#039;s scene. We are after players who take criticism well and are able to remain calm if the team gets behind.\r\n\r\nWe are preferably looking for High Platinum- Diamond players to complete the roster. And players who know the meta and can obviously play those champs.\r\n\r\nPlease either add me or post here and we can discuss further.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueLiquor","date":"2015-10-06T09:30:07.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle main. d2 last season before i went overseas and got LP decay.
