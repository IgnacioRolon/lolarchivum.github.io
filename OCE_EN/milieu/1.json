I am a mid laner but can also play the jungle/ ADC role well. I understand how lane swaps and double jungling works. And the follow the competitive scene religiously, I like to follow the meta pretty strictly but also have some flex picks in mid.\r\n\r\nIn terms of coaching I prefer to not seek for a role but to be approached on it, I prefer the &#039;top-down&#039;coaching style with myself having say on most of what goes on. I specialize in team compositions and review. I like to watch a lot of the pro games and break them down for my own learning. I have a large sporting background and have dealt with many different coaches and have found that when the coach has authority of the team and a mutual respect is there it is a lot more efficient in terms of results and progression.\r\n\r\nKeeping it short and sweet, if you are interested in me as a player or coach please add me on LoL or post here.\r\n\r\nWhickipedia","replies":[{"poster":"Swagzilla420","date":"2015-08-03T06:11:08.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'm looking for an analyst for a Team I'm starting up, this is a serious team looking to compete with the best OCE has to offer so if your keen hmu in game on Swagzilla420 and skype at appl3.soss","replies":[]},{"poster":"loutherknigh","date":"2015-08-03T02:27:56.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"coach my team, ACOG snipers","replies":[]}]}
