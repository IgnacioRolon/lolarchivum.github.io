Not only does it add another layer of counterplay to Annie's snowbally and incredibly bursty kit, it fits together thematically and lets face it, who wouldn't love throwing a cuddly teddy bear at your lane opponent to kill them?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-04T09:18:21.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I like the ability to counter spells, I think Annie's ult makes sense as it is.\nSo recently Corki's Q and even now Viegar's event horizon have been changed so that there is a delay between when it appears and when the dmg/cc is appied; I feel this is justified as they aren't ultimate's. They are just normal abilities with relatively shorter cooldowns. If not easily counterable they can result in heavily lane advantage. \n\nAn ultimate however is meant to be big and scary. \nMost time the only way Annie can get a good ult off is with a flash. \nSo although the ult cd itself is about 60 seconds, the flash timer is significantly longer.\nThis is the current counterplay to Annie.\nIf you wished to make the longer range, in compensation for it not being instant, you would have an Annie who would have the potential to get off A LOT more good ults. \nIncreasing the range would be too much of a buff, compared to the smaller debuff that would be the delay.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-04T09:43:04.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh..

I know this can be hard to pull off in a solo queue game but if said in chat it should be possible to at least make Annie only stun two people.\n\nWith majority of your team unstunned then;\n1. Carry stunned;  Tanks/Support should have some cc to follow up on her, before she learns a combo, and another damage dealer should be quickly kill her. \n2. She stuns the peel; you should be able to get significant trade damage while unstunned, regardless of whether she invests the rest of the combo on you or on your peel.\n\nIn terms of nuking Annie, she will either be support and should die without the need of the damager dealer ultimate, if she is a mid or top she is worth the expenditure of the other damager dealer's ultimate. \n\nIf both your damage dealer's got stunned, you got outplayed! Plain a simple.\nIf you wish to counter Annie you need to ensure you coordinate your team so that both damage dealer will not be stunned. This is what in game chat should be used for. \n\nAnnie is high-risk, high reward. \nShe is fragile, with no escape, particularly if she's flashed in. \nTo balance this is has the high reward of an instant AOE stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-04T13:34:01.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm ok I dig it haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-04T10:03:52.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bjergsen would outplay it....","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-04T13:35:07.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you saw me in game it'd be hard to tell the difference between me and Bjergsen ;) We play just as good as each other. \n\nHAHAH I'm joking :'( I'll never be Bjergerking.

This sucks for Annie when her flash is on cooldown, and sucks for everyone else when it is available.\n\nMake it dodgeable, then up the range to 800 or 900 (1190-1290 effective range at the edge of tibbers spawn damage radius). Now Annie feels better because she doesn't rely on a massive cooldown summoner spell to make plays, and everyone else feels better because they can actually dodge it somewhat. Don't forget she can still flash incinerate if the instant stun is needed versus the larger diameter stun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-04T09:26:52.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"or maybe you could have tibbers throw annie?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-04T11:54:49.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that sounds like a cool skin idea....oh wait.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-04T22:30:25.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy this simply because as is, annies ultimate stuns you before it animates, so you are sitting there thinking \"what the %%%% was that?\" before you get popped because you are a bit too late on your spin or whatever. its extremely frustrating and I swear it takes a bit of my soul away every time it happens","replies":[]},{"poster":"YossarianLives","date":"2015-03-04T17:14:15.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aww, I thought you meant store many Tibbers at once and fire them out one by one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-04T08:04:29.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-03-04T07:39:23.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol love it","replies":[]}]}
