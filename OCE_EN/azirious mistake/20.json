She has mobility with her q that does damage also, she has a solid stun or at very least a push with her condemn that also does damage, she has %HP damage every 3 attacks and it doesn't even have a period where she can't use it on the same unit twice in a short amount of time like most other champs (braum, Naught, J4) and she can go unviable with her Ult and do even more damage ... Compare that to say Sivir ... Who has no CC and her only mobility is from her ult sure her q is long ranged and her W is great for wave clear and team fights but her q is the only spell that actually does damage and her w just makes her autos better .. I think out of all the ADC's vayne needs the biggest rework/nerf .","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-30T14:38:04.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just hate that you can win lane and take Turret but it's almost detrimental because if you get unlucky with Minion RNG your waves keep pushing and you cant go farm because of her 1v1 potential and it's dangerous to push and farm and this Champion excels at chasing down and flanking enemies which means winning lane is almost detrimental and there's not a lot you can do about it in most situations - and coupled with her late game potential this can give her free farm and then GG and there's legitimately nothing you can do about it and if they have wave clear or poke even if you group 5v4 while she farms you can't push hard enough;\n\nAll in all she's always been a problem Champ in that she has insane power spikes but the current meta made it way worse and has left her probably the supreme ADC at the moment.\n\n\nIt's sad watching some pro games with fed Vaynes because both teams know it's just a pentakill waiting to happen and they don't surrender without an obvious disadvtange like if they get aced twice but they can't actually do anything in team fights even with champs getting picked here and there and because of her assassination potential and lack of utility she will be after say a 3 for 3 engage and while she may be a late game monster with full build and slowly but surely winning the enemy team wont surrender...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-30T06:49:02.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not trying to say the Vayne nerfs aren't enough, but when Riot breaks every ADC in the bot lane in the upcoming Marksman update, they might want to leave Vayne alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-30T06:20:29.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd normally argue that Vayne is strong late game and weak early game, which is how she's supposed to be, but....
