As much as I love new balance changes, I like being able to play reworked champions on their release date even more. I think you might need more beta testers so you can sniff out and handle bugs better before the patches hit live servers.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-06T04:00:25.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Fiora still disabled?
