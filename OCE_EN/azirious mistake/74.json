Or he might just have been shiet talking, ignore it.\n\nNot to mention as currently stand there is pretty much no better way to do crits in this kind of genre, and even if there are, it's too much work to redo all ADCs, melee&ranged all over again. At least with dodge removal it was only 1 guy who abused it silly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-09-21T02:44:31.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda agree with you where crits are pretty much one of the only things in LoL to have luck. Your life can sometimes rest in whether or not you get a crit but I mean at the end of the day .. if you want more crits you buy crit chance and don't rely on them.. think of them as nice things that pop up every now an then and can turn a bad situation good.. but you shouldn't really try and get into a situation where you rely on them as in don't waste your flash to try and kill that WW with enough HP to survive a normal Auto attack and just hope for a crit .. because you might just end up dying yourself and not even getting the kill .. and after wasting your flash .. what good is that.  just instead let him go back and take a turret or dragon instead.. help your team get ahead. but I do feel your pain, there isn't really any skill evolved with when you crit and that is a shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-22T01:32:44.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not luck if in is 100% crit","replies":[]}]}]}
