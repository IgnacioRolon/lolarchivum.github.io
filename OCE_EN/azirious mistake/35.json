If you choose to continue to ignore me as a customer, that&rsquo;s fine &ndash; it&rsquo;s not my place to make decisions for you.However, time and time again I have been let down, and at some point I will simply put my money where my mouth is, and stop playing altogether. The overwhelming majority of casual League of Legends players just want to have fun, and a big part of that is finding interesting ways to play the game. Sword of the Occult is something that represents that fun for me, it creates a high risk, high reward playstyle, which is what I enjoy, and is something that League severely lacks. It&rsquo;s not overpowered or unfair, and the playstyle the item creates causes it to be unviable at the competitive level.It doesn&rsquo;t affect the game negatively for the casual player either, so I ask that you please reconsider your decision, and give players the choice to have fun with the item.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFioraTheExplorer.\r\n\r\nSpread the word.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-07T06:16:28.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure they actually removed it because no one built it consistently. It was really only used on smurfs and already super fed melee carries. It just doesn't synergise well with most champions.\n\nOn most auto-attack melee champions it's better to get tanky (Garen {{champion:86}} , Darius {{champion:122}} , Olaf {{champion:2}} , Udyr {{champion:77}} ... etc.).\n\nOn the melee carries where AD is beneficial (Tryndamere {{champion:23}} , Zed {{champion:238}} , Talon {{champion:91}} ) it's better to get critical strike chance. If you think about it, a fully stacked Sword of the Occult only gives 100 AD while just 50% Crit can **double** my AD every 2nd hit. Also most of these champions have to executed really well, or else they'll get blown up and die because they are squishy melee. Meaning I'll loose my stacks.\n\n**Can it work on ADC then? They wont get blown up right?**\nIt should, but there's no ADC Zhonya's Hourglass. So unless you have super clutch support you're going to get 1 hit by an assassin at some point and loose stacks.\n\nBasically Mejai's Soulstealer only works because ranged mages (Lux {{champion:99}}, Veigar {{champion:45}}, Annie {{champion:1}}) Have the option of Zhonya's Hourglass along with the benefit of being ranged.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-07T14:02:45.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but flat AD gives you damage to your AD scaling abilities. Dealing double damage by taking crit chance is sup optimal when you could have 400 bonus damage to your combo from that 100 AD.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-08T01:49:21.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're assuming that we have an AD scaling champion who doesn't auto-attack at least once for their combo. Lets take Zed {{champion:238}}  for example. If you have 200 Bonus AD on him, and 280 base AD (Zed's actual base AD at level 16), then altogether you have 480 AD. This would be a super basic Zed combo with Critical Strike.\n\n**Razor Shuriken Q** will deal 235 (base) + 200 (bonus AD scaling) that's 435 total.\n\n**Shadow Slash E** will deal 180 (base) + 160 (bonus AD scaling) that's 340 total.\n\n**Contempt for the Weak** will deal 10% of their max health plus 250% (remember Infinity Edge passive) of my total AD if I Critically Strike. That's 1200 damage.\n\nIgnoring Zed's passive damage that's 435 + 340 + 1200 = **1975 damage**.\n\nThis is the same combo with no critical strike but a fully stacked Sword of the Occult, so I'm adding 100 to Zed's bonus AD.\n\n**Q**: 235 + 300 = 535\n\n**E**: 180 + 240 = 420\n\n**Passive and Auto**: 580 (Ignoring passive's damage again because it changes)\n\n**Total: 1535**\n\nCritical Strike deals more damage. Obviously if you use more abilities (Q shadow and R) then you'll make better use of your bonus AD, but I could say you make better use of your critical strike if you auto-attack more. Plus Auto-attacks are consistent. They can't miss and I can't run out of energy and not be able to use them. The only downside is I might not critically strike.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-11-07T07:12:28.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your name has fiora in it, nothing you say can be taken seriously","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-07T05:26:18.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not fun if you team feeds a {{champion:114}}  or {{champion:92}}  who has it :/.
