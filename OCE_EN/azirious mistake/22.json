All these old item rushes could be brought back if Riot knew what they wanted each AD Carry to be and do.\n\nIf I had my way, no AD Carry would be able to _viably_ rush Youmuu's or TriForce before BT/BotRK/IE/Muramana. Same as AD Carries would only be AD Carries. No toxic AP off-meta builds. AP Kog'maw, Corki and Ezreal are all incredibly toxic and overbearing when they're allowed to be viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-29T10:11:58.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree with you. I just want more diverse itemisation options, no more boring arms races in bot lane and more windows for ADCs that fall behind to contribute meaningfully to their team, at the moment the bot lane meta is basically \"pick these champs or you have no hope of succeeding\".","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-09-29T10:16:30.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have a read: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/JeHayHME-i-dont-deny-that-the-way-crit-functions-could-use-an-update","replies":[]}]}]}]}
