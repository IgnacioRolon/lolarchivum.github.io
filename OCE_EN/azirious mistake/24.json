All lanes belong to Azir, because he is the emperor.\r\n2. Azir&#039;s will is law, if Azir pings farm with the intention of taking it, you must abide, because he is the emperor.\r\n3. Azir hates Xerath, ban Xerath, he&#039;s a dick.\r\n4. Do not fall for decoys, the only true emperor is the Azir on your team.\r\n5. Continuing on from commandment 4, if there is an imposter Azir on the enemy team, you shall camp them, because the true Azir wills it.\r\n6. Azir demands sacrifice, you shall offer 1 virgin Teemo to bathe in the glorious power of his Sun Disk daily so he may retain his grossly misleading 44% win rate.\r\n7. Azir&#039;s enemies are your enemies, if an ally harasses him, it is your duty to defend him with your life.\r\n8. Azir is the one true carry of any team, if he is in trouble, you shall peel for him over the ADC, because he is the emperor.\r\n9. Using the Galactic Azir skin is blasphemy and is punishable by a 9-man report, Classic Azir is the one true ruler of Shurima.\r\n10. Azir demands all kills, you shall give them to him.\r\n11. Azir demands to play on the red side, because red is a royal colour, if he should be on the blue team then the game shall be dodged regardless of personal opinion.\r\n12. Azir demands the last hit on the enemy nexus, you shall give it to him, for he is the emperor.\r\n13.

If an enemy CCs your Azir, it is your duty to protect him and slay his foes, an emperor never gets his hands dirty.\r\n19. Azir is a god, to be under his presence is an honour and a privilege, do not misuse it.\r\n20. Azir is our glorious leader, sent from the sands to guide humanity to greatness, to follow another is treasonous and asinine.\r\n\r\nBy pledging your allegiance to the true ruler of Shurima, you too pledge your allegiance to the almighty Mr Monkey, our only true god and saviour, aside from Azir, of course.","replies":[{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-14T11:33:35.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Azir demands sacrifice, you shall offer 1 virgin Teemo to bathe in the glorious power of his Sun Disk daily so he may retain his grossly misleading 44% win rate.\"\n\nI swear the S was a C when I first read it.","replies":[]}]}
