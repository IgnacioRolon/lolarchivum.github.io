It has gotten to the point where I'd rather just use the classic skin, complete with puke ugly particles over the glorious Galactic Azir with orgasmic particles and an amazing model. Here is a comparison between the 2 skins, both Classic and Galactic:\r\n\r\nCLASSIC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBHhD5Br0D0 (Skip to 1:09 to hear the sound)\r\nGALACTIC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npDuxfNcfGI (Skip to 1:45 (bugged i think) or 2:23 to try to hear the sound)\r\n\r\nConsider Volcanic Wukong as a comparison, Volcanic Wukong has/had visual bugs where his fire particles reset upon pressing W, so you can tell when he has stealthed, this creates a problem because it gives the enemy information it shouldn't know as soon as Wukong's W was hit, I mean, of course people are going to know when Wukong stealths, but thats beside the point. Another comparison was Frostfire Annie, who has a literally invisible stun buff, she could hide in brush and you could not see the indicator for when her stun was up, see? Having poor clarity sucks, for both yourself and enemy.\r\n\r\nSo I'll ask you again with the kindest of manners, can we please get a new sound for Galactic Azir so we can more clearly find out when Azir's soldier is about to disappear?","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-11-27T10:35:29.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just gonna bump so the almighty reds can see it.","replies":[]}]}
