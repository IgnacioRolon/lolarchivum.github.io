I like her identity as a mixed damage carry but Corki does this better, she has a decent early game but Lucian does this better and has more reliable poke, she has some good AoE damage but then again Graves does this better, not to mention he actually has this wondrous thing called mobility. I like the buffs youre giving her ult but this doesn&#039;t solve any of her problems and she is getting more and more lost in the shuffle with every new marksman that comes out, and now she&#039;s a marksman who does a lot of things but doesn&#039;t really excel in anything, but how do we solve this? My suggestion is to actually give her a passive thats actually worth a damn.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-20T12:38:12.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Corki has to build AP to get more magic damage. I'm not too sure though.\nMF gets her weird scaling and scales physical damage off AP and magic damage off AD\nSo pretty much: If your mid laner thinks he's so cool picking yet another ninja or samurai or whatever weapon you can stuff down mid lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-19T14:44:10.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree shes not the best at the moment, but the argument of Corki is better at this, Lucian is better at that etc. isn't really relevant. A champion that is second rate at everything could easily be OP if they're decent enough at different things and dont have some of the weaknesses of stuff you're comparing them too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-19T09:12:57.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just build {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3087}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3172}} {{item:3071}}   then ask again, her build path slightly differs from a normal adc, she doesn't actually need boots, they just help her early game.\n\nHer q serves as an aa reset (like yasuo q, yes his q is an aa effect and an aa reset) so aa q aa in quick succession allows her to practically 1 hit any squishy in what seems like 1 shot. Her ultimate gets stronger the more you aa your target as well, so if you aa q aa r you can get an animation cancel on her, making you get a combo off in quick succession.\n\nBecause she can animation cancel with her r and reset with her q she can get 4 attacks off in around .15-0.35 seconds if done perfectly","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-19T08:15:34.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think riot when they reworked her they tried to make her like {{champion:96}} how he can go ad and do a tone of ap damage but they failed maybe if they were to put ad scaling on her ad skills so if she has 100 ad her q will do lets say just for example 50 ad damage and 50 ap damage the resone a late game kog is so op is because if you build to stop his ad then his ap on his q w e r will destroy you if you build for both then you are a tank and will have 3k plus hp and his 12% hp damage I think it is will destroy you with his basic attacks that's what I think anyway","replies":[]}]}
