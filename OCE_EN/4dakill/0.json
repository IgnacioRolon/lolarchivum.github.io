Tried installing the new patch, but it just stopped at 99% and froze. Tried to install the patch again but, it failed at 33% this time. Third time got it to 100% pressed play then it said I&#039;m missing the DirectX 9.0c file. Downloaded that and tried to the patch patch again and now it is stuck at 33% and wont change.
