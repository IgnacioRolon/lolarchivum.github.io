While the list of bugs is not public, we'll be trying to keep an up-to-date list of known issues in in the client for each release that we make.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2016-05-20T12:52:51.827+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a public bug tracker would help.
