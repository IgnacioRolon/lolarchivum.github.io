I have a wide range champion pool and I&#039;m able to play flex supports (such as Shen, Naut, etc.) My communication skills are good and I have past shot calling experience from previous teams I was in. So far the highest team I&#039;ve been in is Diamond 5 and I wish to aim higher than that since the season is close to an end. If you&#039;re interested in recruiting me you can always comment below in this thread or add me in-game. I&#039;m currently in the last years of high school so I will not be able to play as frequently due to exams coming up soon within term 4. But as soon as  that is over I&#039;m able to play when ever. As a Diamond 4 Support main I don&#039;t really have the best stats on my profile due to the fact I climbed from Gold 5 throughout this whole season, I&#039;ve had my fair share of playing with players from other parts of the world (massive language barriers), boosted players and toxic gold/plat players.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking your time to read this and I hope I&#039;m the right person you&#039;re looking for.\r\n\r\nP.S. Don&#039;t waste my time if you&#039;re just a team that purposely has a low ranked team so they can boost their stats.","replies":[{"poster":"Balaclava","date":"2015-10-09T08:19:10.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you au or nz?","replies":[{"poster":"Milky","date":"2015-10-09T08:24:34.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm from Melbourne.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BITCONNEEEEECT","date":"2015-10-09T09:57:12.969+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Milky, I have a post just before yours about my teams recruiting if you could please read that post: [http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/8j97RnJc-lfm-team-recruiting-5-more-members-as-alpha-playersreserves\nIf you wish to join let me know, I personally feel we can reach your expectations.\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vet","date":"2015-10-09T08:18:33.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QTE Mezza","date":"2015-10-25T02:42:17.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Milky!
