And by the end of preseason 6 I finished in Diamond 3 with 64 LP. Now with the new season beginning I am unable to play with all of my high elo friends (plat and over) in the new dynamic queue? I&#039;m not sure what is going on but I think I&#039;ve been hard reset by mistake or something? You can even check your database or where ever my account data is stored for proof of my MMR. I would really love if you guys could fix this as soon as possible so I can play in my original elo. I was planning on racing my friends to Challenger but with this issue in the way I wont be able to.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not entirely sure if I&#039;m the only one with this problem.
