Said I would make a video showing how to identify scripters, but I didn&#039;t run into many, so it took while.\r\n\r\nWARNING: The video is really long, and really boring. There&#039;s no video clips at the start, only when I start talking about identifying scripts specifically, but there&#039;s a TL;DR in the background.\r\n\r\nOnly watch the whole thing if you want a thorough explanation.\r\n\r\nHave fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-09-14T03:02:38.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was quite a good bit of info to learn, i'm not sure if it would be something i would see in my games being a low elo player, but it does make you think.\nyou've put alot of time into researching this and understanding how to identify scripters so well done mate.\n\nmy real question is, why would you do something(script) like this?  what's the benefit? your not learning or developing as a player.\n\n\n\nGreat work mate, thanks for sharing this.\nRespect mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Norak","date":"2015-09-14T13:19:32.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was partially covered in the video.\n\nPeople script not to get better, it's partially to gain elo, but mostly to get praise and to be able to shit talk freely.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-09-15T07:08:40.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems stupid I am where I am on the ladder  for a reason, would much rather earn my Elo then shot talk and get stomped.\n\n\nDon't under some.

Then I explained how you can still use it to find out if someone is a scripter.\n\n> And hell challengers do a lot of there things super quick.\n\nI've played against challengers a lot. There's a lot of challengers that don't even have quick reflexes, they're decent at the game, and there are a number of them that are actually really good and really quick, but you overestimate what it takes to be challenger in OCE.\n\nAlso, there's still a massive difference between challenger reaction times and scripter reaction times. Scripters will do it with 100% consistency and will sometimes do it unnecessarily. \n\nI explained all that in detail, but I understand it's a long vid.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-13T06:00:40.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be honest i only looked at the TL;DR.\n\nAnd sure using challenger's isn't a good standard what i'm saying is that it could simply be someone who is really good at the game, even though most actual scripters are extremely obvious.","replies":[{"poster":"Norak","date":"2015-09-13T06:04:51.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's also something I covered in the video. The TL;DR was the absolute basics. I explained how you can tell the difference between someone who is good and someone who is scripting with 100% accuracy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
