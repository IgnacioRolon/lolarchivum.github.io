While he has strong poke and does very well in certain 1v1 match-ups, he is essentially another AD carry who buckles when a tankline or CC manage to pin him down for half a moment. Of course, that's just the theory. A team that coordinates their engage after Jayce's poke will find success just as often as a less prepared one gets run down and slaughtered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"love shaco","date":"2016-08-26T07:04:26.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really he isn't that strong he is only extremely strong if he gets 1st blood and so on.\non the other hand if you get it and kill him so on he will be nothing.{{champion:126}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-26T05:54:30.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you know the matchup it's a pretty easy win, anyone with decent gap closing destroys him- irelia, gnar, yasuo, Quinn, ekko etc pretty much any meta top laner right now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-08-26T03:22:38.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's fine the way he is.\n\nHe's strong, but only if you're decently skilled with him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-08-26T01:18:01.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's always been this strong all riot did was change his mana costs and chnage an ap value to ad(which should have been ad in the 1st place) which they have done something similar  for some other champs Xin, Nocturne and I believe they added an ad scaling to shyv's W a while back also there was a post about riot cleaning up some of the old random ap scalings on champs a while back can't remember where so he's always been strong just git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-26T01:57:14.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You would think that... then you remember Yasuo...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-08-25T23:46:40.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So what, just because you can't dodge one skill shot every 10 seconds doesn't mean he's op.","replies":[]}]}
