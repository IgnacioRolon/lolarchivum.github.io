It really gives players incentive to be positive (or at least neutral). You can get some wicked rewards at the higher honour levels, which is nice, and the \"restricted\" manner in which you can honour gives much more weight to giving and receiving honours. I've really started seeing people \"step up\" and bring something positive to the table, whether it's the occasional compliment, taking on the leadership role, or just giving it their best in-game despite a bad start.\n\nAs a note, I seriously doubt it would be possible to achieve level 3 this early on. The system is about *consistency*, not necessarily quantity, so naturally it *should* take a couple weeks or so to reach the next honour level even if you are getting 2+ honours in each game. That said, it also doesn't restrict neutral players from progressing. You don't *have* to get honours to level up, it will just take longer that way. It certainly gives more meaning to seeing someone with a high honour, especially early on after it's release.\n\nPersonally, I'm hoping Riot might go with an IP buff for higher levels of honour and an IP debuff for level 0/1. Give people that much more reason to do the right thing (or, at least, *not* do the wrong thing). It will certainly be interesting to see where it goes from here, but so far it just seem like the best way Riot could have handled the \"rework\".","replies":[{"poster":"cesuuna","date":"2017-06-19T08:18:20.426+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn, you got Excellences in English. {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slythion","date":"2017-06-21T02:12:15.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like the system has been an overwhelming success based on the feedback from this post along with other's I've looked through!

As it was before, it was just some numbers and a (small) loading screen flair. Now, it's so much more. There are some pretty neat rewards to be gained through honour, and hextech key shards are now given based on whether you are above honour level 1. It provides lots more incentive for players to act appropriately now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-06-19T03:04:49.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's good.
