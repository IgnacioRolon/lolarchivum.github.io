It&#039;s not meant as a permanent cycle of being toxic and getting suspended. It&#039;s actually there to point out to our players what they can improve about their behaviour and to give them repeated chances on changing their attitude.\r\n\r\nAlthough this marks the end of the line, we&rsquo;re confident that with some reflection you will be able to avoid this kind of situation, because we like to encourage change and improvement in our players, so you are always free to create a new account.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I hope my response has answered all your questions and has addressed your issues and if there is anything else I can help you with, please let me know.\r\nGood luck to you!\r\n\r\nMoo regards.\r\nRiot Player Support Specialist\r\n&quot; You can&#039;t milk those! &quot;\r\n\r\nEffect\r\n\r\n&quot;I have read your previous messages and I am sorry to hear about the permanent suspension.&quot;\r\n\r\n- Bullshit you don&#039;t give two fucks about some random dude getting banned especially one for being toxic that&#039;s just another routine reply for your job which you probably once enjoyed but now you hate it, although you tell yourself you still enjoy it we both know deep down that is just another lie you tell yourself so you don&#039;t become manically depressed with the realization that your life is an endless cycle of repetition and drone like habits.\r\n\r\n&quot;Unfortunately we cannot make any refunds, as it would be against our Terms of Use and it wouldn&#039;t be fair towards the other players&quot;\r\n\r\nBullshit again &quot;against our terms of use&quot; WTF does that even mean &quot;we have the right to fuck you over cause we own this bitch&quot; that&#039;s what terms of use fucking mean.\r\n\r\n&quot; It&#039;s not meant as a permanent cycle of being toxic and getting suspended&quot;\r\n\r\nNo shit mate that&#039;s why I suggested a permanent mute that ends the fucking cycle of toxicity, doesn&#039;t it? How about a heads up like &quot; You can be suspended twice more before you receive a permanent ban&quot; not just &quot;ops you&#039;ve been permanently banned this time round, thanks for wasting hundreds of dollars&quot; plus how the fuck does a perm ban end the cycle of being toxic it doesn&#039;t. If anything it makes the problem worse... now a pissed off toxic player is going to create a new account and destroy new players and most probably abuse them because he/she is infuriated, now this new player isn&#039;t going to enjoy this abuse and inferiority, so he&#039;s going to quit... thus stunting population growth &gt; reducing potential profit &gt; and the toxic player who got permanently banned on his/her main account isn&#039;t going to waste money on skins anymore &gt; once again further reducing profits...\r\n\r\n&quot;Wouldn&#039;t be fair to other players&quot;\r\n\r\n- what part of refunding me a tiny portion of the totality I have spent on my account because I have received a permanent ban and now all my skins, champions, achievements are void not to mention time, How the fuck is that unfair for other players.... I bought darkstar varus and got perma banned like 3 hours fucking later, &quot;but nope it&#039;s unfair to others, please see our we have the right to fuck you over cause we own this bitch policy&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Although this marks the end of the line&quot;\r\n\r\n-Way to rub in MATE like &quot;this is the end of the line&quot; oh is it mate??? no shit??? thanks for the heads up son.\r\n\r\n&quot;we&rsquo;re confident that with some reflection you will be able to avoid this kind of situation&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n- Well if that were fucking true I wouldn&#039;t have received a permanent ban in the first place ...\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;because we like to encourage change and improvement in our players, so you are always free to create a new account.&quot;\r\n\r\n...ARE YOU HAVING A FUCKING GIGGLE M8.\r\n\r\n&quot;With that in mind, I hope my response has answered all your questions and has addressed your issues and if there is anything else I can help you with, please let me know.\r\nGood luck to you!&quot;\r\n\r\n- No thank you sir unfortunately you can&#039;t help me, clearly. But perhaps I could help you?\r\n\r\nP:S I&#039;m not really serious...

But tell me hypothetically, would the developer be who he is today or as successful as he is without facing adversity in his life? No. He learnt from it... People need toxic players to grow. Comedians often talk about serious topics and make it funny to desensitise and make light of a bad situation either you can be a sensitive bitch and take offence or you can have a laugh. I can call my jungler a boosted animal now he can question the authenticity of my claims by analysing his play and what he can do to improve ... Or he can cry and hit the report button.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-13T19:16:20.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You being toxic is simply because the developer got bullied? Oh no no, it is not the developer's whose at fault, I'm gonna say in a broadly that people who are toxic, salty or anywhere on that line is because they don't have self-control. If you flame once it may continue on but can take in any forms of criticising that could be constructive.\n\n\"people need toxic players to grow\" ehh fair enough, but how could a player who is able to grow when their mind is on the guy who flamed him constantly, it would simply hinder him. It's not necessarily that people need toxic players to grow, myself would be an example because I grew in skills and a little in morale.\n\nOkay if you can take a bad situation and shed a little light on it then tell me about the infamous WW2 nuclear bomb dropped on Japan or 9/11 and shed a little light on it, it wouldn't work right? Just because you can take a laugh does not make others like you and call them sensitive b**ch, it is sometimes alright to be sensitive b**ch because you want the worst memories kept tuck away so you can bloody grow then constantly think about it.\n\nYes your \"jungler\" can analyse his plays and improve himself, now more days it just becomes clumped up as insults. One game doesn't justify that him as whole is a boosted animal. You may play sh*t at 1 game (maybe someone fed your laner or jungle,etc.) but end up playing the next game well without having to look at his previous game.\n\nOh and purpose is objective, the reason of the purpose is subjective, there is always 1 or more purpose for everything, but the reason behind is many so it is a subjective of how we assume that the purpose was or is.","replies":[{"poster":"Effect","date":"2016-09-14T18:36:36.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm saying the harsh penalties for toxic players are due to the developer getting bullied, many people have made jokes about 9.11 and WW2?
