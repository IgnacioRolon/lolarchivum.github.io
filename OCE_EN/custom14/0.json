She's a champion which you need to have a lot of experience with to play well. For instance, some champions will totally zone you and destroy you in a 1v1 (e.g. Fiora, Renekton...) and some champions you will zone the heck out of (e.g. Nasus).\n\nApart from that Google some cool animation cancels, get Arcade and championship, watch a shit ton of box box and boom suddenly your a riven main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-04T03:31:02.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E Q Q Q W R (recall) R :3 im novice but a_ ~~\"Good\"~~_ Riven player  pretty much does that","replies":[]}]}
