Has pretty good 1v1 outplay potential (quite hard but subjective to the competence of your laner of course), and with a lot of people starting to play Gnar, I feel quite comfortable playing this champ. Only played him a few times but let me know what you think about him in the current top lane.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-15T06:23:18.353+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong is amazing all around. You can base team comps off him and he can be based around other team comps. Amazing team fight and dueling potential. late game ultimates can turn the tides of a fight, or end one before it even starts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T14:41:16.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wukong is ok, he seems pretty weak in lane compared to most tops atm, he can make a decent jungler from what I know, he's ok at best, a very big 1 trick pony with his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlimyDan","date":"2015-01-18T00:55:10.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play a fair bit of Wukong and he is amazing. With a few kills he can spiral out of control by mid-late game. I tend to play him jungle to be honest, you can get some pretty good ganks post 6 and the clone helps to surprise the enemy by poping out of no-where for a gank. \nHere's a game I played today with him: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/75944482/200727054?tab=overview\n\nI personally was considering playing him mid because against certain champs he can destroy certain people there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-15T11:36:52.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played him once or twice so far in jungle and the damage potential (if you get rolling early) is ludicrous I would literally leap whack and hydra to 100-0 someone then follow up by spinning into the rest of their team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-15T06:26:07.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok He is Amazing if you can play him right had one on my team I was yasuo we had to protect inhib we had 3 done they had 1 so wukong ults I ult they target me but I have enough damage to take out there mid and adc then wu kills there top only sup left so he can be great in fighting and defending","replies":[]},{"poster":"Panicwave","date":"2015-01-15T06:19:37.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Wukong too and I'm no professional so I'm not gonna say anything too smart. Wukong is kinda an all rounder and can be played as a fighter, tank or even an assassin. He provides amazing wombos to teamfights like you mentioned(especially Yasuo). I have also seen in some threads he is predicted to be in the Junge and Top Lane God Tier.","replies":[]}]}
