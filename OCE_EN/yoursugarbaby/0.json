I&#039;ve tried to contact the customer service of  the manufacturer of my computer and I ran a diagnostic check, everything is fine including software and hardware.\r\nDo any of you having the similar issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-06T07:06:06.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please go through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Support article and run through the troubleshooting steps.
