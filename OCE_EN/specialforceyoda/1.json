It&#039;s like everyone including minions gets a run speed boost. It&#039;s happened the last 2 aram games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T01:41:31.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you referring to the Homeguard boost you start with in ARAM now (functions the same as SR)? I don't believe that affects minions though.\n\nOtherwise it sounds like packet loss to me (related to your connection not the game itself). High ping is the packets taking a long time to get to Riot and back, packet loss is certain packets not making it at all, usually resulting in a freeze and then a rapid catch up.\n\nAre you using a wireless connection? If so I'd say that's the most likely culprit.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecialForceYoda","date":"2018-03-18T13:16:08.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, this happens all through the game no matter where I am.\n\nI have a constant 33ms, never changes. I'm using ethernet and I have quite good internet. I'm only having problems on this game as well.\nIs there anything else that could cause this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T13:52:17.912+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Packet loss doesn't reflect in your ping so it could still be that. Do you experience freezes before the speed ups (like it's catching up)?\n\nIf it's a connection issue it's entirely possible it's only your connection to League, rather than your connection in general, so having good internet otherwise doesn't rule that out, but it's also a bit of a strange one. I'm not convinced it's a connection issue either, but it is something individual to you at least.\n\nYou can give this site a sus for some insight into your individual connection and your ISPs connection to League: https://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/\n\nI'd also recommend you try running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair.\n\nIf that doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[{"poster":"SpecialForceYoda","date":"2018-03-22T14:33:42.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The newest update seems to have fixed it, thanks for your help though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
