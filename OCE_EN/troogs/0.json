Its random now.\n\nIt used to be in order of your MMR, so the \"best\" player was first pick and the \"worst\" player was last. Thats why pick order > call order made sense. But Riot said there was too much \"bullying\" from the higher picks telling the lowers picks to stfu since they are lower MMR so therefore higher picks should do shotcalling etc etc.\n\nTo stop bullying and other issues, pick order is now random.","replies":[{"poster":"Troogs","date":"2015-09-10T12:35:39.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so does that mean the usual etiquette is now call order in ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-10T12:55:33.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick order still applies.\n\nBut as per usual in life.

I still go with who picks first, gets first, even if that means I am last.\n\nI will always try and be nice, if I call mid and someone else asks for it, if the chance is there I will take top and give them mid etc etc etc.\n\nI will also try and be reasonable when it comes to other players and still take the first pick mentality. if someone in first takes a pick, the rest just have to follow in order, there is not much you can do if last pick asks for Top, yet first pick takes top. We all need to understand this and stop games from having 2-3 in mid or top, or even jungle, protesting by ruining other players games does NOT help.\n\nAlso watch those who call \"X or feed\", generally they can play other lanes, but won't and you need to ask yourself, what is better, taking the pick because you called it first and are first pick, or letting them have it and hope they can play it well to give your team the best chance to win?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-10T15:05:15.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i don't think i have ever seen someone who calls \"X or feed\" go well in ranked, or if i have it's less likely.\n\nMore often then not it's X and feed.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-11T11:54:08.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep pretty much.\n\nBut it is also the other players who fuck the team over. How many times have you seen\"X or FEED\" and thought, this guy is an asshole and I don't really want to help him.\n\nOne player states he will feed, the same team lets him, it's a 2 way street and sadly, occurs regularly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-10T16:51:49.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DEFINITELY pick order. You will become the least popular kid on your team if you start fighting over call order.\n\nPick order is no longer mmr based but first pick is first pick. Also if you pick at the same time (ie 2nd and 3rd pick together ) pick preference is given to pick order - if you squabble about pick order because you \"pick at the same time\" you will soon become hated.\n\nTo be honest, bans are usually fotm anyway and generally the team will agree on half decent bans (there is always some tool who will cry because of one ban or another, but generally it is fine).\n\nPersonally I prefer 2nd or third pick because it opens up the possibility of counter picking the enemies champs. Banning is pretty much standard every game (Eg skarner pretty much guaranteed ban until he gets nerfed) so dont put too much weight on being first pick.\n\n\nThe most important thing in solo q is to be at least proficient in a couple of lanes so that you dont fuck your team if you don't get the lane you want.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-09-11T01:38:41.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it comes to banning i always just check Lolking, the champions on there with the highest ban rate are usually the strongest if you don't know what to ban, also it's a good idea to ask your teammates what they want banned too. When it comes to selecting a champion to play it's always pick order over call order in ranked, the best thing to do is to just type in chat your preferred roles in order e.g. \"Top, Jg, Supp Pref\" then talk it out with your team, that way people will usually give you at least one of your preferred roles that you don't sucks at.","replies":[]}]}
