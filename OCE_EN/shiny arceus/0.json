In my attempts to complete my low priority queue during AI games, my 5 minute queue increased to 10 minutes then again to 20 minutes. This was due to internet problems. I didn't leave the game, I always reconnected cause of the disconnection that occurred a lot, I have posted my match history and it shows I have not left a game, and i have mainly played AI games, I don't think it is necessary to add on longer queues when doing AI games, if you can please remove or lower the 20 minute queue on my account, I would be grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Snack Attack","date":"2015-02-20T13:09:55.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going afk in a game for 3-5 minutes can easily cost you the entire game.

I'm in  20 minute low priority queue and would like to request the removal or minimization of this low priority queue. Thank you in advance Riot support.\n\nEdit: If this could be done as soon as possible I would be truly grateful.

Hell, you might even employ a tactic in game that involves waiting for five minutes (buffs take five minutes to spawn). But that's another matter.\n\nMaybe get a modem that's quicker to reset?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
