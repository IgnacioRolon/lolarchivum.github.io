There&#039;s no other way to put it- the other team had a primarily early-game team comp against our late-game comp, and we got destroyed. There was absolutely nothing we could do about a 5/0 Pantheon ganking me and my Varus. We just took our defeat and discussed about strategy, and we decided on changing up the team comp, and settled with Ornn (Garen got banned) top, Diana mid, Ammumu jg, and Lucian + Pyke bot. Because we either mained or were very confident at those champs, (except for ornn, but Garen is on permaban lol), we were very pretty confident in winning- we banned the opponent&#039;s best champs, they banned all the champs that we were M7 at, but we weren&#039;t playing any of them (except for Garen). So, after the bans were done, I lock in my Diana, and I see our top lock in Ornn because we decided his ult would be very good in a teamfight, plus the top said he was pretty good. Then, I see Ahri get locked in on the other team and I laugh, because lolcounters says Diana counters Ahri. So, it was all fine and dandy, we were very confident in our win, especially after seeing Kai&#039;Sa and Janna bot (which both Diana and Pyke will absolutely delete), and then it came to our support to lock in.\r\n\r\nWe waited.\r\n\r\nAnd waited.\r\n\r\nThen I say &#039;hey Pyke, you there?&#039; into the mic, and nothing happens. We all sit silently, and our support doesn&#039;t lock in. The timer runs out, and the game autolocks Anivia. We all shrugged, and we all discussed how Anivia actually works very well with our current team comp anyways, and the game begins. In loading, we see Anivia has the wrong runes- Press The Attack. The remaining four of us discuss anxiously whether Anivia was AFK, and to nobody&#039;s surprise; they were. Now, we were at that point, completely devoid of any hope, but we went into lane.\r\n\r\n5 minutes in, I manage to pick up First Blood onto the Ahri, and blew both her summoner spells for mine. Then, Ammumu ganks botlane and Lucian gets a double. All this time though, Ornn has been dying to Urgot and the Urgod 2/1. Manageable, we say in chat. Then, 10 minutes in, Lucian walks into lane with BORK and 2 levels ahead of both bots, and solo double-kills them. We start laughing, and tell each other that we might actually win. At this point, I was 5/1, having ganked Urgot once and picked up several more kills on Ahri. I did a boosted play and die to her in a towerdive though- I pick up ahri but tower finishes me off anyways. So about 20 minutes in, the score is 9:6- Urgot has 5, Ahri has 1. However, the teamfights started happening and we started running into issues.\r\n\r\nThe Ammumu had to babysit Lucian a bit so Kayn started clearing his jg, and we walks into us with tons more farm and level than Ammumu. Ahri started building a ton of MR, with Morellonomicon and Rylai&#039;s to boot, so I can&#039;t 1-shot her anymore. Kai&#039;sa and Janna are basically still nonfactors, she still gets deleted. We had issues with towers simply because of a 1-man shortage, so we had trouble keeping up with their splitpushes. I couldn&#039;t deal with a slightly fed Urgot, and he was pushing the Rift Herald into our base as well. We lose both toplane turrets, before I die along with Urgot. The rest of our team tries to 3v4 their team, but we simply didn&#039;t have enough damage, even with fed Lucian, and barely manage to hold them off, only after they lose Kai&#039;Sa and Janna. Kayn ults at Lucian and kills him, and they clean up before I respawn and kill Ahri, and scare away Kayn. Then, we kept defending for a solid 15 minutes. We just didn&#039;t have the manpower to do anything- their team wasn&#039;t stupid, so they weren&#039;t letting us pick them off, and we couldn&#039;t win a 4v5, even with a good ult from both Ornn and Amumu, because Urgot and Kayn were both too tanky and Kayn always blew his combo on Lucian, ult, then proceeds to tear him apart. We didn&#039;t have a Blitz or Thresh to CC, no Sona, and certainly no Anivia to ult on their team to followup from Ammumu. (well, we did, but she was lv1 and sitting in fountain.) We had a gold lead against the opponent till the very end.\r\n\r\nIn the end, that&#039;s how we lost the game. We simply didn&#039;t have enough people or damage to be able to deal with their whole team, and even though we were significantly more fed, their people advantage, Elder Drag AND Baron still screwed us up. I keep thinking back to how hard botlane would&#039;ve been stomped if Pyke (or Anivia) had been there, because Lucian was 1v2&#039;ing anyways. Then, I think off all the glorious stuns and executes Pyke could&#039;ve done (this guy is M7 pyke and carried a hopeless ranked game I was playing with him). \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve read this far, you must be really bored to listen to a no friends irl, bronze, edgy teen rant about their own bad luck, but thanks for reading this far. I guess the moral of the story is, always be grateful for your support, because every time I think back, I figured Pyke, or even Anivia support could&#039;ve actually done so much for our team and could&#039;ve easily won the game. \r\n\r\nAlso, I want to know if anyone else had a bad experience with Clash, especially an AFK teammate, mostly to comfort myself, lol.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want some advice as to what to do with my pyke friend- I still think he&#039;s a great teammate, and would love still play with him (if im not mistaken, Clash is still a thing even if you lose both games?), but I really hate for him to afk in our game again. Getting into clash was also a bit chaotic, because my friend couldn&#039;t find the tab, didn&#039;t know how to place a ticket etc, which kinda made me scared something like this will happen. Can somebody tell me how to handle this? I really don&#039;t want to upset him, because in the end, I still wanna play with him, but I&#039;m still very frustrated about that afk. Being the edgelord weebtaku thing I am, idk what I&#039;m supposed to do rn. kek. \r\n\r\nI did consider replacing him with a D3 smurf but I hit myself over that idea because that&#039;s both a dick thing to pull on the Pyke and the other team.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2018-10-15T11:55:34.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did he give you any reason he afk'd? if his cat died (actually happened to one of the guys on my team in clash, he didn't show up at all because he was at the vet. RIP kitty :( but since it was before clash started we could get someone else so it's a bit different) or he lost internet or something serious happened that was out of his control, then that's just an unlucky circumstance, and i'd give him another shot. if he doesn't have a reason, or it's something shitty like he wanted to go do something else, i would personally just cut him from the team. if he doesn't respect you or your team's time, then you have no reason to respect his spot on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2018-10-21T02:24:14.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was messaging me yesterday and he told me it was because his mum unplugged the wifi modem and told him to stop playing games. xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-10-14T11:03:46.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't have an afk if you're the afk :^)\n\nhowever the easiest way to deal with this, is to make friends, around the rank you are, play with them a while prior to clash, like 5-6 games to get a feel for their WR, champ pool, and mechanical decision making (splitting vs teamfighting etc.)\n\nThe other way is to look to the boards, most of us (even the lurkers) are often look for people to play with (both inside and outside of clash)\n\nalternatively you can try and find friends at your school (maybe a club), uni, or even workplace that play league then play with them\n\nfortunately i'm not stuck in your boat, i have 13 players in our clash \"group\" so we have basically 3 teams (double bonus i know these nerds in real life) \n\nIf it comes down to it, add me on SkyStorm (since this acc is perma'd because i was a toxic boi) and if our clash teams need spares, we'll send you a message seeing if you want to come play, we're all pretty chil (some of us are tiltlords, mostly they'll just pick some sort of bullshit pick like AS naut or something and have a laugh), even if we can't bring you to clash (maybe we fill our teams) we're still likely to play with you every now and then, play with us enough and you'll probably get inv'd more often when we're short for flex or even draft pick","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hesed","date":"2018-10-13T22:10:40.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear that man, that sucks. \n\nI'll just share my frustration, although we ended up actually winning our bracket.\n\nI looked on the forums trying to find a team, get a team, get all ready, even chatting strategy with the leader. 2 min before lock-in starts the leader for no reason  given, deletes me as a friend. What a .... move. Here I am, no team, 2 min to go, trying to find something. It was frustrating. Thankfully I found one, but it was stressful and they were pretty good. \n\nI love that Riot is doing these in-house tourny's, but there will be issues and bugs. Most of us don't have 5 actual LOL friends who can all be available to do this. I mean this isn't fortnight lol.

These teams should be full of people you know. \n\nIt was  quite unfortunate this happened to you, I had partied up with a group of 3 and I didn't have a single problem with them.","replies":[]}]}
