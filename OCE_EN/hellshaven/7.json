Does anyone have any news regarding that, or if it's been changed? It's an amazing skin, and I'm pretty annoyed that I couldn't get it since Cho'Gath is one of my favourite champions.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-04-28T02:32:09.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was a make a wish skin so its part of legacy so yes it might come back out on its aniversary or some event but all is unknown","replies":[]}]}
