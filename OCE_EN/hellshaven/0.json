(add a few more if u wish)\r\nif he buys bloodthirster, forbid idol,zzzrot he say : weapons like these must be kept away from meddling hands!\r\nTalisman of ascend- ahhhhh such charm, how is it possible to end up in their hands?\r\nBlade of the ruined king- Why he has been punished siutably\r\nand change all his lines. like dj sona you are able to pick the atmosphere of the rift- divine, corrupted or deafault","replies":[{"poster":"minnie002312","date":"2015-03-29T12:22:39.200+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"soz to {{item:3070}}  on ur parade but im pretty sure riot is trying to make an ultimate skin team?
