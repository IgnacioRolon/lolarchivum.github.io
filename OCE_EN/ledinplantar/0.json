You go 2-8 and expect higher than Silver?\n\nYour MMR was probably already lowish considering your record before the new season started. You had like a 35-40% winrate in the games before the  new season so your MMR was getting low. That along with the soft reset which lowers anyone above silver MMR even more, plus doing very poor in placements means mid-high silver.\n\nIf I were you i'd probably be annoyed to not be atleast gold, but if your a plat player, you should be out of silver in a couple days.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-06T06:37:11.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before your provisionals your MMR was around 1600, which is mid/low Gold if I'm not mistaken.

Your rating isn't your MMR. I've played several games, losing at 0 lp at Bronze 4 without dropping to Bronze 5. Why you ask? Because my MMR is still higher than a Bronze 5 level, so Riot doesn't think I belong in Bronze 5. If you truly belong in Platinum, your LP gains/losses will speak for themselves, they set everyone back, there's challengers in platinum 1 because that's the highest you could come out of provisionals (being diamond 2+ to challenger and having won all provisionals), but they all have challenger mmr, meaning they're going to be versing other ex-challengers with the same MMR for the title.\n\n The reset was just a drop (for everyone), that 2 season wait wasn't a farm fest, your WoW account didn't get hacked, it was training, you've come a long way to do what you do now, and the last game you had will have had the same purpose your 50th game did, use the skills you've learned along the way and you should soon be in the division you deserve.","replies":[]}]}
