Why does this happen. usually i play with friends, draft , and i'm not the one queuing the group. 90% of the time i'm first pick. i wanna play new champs i'm not sure about without being counterpicked or feel a little bit of safety there. i wanna see them pick the zed first and then decide, alright, i'll pick syndra. but when they pick something like ziggs, i can pick something different i can practice a bit on in actual games. or pick a sylas into a cho.\r\n\r\nit feels like a curse. and doesn't matter where in the group i am, invited last or leading, im so often first damn pick.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-11-13T01:17:34.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a typical case of \"Git Gud\"\n\nFirst pick means you have the highest MMR out of your group, ie. you're good enough to be first pick, so the system puts you there (i'm in the same boat, i'm always first pick or first rotation)\n\nFirst pick is actually a good testing ground, if you want to learn matchups that you're uncomfortable with, thats the best way to do it you will almost always get counterpicked, and thats how you learn to not suck in that matchup","replies":[{"poster":"LeDorv","date":"2019-11-13T03:43:08.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but one of the folks in my group used to be challenger D= i cant be highest mmr! new account, but he's played enough\nMight be the reason i can wreck zeds as a squishy no- movement syndra. being forced to pick first.\nand i understand that ill do better with matchups im uncomfortable with, but learning new people you wanna have a little more comfort, you dont really learn anything about a new champ if you get stomped.

Always.\n\nIn 3v3 its especially noticeable as we usually only play it as a 3 man. It's always our ADC main in 1st pick, me in 2nd pick, and our Jungler main in 3rd.\nThe same holds true in ranked flex or normals when we have a full lobby.\n\nNot sure if this is intended by riot _(not sure why it would be?)_ but it seems to be the way it works at the moment.  At least from the pattern we have noticed.","replies":[{"poster":"LeDorv","date":"2019-11-12T22:39:51.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no i am not, i am in the middle, i'm the most average, i dont do the big plays, but i dont feed either, so i imagine my mmr aint the highest. im 20 levels behind the highest, but im not the lowest. i dont main anything, i play fill.\n\nedit- as examples i'm level 93 and we have a few 120's  and a couple 70's\n","replies":[]}]}]}
