But I didnt think I would get a permanent ban. The yasuo I was versing instigated the flamewar, and what he said was just as bad as what I said. The Leona on my team also started a problem with me by calling me stupid and pointing out my score. At the beginning, I didn't think of flaming anyone. But I was insulted and downgraded, so I felt a need to retaliate and defend myself. Every toxic message I made was in response to someone else's toxic message. After I post this ill go and manually report the Yasuo I versed. The difference between the Yasuo and I was that he didn't get reported. He's not going to face punishment for his terrible behavior. He gets off scott free. And the Leona. And the Caitlyn that joined in and also made fun of me. I went into that game relaxed, happy, supportive of the Kindred that had never played Kindred before. I came out degraded and bitter. I wish for a second chance. I never in a million years thought I would get a permanent ban for responding to someone else's toxicity with matched toxicity. This game is my childhood, was my childhood, and I have very fond memories of getting a $25 dollar league gift card for christmas and my birthday. It's all gone now, because of my weak will and resilience. I can't take anything. I don't know how to ignore insults. I'm weak, and it sucks to me that I'll never play this nostalgic game ever again.\n\nThis scenario reminds me exactly of a teacher punishing a kid for punching his bully in the face. Cringy analogy, I know, but I'm 16, and its the analogy that stands out to me. Here is my chat text. Since I can't show another player's chat, you'll have to take my word and infer from my messages what I am responding to.\n\nGame 1\nPre-Game\nFrostFang476: Do what you want dude\nFrostFang476: Doesnt matter, its normal mode\nFrostFang476: chill\nFrostFang476: ez lose\nFrostFang476: I mean win\nIn-Game\nFrostFang476: kindred you should play a game of bots next time you want to learn a champ\nFrostFang476: Not really\nFrostFang476: Its better than using practice tool\nFrostFang476: ff at 15\nFrostFang476: we arent gonna beat a fed zoe, nocturne and yasuo\nFrostFang476: Shut up idiot\nFrostFang476: you're stupid\nFrostFang476: no you are\nFrostFang476: Yeah lucian and leona, go ahead and win this 17-5 game\nFrostFang476: Morons\nFrostFang476: ff at 15\nFrostFang476: shut up dickhead\nFrostFang476: get fucked\nFrostFang476: My team is fucked in the head\nFrostFang476: Alright dickhead\nFrostFang476: Lets 1v1 ill choose yasuo you choose sylas\nFrostFang476: \"\nFrostFang476: Then shut the fuck up dickhead you dont know what its like\nFrostFang476: You realise I cant fuckin use my ult against a yasuo you dumbass?\nFrostFang476: Im muting you, you have 0 iq\nFrostFang476: Okay so how do I knock you up to use it?\nFrostFang476: Huh smart guy?\nFrostFang476: I dont have an ability that knocks you up\nFrostFang476: I cant do anything during the grab you fucking idiot\nFrostFang476: Since Im pulling myself to you\nFrostFang476: Fuck you\nFrostFang476: You're a fucking ape\nFrostFang476: You should kill yourself you fucking mongoloid'\nFrostFang476: I knocked up your mum, bitch\nFrostFang476: You are\nFrostFang476: You're playing yas\nFrostFang476: 1v1 me aram, you choose sylas i choose yas\nFrostFang476: You dont know shit about sylas\nFrostFang476: Hes not playing sylas so how would him whooping my ass have any thing to do with that?\nFrostFang476: Dude you're so good at the game, you press then q\nFrostFang476: So good\nFrostFang476: So amazing\nFrostFang476: No problem/\nFrostFang476: Shut up caitlyn your mum sooked for my dic\nFrostFang476: You're actually 9\nFrostFang476: No one older than 20 uses \"ur:\nFrostFang476: No one over 20 uses \":D\"\nFrostFang476: Yeah nah you have an IQ lower than 3 caitlyn you didnt kite shit you pressed a fucking button\nFrostFang476: Mistook your mum for a fleshlight\nFrostFang476: Lucian and leona, stop acting like dickheads and surrender\nFrostFang476: Dont even know why I play lane\nFrostFang476: Should just play jungle all the time because when I play lane im matched with junglers that dont know how to play\nFrostFang476: Its her first game\nFrostFang476: She knows shes bad\nFrostFang476: Ill blame who I wanted dickhead\nFrostFang476: The problem isnt that you played kindred\nFrostFang476: The problem is you arent good at jungle\nFrostFang476: Nah you are\nFrostFang476: kk\nFrostFang476: Caitlyns having another stroke\nFrostFang476: Had 5 strokes writing that yeah?\nFrostFang476: Shut up dickhead we arent gonna win\nFrostFang476: Thanks gaytlyn\nFrostFang476: No we can still win\nFrostFang476: We shouldnt surrender\nFrostFang476: Like you dickheads said no\n\nHonestly so much of this is fucking disgusting and cringe to look at. If I saw another person typing this shit out in a League game, I'd feel so much second hand embarassment I'd die. I guess it looks worse when there isnt anyone else's messages to compare it to. They were saying the exact same shit. I promise you. I just feel like permanent bans arent the way to go. I could've received a 1 year ban and I'd get the exact same message. \n\nYou can see how I quickly descend into hatred and anger, like a fucking unleashed animal. I start off by saying Kindred can play who they want and not worry about it. I go on to complain about losing so hard and wanting to surrender. Leona calls me stupid. I reply with the same thing. Yasuo makes fun of my score, I call him a dickhead. Yasuo continues making fun of me being terrible at Sylas. I call him a dickhead again. At this point Yasuo says I havent used my ult once. I didnt know I could but I tried to reply with confidence to protect my dignity. But he just stomps it to the ground. I realise I was wrong. I get called an ape, and reply the same. I call him a mongoloid (retard), I make a dumb \"your mum\" joke because the topic was using my E to knock Yas up so I can use his ult. I try to prove that its not because im terrible at the game that im losing, but its because im versing a yasuo top lane as sylas. I use childish insults because I try to prove I am winning the argument. More childish insults, very sad. I blame the Kindred, the most innocent player on our team, possibly in our game. Caitlyn makes a dumb insult and i say she had a stroke. I respond with an equally dumb insult. The game ends. I dont report anyone. I get reported. I should have reported that Yasuo. He deserves the exact same punishment as I get. Leona and Caitlyn both deserve punishments. But NONE of them will get it. And thats what I find wrong about this entire event.\n\n\nBefore this ban, I got a chat restriction. How it jumped to a permanent ban is beyond me, and why Riot thinks permanent bans are the way to go is beyond me. \n\nWhat is the purpose of a permanent ban? A 1 month, 2 month, any number of months. 1 year, 2 years. These would all make ample punishments and make the ban memorable enough for me to look back on it and resist the urge to be toxic back. A permanent ban leaves no room for improvement. Given no chances. But maybe I dont deserve any. I'm sorry.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-10-05T07:28:47.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, don't post here, go to support if you want to appeal a ban\n\nSecondly, you literally told someone to kill themselves, that's one of Riot's big triggers (alongside Racism and Hate Speech) so even if you go to support, you aren't likely getting your account back.\n\nChat bans are for minor issues (excessive swearing, insults) but not for Hate Speech, Suicide Encouragement or Racism, thats an instant 14 dayer or Perma. You jumped  to perma because you told someone to kill themselves.\n\nI was in your boat too, this account (the one i post with) was perma'd in Season 5 for Suicide Encouragement, and like you, I have the temper of a ticking time bomb, i've found the only way to control it is to type but not send what i want to tell the idiots i have to play with. Otherwise Muteall is your only go to.\n\nYou also state its a Norms so you should already be well aware that no one is likely to play properly, so there's no real reason to get worked up about it. Its just a Norms, all you're doing is learning a champ or mastering a champ, your KDA means nothing and your scores are irrelevant, norms are literally for Chilling, having a laugh and some competitive trash talking (ie. nothing toxic).\n\nBad Luck on the account, but restrain yourself next time you get put with 4 mongoloids, just mute them and move on","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-04T06:57:56.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I'm no moderator or person of any importance so whether you care or take anything I have to say seriously is you're own right. \nHonestly, I have been in you're shoes many times and in fact been reported for similar violations. The only reason in my opinion you were disciplined from what I see and no one else was is because more reports were sent about you're behavior than there was about there's. I don't agree with that part of system because many times it hasn't worked for me but I understand the logic. \nHaving said all that you really didn't give yourself or you're team much of a chance for success. Not to say it's all on you and they aren't equally responsible but what I'm saying is \"you\" have a choice, \"you\" can make a difference and in this case \"you\" chose that path which led to this conclusion. I know it's easy to say because when someone triggers you it's not easy to deal with while still feeling good about the game. A change of perspective and determination to stay in control will not only keep you out trouble but could also win the game. If you can't stay in control and or reply to the comments in a diffusive manner then just mute and concentrate on the game. Remember, we are all the same, we are all human, what sets us apart is how we deal with things differently that makes up the people we are. Ask yourself how will I deal with this and show I am better?","replies":[]}]}
