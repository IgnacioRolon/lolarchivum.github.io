However, it only shows ranked stats ._. This is pretty annoying to some players who don&#039;t play ranked at all, those only play normal games but still the new client doesn&#039;t update the feature to check your normal games&#039; no. of wins and other stats like the old client does. Please looking forward to fix this Riot games!","replies":[{"poster":"Pömp3l","date":"2017-03-24T13:48:57.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"y, I hate that too. I played this game for 5 years and the champion level is new too. This way my profil looks like I am a complete noob, because I haven't played that mch over the last year and haven't played rank for a while. Additionally I don't get why it is missing, because there is more than enough unused space in the profil page.","replies":[]}]}
