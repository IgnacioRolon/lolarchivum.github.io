While, the new bloody client only displays that so tiny at the top left corner -__- like WTF? but not yet, it only shows the number of wins and losses but didn&#039;t show the detailed statistics like: TAKEDOWNS, WINS and CREEP SCORE. The new client DOES NOT have this feature yet and it&#039;s still missing, which is stupid. Riot&#039;s full saying like we will able to have more features in the new client, yet, this simple feature is not displayed? How crap is that? HONESTLY, all of you stupid freaking RIOT. Dumb af!!","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-11-10T15:17:57.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought you meant client stability, but this works too.","replies":[]}]}
