But with this new system, your experienced players now are having this experience forced onto them.\r\n\r\nI understand the idea behind unlimited leveling, and larger rewards at milestones. However, when each level takes ~2500xp just after level 30, without first win of the day bonus it takes about 15-20 games to EARN ANY BLUE ESSENCE AT ALL!!! This is insane.\r\n\r\nI saw the change made to the first win of the day bonus today on OCE, as part of patch 7.23, but it is not nearly enough. You are promoting people playing on multiple accounts, and playing one game a day as the first win of the day is the only way to level up without spamming/grinding tons of games. \r\n\r\nRather than having so much focus on the first win of the day, I propose something along the lines of the following system:\r\n1. First and foremost, BRING BACK rewards after each game. A small amount of blue essence is all we need (25-50 ish). This encourages people to play regularly. \r\n2. Reduce the first win of the day bonus more, but slightly increase the XP per game. Rather than earning 700ish (total) for first win of the day,  and earning around 150-200 for other games, bring the exp closer to 500 total for first win of the day, and around 200-300 for each game. This way people are encouraged to play mutliple games in a row, rather than jumping on once a day. \r\n3. Set a minimum blue essence amount for leveling up, that is actually significant. Maybe 400ish? And the chance to win 1-3 champion capsules. This way people aren&#039;t grinding a whole bunch of games to get unlucky and being disappointed in all the time they just spent aiming to level up.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Not enough essence. Add essence per game, reduce first win of the day in favour of higher rewards after each game. DONT MAKE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS A GRIND. IT IS THE ONE THING IT NEVER HAS BEEN, BUT IT IS THREATENING TO BECOME JUST THAT!\r\n\r\nThankyou,\r\nDylan","replies":[{"poster":"AudaciousTemplar","date":"2017-11-21T05:29:47.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"In addition to this, tack on a little extra BE for the most honourable player on the team.

Otherwise they may give you missions based on playing one or more game in the rotating game mode, but it only gives you Blue Essence if you win.\nIf this happens, then it is better than nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-11-21T03:19:09.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do the math..... the higher exp by 150 per first win vs the 50BE straight up. 150exp wins every time as it is the equivalent of one game 25 minutes long won. 50 BE is also about this level.\nHowever levelling up actually gives you more than the old system would have per number of games as proven by RIOT.\nTherefore getting that extra exp game feels better so in long run way more BE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-21T03:16:56.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game died with 7.22 patch, why are we still playing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2017-11-21T03:11:55.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still don't have all the champions and it's going to be impossible for me to get all the champions I want now.

Time Limited, be quick for this, even though it may not grant you much Blue Essence overall, it is at least something, still better than nothing. If you want to get Blue Essence as fast as possible, I strongly recommend you to go and complete missions.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-23T10:21:27.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The missions to BE conversion rate is terrible though, as it always is.\n\n240 BE = Key Fragment\n640 BE = Project Champion Orb (Champion shard, chance to get a second)\n960 BE = Skin Shard + Orange Essence (plus potentially another orb, an emote, a gemstone, or a \"hextech exclusive skin shard)\n1280 BE = Project skin shard (not the new ones)\n1600 BE = Icon + Three Hunters borders\n\nOut of these, the only one i wouldn't trade the BE for what is a potential drop, is the Icon + borders the rest are totally worth way more then the BE.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-21T03:22:37.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bro math is always so fail.","replies":[]}]}
