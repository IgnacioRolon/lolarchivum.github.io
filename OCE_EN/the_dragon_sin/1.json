Not a lot maybe around 150 essence?\r\n\r\nThis would allow players to get their mastery tokens on their favorite champs. \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think and maybe if a Red can add to the conversation or let us know if you guys have considered this idea that would be sweet. \r\n\r\nThankyou,\r\nWarmazzta","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-29T10:27:45.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you realise next patch they release a buy essence for x ip right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-29T10:16:01.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure.","replies":[]}]}
