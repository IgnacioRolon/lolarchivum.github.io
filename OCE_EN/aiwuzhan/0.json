I usually just play hyper snowball champions (evelynn, graves etc) until I'm in gold then switch back to my main (supp).\n\nIt seems like a joke but my diamond friend who is an Udyr main struggles biiig time to get out of silver. Last account he ranked up to Plat started in Silver 1 and he was in there for nearly 60 games. Once he broke into gold I think he got Plat in around 20 games.\n\nSilver is the worst ELO by far.\n\nGood luck.","replies":[{"poster":"AiWuZhan","date":"2018-09-18T04:52:19.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
