It actualy matters how you act in game now!\r\n\r\nToday, we change the honor system so now you have levels of honor! You start at level 2, and can either go down by telling people too much truth in game, or go up by sucking everyone&#039;s specific body part that will be left unmentioned! (Note: You can also do nothing and you&#039;ll be good too, but let&#039;s be honest, you&#039;re not casual enough for that)\r\n\r\nHonor levels reward you with key fragments, they now drop randomly whenever you turn the game on, so you&#039;ll never know if you&#039;re going to get anything! A pleasant surprise or a big dissapointment? You&#039;ll know the next time you turn on the game!\r\n\r\nWhen do you level up honor? Nobody knows! There is absolutely no knowledge of your progress between levels, so the best you can do is suck some more and hope one day Riot games will notice your, cough cough, involvement.\r\n\r\nBut if you somehow actualy manage to reach higher level, then congratulations! You&#039;re officialy egible to earn more rewards, such as capsules that have even more keys! Except for those, you can also get more champion shards to your lovely collection of +200 champion shards in your loot menu, and have a rare chance to unlock permanently skins that were once awarded for ref-linking people into the game!\r\n\r\nWhere&#039;s the catch, you ask?\r\n\r\nThe catch is, you don&#039;t get honored for being friendly, you get honored for one shotting enemies, and nothing else! Watch in dissapointment as you&#039;ve succesfully untilted half of your team and brought around a lost match just to have all the honor go to your ally Zed for one shotting enemy Soraka! Isn&#039;t it just exciting? \r\n\r\nHope you like the changes, and we&#039;ll see you on the rift~","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-05T02:01:31.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly you're not too wrong about the catch there. I had a number of games so far where a specific player was being outright abusive to another teammate without so much as a kind or constructive word the whole match, yet at the end screen they get the little pop-up as the \"Most Honorable\" player on our team as if some kind of joke. Many players mistake, or just can't be bothered to differentiate \"Honor\" with \"Being the best in playing the game\". I suppose it's such normal behaviour to call a struggling teammate trash and suggest them to uninstall or kill themselves that many don't even see the dishonor in such remarks â€” and probably even agree with them, especially if the one saying so is carrying them to a win.\n\nThe other habit I've noticed is that people love to honor the \"Not this time\" button, so the little bit of bonus honor that everyone gets when the whole team honors someone is not common, even coming off good games where everyone was nice. Maybe a rate of 1 in every 20 matches that I've seen so far. I play in OCE we've had this honor update for a bit longer, but I've seen the bonus honor proc less than 4 times, maybe I've just been unlucky.\n\nI think the system is at least better than what it was before the change and can result in some good moments. I'd rather there was no public announcement of who was \"most honorable\" in the post lobby though. If you get it then you don't need the lobby to know to be satisfied with it, and due to the issues mentioned above it's often as well as: 'This is the person who stomped you hardest, and their teammates appreciate it!', or 'This is the player who neglected your team the whole game and was an unpleasant grump but split push to victory anyway!'.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-05T08:48:40.602+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sometimes being good at the game IS honour worthy, and everyone values things differently. To some people, playing well or carrying is enough to deserve an honour, for others it is staying calm in the face of negativity, even if you don't do all that well that deserves merit. This is the beauty of honour, to progress quickly you have to appeal to ALL spectrums of people, not just some, and it also puts the choice in your hands to decide what is or isn't worth recognition, with the added bonus of being able to communicate more specifically to the player what you are honouring them for.\n\nAs for the bonus honour, you need at 3 honours to get the special badge in the post game lobby, and maybe you did single handedly untilt your team, but maybe your top laner also dragged your team back with good shotcalling and leadership, at which point, would the votes not be split depending on what each player values more? The badge isn't supposed to be common, because if it was common, it wouldn't feel special, it wouldn't feel like extra recognition it would just be whatever. It's designed so you have to go above and beyond the norm.\n\nAs for simple honours not being all that common, I think that depends very much on the type of player you are, and your level of play. In Bronze, skill is rewarded much more highly than elsewhere, because the games are so polarising and being fed means a LOT more. In Gold players still value skill, but personally I find there is a lot more emphasis on level-headedness as well. In Diamond the climate would be different again.\n\nAdding to that, someone who is say, a Jungle main with a support like mentality is likely to receive a lot more honours than someone who just gets really fed, because while a fed someone is much more likely to have a positive impact on the game, that jungle supporter is going to have a direct positive impact on the *players*, an ultimately, that's what honour is rewarding, having a positive impact on players. \n\nWins reward good gameplay, Honour rewards good sportsmanship.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-06T01:55:56.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=m40dIeg2,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-07-05T08:48:40.602+0000)\n>\n> Sometimes being good at the game IS honour worthy, and everyone values things differently.

Few care about sportsmanship in League and the new Honor system serves to make this more obvious to me. If you see the beauty in such a thing I envy your perception.\n\nWhen I spoke of the \"bonus honor\" I didn't mean the little flag that is made public when someone gets 3 or more honor after a match, I mean the thing that happens when all 5 of your team gives someone (not the same someone in particular) an honor. It will pop up in the lobby with the message such as: \"Everyone on your team honored a teammate, everyone gets a bit of bonus honor this time!\". When they announced the honor system they said that you would progress even if you aren't directly receiving honor, as long as you play to win, and what they mean by that is what I called the \"bonus honor\" that it gives when everyone on the team chooses to use the system rather than skip it. Lots of people just skip it so there really isn't much progress at all being made on your own honor level unless you are directly receiving honor.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-06T03:48:01.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone honouring in a game is not a requirement for you to progress outside of earning direct honours. The only requirement is that you don't play negatively and therefore are losing honour. Honours are far more valuable to some than others. Personally I find myself honouring at least every second game, but a friend I play with, he only honours exceptional behaviour so he'll only use it maybe one in 5-10.\n\nEveryone approaches honour differently, and that is why it is special, because everyone gets to decide what they think is honourable. You aren't limited by anything Riot dictates, it's your choice to honour and it's your choice not to.","replies":[{"poster":"Bordable","date":"2017-07-08T19:27:46.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant this whole post as a joke, you guys are taking it a bit too seriously... {{summoner:3}} \n\nAlthough it still would be nice to at least know how close i am to reaching next level in honor","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-09T01:56:32.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh I just gave a serious response to a serious comment.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-05T05:53:24.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had a good crack up with this well written piece nice work","replies":[]}]}
