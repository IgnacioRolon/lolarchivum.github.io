I ask for anyone of a high level to help me improve. I feel like I am locked down and inconsistent with my play. I need someone who can help me improve, play consistently every game, and avoid tilting and keeping a good mental. I feel as if I have been stuck in the same level, and progressed extremely slowly, having good periods and terrible periods with different aspects of my game going on tilt.\r\nI am NOT asking to be carried, if I wanted to be directly in a higher ELO I would just get my account boosted. But I actually want to learn. It would be of great help and pleasure if  someone with lots of experience could casually help me to get better. If you could duo ranked with me on a lower level smurf, that would be great, but if not, normals would be fine. But I believe that people bring a different mentality and level of skill to ranked, which makes normals completely different.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Sierra 117","date":"2015-11-22T03:15:24.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couple things I can tell you to work on based on your match history. \n\n\n* - CS, CS is important,  because around 15-20 cs = 1 kill. Average you should be aiming for ATM is, 70 cs by 10, 140 by 20, and around 210 by 30. I've noticed a lot of silver players, are decent at csing in lane, but after lane phase is over, people barely cs except while seiging mid, where you have 5 people sharing 1 lanes worth of xp and gold. \n\n\n* - Losing lane gracefully. It's one thing to lose your lane going 0-1/0-2, it's an entirely different ballgame when you die 5-6 times within 20 minutes of the game and let the enemy laner snowball. One thing I see players in your bracket do is to constantly fight and die until the enemy laner is strong enough to towerdive (generally after 2-3 kills) then complain that the jungler doesnt help.\n\n\n* -Game knowledge, understanding things like, champion and item powerspikes and cooldowns is very important. For example, when I play riven, I will almost always go aggressive right after hitting levels 3 and 6, this is when I powerspike. I also know that if someone that soft counters me, say garen, if garen Q's a minion, his Q is now on a cooldown, I now have a window of opportunity to win a trade.  This type of knowledge helps you to either win your lane, comeback in your lane, or not feed it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-22T02:34:14.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I myself can not help you. But, if you watch the professionals look at:\n- How they build.\n- Where they ward.\n- How they position themselves in game. \n- When and when not to leave lane.\n- Look at masteries.\n- Find your promising role.\n\nAsk useful questions to the right Summoners and you will get great results.(not many great Summoners on here though. I myself is one of them.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-11-22T02:21:14.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"In all seriousness, give up caring.

What I did to improve was play other mobas or have/watch people who are familiarized with the game more than I ( I started 6 months ago and I'm Gold, but I've played Smite and Dota 2 for ages ). Also, when having a bad time, don't lash out and provide criticism where it won't insult teammates and lastly be consistent and think things through with everything and especially communication.
