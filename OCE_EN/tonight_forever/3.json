Back then I didn&#039;t even know of mechanics and pressuring and all the skills that make a high level player. I&#039;d like to put out a request to any high elo player that would be able to essentially train me to fundamentals of this game so that I can become a better player, and ultimately achieve the skill level of high level player. What I would be looking for this player to do is, in their own free time, be able to do custom/normal games (or anything that would work) with me to be able to assess my gameplay and give me tips and things to do that will help me to improve.\r\nIn the recent week I&#039;ve taken a break from ranked games, as I feel that they are not the place to learn. I&#039;ve been playing normals trying out champions that are mechanically intensive to play (like Azir), but I feel that I am not learning anything by myself, playing with and against people in Bronze III, IV, and V.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not limited to playing any specific champion, but if it helps anything my main for pretty much 90% of my level 30 days was Rumble (although I have not played much of him recently.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have a particular role that I play, but the champions I like to play fit into mid and top lane.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to my summoner on LoLKing if it helps: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/620481#profile\r\n\r\nFeel free to add me (phantomz) on oce.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Looking for a high level player to be able to give me some guidance and help (possibly in the form of playing normal games with me) , essentially teach me everything they know to help me improve my game knowledge and mechanical skill at the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks =)","replies":[{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-09T21:21:21.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of videos on youtube and sites you can use for tips that will help you out a lot.\nHere are a few I am practicing myself :D\n\n- MAP AWARENESS\nThis is definitely key, make sure you're paying attention to where the enemy is so you know when you can go all in on your opponent and so you know when you can push.\n\n- PINGING, ping ping ping ping ping.\nThis may seem stupid but a lot of people never ping MIA ever. Even if you have to spam three or four times where the enemy is or if they're missing, JUST DO IT~ Make it clear to your team that you don't know where your laner is or if they're not aware, that there is an enemy near them. \n\n- WARDING {{item:2043}} seeing is everything.\nMake sure you're warding 99.99% of the time, its better to spend your gold on buying a ward, green or pink. or both! than dying to the enemy because you didn't have a ward in the bush that you needed. It also helps your team out a lot with map awareness! There are also a lot of key areas you can place your wards for maximum use of vision, there are pictures all over the interwebs for that. \n\n- LAST HITTING, the right way to pewpew.\nLast hitting minions is also a good way to get ahead of the enemy regardless of them being stronger or not in laning phase, that way you won't fall behind in gold. Practice in custom games till you think you have the hang of it!\n\n- KITING AND TRADING, wooooosh.\nWhen you go to throw a few skills at the enemy or just go all in, be aware of their items, as well as what skills and spells they have left up! This will help you so much\n\n- BUILDING {{item:3184}} {{item:1037}} \nA lot of people surprisingly are not aware, build AGAINST your enemy. Its okay to use builds off sites too! but its most important when you're able to build against the enemy, instead of using some random build you may not understand or just think its very powerful because you saw Bjergsen or Faker build it.\n\n- BARON AND DRAGON CONTROL \nMake sure you're keeping a close eye on dragon and baron, getting that fifth drag or last minute baron may just win you the game. This also relates to map awareness and the location of the enemies. You wouldn't want to start it when they've respawned and are coming to slay you all, unless you're {{champion:17}} and just throw shrooms everywhere, maybe you'll be okay. ;)\n\n- ATTITUDE\nAlways have a positive outlook on the game regardless of your situation or you'll just end up not having fun. Forget the flamers and afkers, just mute and report then carry on being fabulous. {{champion:44}} \n\nThere are many more tips that can help you out like Roaming, Peeling, Teamfighting, Initiating and Disengaging, Split pushing, Poke and Sustain etc. But you shouldn't push yourself too hard to learn everything at once, take it easy and have fun :) hope this helped some !","replies":[]}]}
