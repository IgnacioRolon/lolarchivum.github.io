You should have gotten the RP before moving to avoid this mess :P What JF said is right, RP cards that are physically purchased can only be redeemed in their country of purchase, so since you've brought an American RP card, it won't work if your account is still in OCE.\n\nIt's weird that you can't use your card to buy things online. Have you tried getting a temp card from the post office?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JF Muted","date":"2015-01-15T06:54:15.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I don't really know much, but first thing I'd do is check that the RP card works for all servers. I know that in Australia you can get RP cards that only work on OCE accounts, so maybe you've got one that only works on NA accounts. Check that first. (sorry I'm not much help)","replies":[]}]}
