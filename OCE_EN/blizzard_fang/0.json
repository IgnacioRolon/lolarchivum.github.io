She took off her boots and sat on the first chair she found near the chimney; she was tired of walking. With a slight move of her left hand, she called Bren, her personal servant.\r\n-Where&#039;s Anyssa? - asked the deceiver. -I told you that I wanted her here as soon as I arrived. Go get her.\r\nWithout a word, Bren disappeared behind the door. It didn&#039;t take long for him to be back, now with Anyssa at his side. She had blonde curly hair, a pair of blue eyes that resembled the deep blue sea of the Shadow Isles and a perfect smile for lying. The girl was a twenty year-old orphan that LeBlanc had adopted during those days when she needed more eyes than she had. It was strange for a normal spy kid to stay loyal for so long, but Anyssa&#039;s case was a different one; she had always been her favourite, and she had received the well-deserved payments.\r\n-Hello, sweetling. How are you? -LeBlanc greeted her. -Come and sit here by my side, Ive been waiting so long for our meeting.\r\n-Everything&#039;s fine madame. -answered politely the young girl, turning her head down before seating at her side.\r\nLeBlanc knew that she longed to know why she had been called in such a fashion, but the girl had been taught well during her childhood. Not everyone could ask questions without permission. While the girl looked at the fire, LeBlanc prepared the long-awaited drinks. Silence filled the room until she handled the potion to Anyssa.\r\n-Here you have my dear, as a prize for your work. -said LeBlanc while handling her what would mean her salvation. -I must have been tiring, especially to someone as calm as you; Piltover&#039;s city life is too noisy for the likes of us. Drink and rest now, you shall have everything you want.\r\n-Thanks madame, but I don&#039;t deserve no appreciation, I just did what had to be done. -lied the girl with a bright smile.\r\n-I am the one who decides what&#039;s to be appreciated or not, Anyssa. -stated the last living member of the Black Rose. -We shall share a drink.\r\nUnable to refuse her master&#039;s invitation, Anyssa emptied the cup in her throat at the very same time than LeBlanc did. The deceiver could notice in the girl&#039;s face that she had not liked the drink, but she didn&#039;t care now. The job had been done. Now she only needed to sleep and everything would be over.\r\nShe told Anyssa to go to her room; after such a tiring work she had gained the right to use LeBlanc&#039;s chambers for a night, and as she had a lot of work to do.\r\nOnce she ensured that Anyssa was sleeping, LeBlanc ordered Bren to take care of the girl until she was back. Then the deceiver headed back to the catacombs; it was time to pay a visit to Thresh.\r\nIt had not been easy to imprison the chain warden; a lot of men died fighting him, and LeBlanc had taken down the remaining servants that knew about his presence in the Noxian catacombs. But he was the key to his plan; she needed his passages, the lanterns that could take her wherever she wanted if well prepared.\r\nVanishing in the shadows, it didn&#039;t take long for her to arrive to the cell. The chain warden was fast asleep, his eyes glowing in the dark and his chains moving slightly, as if they were alive. She waited long for the potion to affect her, but once she started feeling asleep, she entered the cell.\r\nA storm of souls came out of Thresh&#039;s open mouth: she could barely feel the pain because of how asleep she felt. Her skin was burning, but she didn&#039;t care. Her legs, her arms, her chest; she was unable to feel. No pain, no screams, no lights. She couldn&#039;t even distinguish her own hands in the dark. After a short while, she woke up in her bed. It didn&#039;t take long for her to fall asleep again; it felt like no more than a nightmare.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-06-28T08:16:07.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I was expecting a really low quality shipfic, but it's actually pretty nice! Just wondering though, did you write this in one go?

It's an insight into what LB gets up to off the rift, and I think that's cool! It really gave me a sense that this is just one small snapshot of a bigger world.
