I&#039;ve been playing for almost a week before patch 6.22 was released and the game was running perfectly with an average ping of 50ms using my phone.\r\nWhen patch 6.22 was realised I tried to update my client but the speed,as mentioned on the title, didn&#039;t even reach the 10KBps ( as I&#039;m writing this it&#039;s downloading at 3 KBps).\r\nI&#039;ve searched in the net for some solutions but without any result.\r\nI&#039;d like to ask to the OCE community if someone have a solution or if someone could upload the client somehow so that I can download it from the browser since when I tried to download Garena LoL it was going pretty fast ( I was trying to download garena hopping that I could use the client files to &quot;fill&quot; up the normal client.).\r\nI already tried to check trought speedtest my speed too and on the Brisbane server I have 23ms ping,22MBps ~ download and an average 4-5MBps on upload.\r\nMy computer is a laptop msi GT80 SLI.\r\nThanks for your time and hope in a fast answer, can&#039;t wait to play ( yeah I love this game :3)","replies":[{"poster":"Orunitor","date":"2016-11-13T20:50:11.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your using your internet through your phone....if you havent figured out already what the problem is just by saying that then you should really rethink computer gaming.\n\nlive far away from town. problem number 2. most out of city towns cant or stuggle to get fast internet like fibre.\n\n# \" I've been playing for almost a week before patch 6.22 was released and the game was running perfectly with an average ping of 50ms using my phone.\"\n\nuhh ping has nothing to do with your download speed.\n\n\n#\" My computer is a laptop msi GT80 SLI. \"#\nok cool, what does your laptops gfx card have to do with internet speed?....\n\no man you really should not be playing video games.","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-11-14T11:22:10.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Orunitor,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=pilAWZ60,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-13T20:50:11.980+0000)\n>\n> your using your internet through your phone....if you havent figured out already what the problem is just by saying that then you should really rethink computer gaming.\n> \n> live far away from town. problem number 2. most out of city towns cant or stuggle to get fast internet like fibre.\n> \n> # &quot; I&#x27;ve been playing for almost a week before patch 6.22 was released and the game was running perfectly with an average ping of 50ms using my phone.&quot;\n> \n> uhh ping has nothing to do with your download speed.\n> \n> \n> #&quot; My computer is a laptop msi GT80 SLI. &quot;#\n> ok cool, what does your laptops gfx card have to do with internet speed?....\n> \n> o man you really should not be playing video games.\n\nHonestly mate, if you dont have anything constructive to say, fuck off. Idc if I get banned for saying so. This community is the worst amongst gaming. Your obviously not tech support and know very little, so instead of putting your 2 cents where it's not wanted, how about trying to help this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Orunitor","date":"2016-11-14T19:16:33.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what i said was constructive and informative.\n\n1 - using mobile phone internet/wifi is indeed really slow, if compared to a ethernet cable.\n\n2 - its true that most of outer city towns cant get the same super fast internet most city people can.\n\n3 - your ping to a game server really doesnt have any relevance to your actual download speed.\n\nso please tell me, how is that not constructive or informative? i know very little? i sure know more then you if im giving you the 100% facts and truths and you think im making stuff up.\n\nBut really the OP answered his own question. said his download speed is fine, and that it was working fine before. THERE IS YOUR ANSWER\n\n\nHERE IS YOUR ANSWER \n\nits not a you problem its a LoL problem,a client problem effecting the speed at which users can download the game, it happens with many other games, i have a 10mb/s download speed and sometimes things like to download at 50kb/s. but even then right away i know its a game client problem and nothing to do with me. it doesnt take a genius to figure that out\n\nor its a ISP problem. either way, its nothing on your end you can fix yourself / nothing you can do about it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nimnael","date":"2016-11-13T22:13:13.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've just asked for some help on solving my issue. I love video games and ain't gonna stop playing cause I love travelling too. I'm a back packer and right now I've got my work here so there's no point for me to go in town and spend more money on fuel. My internet connection is not the best browser but isn't the worst either. I even mentioned that the download speed is not that low since I already tested it using the Brisbane server.about the useless infos I gave out is just cause that way you can have all the details I've about my situation and so someone that actually want to help me can have the infos they might need out of that. Thanks for your \"help\" tho. Have a good day man.\nEdit: the msi gt80 sli is not a graphic card but ,as I said,is the model of the laptop.
