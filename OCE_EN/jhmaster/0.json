Same thing goes when you search someone's name to look at their profile and you can't view their match history and it says they have not played a game its because they are not on the alpha. Just wait till beta, there will still be room for improvement until the full release. Anything to do with connectivity between Alpha and Legacy will be amended during the beta transition.","replies":[]}]}
