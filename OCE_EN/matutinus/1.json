Upon accepting his request a bot message from another unknown account immediately popped up advertising ELO boosting websites. I checked my friends list to remove the account but it was not found so i cannot remove it. Have contacted Support waiting for a response but has anyone else seen/experienced something like this? worried account could be hacked so am not logging out until Riot responds just to be sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-18T06:42:35.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just a bot that automatically adds people, advertises the boost and most likely removes them from friends list (hence why you couldn't find them on your list). Either the account was hacked (if it's level 30 that's most likely the case) or it was created for the sole purpose of advertising (most likely level 1 accounts). Just report the incident to Riot, with a screenshot if possible, and let them deal with it. The chances of your account being hacked because of it is slim, even with your username they'd need to get your password which is a feat in itself. Just make sure not to visit any links they gave you because that will probably be what causes your account to be hacked, if at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-18T06:00:05.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a few of the same, just go to block player and put their name in. I wouldn't stress about it, if you're really concerned change your password but I'm pretty sure it's just a bot that logs on, msgs everyone in their list and instantly logs off. If you realy want to screw them over report to riot the company trying to do it and get them to match other accounts IP, get them banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-18T06:57:23.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they add you, message you, remover you. it's not an invisible account. that's **f**ucking dumb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2015-03-18T06:46:23.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the responses, yeah there was no way i was clicking those links, years of internet usage have taught me not to do that, unless its some email from a Nigerian prince, those guys are totally legit (/s)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-18T06:47:53.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> unless its some email from a Nigerian prince, those guys are totally legit\n\nTrust me when I say you don't want to trust my long lost relatives.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-03-18T06:36:15.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they just log off super quick","replies":[]}]}
