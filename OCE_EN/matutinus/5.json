So i turn off firewall/other security and it still blocks the game. now i lose one of my ranked promotional games, get no loss forgiven and get a 20 min time penalty because of your dodgy servers. Funny thing was team was talking about their last two games where the ENTIRE enemy team and one player on their team had not connected the previous game, and the game before that, so this is clearly  an ongoing problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-03-03T23:28:35.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nWe're aware of an issue with the servers at the moment - please see [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/IOuWqG7B-troubleshooting-connection-issues-4032015) on our boards for how to help.\n\nCheers \nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
