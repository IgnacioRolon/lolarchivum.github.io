I'm not sure whether this is due to Skirmisher enchantment, Devourer upgrade, Ww's ult, or possibly a combination of all three factors. I don't have any recorded replays (Lolreplay crashes client), but apparently this is a well known bug. This makes it very hard to play Tryndamere against Ww (and possibly other champs that can abuse this bug), as his \"Undying rage\" is more like \"Dying rage\" now. Is Riot working on a bugfix, or will tryn just go to being unusable in certain situations (or blind pick) at the risk of there being a Warwick on the other team?","replies":[{"poster":"mateani","date":"2016-01-23T06:38:23.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've had the same problem sometimes when playing tryn. it's really fucked when u know you not going to die then WTF you dead. lol bug needs to get fixed plz.","replies":[]}]}
