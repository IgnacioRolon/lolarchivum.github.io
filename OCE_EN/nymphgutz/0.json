Ekko and Ahri had recently been becoming closer, almost leaving their two other friends in the dust. Especially today as Ahri had asked Ekko to meet with her alone once they were on their break, Ekko quickly agreed being unable to refuse Ahri&rsquo;s pure beauty. The morning dragged on and on for Ekko as he couldn&rsquo;t stand not knowing the reason his friend had asked to be alone with him. \r\n\r\nUnbeknown to Ekko today was the day his ally Jinx had been planning to visit the academy to discuss her next destructive plan for Piltover with him. Although what Jinx saw when she showed made her sick with rage and quickly go back the way she had came to begin putting her new plan into action, Ahri was leaning towards Ekko seconds away from landing one of her charming kisses on his lips. Ekko became star struck unable to ignore his newfound love for his friend as they upsettingly departed to finish off their day.\r\n\r\nThe day was drawing to a close when an announcement came over the academy&rsquo;s announcement system, &ldquo;The building&rsquo;s been rigged to blow, try to escape I&rsquo;d love to waste my bullets. It&rsquo;s all part of the plan I just made up.&rdquo; At this point Ekko was struck with panic he knew exactly who would do this, he reached for his phone to call Caitlyn before the academy was blown to shreds, Caitlyn responded with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the case,&rdquo; after Ekko had told her the situation before ending the call.\r\n\r\nCaitlyn and Vi rushed to school as fast as they could hoping that it would be fast enough to save the citizens of the town that Caitlyn had vowed to protect. The two partners got to the school only to see the horrific state it was in; during the time it had taken them to make their way to the academy the mysterious person behind this hostage situation had blown up sections of the school which were now flaming and had those who tried to escape lying in front of her engulfed with bullet wounds from the three guns which were surrounding her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Caitlyn got closer she knew this mysterious persons identity instantly, it was Jinx who had caused her trouble before as she wreaked havoc throughout Piltover. Once Jinx had spotted Caitlyn another messaged was muttered through the speakers, &ldquo;One gun? Pathetic. But where are your other guns, hat lady?&rdquo; an insult that Caitlyn was all too familiar with at this point as the amount of times these two had met was becoming uncountable, &ldquo;Oh look and you brought fat hands.&rdquo; Jinx followed up her previous statement as Vi came into her vision.\r\n\r\nAt this point the students and teachers within the academy were terrified knowing that any part of the building could be the next to blow. The teachers tried their hardest to keep the student&rsquo;s calm while being utterly terrified themselves. The current occupants within the academy tried their hardest not to make and movements that could result in them being shot at or blew to pieces. \r\n\r\nCaitlyn and Vi stayed somewhat in the distance fearing if they made the slightest wrong move the school would be blown to shreds. They sat and waiting for Jinx to make a move while putting together their plan. It didn&rsquo;t take very long before Jinx decided to finally make her intentions clear, demanding for Ekko and Ahri to slowly leave the building or she would blow up the entire academy piece by piece. \r\n\r\nAhri and Ekko began to open the academy&rsquo;s doors, but before they could make their way out Vi and Caitlyn made their move to stop Jinx; leaving Ekko and Ahri frozen at the door in fear of being caught in the crossfire. Jinx unleashed a wave of bullets from her mini gun so fast it looked as if each bullet had no gap between however Caitlyn and Vi had a less reckless strategy. Vi blocked the rain of bullets with her hands while Caitlyn somehow effortlessly dodged each fast paced bullet while hiding part of her body behind Vi&rsquo;s hands.\r\n\r\nWhile all this action was taking place Ekko and Ahri still stood motionless at the entrance of the academy unable to believe what was happening right in front of them. As Jinx gave up on her mini gun she began shooting rockets at her two apprehenders from Fishbones which to her dismay were still avoided flawlessly. Vi launched herself towards Jinx while Caitlyn stayed back and continued to shoot while Jinx kept shooting back at her. As Vi launched towards Jinx she was trapped by Jinx&rsquo;s Flame Chompers; this caused Caitlyn to drop her gun and run to help her partner only resulting in her being trapped by Jinx as well.\r\n\r\nJinx smirked at the two of them and walked up to them so that she was just out of reach, &ldquo;That hurt,&rdquo; she sneered rubbing her fists under her eyes in a way to indicate crying, &ldquo;my feelings.&rdquo; Jinx added as she walked away cackling. Caitlyn and Vi struggled as Jinx wandered towards her previous position, &ldquo;I feel like I forgot to shoot something.&rdquo; she seemingly asked herself twirling her braids as she pondered.\r\n\r\nThe sudden realisation Jinx had could be seen easily as an excited smirk grew across her face, with this new deviant look she picked up her Super Mega Death Rocket. Jinx had now locked eyes with Ahri cackling hysterically as she lined up her rocket preparing to launch the massive explosive right at her. The rocket began it&rsquo;s journey towards Ahri as Jinx screamed, &ldquo;Catch!&rdquo; still cackling as hysterically as before now to the point where she had dropped to the ground. The sound of Ahri&rsquo;s scream as the rocket impacted it&rsquo;s target was music to Jinx&rsquo;s ears causing her to cackle even harder than she was before. \r\n\r\nAfter some time Jinx heard Ahri&rsquo;s voice which caused her to jump up instantly no longer amused in the slightest, she ran towards Ahri angrily noticing that her ally Ekko was lying motionless on the ground. At this point tears were streaming down Jinx&rsquo;s face as she wrapped her thin arms around Ekko&rsquo;s near lifeless body tears still aggressively streaming down her face. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she choked out between breaths while running her hands over Ekko&rsquo;s cheeks which were now pale. &ldquo;I &ndash; love &ndash; her,&rdquo; Ekko whispered before falling limp in Jinx&rsquo;s arms causing her to wail more than before. \r\n\r\nIn Caitlyn&rsquo;s eyes Jinx&rsquo;s loss was nothing compared to her crimes and this was her one chance to take her to prison. Now that Caitlyn and Vi had both escaped Jinx&rsquo;s traps they ran to apprehend her while she was distracted; the two ran towards Jinx as fast as they could quickly handcuffing her and dragging her from her recently deceased friend. Jinx kicked and screamed trying to make her way back to Ekko, who was now being held by Ahri which only made her more upset. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo; Jinx shouted through her tears as Caitlyn continued to drag her toward the Piltover Prison.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:35:05.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha League Drama XD I love it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kninfer","date":"2016-06-26T11:38:00.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoyed this. :)","replies":[]}]}
