I started just doing little online events, Cybergamer open ladder games and the like, basically getting as much casting in as I possibly could.\r\nSince then we&#039;ve casted the Oceanic Finals at PAX 2014, the North American Promotion Tournament in LA, MSI in Tallahassee and of course the OPL and the LPL from our Sydney studio.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing league since late season 1 (Xin Zhao patch), the casters I look up to most have always been Erik &quot;Doa&quot; Lonnquist and Julian &quot;Pastrytime&quot; Carr, I played competitive Pokemon in my youth and my favourite moment in casting was a community Hexakill match at Armageddon in Auckland where Pastry and I screamed Shockwave in perfect unison as Orianna hit 6 people at once. \r\n\r\n**That&#039;s a brief backstory of my road to the OPL caster desk and some other stuff but if there&#039;s anything else you&#039;d like to know chuck me a question!**\r\n\r\np.s.

Think company's like TSM/CLG/WE/Dignitas, these are brands that took time to build around esports and can now support their players and provide a career-path for them in competitive gaming.\n\nThose are a couple of things but there are a lots of other factors but despite this, I believe we can make it to worlds this year and can really make some waves internationally.

I was worried to begin with because she has a very different style to that of Spawn, Rusty or Papasmithy with whom I had a lot of experience casting with.

I kind of wish she would just say screw Reddit, and open up since I think it would go awesome with your personality as well.
