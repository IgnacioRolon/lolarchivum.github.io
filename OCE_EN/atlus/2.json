Rusty and Atlus**\r\n\r\nHey Summoners, Rusty and Atlus here again for the match of the week, this time for week 5! We want to hear your thoughts on the game below and who you think will win and why, so without further rambling our match of the week is:\r\n\r\n*..Drumroll..*\r\n\r\n**Legacy vs. Direwolves**\r\n\r\nWith both teams sitting at 6-3 on the ladder and the hotly contested 2nd place on the standings up for grabs tonight, will we see a repeat of last split where Direwolves took hold, or can Legacy force their way back into a commanding second place position?\r\nWithout further adieu, let&rsquo;s start with the &lsquo;challengers&rsquo;, Legacy eSports\r\n\r\n**Legacy** - A team who have been around since the OPL&rsquo;s conception, Legacy have never been a slouch to battle, backing their phenomenal arsenal of gifted individual players is a diverse support team and everything you could ever want to be part of a pro league. We&rsquo;ve seen the rise and fall of Legacy over the past two splits, with a commanding year before hand taking out Winter Regionals and representing OCE at the International Wildcards, to falling short of the finals at the hands of Avant Garde. This polarising and very emotionally influenced team play with it all on the line and never hold back, ever.\r\n\r\nTheir rise in the second split of the OPL has been no coincidence with a change in playstyle, seemingly having adapted to the meta, the team works around the control of their jungler &lsquo;Carbon&rsquo; and allows freedom for their carries &ldquo;ChuChuZ&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minkywhale&rdquo; to work their magic. We&rsquo;ll see if they continue this upward trend as they take on one of their bitter rivals, the Direwolves.\r\n\r\n**Direwolves** - A team to take very seriously when competing on the fields of justice, having arguably the best players in the Mid and ADC position, this veteran side know what it means to be aggressive. A team that has been around for seemingly forever, Direwolves were the undoing of Legacy in the last split of the OPL, achieving a 3-1 victory in the semi finals. From there Direwolves had seemingly bounced from strength to strength remaining the amazingly talented and strong team we&rsquo;ve grown to know and love them as. \r\n\r\nLast time we saw these teams clash, Legacy came out on top in a commanding victory, but in overall versus records, Direwolves still take a convincing lead (5-2). This semi final rematch will be the true test for whether Direwolves still possess what it takes to defeat the charging Legacy roster, or if they may have lost their edge.\r\nwith role swaps and roster swaps plaguing the Direwolves, we will see how they perform under pressure and with Legacy seemingly finding their identity again as a team this could be a bitter match to the last second. \r\n\r\nWe&rsquo;ve shared our thoughts on the game, so let us know what you guys think below!","replies":[{"poster":"Squire Pug","date":"2015-06-25T07:07:36.651+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Discipline over Ferocity, Precision over Flashiness.","replies":[]}]}
