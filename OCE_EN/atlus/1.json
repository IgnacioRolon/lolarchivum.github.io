Enjoying worlds? :) Trust me, Cardrid is good. However it was always gonna happen that EGym and Raydere would get most the vote, eliminating any more Chiefs, which meant that Chuchuz and Carbon would get the vote eliminating any more Legacy, producing a lucky top laner :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-28T14:14:03.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally my votes were more based off the second pick i'd want to see in there over the first.\n\nI gathered Raydere, Egym and Carbon would be high picks, so i decided that i would leave those 3 even though they would have been my first picks but the 2 per team rule made me jump off them fairly quickly.\n\nI wanted to see a Swip3rR top lane, and figured he'd probably be under picked due to the ruling (i actually thought that Raydere and Egym would be the main picks for Chiefs.)\n\nAlso picked me some Spookz as a back up for that carbon pick which i knew would be dominant.\n\nI've always kinda liked ChuChuz mid laning so he was the mid laning pick.\n\nAnd picked me some King and Nada in the bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-09-29T04:09:26.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So picking more to make up for less popular players... interesting.
