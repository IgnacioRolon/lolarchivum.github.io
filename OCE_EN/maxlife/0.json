Yeah i know that darius is a juggernauts he should be person endure damage but his kits isnt make him a good tank or a fighter. He easily counter with melee or range\n\nQ = have decent damage, charge for absolutely nothing? is it for people to dodge easily? Heal only if hit champions... useless before u finish charge ur Q u already around 50% even u use ur E + W \nW = No more reduce CD on this ability and reduce MS and less damage... so rito doesn&#039;t want him to do damage? just a meatshield? that no fun...\nE = More slow... did rito forget that MS reduction doesn&#039;t stack? and a pull that really short u need to be in front of the enemy to pull them back. Before you pull them you either have to flash in and  E or run to them hoping they are dumb and not move back or attack u\nR = 5 stacks of passive needed to get max damage... yeah forget getting 5 stacks of passive if u couldn&#039;t do anything auto attack nope cant even get close try using E too short to reach the enemy. Use E+W+Q combo too slow 90% slow for 1 sec does nothing in 1 v 1 or 5 v 5.\"BOO minion are terrified of me BOOO\"... Come on rito this just useless. The good thing is that using 0 mana at lvl 16 and it reset before lvl 16 just dream that your team is good and able to win their lane till late so u can be \"useful\".\n\nThis is just my opinion of him and i would like to see him get a bit of buff in the future so he will be a fun champion to play again. BTW i suck at english so my grammar is very terrible. But i just gotta make this feedback because how horrible he is now","replies":[{"poster":"GavMan","date":"2015-08-21T06:31:07.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree with OP, Darius feels clunky and slow now, really don't like his q windup, it is way to visible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-20T11:04:54.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you all seen new {{item:3083}} so op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-20T10:54:39.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you guys seen the new mord and skarner reworks though?
