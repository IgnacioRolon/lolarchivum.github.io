Will this truly make a large difference to my gameplay or is it not worth the effort learning, as it feels quite unnatural and I was slow when i tried using it.\r\n\r\nIf it is worth it then i&#039;d like to know:\r\n1. The best way to learn smart cast?\r\n2. Should it always be used?\r\n3. Should I use with or without indicators?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-20T22:33:59.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, smart cast is far superior!\n\nI was like you, I had only used normal casting for aaaaages and was resistant to the change, and it does take a while to get used to it, but it is well worth it.\n\nI think what forces the change sometimes are the champions themselves, and what champions you choose to play. For example someone like Fizz isn't going to notice much difference between smart cast and normal cast, he might be ever so slightly faster with smart cast on, but those few nanoseconds lost might only kill you 1 time in a 1000, as Fizz's kit isn't one that requires split-second actions, so it doesn't really make much difference.\n\nOn the other hand, a champ like Azir could well be impossible to play properly on normal cast. Take the Shurima shuffle for example, for that you need to position your mouse, press W, immediately press E, and while he is travelling a distance only a few minions wide, reposition your mouse and press Q just before he reaches the solider. This all happens in a mere fraction of a second. It's incredibly easy to screw up by being too slow or not getting your mouse in the right place at the right time. And if you have normal cast on, you have to add a mouse click in between every action there, which practically doubles the time it would take, and unless your fingers were made of pure lightning I just don't think it'd be possible to do it consistently in a teamfight situation. \n\nAnd thats just one of Azir's moves! Another one, unimaginatively dubbed the 'Redmercy' requires you to do all this as well as _aim his ult_ while dashing, and not only dash one way, but reposition the soldier to where you started from before you hit it, so you are essentially dashing twice in two opposite directions. all in like 0.2 seconds.\n\nSo while you might not be playing champs that require that kind of microsecond finger work, one day you might pick one like Azir up, or riot brings out a new champ that you really want to play, but who needs smart cast. It's best to start early, so when that does happen you can pick them up no problem.\n\nIt feels weird at first, but trust me once you know it, nothing could make you go back!\n\nif you play your champions enough, you come to get very very accurate in knowing the range of their abilities, and so not having an indicator isn't an issue, infact not having an indicator makes you more aware of not only the range of your abilities, but also the ranges of other champion's abilities too.\n\nThere are only 3 abilities in the game that become hard and confusing on smart cast (in my opinion).\n\n{{champion:163}}'s W Seismic shove. \n{{champion:112}}'s E Death Ray\n{{champion:68}}'s R The Equalizer \n\nbecause these abilities are 'select a point and then aim from that point' type abilities, and it involves lots of holding and dragging and is just unpleasant.\n\nHowever when playing these champs, I will still use smart cast.\nTaliyah's W needs to be very fast if you want to use it right, so I personally need smart cast for the speed on her. and with the others, I would rather just grit my teeth and use it how it is, than be constantly switching between normal and smart cast. \n\nI hope that some of this is helpful.\n\n_PS. I don't use smart cast with indicators because I have a tendency to hold the button down, (because we all know that the harder and longer your hold it down, the more powerful the spell becomes!)._","replies":[{"poster":"NehiDude","date":"2017-10-21T02:52:44.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the detailed reply!\n\nThis is actually very clearly laid out and quite insightful, definitely giving me a better idea of the pros for quick casting! How long did it take for you to get to the same comfort level as you were while normal casting?\n\nAlso, do you recommend that I only play normal games, avoiding ranked, for a certain amount of games?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-22T21:15:42.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea definitely avoid ranked for a while. until you're comfortable with your main champs.\n\nIt probably took me a month or so (probably less) to get 100% comfortable.\n\nStuff like lux's Q and R come easy as, other stuff like Vlad's E require a little more thought.\nBut its really no big deal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-21T12:40:00.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick cast with the indicator is basically the thing to go if your used to normal casting, basically holding the button is the same as hitting the button, and releasing it will send out the spell.\n\nThis is close to normal casting, but also gives you the benefit of the speed of quick casting when you get more used to it.\n\nBut as always personal preference is a bigger thing, same with locked screen, sure people can say all they want that people that use locked screen/Normal cast are worse, but there is no real proof, and if it's what your used to, there isn't a huge benefit to changing, especially since it's clear you can climb without it.\n\nAs a note, this is coming from someone that uses quick cast with the indicator","replies":[]}]}
