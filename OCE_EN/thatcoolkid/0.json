However, as of late I can't connect to games anymore if I have an internet failure. In the past when my internet stops working I simply reboot and reconnect to a game in progress, however now I can't reconnect to a game at all after rebooting my internet. It is a error with the client being disconnected because i also get that notification on the client about it being disconnected. The simple way to fix this is to completely exit LoL client and re-open it, which restarts my connection to Rito's servers and then I can reconnect. HOWEVER, by quitting the LoL client even though I have intentions to reconnect to the game, I am immediately giving this ridiculous 5 match low priority queue. Which is just insane because Riot is preventing me from solving my problem by threatening to penalise me by fixing it, so I dont fix it and i just stay disconnected from the game, because once again; I cant connect without Rito's auto-banner punishing me. Just to re-cap this has started happening recently and never used to be a problem of being locked out of the game, so I can only assume some thing has changed on Rito's end. If Rito were able to address this issue or propose a solution to what I see as a bug, that'd be just swell.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nTL:DR ; cant re-connect to game after DC","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-02-28T11:40:10.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low priority queues are not just handed out for 1 or even 2 leaves or afk, it has to be very consistent.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T09:32:06.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, actually two leaves is enough in some cases.

MWA HA HA HA HA!\". This is just the result of their automated systems recognising certain events and applying punishments accordingly.\n\nWhat OS are you on and who's your ISP?","replies":[]}]}
