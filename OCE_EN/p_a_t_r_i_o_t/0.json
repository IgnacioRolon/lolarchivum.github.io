There were multiple planes to choose form with different characters. If i remember correctly they were kind of anime/japanese looking characters.\n\nThe game i remember also had a kind of super move button. I remember one was a big laser thing and another i remember filled the screen with rockets. I live in Australia if that changes anything but i really want to remember this.\n\n\nEdit: If it wasnt clear enough, Im actually talking about an IRL arcade Cabinet. It was a Vertical scrolling arcade game.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2014-12-08T23:01:33.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was it 1942?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-07T14:30:06.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure it wasn't Runescape?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-07T12:46:58.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Youtube - Top 10 MAME Vertical Shmups/Shooters of All-Time! ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twe2uKsWxqE)\n\nMaybe it's in there look for yourself.\n\nEDIT: [Best top Down Shooters ](http://retro-sanctuary.com/Top%20Down%20Run%20N%27%20Guns.html)\nEDIT: [Ikaruga ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y92tLTUgOgs)","replies":[{"poster":"p a t r i o t","date":"2014-12-07T12:50:01.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow thanks.
