I would be salty majority of my games. I had a break for months because I was angry that I got permanently banned but after not playing the game for so long I started to miss it. So I made a new account now and I am enjoying the game again without being toxic to anyone. I know it is probably unlikely for me to get unbanned because I did everything to get the ban, it was deserved. I looked past the warning on the 14 day ban and was like oh well. But I am reformed now and was just hoping that maybe I could get this account back because I have spent nearly $3000 and just want to have all my cosmetics back. \r\n\r\nThankyou for taking your time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2019-01-19T22:43:42.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to see you have changed now and are enjoying the game without being a  ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥, however punishments that weren't given out in error don't get lifted, and considering you got a 14 day ban prior to the perma (and likely the two chat restriction tiers) you were given a fair bit of warning to fix your behavior before you lost your account.  \n\nBan appeals aren't done through the boards so we can't help you here unfortunately. Feel free to send a ticket in to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and request an appeal that way. Please remember that due to the fact it is preseason response times may be slow, and not to send in multiple tickets or keep \"bumping\" yours as it will slow down  your response.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rilye","date":"2019-01-19T07:09:59.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"They don't give a single fk man, my friend got banned for supposedly cheating and they wouldn't say how.\nAnd another for 'toxicity' which i reviewed wasn't even ban worthy + considering the situation. \n\nIt's just like Dunkey said when he was leaving because of this system, it's as poor as America's justice system but the summoners are all minorities lol.","replies":[]}]}
