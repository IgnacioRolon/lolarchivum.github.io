On the internet, the people that dislike something are always the loudest, even if they are the minority, and i suspect its the case with this aswell. Heres to you riot, for making an amazing event, with great new features (albeit temporary) and a featured game mode.\r\n\r\nTl;DR: Love the new Voice over and music, would like an option for it to stay","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-23T12:47:41.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get out of here.","replies":[]}]}
