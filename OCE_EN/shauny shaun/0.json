Most games i will have these people on my team and i just dont know how to prevent it. I try to get Top lane because i function best at top, but sometimes i wont get so lucky and someone else will go top, forcing me to pick another lane/role. thats ok but please dont feed your lane. I cant stress how many people have called top and lost it due to feeding. Every person i meet in these games always go so far into a fight they die, i mean can you stay safe please? unless you know you can absolutely kill them. if your top please just farm and if your getting pushed farm safely dont try to kill them, try to force them out of lane and then get back to farming. And when you tell them advice, they bombard you with a list of insults and derogatory names. theyre so angry and toxic. ill post an example game i had recently: \r\n\r\ni was Udyr jungle, my adc was ezreal and my support was thresh, my best friend whom i know personally was Fizz in mid. now my top ooo my top was Shyvana with Tele and Smite. i mean yeah ive heard of that kind of combo on some people it works, but can you not play it unless you know for certain it works, especially against Cho Gath. oh btw the enemy team is Sejuani jungle, Cho gath top (with flash and teleport) Ahri mid and Cait and Leona bot. I start at golems and all of a sudden shyvana asks me can i take a camp? i said no thx im gunna start golems, then they start pleading with me and saying &quot;ok well ill smite golem then you smite&quot;. meanwhile ezreal is telling me to invade &quot;Gogogogogo&quot; i then say id just like to do what im comfortable with please. after i do golems and red i foolishly begin to head over to blue and ward it then steal it from Sej, ok great i got blue now. abit of farming later i think ok time to gank, i cant gank bot, its warded. Mid is pushed and shyvana is dead. so i decide to farm more\r\n\r\nThen mid game im trying to get my Jungle stacks up but im being pestered to gank over and over again, my Fizz buddy decides to gank top ok cheers mate, but i still cant gank bot now becoz my team members are really hurt and the enemy bot team is pushing it hard as. now here comes the abuse when they die. i am getting pestered to gank and gank over and over again, my question is &quot;How can i gank and get you to stop asking me to gank when i wanna get my jungle stacks and all lanes are warded???&quot; then later in the game everyone was blaming me coz im shit, i was saying i couldnt gank i needed to farm to get money ya know to get better items to gank better??? and they come back with oh wow 9 stacks your really farming you noob, well what do you want me to do, the lane is warded, pushed and you wont stop dying?? cant u just hang back abit and farm safely??\r\n\r\nI then got blamed for everything and it was all my fault, they then proceeded to harass me and verbally abuse me. like why couldnt top just stay safe and quit dying and begging for a gank?? mid didnt die much till late game ya know why?? coz he played safe. also i hate this more than anything in the world, why do ezreals ult every second its up?! why cant you keep it to save it for a crucial moment like stealing drag or baron or killing someone? I cant rely on my teammates because theyre (now i dont mean to be aggressive) stupid?? honastly i dont know how else to put it. And i better not get back as my feedback for me to improve. im doing all i can, im warding, im locking up fed people and CCing them, im not fighting unless its 5v5, i usually win my lane 90% of the time, not saying im perfect but i do lose lane rarely. \r\n\r\nI just wish i had some good team members more of the time so i could maybe have an average win/loss ratio, im not saying i wanna win every game, im saying can i have team mates that are at least half smart? i would be happy if i lost a game but it was due to the enemy team outplaying us. i dont wanna get obliterated and i cant do anything. Also im in Bronze 3 so just be wary that anything can happen in bronze, that means matchups, counters, builds, plays (ive seen some weird stuff in bronze) to top it off i just wanna say why cant you just have a relaxing game and play safe if ur getting pushed or poked. take summoner spells appropiate for the lane and just take it easy, get your CS up and just play safe, dont try to be over creative, just keep it simple. Also i would gladly appreciate positive or helpful feedback, please! anything i can possibly do to avoid this because ive considered just trolling and staying in B5, i dont want to do that and be that kind of person, im almost there though.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-05T00:40:31.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nLooks like you've been having a hard time in Ranked. I would like to jump in and provide some help if you don't mind.\n\nFirst off, Its not cool that they abused you, that was definitely wrong of your team.\n\n> Ok so im playing Ranked abit and ive noticed i keep getting team members that either dont know what theyre doing or are frequently toxic. Most games i will have these people on my team and i just dont know how to prevent it. \n\nYour teammates and your opponents team mates are pulled from the same pool of players. As long as you stay positive and play well theres a 44% chance a bad/toxic player will be on your team and a 56% chance they will be on the enemy team.\n\nCheck out this video from Gbay99 (and others if you're interested), its a great video about the kind of attitude you should have going into ranked. - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\n---\nNow for some gameplay tips!\n\nhttp://freelo.gg/summoner/OCE/Shauny%20Shaun\nThe biggest thing I notice is Creep Score (CS), pros aim for 80 at 10 minutes then an extra 100 every 10 minutes from there.  e.g.\n10 minutes - 80 cs\n20 minutes - 180 cs\n30 minutes - 280 cs\n40 minutes - 380 cs\n\nBy getting more CS you get more gold earlier;\n\n* you can hit power spikes\n* crucial items early \n* you can impact the game earlier and more.\n\nIn your last few games (not jungle or support) your cs has been a bit low (but thats okay you can improve, thats what ranked is for).\nhttp://www.carry.gg/oce/ShaunyShaun\n\n40 minute game as Nasus 228 cs\n39 min game as Cho 166 cs\n51 minute game as nasus 353 cs (you didn't have full build till 48 minutes into the game)\n33 min game as Maokai 90 cs\n53 minute game as nasus 292 cs\n40 minu game as singed 161 cs\n\nAnd another minor thing is try to aim for a KDA ((Kills + Assists/Deaths)) of 4+. If you can consistently make a positive impact on the game like KDA 4+ then you will win more!\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Shauny+Shaun+\nIn your last 20 ranked games your kda has been 2.33","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T15:31:41.864+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-04T18:11:41.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the gigapube-dunning-kruger effect. being aware of and accusing others of having this mindset to push away the fact that they themselves have so many insecurities they wanna hide. having put forth this accusation it is likely nobody can call him out of having this very mindset as it is easily rebutted with \"stahp cahpying me hurrdurr\". well im going to put forth that you have something smaller than an average male otherwise you'd be out using it instead of sitting on your ass behind a keyboard making fun of people who couldnt possibly be certain of your debilitating inferior characteristic","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-08-06T01:01:12.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, at noob level sometimes its harder to get higher cs because noobs love to fight ALL OF THE TIME (whether behind, ahead or whatever). So say you are csing instead, and you don't help your noob teammates who chase a couple of the enemy team into a no-vision area (e.g. jungle), you end up being flamed for it, like Shauny Shaun says.\n\nI understand where he is coming from. A lot of bronze noobs just have no patience. They can't wait for a jungler to stack sated. They want him ganking there NOW, even if he is already on the opposite side of the map ganking another lane. They can't wait to DEFEND when behind, they have to engage all of the time. To them, kills matter more than cs, warding and even objectives. Because of this, their team gets no map pressure and therefore no objectives. Then they blame the jungler for getting no dragons, when in reality it was their deaths that caused the TEAM to get no dragons. The game snowballs out of hand.\n\nThe 56-44 theory is all good in theory, BUT, if you are not playing a carry role at B5 or if you are not playing a snowball champion, or if you are not playing an early game champion, and your team has noobs, there's not a lot you can do. I would advise just mute all abusive people, or people that talk rubbish, and just go about your business. If you are support, then you probably won't be able to carry. Some of these kids have no resolve and no logical skills whatsoever. I can understand when you give them advice or tips, they just flame you because that's their mentality. They don't have patience to fix things in the game. They don't have resolve to stop chasing, warding their lane using their trinket and start defending and buying defensive items instead of the same build every game, or the wrong builds for their lane or team matchups. Some don't even have the balls to continue playing, and give up after 1 or 2 deaths, or blame the jungler for their problems. Sometimes the noob adc even quits because they have no balls when the support takes a kill. They are not team members. They just play the game \"cos their friends play it and its exciting to get kills\". They don't understand that bronze make many mistakes every game, they can't accept that their teammates will do this, and then quit/give up early, because thats what current society teaches them - a lot are either wrapped in cotton wool, or have never faced challenges in their life yet.\n\nIt doesn't matter what advice you give them, some people just dont want advice. You can't change them. Just mute and do your thing. If you have them muted you don't have to listen to them flaming you for split pushing to try and get some map pressure, for example. You just do what you can to get back in the game. If you still lose, at least you did your best and you didn't have to listen to some BS yank \"your mom\" talk.\n\nIf you are a jungler and your top laner is an absolute muppet, don't gank their lane if they are flaming you. Don't tell them this but just focus on the other lanes while keeping them muted. Because even if you get them back into the game, they will screw it up again. You'll need a carry on your team, and it won't be them. Watch some of TheOddOne's games on youtube from last week. He got matched with a noob on his team that lost lane no matter what champion they played. His strategy was to ignore that lane if they were not in a real position for a gank and focus on getting the others ahead. You make the call \"is this really a ganking opportunity or not?\". Don't listen to noobs making shotcalling, they will get you into trouble also. You have to judge things yourself. \"Do I help them chase into the jungle after that Singed, or should I let them go and get back to farming?\".\n\nTry duoing with a silver partner, you'll get slightly better quality games that way. Another thing you can do is play ranked before 3pm on school days, and then normals for the rest of the day. Good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-04T18:15:02.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're at the same rank as you. If they're making so many obvious mistakes and bad plays, you're probably making an equally large amount of mistakes and bad plays that you dont even recognise. You can't control your teammates, you only control you, focus on improving yourself. If you're so sure you're better than the average bronze player at something (e.g. \"winning lane\") you're likely much worse than the average bronze player at something else (map awareness, decision making, playing less prefered roles etc).
