My perfect record of good behaviour &amp; sportsmanship has now been tarnished because of some foul individual who somehow managed to get their hands on my account. Which I still have no clue how, since I&#039;ve never in my life shared my passwords to anyone, the only positive thing about this is that they &quot;helped&quot; get me more influence points &amp; even a rank. But it just wasn&#039;t worth the negativity.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway for me to redemn myself? Or at least, the past actions of someone who got their hands on my account.\r\nThis upsets me very much so, my past friends &amp; individuals I&#039;ve played with can attest that this behaviour isn&#039;t like me at all. I have examples of what they said, I hope you don&#039;t mind the cursive tongue.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nLucifersRage: hi\r\nLucifersRage: you mean u nearly getting me killed\r\nLucifersRage: as u cant
