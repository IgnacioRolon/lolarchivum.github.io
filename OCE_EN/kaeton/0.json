Maybe Riot could add a thing where when you hover over an icon, or when you click it, a box pops up to the side that gives you some information about what the icon is and how it was acquired (and maybe some additional info, like some lore, or why the icon was important at that time). I know we all have a bunch of icons and for me sometimes I don&#039;t remember how or why I received a particular icon or what it even is or represents!\r\n\r\nFor example, I bought the Star Guardian Ahri icon, and maybe a little description could say something basic along the lines of: &quot;Star Guardian Ahri&quot; or something a bit more in depth and specific to the Star Guardian minigame or skin. \r\n\r\nI reckon if Riot added this then perhaps more people would buy icons as it adds a little bit more than just having a small icon next to your in your friends list and if your profile. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you think this is a good idea.","replies":[]}
