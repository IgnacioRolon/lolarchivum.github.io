We entered the Oceanic Open Ladder and in the 2 Bi-Weekly tournaments we entered we only lost games to Sin Gaming and Absolute Gaming. Also on the Cybergaming ladder we go to 8th place. Unfortunately our mid laner damaged his wrist and we had to forfeit all games over the last 2 weeks after having issues with our subs. While I have only played jungle on the teams I have been on in the past, I have been practicing ADC in Solo q to better understand bot lane and would happily move from jungle to support.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss Blzdragon","date":"2015-08-14T13:12:04.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No official requirements, tho if your in solo q as silver you will have extremely hard time playing against diamond/master/challenger players. even myself as a plat solo q player cant match mechanically with the higher level players, i m yet to see a silver/gold that isnt a smurf that can win 9/10 matches v a diamond player, the only way i would really trial a silver or gold is if the match history was clearly phenomenal","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Little Unlucky","date":"2015-08-13T16:33:41.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gl everyone, I would apply, but im a silver player sadly :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"nV Woodee","date":"2015-08-13T10:17:31.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard this team was a really good opportunity to prove myself!
