It is very annoying especially in a clutch situation. Does anyone know why or how this problem occurs? :\\ {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-30T06:20:50.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man!\n\nWe'd have to see the footage to determine weather it's actually bug or not. Chances are it just **looks** like you blocked the auto-attack from your perspective, but in fact you triggered windwall too late.\n\nThis happens because the camera perspective on summoners rift is tilted sideways slightly, so [parallax error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) often occurs.","replies":[]}]}
