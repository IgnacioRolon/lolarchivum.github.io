With that being said I can only think of one punishment pretty much fitting for it. \r\n\r\nThe punishments should be like\r\n\r\nXP% down, no Mastery Tokens if S- or above, Less IP gained for 5 matchmade games.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-04T03:36:19.077+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like someone doesn't get the point of punishments...","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-06-04T12:18:55.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people don't have control over whether or not their internet disconnects, ii is after all Australia.\n\nPlus power outages emergencies etc. I think the time punishment is massively harsh because you are basically waiting for a game for the same amount of time it takes to have a game. If it just so happens to occur when you are in a team and trying to practice. It can take up a good 4-5 hours just trying to finish the matchmade queue timer or your whole team has to put up with it as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-04T13:10:40.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Some people don't have control over whether or not their internet disconnects\n\nNever said anyone has complete control over their internet connection, *however* one of the requirements of the game (as stated in the TOU and EULA) is a (relatively) stable connection. For anyone who meets that requirement, they shouldn't be disconnecting consistently enough to be hit with punishments (certainly not the more severe punishments). For anyone who doesn't meet that requirement, they simply shouldn't be playing (I know it sucks but that's how it is).","replies":[{"poster":"EquiIibriumm","date":"2016-06-04T23:06:04.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a shame really, because my internet really goes haywire in random moments everyday.
