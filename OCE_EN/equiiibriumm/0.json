I know I main and play yasuo and all but I am a fair guy and want to give people a chance so I would like to create a discussion about nerfing yasuo. First off, I should talk about his W. He can block anything with his W just like Braum, However Braum actually takes the damage while Yasuo doesnt. I think that his wind wall should be only able to block abilities for one. Next is his passive. Yasuo&#039;s passive is pretty op although the crit damage is decreased. That decrease can easily be fixed just by using Infinity edge. I think Yasuo&#039;s passive should be nerfed to a certain point where he deals average damage just like all the other bruisers. Crit doubling is pretty op in pre-season 6. For example, stattik shiv, it only had 20% crit chance but now it has been patched and now has been increased to a whopping 30% crit chance. I feel that this is an unbalanced item to Yasuo now that it is practically just 60% alone. So I think Yasuo&#039;s passive should instead of doubling the crit chance but just by adding 25% of the crit chance. Pre balanced huh. Nah probs not. He is still OP either way but this nerf might make other champions to prevail more.

Riot is patching this masteries with the crit stuff and are also nerfing the crits on items so, Yasuo doesnt need nerfing, its the way he interacts with items and masteries","replies":[{"poster":"onguana","date":"2015-11-19T09:05:01.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't we try and balance champions for the current meta rather than change major gameplay aspects?","replies":[{"poster":"Cipse","date":"2015-11-19T10:03:15.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo was made much stronger due to the Warlord's mastery.\nHe was fixed about 6 hours ago, when they took off the healing from critical strikes against anything apart from champions.","replies":[{"poster":"EquiIibriumm","date":"2015-11-19T10:13:41.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, If you think about it.

Please don't mistake this for a succinct rant from a high elo player because its not. What concerns me is my level of play. In my level teams rarely mesh/gel well. People in normals pick champions they want to play and that fine. But what ensues is usually a team comp that isnt good or a team that cant communicate and target properly. And thats fine.. because the other team is usually in simular position. But.. Introduce Yas into the mix and you have a litteral 1 man team (I'll explain a little later on). As of this moment (patch 5.22) Yasuo is completely and utterly unfair in almost all aspects.\n\nLet me explain,\n\nI see it every game. All it takes is an item or a kill advantage and suddenly Yasuo becomes a terror. Now you can blame it on my elo and not being able to deal with Yasuo properly, but I digress. I just got out of a game where my entire team built specifically to counter yas. We built items with grievous wounds to counter the keystone mastery, armour, randuins and ninja tabi and its still wasnt enough. I dont necessarily have an issue with his overall damage, what concerns me is the hilarity that is his kit and how it puts him at such an advantage over all other champions. Let me list it out so you can see how freaking funny this is:\n\n1) He has 5 successive dashes in team fights (and thats assuming there are no minions around). Lets not go into laning phase. (Akali has 3 maybe 4 at best per team fight and Diana can't spam dashes in a row).\n2) Windwall blocks everything. (I played Braum and he essentially nullified my ult in team fights.. and if I waited for him to use windwall first, everyone was dead before I could even use it) .\n3) {{item:3087}} Is broken on him first item (60% crit chance.. WTF RITO). \n4) His shield early game is retarded as it blocks an entire spell for free. (Yes, auto attacking first would be a good idea.. except any good Yas would back off knowing their shield is down and then it becomes impossible to engage on him).\n5) No mana.. Already strong if you want to play passive and farm up for that {{item:3087}} \n6) His Q cooldown is unfair in comparison to all other champions with similar spells. (Eve's is the same but does arguably less damage nor does is double as a form of cc unless you buy {{item:3116}} ).  \n7) Also, windwalls cooldown is too short for the benefit it gives him (in my most.. and obviously, humble opinion). (I compare the cooldown to Diana W; arguably Diana's W is less effective (in terms of its usefulness) yet, has the same cooldown as a wall that blocks all spells and ranged autos) -insert confused Jackie Chan meme here-\n\nTL;DR It is my opinion that his kit is overly bloated allowing him both massive utility and mobility. Together with his high (almost assassin like) damage make him an almost perfect storm for any solo q or normals game.\n\nI'd also like to add that the last game I played the enemy team had a Yas that, in some team fights, never lost health due to the keystone mastery. I literally watched him go from about 20% health to 100% in 2-3 auto attacks after one fight. Now, I don't know about you, but that seems a little bit broken (This was patch 5.22).\n\nA lot of people will disagree with this post.. I understand.. I am a little butt hurt over the excessive Yasuo rape-age at the moment. I have been playing League now for just over 3 years now and I have never felt so strongly towards a champion before. This pre-season is seriously making me consider if I have the right game..\n\nWith that said, I am sure Yas will get a nerf soon.. It's pretty plainly obvious how strong he is at the moment in this current meta.. \n\nAnyway.. Its safe now.. -rant over-\n\n{{summoner:12}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-19T08:35:35.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no the NA QQers have migrated to our boards.

His passive is good because of the bonus crit (I think doubled) and with the reduced damage also makes it stronger.\nBesides, with Randuins omen reducing crit damage and thornmail just completely shutting down Auto Attack based champions.\n\nIn conclusion, Yas is naturally strong, and besides, there is already a lot of counterplay against Yasuo, such as cc lockdowns(any champ really) A black shield on the carry to easily hit Yas whilst he ults, and finally just outplaying the enemy.\n\nRant Over","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2015-11-22T04:42:05.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you finally someone who has knowledge on this haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"EquiIibriumm","date":"2015-11-19T21:04:38.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It only blocks ranged attacks, yes but yasuo can easily kite melee attacks with his Q and while running away so its pretty OP atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-20T05:59:16.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OI NUB, ONLY A GOOD YASUO WON'T FEED.","replies":[{"poster":"EquiIibriumm","date":"2015-11-20T06:15:19.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think you READ what i wrote on my post.
