Unfortunately your leaves affect other people whatever the cause, and Riot can't fix issues occurring on your end.\n\nIf you only bugsplatted once and got a timer, then this isn't the first time you've left a game. You can leave (or dc from) a game quite a few times before you'll ever see a Leaver Buster timer unless you are doing it often, and again, you are affecting other players by doing so.","replies":[]}]}
