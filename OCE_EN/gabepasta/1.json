My name is gabepasta on Ocenia of course and it would be very courteous for someone to do such a thing. Thank you everyone I hope you have an awesome time playing my favourite game league of legends!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-24T06:25:23.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one likes a yasuo player, they come in 2 bunches nothing else, good and carry or they feed hard and lose game for team. And even for every 1 good yasuo there is 1 bad, the way that 1 good carries makes people hate yasuos in general.\n\nSo unless someone with a heart of gold, dipped in honey surrounded by caring mothers comes along its unlikely you will get it.","replies":[{"poster":"gabepasta","date":"2016-10-24T06:54:29.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said I was going to get a skin for yasuo, in fact I don't even play him that much, but I just really want at least 1 skin for my favourite champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-24T10:46:17.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gabepasta,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=T3wzB7Zx,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-10-24T06:54:29.332+0000)\n>\n> I never said I was going to get a skin for yasuo, in fact I don&#x27;t even play him that much, but I just really want at least 1 skin for my favourite champions.\n\n I really want a skin for my favourite champion- yasuo, if someone could gift me\n\nI win.
