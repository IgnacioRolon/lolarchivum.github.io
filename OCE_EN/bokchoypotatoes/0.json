As a riot member you probably know how frustrating this is. Though I have a suggestion to solve this common issue that makes league of legends players upset and causes them to lose lp. For each afk player, the affected team should receive some kind of buff to their team to balance the game. I have been struggling to climb the lp ladder and these ranked games have set me back hugely. If this suggestion is not developed I at least hope it inspires riot to find another way to fix this issue.\r\nAs always your support is appreciated.\r\nBokChoyPotatoes.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-17T03:34:30.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what they need to do is make games NOT start if someone has failed to load and disconnected. i don't understand why they have it so teams are instantly likely to lose from the start.","replies":[{"poster":"Onray","date":"2015-08-19T04:29:38.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Only Heimer,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=QwUZOyBs,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-08-17T03:34:30.452+0000)\n>\n> what they need to do is make games NOT start if someone has failed to load and disconnected. i don't understand why they have it so teams are instantly likely to lose from the start.\n\nThis or get the game client to take priority on the network from other (family) sources (youtube and netflix), so that they lag before the game does.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-17T10:30:55.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Afaik i've heard them working on something like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-16T04:56:48.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem:\n- Is there a point at which it is convenient to intentionally leave and give the buff to your team despite penalties?\n*if yes, system is wrong (induces leaving)*\n- Is there a point at which it is convenient to induce a player to leave the game in order to gain the buff yourself?\n*if yes, system is toxic (induces abuse)*\n\nDiscuss.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-16T10:56:20.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The solution to these problems are:\n\n1 Make IP losses be non-revocable even after reconnecting  and/or stack per disconnect\n\nThis is bad for people who DC by accident and reconnect right after\n\n2 Make IP losses gain over time AFK\n\nI guess this works, but I'm not sure about trolls going AFK at the end of the game and people who accidentally DC and can't join again for a while\n\n3 Make IP losses only apply to people who DC for a certain period of time or till the end\n\nMaybe this can work, I can't think of too many ways for this to fail.\n\nEven with these fixes, a person in normal mode who's particularly stupid/obsessed can make 5 accounts (fifth one is for smurfing), go in a premade, then try to 1v5 people who are in lower skill levels.
