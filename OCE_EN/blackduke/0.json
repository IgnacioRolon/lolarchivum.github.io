As League of Legends accounts make the transition to Riot accounts, these become global rather than regional, and so an update is required.\n\nIf your UN doesn't exist anywhere else, then it will automatically update your RIot account username (which you will still use to login to League) to the same as what you had.\n\n If your UN *does* exist elsewhere, like a PBE or other region account, then you will have to choose a new UN (or update those other region accounts first) to confirm the creation of the RIot account.","replies":[{"poster":"Findu","date":"2019-11-26T12:13:09.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well at least now I know why I can't my original one again, thanks for the info.\n\nNow to track all the accounts I made before oce was a thing....sigh.","replies":[]}]}]}
