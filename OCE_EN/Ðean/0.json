I understand every game is different, but it would give us somewhat of an idea of how strong a keystone is compared to another. Also, it could be used to compare damage of keystones in different phases of the game, i.e. early game, mid game and late game.\r\n\r\nAs I said, it&#039;s probably been talked about because this is present in a few addons for WoW and probably lots of other games. But giving an idea popularity never hurts, and perhaps if more people want this feature, it will be implemented.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t really see how this feature could be negative in anyway.

Like if you click on the enemy you should see their health and the damage under their debuffs. Also just play the game more, you will be able to safely estimate how much damage it does.","replies":[]}]}
