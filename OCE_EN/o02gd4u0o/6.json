My question to Riot was about the hextech skins more specifically Soulstealer Vayne now let me make this clear i have no problem with Hextech Annie i think its worth its rarity, however Soulstealer vayne is not. Now since i&#039;m a vayne main as a lot of us are i really wanted the skin and so with the project augmented chest being worth the money seeing how it gave 2 shards in each box i spent a decent amount of money on it now in that process i ended up receiving 10 gemstones and without thinking i spent it on Soulstealer Vayne. After a couple of games with Soulstealer Vayne i realised there weren&#039;t many particle changes; No new voice changing effects (like for example to make her voice sound a bit like Kalista&#039;s voice &quot;Soulstealer like&#039;), E (Condem) no new effects so still the same, W (Silver Bolts) green is too light and simple (why not a small mist of souls around a bolt and on the third auto a soul sound effect or even just a mist around a bolt) and so the amount of money i spent on this skin is not worth its rarity in comparison to Hextech Annie as hextech Annie has noticeable and awesome particle changes and is just an awesome skin. So, basically my opinion on Soulstealer vayne is that it should of been a 975RP or 1350RP skin not a Hextech skin, often i feel Riot made a mistake with making Soulstealer vayne a Hextech skin as their is a Soulstealer Vladimir skin for 1350RP so what makes Soulstealer vayne so special that Riot has made it a Hextech Skin? In conclusion my question to &#039;Ask Riot&#039; was to make gemstones easier to acquire as the Hextech Skins mainly Soulstealer Vayne aren&#039;t worth the 100s of dollars.
