Now can she Solo carry? If you know how to play her and know what your doing,  yes she can.\n\nNow there is a lot of builds for vayne ill list them all:\n- Bork &gt; Boots &gt; Phantom Dancer &gt; Infinity Edge &gt;  Mercurial Scimitar &gt; Lord Dominiks Regard      (Standard Vayne)\n- GhostBlade &gt; Boots &gt; Phantom Dancer &gt; Infinity Edge &gt; Bloodthirster &gt;  Lord Dominiks Regard   ( Chase Vayne)\n- Shiv &gt; Boots &gt; Infinity Edge &gt; Bloodthirster &gt; PD/ Mecurial Scimitar &gt;  Lord Dominiks Regard       ( 2 Shot Vayne)\n- GhostBlade &gt; Boots &gt; Trinity Force &gt; Bork &gt; PD/Bloodthirster &gt;  Lord Dominiks Regard                                         ( Attack Speed Vayne)\n- Bork &gt; Boots &gt; Phantom Dancer &gt; Infinity Edge &gt; Bloodthirster &gt; Mecurial Scimitar                       (Life steal Vayne)\n\nIm pretty sure ive listed them all, now im gonna show you when to use them:\n\n(Standard Vayne)\nNow the standard vayne build is mainly focused on melting those tanks so if there is a lot of tanks on the enemy team be sure to build the standard build as the Bork, Silver bolts, and Lord Dominiks Regard combine together making you shred those tank with ease. Also the standard build is for sustain for the early game as vayne&#039;s early game is trash so if you are not confident with vayne be sure to rush the Bork for sustain against the enemy adc or support especially if they have a poke comp.\n\n(Chase vayne)\nSo, Chase vayne is pretty self-explanatory is to chase after those champs with alot of mobility for example, Leblanc, Ezreal, Hecarim Tristana, Kassadin, and mainly Kog&#039;Maw... Just kidding you&#039;ll murder that snail. So keep in mind only build this build if you think your passive is not enough to chase after the enemy champs in your game, you know like that fucken Penta.\n\n(2 Shot Vayne)\n2 Shot Vayne build is the best build to murder those hard carries before they touch you like a Leblanc. This build is really good in taking out the enemy adc thats deals a shit ton of damage like for example Jhin even though Vayne counters him he can still deal a shit ton of damage to the team so what you do when in a team fight is you Ult tumble through the enemy team 2 shot his ass his team wont even notice his gone cause by the time they do you&#039; ll be melting them.\n\n(Attack speed Vayne)\nOk the attack speed vayne build is to take out those bullshit champions who build full tank but still deal a shit ton of damage like Tahm kench, Ekko, Volibear, etc. So this build will melt those bullshit champs before they have a chance to turn around back to safety cause remember Silver Bolts dosen&#039;t have a Cooldown but their flash does.\n\n(Life Steal Vayne)\nFinally, The Life Steal Vayne build is the build against those poke comp teams like Nidalee, Sona, Karma, Leblanc, Lux and so on. Now this life steal build will give you 40-50% of your HP back after one tumble auto on a minion and yes you fucken read that properly. Now, how?\nwell first of all you have 40% Life steal and dont forget Bloodthirster&#039;s passive &quot;Your basic attacks can now overheal you.&quot; now &#039;basic attacks&#039; vayne&#039;s Q is a im-powered auto attack so im guessing and i may be wrong vayne has increased healing from that Q. Anyway the Life Steal Vayne build is good for sustain when dueling for example your 1v1ing a Leblanc she Qs then Ws you, you then lose about 50-60%\nof your HP you then Ult + Q auto a minion to get your HP back and 3 Shot her ass. \n\nWell, Fuck thats a lot of Info but I hope that helped guys glhf :)__","replies":[]}
