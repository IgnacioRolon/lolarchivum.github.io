My question to Riot was about the hextech skins more specifically Soulstealer Vayne now let me make this clear i have no problem with Hextech Annie i think its worth its rarity, however Soulstealer vayne is not. Now since i&#039;m a vayne main as a lot of us are i really wanted the skin and so with the project augmented chest being worth the money seeing how it gave 2 shards in each box i spent a decent amount of money on it now in that process i ended up receiving 10 gemstones and without thinking i spent it on Soulstealer Vayne. After a couple of games with Soulstealer Vayne i realised there weren&#039;t many particle changes; No new voice changing effects (like for example to make her voice sound a bit like Kalista&#039;s voice &quot;Soulstealer like&#039;), E (Condem) no new effects so still the same, W (Silver Bolts) green is too light and simple (why not a small mist of souls around a bolt and on the third auto a soul sound effect or even just a mist around a bolt) and so the amount of money i spent on this skin is not worth its rarity in comparison to Hextech Annie as hextech Annie has noticeable and awesome particle changes and is just an awesome skin. So, basically my opinion on Soulstealer vayne is that it should of been a 975RP or 1350RP skin not a Hextech skin, often i feel Riot made a mistake with making Soulstealer vayne a Hextech skin as their is a Soulstealer Vladimir skin for 1350RP so what makes Soulstealer vayne so special that Riot has made it a Hextech Skin? In conclusion my question to &#039;Ask Riot&#039; was to make gemstones easier to acquire as the Hextech Skins mainly Soulstealer Vayne aren&#039;t worth the 100s of dollars. What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-04T07:55:36.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you have some preconceived idea that hextech crafting should be producing quality skins. When in actual fact RIOT has never set a standard for skins only available through hextech crafting.\nOf all the skins it is possible to unlock, hextech annie and soul stealer vayne are the hardest. But they are far far far from being the highest quality skins.\nIf quality was equivalent to how much effort you put into getting the skin, then hextech skins would be better skins than Ultimate ones. But it doesn't work like that.\nPROJECT: Ashe is a better skin than Pulsefire Ezreal, but that doesn't mean the prices should be swapped around.\n\nYou say \"what made soul stealer vayne so special? as there is also a soul stealer vlad.\" Well i ask you, what made Hextech annie so special? There is a Hextech Sion, Anivia and Janna too. \n\nHextech annie is a good skin its true, but its not half as good as PROJECT: Ashe or Yi. and people only spend money on getting it because its rare. If anyone could buy it, it would just be 'another annie skin'. \n\nSomeone had to get the hard to get skin, and it just so happened to be vayne, it could just have easily been Wukong or Bard, and we would have had the equivalent argument of \"why is bard so special. I think the hextech skin should go to someone else.\"  but the roulette wheel just happened to land on vayne.\n\nIts a game of luck, and vayne lost. Its just that simple. \n\nIf I was RIOT i would have made a special line of 'Hextech' skins that were only available through crafting, and taken Janna/Sion/Anivia's skins re-done them and mad them hextech exclusive. \n\nMy guess is that they made so much money from hextech annie. and when all the people who were willing to spend $500+ on a 975 skin, already had Hextech annie, they needed another cow to milk, but didn't have the time to make another 'hextech' skin. so they took a random skin off the production line and made it the new hextech exclusive skin.\n\nMy problem is the theme if the skin, not the quality. The quality of soul stealer vayne is pretty much the same quality of hextech annie.","replies":[{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2016-10-05T02:11:42.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you from \"Someone had to get the hard skin....\" but when you ask me what made hextech annie so special compared to the other hextech skins its pretty obvious for one the particle changes in the abilities. Now when i compared Vlad with Vayne and ask why is vayne so special between the two its because there is nothing extremely special about it as to make it a Hextech Skin. \n\nNow you also stated that PROJECT: Ashe is a better skin than Pulsefire Ezreal now you cant compare those skins with each other as PROJECT: Ashe is such a recent skin so with it being so recent Riot has better ways in making PROJECT: Ashe and all project skins stand out from the rest and so you cant compare a skin as recent as PROJECT: Ashe to a Ultimate skin made 4 years ago. Where Soulstealer Vayne was recently made and is just not worth its rarity.\n\nNow again your comparing Hextech annie to PROJECT: Ashe and Yi. These are completely different themes and obviously one will get more attention than the other i mean your comparing a theme that had its own intro video and web page its always clearly going to win as it had much more hype and focus around it towards its audience, so again you cannot compare these skins with each other their two completely different skins. Now the point you made with the comparison of the hextech skins, now that makes sense as hextech annie was much more valued and you might ask why? because its such a recent skin Riot can make it look so much more appealing than the others. lf you dont believe me take a look at the hextech skins beofre their Splash art rework they dont look like they could be hyped up for, right?\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-05T02:39:45.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you didn't.
