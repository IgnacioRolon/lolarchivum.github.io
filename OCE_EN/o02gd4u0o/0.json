In my opinion i think getting a refund point back every 4 months would be great as we would have 3 refunds a season instead of 3 refunds for eternity. Obviously these refunds wont stack if not used just a maximum of 3 refunds a year would make life easier, i mean its not like your losing money out of this right? the money has already been spent just on the wrong item or figured out another option is better. In conclusion, having the thought in the back of your head that &quot;i can refund this if i don&#039;t like it&quot; ls always better than taking the risk and being stuck with that particular item.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-09-12T10:10:42.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you manage to accidentally buy something i gotta say you're pretty goddamn retarded. there's a difference between regretting a purchase, and accidentally purchasing something. you should think hard about whether you want to buy something or not. you should also think carefully about what to spend your refunds on, and to not waste them. you don't deserve any more, you're lucky you get any in the first place tbh.\nor even better, don't spend money on league. that's honestly your best option. basically don't be retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2016-09-13T06:39:22.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My argument isn't sorely focused on the fact that people 'accidentally' buy stuff but about the fact that refunds are so limited to summoners. For example QAPLA is a late season 2 player he states his used 1 refund on the fact that he bought a skin for a champ he realised he did not enjoy and wasn't good at, that right there is one reason a refund is useful. Another reason? buying a expensive skin just released but a couple of weeks/months later it goes on sale for lets say 50% right there is another reason refund as u can refund the skin purchase it again while on sale and probably have enough for another cheap skin for example 520RP or 750RP and you maybe thinking \"but then were purchasing 2 skins one being the same with one refund and so riot well see it as a loss of benefits' right\" heres the answer riot will not lose benefits for 2 reasons. The first reason being the money is already spent, riot has already made the money, its not a full refund its a refund for credit which CHOBI followed up on understanding my argument. The second is the fact that summoners hardly ever spend their money on cheap skins worth 520RP or 750RP as there are no particle changes implemented into those skins and so aren't really worth the money being spend thats just my observation through my experience in LoL","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-13T06:50:20.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=o02GD4U0o,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Eo8eiuxQ,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-09-13T06:39:22.830+0000)\n>\n> My argument isn&#x27;t sorely focused on the fact that people &#x27;accidentally&#x27; buy stuff but about the fact that refunds are so limited to summoners.

And that 1 refund I used, was within the last year.\n\nI really don't see an issue with extra refunds, but they should be earned, not given.\nPerhaps, you could buy refunds, at an equivalent IP cost as name change, or something.\nThey shouldn't be cheap, 13k IP for a refund or something. Otherwise, just buy what you want as well as, not instead of.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-13T03:45:04.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be like that. If he accidentally bought something that he didn't mean to which I gotta admit is ridiculously impossible but say  if your sibling or any other people bought a rune page or something that you didn't then a refund would be available to take care of that problem and use the Rp on something else. He does have a good point about the RP not going anywhere, once us summoners buy RP, the money they receive would be in their bank account and getting refund on items to get back the Rp would not affect Riot company as they receive more in benefit.\nAnd just on the side, no-one here including you (other than riot) are able say who don't deserve what.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-13T05:48:05.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my second account, had it since late season 2.
