So I couldn't dodge because i was in promos so there was no reason to as i would of got a loss regardless, anyway so i was adc with a vi support and because we were at such a disadvantage our lane got camped by their Jungler and mid laner so i got tilted and started flaming the Vi as she was to stubborn to play an actual support and also our jungler who was to stubborn to give up his lane. After all that, because i flamed both the Jungler and Vi support i got Chat banned for 10 games, which i didn't mind cause yes i was toxic as i was so frustrated from the game but then Riot decides a Chat ban is not enough so they demote me to honor level 1...\n\nI mean i understand the chat ban but demoting me to honor level 1 from just one ban when i had a Vi support like really?... after countless of honors i got in the past from the beginning of the new honor system basically didn't count shit, as if i was toxic just for one game those 100s of games played with a positive attitude don't count for shit...really Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-02T08:43:14.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't flame. Scream at your screen if you must vent frustration, or at least don't be a dickbag when you're typing to let others know if you're angry.

Fact is, Honour is based on attitude and behaviour, so why shouldn't you lose progress and be demoted when you do the wrong thing? Saying that \"being demoted in Honour when you flame others isn't fair\" would be like saying \"it's not fair that you get demoted in Ranked when you consistently lose, and do badly in, games\". It makes no sense to the purpose of the system.\n\nIf you want to keep all the progress you've made in Honour, don't be a jerk. There are plenty of things you can try to keep your negative attitude from showing in-game, such as Sekai's suggestion of yelling at your monitor, or maybe you just need some kind of hobby to vent that anger/frustration into (like some kind of martial arts, perhaps). Fact is, your behaviour is on you, and it's up to you to change it before you lose access to the account entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2017-08-02T11:05:51.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not saying i shouldn't be punished, yes i should be punished by but a whole rank that is not fair. Also, you did not have a reasonable comparison when you stated \"it's not fair that you get demoted in Ranked when you consistently lose\" that example does not compare to what happened to me as if you want to compare it to Ranked, an example would be \"demoting from Gold 3 to Gold 4 from one bad game\" see that makes sense as thats what happened to me as i was not consistently being banned in order for me to demote, if i was i wouldn't be complaining and this post wouldn't exist. Its the fact i demoted off of one ban, a loss in progress with a warning telling me i'm close to demotion would've been awesome but it wasn't its the fact that no matter how many games i did well in, in honor level 2, a single bad game will result in a full rank demotion.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-02T12:51:13.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, it's my understanding that a 10 game Chat Restriction wont occur unless you *consistently* show negative behaviour *or* show such *severe* negative behaviour that you end up skipping a tier of punishment. Point being, a *single* \"bad game\" will only give you a punishment if you're extremely toxic, otherwise it's from several games and considering previous punishments. Either way, I stand by both my opinion (it seems to be a fair system) and my analogy (I did specify consistently doing badly in-game with that, mind you).\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, this could all have been avoided if you stopped and evaluated your own behaviour before receiving any punishments, or when you got the 5 game Chat Restriction (assuming you didn't skip a punishment tier). That doesn't make the system unfair, it just means you need to re-evaluate what you are doing to trigger this response from Riot and their systems and make changes so you're not contributing to the toxic community that already exists in-game (at least not anymore).","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-08-05T11:51:55.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he has apoint but i rely think the honor rank is a bit stupid","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-02T09:40:59.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=o02GD4U0o,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=RqzdPun6,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-08-02T09:24:45.307+0000)\n>\n> I already established the fact that i was toxic and the Chat ban was just but the fact that i got demoted to Honor level 1 on my first ban in the new honor system is not fair.
