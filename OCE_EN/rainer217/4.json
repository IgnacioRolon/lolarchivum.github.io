They won the game and I thought that my account can&#039;t get low priority. As I log in it came up as that I am in low priority that I left the game (which I understand) but the thing is that my team won and I have to be punished for that? This kinda gets my frustrated but I just want to ask to a riot employee is that do we have to get banned even though our team still won?\r\n\r\nCheers Rainer","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T08:11:19.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A leave is still a leave. If they allowed something like this then consistent leavers will have less to fear, as they can say, \"it's the team's fault for not winning, I don't deserve this punishment.\"\n\nYou should not play a game if you aren't 100% sure that you have at least one hour spare.","replies":[]}]}
