Usually when im not in game the client take up around 500mb of ram and when it&#039;s in game it tends to go up 600-700mb of ram (for some reason). Just wondering why this is happening to mac (not sure if it happens to windows users) but it does consume a bit of ram. \r\n\r\nMac details\r\nMac Book Pro 13-inch mid 2012 \r\nProcessor: 2.5GHz Inter Core i5\r\nMemory: 4GB 1600 MHz DDR3\r\nGraphics: Intel HD Graphics 4000 512mb \r\nSoftware: OS X 10.8.5 \r\n\r\nIf it&#039;s all good if riot does change something to this that would be great \r\n(will update post with activity monitor and ram usage)","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-06-20T02:19:41.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u have like 256mb ram? lol?","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-20T02:41:12.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"read, bro.

Also, it runs in the background during games. Always. Not much you can do except, if you find that being a problem, upgrading the RAM.\nI did it recently on my MBP and it sure helped. But then again i hadn't done maintenance or upgrades in 5 years, so it was kinda time.\n\nDo you use MemoryMonitor or something else by any chance?","replies":[{"poster":"rainer217","date":"2015-06-20T02:00:17.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I use memory clean as a application to clean my ram and it sure does work but then it just doesn't clean all of it since it all comes back as inactive ram when i have LoL client open. I've had my mac for 3 years and i've had minor problems with battery and stuff. (recently had a problem with my Hard drive to motherboard cable but league still runs fine after that). But since im in year 9 and in year 10 end of term 1 we have a option to own these macs for our own and receive another for school. Ive been thinking about upgrading the ram to 8Gb when I receive it as my own laptop. But anyhow I do receive 60fps on mac version and on my boot camp windows i receive 120fps.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-06-19T22:57:55.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here comes the mac hate comments {{champion:82}}","replies":[{"poster":"rainer217","date":"2015-06-20T01:25:38.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahah its not hate just love","replies":[]}]}]}
