In that case her 3rd auto attack is less threatening to other laners while not hurting her too drastically in the midlane with an AP build.\r\nThe bonus movespeed from 3rd AA can be threatning with the ability to follow it up with a few more hits, so it should be toned down from 20/25/30/35/40 to 15/20/25/30/35, in that scenario you're getting one less auto attack if you try to chase and harass. \r\n\r\nTangle-Barbs allows self peel, so the root should be lowered by .2 seconds per level, just to give her less self peeling against enemies.\r\n\r\nPop Blossom is fine, but I don't think she should be allowed to attack enemies while casting it.\r\n\r\nI feel like all these numbers will show her that she can still be viable botlane, but without being really powerful while doing it.\r\nI don't feel like much of you will agree with these numbers, so I'd like to hear what you have in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-12T02:14:28.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's fine.\n\nLet's talk about Morgana having a 40s snare.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-03-10T05:41:45.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or alternatively, you could just remove any ad scaling and reduce root time, completely gutting her so no-one has to deal with her again\n\n(AP Mid Neeko main btw, and i 100% want her out of the game, she's a piece of shit who's way overtuned)","replies":[{"poster":"Neëko","date":"2019-03-10T07:30:14.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yah Neeko main too, obviously haha.\n\nI like both builds, and I'd like to see AD Neeko in the future.","replies":[]}]}]}
