Another one.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently levelling a pre-30 account for Season 9, and I remembered why I cannot stand it.\r\nThe first 10 levels. Are. Hell. I know many people have given up before getting to level 10, due to one thing. The botting rampancy.\r\n\r\nWhen I was levelling this account, about 7/10 games in every blind pick game I play there is usually ALWAYS 1 to 2 bots.\r\nThis is an extremely unhealthy measure for blind pick, and I wouldn&#039;t so have a problem with it if Riot weeded the bots. But I never see the Instant Feedback message show up on my screen. It&#039;s maddening.\r\n\r\nIn saying that, Draft Pick has a big part in all this. \r\nThe fact that Draft is only available somewhat 14-15 hours a day is annoying because almost all, if not all servers have it up 24/7.\r\n\r\nWhy not Oceania? Sure, we have a smaller player base and that&#039;s completely understandable, but I feel like having Draft Pick on 24/7 has more incentive for people to continue playing and not give up so soon. Some of us might wake up and have a game before work/school. \r\n\r\nWhy this works out so much is because:\r\na) Blind pick has a higher rate of teammates flaming one another due to not getting the role they want, where they can queue it in draft.\r\nb) The bots that are going to remain unbanned (what I could guess is to inflate player count, don&#039;t take my word for it) remain in blind pick while all the early morning pre-30&#039;s get to go over to draft pick to play in a better game environment.\r\n\r\nI, along with majority of pre-30&#039;s who play early shouldn&#039;t have to deal with the bots, or people refusing to jungle, or people instalocking champs and calling a role they don&#039;t even know the name of, all because Riot won&#039;t give us Draft early morning.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-05T03:41:52.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots are banned in waves, not in the same way that negative behaviour is punished, so the popup won't ever appear for bot bans. That doesn't mean they aren't being punished though.\n\nGehirn also personally bans a lot of bots on OCE as I understand, and there was a cool [/dev post](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2018/10/dev-removing-cheaters-from-lol/) about Riot's approach to controlling bots going forward.\n\nOCE doesn't have draft pick up all the time because it can't support it. Our population just isn't big enough to, and if we tried queue health would decline rapidly and significantly, which results in horribly mismatched games with long queue times. We can't make draft the permanent mode and blind the limited time because not everyone can play draft.\n\nBots don't inflate player count. In fact they have quite the opposite effect. Bots have a negative impact on player retention, so naturally Riot wants to limit their impact as much as possible. They don't remain unbanned for long, but they are banned in waves instead of individually for a few reasons. The struggle is how easy new accounts are to create. Making account creation harder would hinder (though not stop botters), but it would also reduce accessibility for new players.\n\nOne key reason is to obfuscate exactly what the system is detecting, which helps in the long term to keep catching the trickier bots. The vast majority of bots are banned before level 30. The sooner they are banned the less profitable they are for botters, so again this is a key goal. The dev post outlines what the current plans are moving forward to limit the impact bots have on players between creation and removal.","replies":[]}]}
