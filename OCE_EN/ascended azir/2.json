However, i would still like to play against some teams for fun /practice.\r\n\r\nAdd me on league if you and your team would like to play some custom 5v5s. We were a tier 3 team so ideally would like to vs the same tier.\r\n\r\nWe would play at the same time as clash would have, at 930pm which will follow with a short scouting period then game start.\r\n\r\nI hope to see you on the rift!","replies":[]}
