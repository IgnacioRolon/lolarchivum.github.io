Darius next imo needs his passive ad boost lowered or removed i say this due to the fact is u build a damage and trinforce build on him when his passive goes off he has about 650-750 ad depending on build with the one i tested i had 683 u combine this with his w and a trin proc and u will insta kill basicly any adc in the game. it seems like riot does not care for the fact this game is dying and is due to ppl hating the fact that riot cant balance a glass of fken water if they had to they talk about balance but never take opinions from ppl or from the actual top playing pros i think riot as basicly become Aeria Games Jr and has just become about milking money from players and then giving them the finger and on top of all this giving fiora hp% true damage every 3-5 seconds? wtf how did u think this way balanced in anyway or even building an ad mord? yea he squishy but get some atk speed and he gets all 3 q off faster then u can say wat and ur dead his final q is like 400% ad scaling ( totally balanced)  thats all ima say let the raging in this post commence","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-25T08:21:34.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well 100% pick or ban rate at Worlds speaks for itself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lyqx","date":"2015-10-27T21:43:36.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes time to set up barrels and in most cases you need 2-3 barrels to hit once.","replies":[{"poster":"GD FynoL","date":"2015-10-28T13:39:56.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u did not just really say it needs time to set them up did u? he can drop barrels almost every second and in a teamfight ppl arnt looking for barrels are they not to mention there is a bug where he blows it when its at 3 ticks","replies":[{"poster":"Lyqx","date":"2015-10-29T04:10:00.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so barrel has 1 sec delay and you need to wait 1 sec before you can trigger, and normally you need one more to reach enemy. that would be 3 seconds?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-27T21:55:01.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who the fuck said GP isn't broken","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-10-25T05:09:59.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"His barrels are 70% of my HP when I play Vayne.\n\nCancer champion, GP is Vi 2.0, no counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"GD FynoL","date":"2015-10-25T05:11:30.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"exactly i play mundo top alot and ill usually build tanky with hp for e and to basicly go ham in teamfight but 2-3 barrels in the fight and im dead not to mention he can have so many fken down and just insta destroy u in a teamfight","replies":[]}]}]}
