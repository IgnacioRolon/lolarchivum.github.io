There are [so many reasons that people dodge](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/3bgid8/queue_dodging_when_is_it_worth_it/), and a lot of them are legit. Even I dodge at least once a day so that I only lose 3 LP instead of 17. If they repeatedly dodge queues, the time [stacks up quite quickly](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging). It's pretty generous of Riot to allow us 1 \"get out of jail free\" card in the form of a dodge, so stop complaining about people using theirs. I'm sure you've probably done it a couple of times as well.
