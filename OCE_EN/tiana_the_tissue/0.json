It happened when yesterday, me and a friend started a classic game and as soon as we got into champion select, the 3 other players insta locked champions from the rotation almost immediately (i believe the champions were {{champion:164}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:119}}). They all had {{summoner:6}} and {{summoner:7}} and all had similar names. Due to the this, we dodged.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has happened again today numerous times. I want to know if this is a bug or if its going to be permanent (like the bots being in aram games if no players are available).\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"DIV1D3","date":"2017-01-03T02:52:05.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't the bots like in your regular Co-Op vs AI match, they are instead  what I like to call 'Feeder Bots'. People set up these accounts with the intention of getting them to Level 30 without any work from themselves, and either go into Ranked and get a certain Rank to sell the account, or just sell the account at Level 30. That's just my guess as I don't see any other reason for them to exist. \nThey generally stick to Bot matches where they aren't very disruptive, but some nefarious individuals let them loose into PVP matches. \n\nIf you notice a 'player' buying just one particular item and continuously dying, then they may just be a bad player, however if you look at their movement and actions it should be easy to differentiate between a **real** player and a **bot** player. A very good way to spot them out is to see if they **only** Auto-Attack, using abilities seems to be beyond what some people want to include in their bots. \n\nObviously if you spot one, just report it and hope that you don't get queue with more int he future.","replies":[]}]}
