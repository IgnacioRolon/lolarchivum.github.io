You can troll, feed and ragequit a trillion games in a row and receive no punishment but as soon as you use \"hate speech\" or other \"no tolerance language\" you are looking at a banned account. I think this is disgusting as this just encourages people to ruin this game but be justified as long as they don't use dirty words.\r\n\r\nI think the opposite should occur, you should say anything you want but purposefully throwing games gets your permabanned. This will dramatically improve the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-12-25T14:19:04.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As long as you're not racist or aggressive, as long as you don't run it down, as long as you don't hard troll and keep it soft-trolling, you can throw the game.\n\nI literally inted 19 games in a row by doing the same crap and was not punished. Yet if I swore even once, gone.\n\nPeople who verbally abusive are doing it wrong. The best thing is that soft-inting makes people flame you, which means you can report them. You can literally bait them into getting banned and riot pats you on the back for it. Oh, I just walled my 11/0 ADC into 5 enemies and she died and handed their carry 1k gold. Damn , spend 2 mins apologising in team chat, claiming it was lag and you weren't thinking right. Do it again later, but still make some plays. Going 0/14 is hard-inting. Going 5/0 and killing your team puts you in the clear as riots system cant see that you're killing your team.","replies":[]}]}
