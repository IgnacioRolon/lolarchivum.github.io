Make sure your Runes and Masteries are efficient! Don't shoot yourself in the foot by not having the optimal stats!\n\nYour Current Volibear Page:\nHP - Marks/Quints\nArmor - Seals\nMR - Glyphs\n\nEfficient Volibear Page\nAS - Marks/Quints\nArmor - Seals\nScaling MR - Glyphs\n\nThe HP is understandable to synergize in with Voli's Kit. However it's very easy for you to just build it into his Item Path. Attackspeed however works with his ultimate and stacking his W. Try running Attackspeed Marks and Quints with this page instead. This also helps your general clear speed and overall Damage Per Second a lot more. As a jungler you can go for scaling Magic Resist on Volibear. Not many mages can burst through your passive early which allows you some time to ramp up the scaling aspect.\n\nFor Masteries you typically should not run Grasp of the Undying in the jungle. You generally won't find much use of it in the game as your ganks will typically be over in less than 4seconds before it procs. Try going for the Strength of Ages Keystone. It will give you 300Bonus HP to synergize with your W and passive. Far more effective at giving you a good powerspike throughout the game.\n\nYour ward count is very low and you don't swap to red trinket. In the jungle you don't always have to take the oracle lens, but its super effective at giving your team information as to what objectives can be taken sneakily. Regardless of swapping to this, place more wards! You have at least 18-20 that you can lay within a game from trinket alone. Be sure to lay them (and not just anywhere, put some thought into it! Deep vision by camps is great for tracking movement!). \n\nJust upping your vision control (and number of pink wards), pushing vision deeper will allow your whole team to snowball from information alone. (Not getting caught, sneaking a dragon etc). Sorry I don't have time for spectating right now, but a couple of very important tips to remember should help!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-21T11:45:04.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cough... *****gets ward count up by placing sightstone in base*****","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maccasfr33wifi","date":"2016-03-21T09:22:50.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well thank you so much for the time and effort for that and I will be sure to change the runes around and masteries.
