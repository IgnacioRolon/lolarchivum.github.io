A lot can be told from just the stats in the post game lobby and is a good way for me to breakdown some basics for you to change. So until you've got some games I can see there I won't be too much help!\n\nI am good friends with an avid Yasuo main who is very skilled on the champion. He's not one for ranked over the last couple years, but he knows this champ better than anyone I know! [Some of his stats can be found here (~70% win S4/S6 Yasuo) ](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/225465#ranked-stats). He's played him almost exclusively for a long time, although I'm not sure on his availability to watch matches. However I bet he can give you some great tips/feedback! If you add \"Sere\" and tell him Crunch sent you he should be able to help!","replies":[{"poster":"Maccasfr33wifi","date":"2016-04-13T07:04:49.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright sorry have been busy for the last days and it's hard getting mid cause my computer isn't good but I will add him thanks heaps","replies":[]}]}]}
