I click the LoL launcher and everything is mucked up. the photo's aren't correct on the screen. I am not able to agree to the terms or click launch as its not on my screen.\r\nI've removed it and re installed it multiple times.\r\nAny fixes please?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2014-12-07T23:41:23.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThere is a known issue where non-default DPI settings will cause the patcher to display incorrectly and in some cases, prevent you from launching the game client, because the Accept button for the Terms of Use will be off screen. This is something that we're currently working on resolving.\n\nIn the meantime, you can work around this issue by resetting your DPI settings back to 100%. You can do so by following the steps below:\n\nGo to Control Panel\nGo to Appearance and Personalization\nGo to Display\nChoose the 100% (default) option\nClick on Apply\nRe-launch League of Legends\nAlternatively, you can use the Windows Key and Search \"Personalization\" (without the quotes) and continue from Step 3 onwards.\n\nBest Regards,\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-07T23:45:54.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also on this note - you'll be able to swap it back to the same settings after you've made this change. You'll just need to make these changes again if there is another patch.\n\nWhich I personally would suggest unless you enjoy everything being massive on your screen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Harry Potter Mid","date":"2014-12-07T23:52:01.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate the help. \nThank you!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-07T12:20:35.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I currently have a rather similar situation.\n\nWhen I open the launcher, the pics are all black, with only Launch is visible at the top, is that the same as yours?\n\nFor me, I just wait for a few secs, the pictures will come back. And I can Launch and proceed my normal business as usual.\n\nI have noticed if you click Launch before the pictures come back everything will fk up bad but it seems at least in my case, have an easy fix, just wait for a bit.","replies":[]}]}
