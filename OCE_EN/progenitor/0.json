I am open to new strategies etc and enjoy them when they pay off, learn when they don&#039;t but i wont join a game that has someone destroying any hope of victory for 35+ mins because they wont surrender and drag on games i would rather wait the timer, but i don&#039;t also like being punished when for some reason you end up in queue with the same person or another toxic player.","replies":[{"poster":"What The Thresh","date":"2016-08-24T11:51:49.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That amazing feeling when you get back to back lobbies that need to be dodged (I do not say \"need\" lightly, I'm talking fresh lvl 30 in their first ranked picking AP Diana with smite for an ADC, followed by a raging Tyler1 wannabe trying to play Draven jg with no smite) Only to have my attempts at clinging onto my precious LP shredded by a -3 and -15 LP punishment, as well as a total of 20 mins ban. Even leaving the queue till the final seconds of pre game because god forbid the troll or anyone else take that LP loss...

It was a ranked game, and I was second pick zed. About a minute into champ select, One of my teammates recognised someone else in my team, and asked if it was the person in their last game. But no, it wasn't just a simple question like that. It started with simple, then went to \"oh, that shitty thresh, please don't play that again!\", and that person would reply with something toxic. I was so happy when the person who first asked the question said he would dodge, and did, because I knew this game was a loss of he didn't.\n\nI was close to dodging myself, but was in promos and didn't want to risk it...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-12-09T21:27:33.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See ive been saying this for ages why should players be punished because of others actions...\nBut in all seriousness this will never be done.....\nThey have time even banning players for repeated violations like feeding so this would never get in..","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-09T20:19:10.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're releasing the new champ select in the next patch, but unfortunately thats not until next year","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-09T12:53:12.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There needs to be a way to report players at any time, not just in the after game.
