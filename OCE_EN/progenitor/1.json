I came here because the ping is better for I am Australian and thought this would mean a better overall gaming experience. All I have experienced so far is a community that is riddled with hate and trolls, they are not having fun unless they are making sure somebody else isnt.\r\n\r\nI play a lot of ARAM, a lot.  The trolling is so bad it takes 4-5 games before you can actually have a serious game, I am returning to league after a break because lag was getting to be an issue and OCE won me over, but the issue of \"Toxic\" players is appalling, I was refreshing my skills in ARAM to eventually go back to summoners/ ranked on my ranked account.\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists I may move back to NA when NBN is rolled out in my area, this is a sad moment for me because I am not proud to call myself an Australian in league we are the worst of any server when it comes to behavior.\r\n\r\nThe last game I played we had an Ashe, who in champ select said they were building AP Ashe... this is impossible the only thing this does is buff her long cooldown ultimate, we were relying on ashes poke (volley) to even survive in lane and she didn't use it just sat back and last hit super low champions with ultimate. To make matters worse because I was upset about the decision to build AP, I was supposedly the one who was \"toxic\" being able to troll others then sit back and call them toxic for being upset that you have to spend 20-25 mins in a game you can not win.\r\n\r\nMost of my friends tell me when you get to ranked its just as bad, with afkers feeders leaver almost every game, and the common retort to ill report you is \"there is no tribunal\" or laughing and mocking almost every game there is someone saying \"you mad\" and other troll lingo or on drugs or afking.\r\n\r\nI like playing league of legends, but this problem is way out of hand and needs some serious behavior modification done and as fast as possible, i myself am almost tempted to stop playing until this issue is resolved or move back to playing high ping games vs Americans. At least vs Americans I only have the odd report 1 in 10 games because someone is being ridiculous, here in OCE its 1 in 5 games I don't report someone, I am not stupid there is a large difference.\r\n\r\n**Some Ideas**\r\n\r\nPlayers need to be warned when they are being bad we need to implement a Behavior colour/Hue system when you are behaving well its green or clear, when your behaving badly it changes closer to red or dark. matchmaking should take into account your behavior using this, so players that troll end up with only other trollers, and good players can see that they are good players based on their colour or modify their behavior to do so.\r\n\r\nAt certain behavior thresholds warnings are given etc to improve your behavior or risk bans, but in the end you could keep their accounts open and allow trolls to troll each other and still be able to play and pay money supporting the game but not harming individuals who want to play proper games.\r\nIf someone decides to redeem themselves and play properly they should be given the opportunity to do so, playing more games without receiving reports or even getting commends should clear your hue. and push you back to games with players that behave well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless something drastic like this takes place you are gonna have decent people corrupted and made into angry players because being taunted etc makes people mad, its not that they are trying their best its that they are deliberately trying to get a rise out of people which ends up with decent people getting mad or deciding not to play because they don't like how the current community in OCE effects them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease everyone who was trolled recently leave a comment describing the most recent person you reported for trolling **NO NAMES PLEASE**\r\nJust so people can see, and riot can read and identify with us how they are annoying us and modifying our behavior due to this we cant stay saints forever we get mad too.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-20T23:45:24.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"ARAM is trash and isn't meant to be taken seriously? Who honestly cares if Ashe wants to go AP in a joke game mode? If you want serious gameplay, go and actually play ranked. Get off your high-horse and let the people who want to muck around in ARAM do so. Not everyone takes every game mode seriously and sometimes you just want to stuff around after playing ranked for hours to blow off some steam.","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-20T23:58:07.069+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I see where you're coming from, just because it's intended to be a fun mode doesn't mean people won't get annoyed at things.  It'd be like someone asking you to play Tic Tac Toe and randomly changing the rules; sure, it's just Tic Tac Toe and doesn't matter, but it's annoying when you can't just play it like it's meant to be played.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-21T00:25:43.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What rules? There aren't any rules in ARAM apart from push mid and take the Nexus. In fact, taking the Nexus is really the only 'rule' per-se. Obviously there are reportable offences like intentionally feeding and toxic behaviour but if someone's trying a different build, AP Ashe for example, in ARAM and genuinely trying to win, who are you to get angry and tell them they are wrong? There's no need to try-hard in ARAM when it's just a mode to blow off steam. I understand some people take it seriously but the vast majority of the community won't when ranked is there for competitive games.","replies":[{"poster":"Progenitor","date":"2015-03-21T11:59:19.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to blow off steam after a bunch of ranked games make a \"5 man premade\" and play with people who intend to lose building strangely on purpose do not get people who want to have a serious game involved, you may not find it to be a serious mode but a lot of people want to have serious games of it but instead are involved with players who want to mess about. \n\nYou also make the mistake of thinking \"This is his only example of toxic behavior\" I assure you it isn't its just the most recent, there have been dozens of examples in the last week alone.\n\nI enjoy aram because it forces you to deal with situations and champion match ups to make the best of a situation you have been handed, and if you take it seriously you can improve your skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-26T01:10:58.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I'm all for having a ranked version of aram, so you guys who take aram seriously have somewhere to play. I feel alot of you 'professional aramers' are just too pretentious and I don't appreciate that you are forcing your mindset on other people.\n\n If I want to go ap sion, that's not really your business and like you said. If you want to take aram seriously find a group of serious aramers and make a 5man premade because tbh aram has a much smaller community than summoners rift and thus people doing silly builds just comes with the turf. \n\nYou have to accept that aram is not a place most people consider a serious game mode and you're the odd one out. If the bulk of the community decides to play silly builds like ap sion or titanic hydra singed or tank kennen and accepts that, then that becomes the norm, and if you want to take it seriously, that's your prerogative but we don't have to behave to your accord.\n\nIt's sad and it feels unfair but that's the rule of the herd.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ThanatosX","date":"2015-03-20T17:12:23.086+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mostly get people trying to drag out ARAM matches these days. Derping around the nexus when you can't even surrender because you lost hard from RNG or no connections. Not against the rules, bad sportsmanship just the same.

I dunno when I play aram and I get say sion for instance, I want to go ap. I know it's bad but it's alot of fun. ARAM is kinda casual to start with since you can't really main a champion and you probably won't have the optimum runes and masteries half the time, you can't strategically back unless you get executes and the format let's you play a number of stupid builds without getting wrecked in lane. Also teamwork isn't as hard to pull off in aram as you make it sound since positioning wise, it's alot simpler.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-26T01:16:19.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ndUtWzEX,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-10-26T01:00:55.060+0000)\n>\n> ranked\n\nBro look how old the thread is lol","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-10-26T03:52:36.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sad to say that OCE is by far the most toxic server I have ever been in.
