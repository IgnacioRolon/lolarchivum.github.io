I was unaware of the changes that were made where it doesn&#039;t give you an option of how to make to the purchase or who the purchase is for. \r\n\r\nI was hoping that this could be refunded as I did not want the skin bundle I was purchasing it for a friend.\r\n\r\nI have now just purchased him the RP for him to buy it as there is no option to buy bundles as a gift for friends.\r\n\r\nThe receipt number for the purchase is: \r\n\r\nOC1-e97d5104-f7dc-11e5-b7d9-1dad0d3b0155\r\n\r\nPlease contact me as soon as possible","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-18T00:27:36.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! Unfortunately bundles can neither be gifted nor refunded, as per the refund policy that SephirothSG linked in his comment. However, if anything, you could try to contact Riot Games Player Support, as perhaps they might be able to give you better news, albeit unlikely. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-18T00:18:10.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHaving just attempted to purchase a skin for myself I can in fact confirm that you are still prompted before making a purchase (As can be seen in the screenshot below)\nhttp://puu.sh/pwBlH/86a2690b95.jpg\n\nFor more information about the Content Refund system, [check out the FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ).","replies":[]}]}
