My friend got told by support when he was permed \"there's truly no mechanism for recovering an account\". We know that's a load of bullshit thanks to you getting gehrin to unban luna. Well done by the way, she's spoke to me about it and she did deserve it. But back to the point they will just tell you \"it was deserved\" with a load of other bullshit about trying to get you to improve and how to properly use their mute button and tolerate... bullying..

In the meantime I'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support since at the very least with a ticket open they can contact you directly. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n___\n\nTo address some other comments as well real quick, it's not volume of reports that gets you punished, it's quality (though volume will defs get you noticed for manual reviews). The bot catches context to a degree but there will always be hiccups with any system, and given the tone of your logs it probably thought there was more negativity there than there was.\n\nIt doesn't show the full log because it's your behaviour that's being reviewed, not everyone else's, and negativity is negativity regardless of who started it, but understandably if a relatively innocent player gets caught up it looks a little weird to just have your logs.","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-07T02:37:18.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but with the quality thing that was one of the only games pre level 15 ive even talked in othe rgames i just want to end the game win or lose for some xp because the other players are new and the same account level so im not even sure why the system even picked me up for a punishment i have done nothing wrong and have not broken any of there terms of use. making a supoort ticket about the issie didnt help they have basicaly told me theat i got banned for a reason (they wont tell me why) its an automted system the punishment syustem is not perfect and far from it","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T03:07:52.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll see if there's anything I can do about support but no promises.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T09:28:26.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And here we run into the same argument, the support team can't do anything, either by refusal or by lack of ability to do things, and we again come to your advice having to be message support being utterly useless.\n\nSo do we get an admission that Riot support is useless yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2018-01-26T06:42:15.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9eOFgpe6,comment-id=0001000000010000000000000000,timestamp=2018-01-07T09:28:26.225+0000)\n> So do we get an admission that Riot support is useless yet?\n\nI gave up emailing support.
