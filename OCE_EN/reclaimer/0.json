Lasts for three seconds or until it is consumed by E&rsquo;grus&rsquo; first damaging ability.\nRanged auto attacks deal reduced damage however, E&rsquo;grus has a high base attack speed.\n\n**Q: Superbolt** (natural phenomenon, a rare lightning strike that is far brighter)\nAfter charging briefly, E&rsquo;grus fires a lightning bolt to a selected target dealing magic damage. If there are enemies nearby within a small radius, who are charged with Static Electricity, the lightning bolt then jumps to the nearest enemy(prioritising champions) dealing magic damage and then traveling again and so forth. For each new enemy the lightning bolt strikes, the cooldown of the ability is lowered by a second. (E&rsquo;grus&rsquo; main source of wave clear and damage).\n\n**W (toggle): Writhing Winds**\nStance 1: Increased movement speed. E&rsquo;grus leaves behind a wind trail that boosts allied champions movement speed when walking through it. Wind trail has a short lifetime. (As E&rsquo;grus has little cc, this is his main mode of escape, but also allows for some unique benefits for your fellow jungler when it comes to roaming to other lanes for ganks).\n\nStance 2: Swirling winds form beneath E&rsquo;grus covering a medium sized circular area. This area applies a weak slow to enemies that enter. While this mode is active, auto attack range is increased substantially. This bonus range increases with the level of the ability starting off as a minor extension as to avoid a strong lane phase.\n\n**E: Lightning Tether**\nE&rsquo;grus fires a super charged gust at targeted enemy champion, dealing magic damage and applying a weak slow. If there are other enemy champions within a small radius, with Static Electricity, the gust travels to the nearest enemy, and so forth.  Once two enemies are connected they are stunned for a short duration.\n\n**R: Electrostatic Cyclone**\nE&rsquo;grus channels for a few seconds, creating a large ring of spiralling wind and lightning over targeted area, dealing magic damage over time and drastically slowing enemies caught inside. The thickness of the ring is less than 425 so if caught inside, can be flashed out to avoid the detrimental effects.\nhttp://fav.me/d9odac0\nE&rsquo;grus is a powerful mage who excels in team fights. His core visual concept is based on a sprite (meteorological and mythological) sitting in a twister, bearing lightning and wind as his weapons. His core playstyle concept is his passives interaction with his Q and E abilities. His playstyle is based around auto attacking multiple enemies before using his abilities for maximum aoe damage, therefore the more enemies in close proximity that are grouped up, the more damage he is able to dish out. Counter play to this would be keeping your distance from his auto range, your allies or to cleanse/QSS the passive. His W gives him some means of mobility or enhanced team fighting, by being able to reach the back line potentially with his auto&rsquo;s and then using his mid-range abilities. The length of his auto range when in his second stance at level 5 would match his Q and E ability distance. Adjusting the max auto range would be a good way to balance him. His ultimate excels in team fights, especially ones centred near baron and dragon pits, thus increasing his team fight potential. I designed him to be a high risk, high reward champion requiring a high skill cap to master and achieve the most DPS. Depending on the projectile speed of his Q and E, a mechanic where using one of the spells on an enemy, and as its traveling proc the passive on nearby enemies would arise giving him more depth.\nhttp://fav.me/d9odark\nE&rsquo;grus is the shepherd of the clouds, and the embodiment of the majestic winds swirling over Valoran. With Zaun&rsquo;s disregard for the sky above, it has allowed its city to spew its pollution into air unchecked, smothering the clouds in filth, toxins and dark magic&rsquo;s. With Zaun&rsquo;s relentless pursue for power, no one on Valoran can halt its greed, and so the burden has risen to the shepherd above, E&rsquo;grus.\nFriends &ndash; Anivia, for some good banter about storms.\nRivals &ndash; everyone in Zaun!\n&ldquo;This cities disregard for the sky knows no bounds, as does my resolve&rdquo;.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my champion idea. My drawing isn&rsquo;t that great but I have tried as best I can to show the basic concept of this champion and his abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"MrShunpo","date":"2016-01-19T21:44:44.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice concept but I think the whole lightning/wind thing is already occupied by Ao Shin D: who is said to be released sometime this year.\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ao_Shin?file=AoShin_Concept.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-20T10:11:04.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well shit :C thats my idea down the drain!\n\nThanks for showing me this though, i hadn't realised Ao'Shin was actually going to get released.\nThought he wasn't going to happen thanks to copy right or something haha.\n\noh well, back to the drawing board xD","replies":[{"poster":"MrShunpo","date":"2016-01-20T12:57:06.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahaha no problem dude, btw all you would have to do is change the theme of your concept to something new and the ability names in this kit and can make something better. for example you could use the ''Glade'', I can only recall lulu{{champion:117}}  coming from there that's about it, it's unique and a lot can be done with it, maybe you can have this champ concept linked with this place? \n\n''the Glade, the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods. There the rigid properties of the outside world - things like size and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind.

I have the Idea that Riot could also bring a series of champions that are the defenders/essence of various parts and aspects of Runeterra. Anivia being the Freljord/ice (an idea already consistent with Anivia's current lore/background) and Eâ€™grus as the sky/thunder or after an area that reflects this champion. Same could be done for other elements, I think the idea is great, it really makes an easy backdrop for potential new champions plus it would help establish a world that still needs a lot of fleshing out.","replies":[{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-15T12:22:16.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps :D\n\nThat idea of defenders/guardians sounds awesome too!\nSeems like there could be lots of potential here!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-01-15T09:16:12.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He's too much like Xerath imo","replies":[{"poster":"Omegalucky","date":"2016-01-15T10:46:46.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disagree, Xerath is an artillery caster that simply cannot handle close up fights.\nThis one sounds like he has some wave clear to stay viable during laning phase and  the ability to cause havoc on people who would choose to dive him. While he would generally be a whittler (not bursty like a caster) but have an ult with enough bang to really tie in with a flash storm and also gives him enough burst to be considered viable in mid.\nJust because Xerath has lightning-ish themes doesn't mean they are the same, plus I don't even imagine this guy being that far reaching.","replies":[{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-15T11:01:34.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Omegalucky! imo he also doesnt resemble xerath at all. Xerath is an arcane magic user with long range spells. This champion would be more mid range, using lightning in a way that is as similar to xerath as any other mid laner. If you elaborate on your thoughts as to why he is so similar maybe then I could see why. thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-02-08T05:52:44.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/ocVHxrm8-cywick-the-elimination-protocol-prof-stanwick-lore-champion-concept\n\nReworked version\n\nReally need some feedback on why its not popular.
