His basic attacks apply Latent Shrapnel.  Lasts for three seconds or until it is consumed by Cywick&rsquo;s first damaging ability.\n\nDue to the precise compact design of the ammunition he uses, Cywick is unable to critically strike.\n\n\n**Q: Liquid Metal Shot **\n\nCywick fires a liquid metal bullet towards target location, dealing physical damage to the first enemy hit. If there are enemies nearby within a small radius (450) of the first target that are affected by Latent Shrapnel, the bullet then continues to the nearest enemy (prioritising champions) dealing physical damage and then traveling again and so forth (cannot target the same enemy twice). For each new enemy the bullet strikes, the cooldown of the ability is lowered by a 2 seconds.\n\nMetal shot liquefies after impact, reforming its shape and then resuming its destructive path.\n\nCost 40/50/60/70/80 mana\nCooldown 15/14/13/12/11 seconds\nRange 1100\nDeals 30/60/90/120/150 (+120% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage to first enemy and 80% to subsequent enemies.\n\n\n**W: Long Range Assault**\n\nCywick unleashes the power of his cannons. Cywick gains an increase to his maximum basic attack range however, he also gains a minimum attack range as well. Can be reactivated to cancel the ability early. While in this mode, basic attacks ignore 5/10/15/20/25% of the targets bonus armour.\n\nToggle: 30/35/40/45/50 mana per second\nRange increased to 600/650/700/750/800, with minimum range of 450 at all levels.\n\n\n**E: Electrified Tether**\n\nCywick fires an electrified harpoon at target location, dealing physical damage and applying a 20/25/30/35/40% slow to the first enemy champion hit. If there are other enemy champions within a small radius (450) of the first target, with Latent Shrapnel, the harpoon then travels to the nearest enemy, and so forth (cannot target the same champion twice).  Once two enemies are connected they are stunned for 1.5 seconds, increasing by 0.25 seconds for each subsequent enemy caught. Max stun duration would be 2.5 seconds on the last champion caught.\n\nCost 60/70/80/90/100 mana\nCooldown 16/15/14/13/12 seconds\nRange 1000\nDeals 40/80/120/160/200 (+75% bonus Attack Damage) physical damage to each enemy hit.\n\n**R: Isolation Rockets**\nAfter confirming coordinates, Cywick launches a rocket into the sky. The rocket then plummets towards the ground, splitting up into four individual rockets before landing at the designated target location dealing damage. After a short delay the three rockets that split from the original then connect to the central rocket via a powerful electric tether. This tether deals magic damage to enemy champions that pass through it, slowing them by 60/70/80% for 1.5 seconds. Champions in close proximity to the tether take additional magic damage over time.\n\nCost 100 mana\nRange 5000\nCooldown 140/120/100 seconds\nDeals 30/40/50 magic damage each second.\n\nhttp://fav.me/d9pxqme\n\nClick once to select location for the central rocket, then once again left or right of the previous location. Dragging the mouse then would rotate the ability marker allowing one to align the tethers how they wish.\n\nhttp://fav.me/d9pxpq7 http://fav.me/d9pxprl http://fav.me/d9pxqdd\n\nCywick is a late game scaling AD caster that excels in team fights. His core playstyle concept is his passives interaction with his Q and E abilities. His playstyle is based around auto attacking multiple enemies before using his abilities for maximum DPS. The more enemies, the more likely he will hit multiple targets with one Q, and therefore lower its cd providing more DPS in a team fight. The Q and E projectile speeds would be relatively fast, however there would be a slight delay between hitting the first target and then launching at the next. This would allow for the most adept at the champion to take advantage of his passive. Applying Latent Shrapnel to adjacent enemies as the Q or E ability is already traveling to the first target, overall increasing DPS.\n\nhttp://fav.me/d9pxqm7\n\nCywick is weak in 1v1 situations as he won&rsquo;t have any form of hard cc and relies on multiple enemies to lower his cool downs. The main tactic to avoid being hit by a jumping Q or E is to stay out of range of your allies that have been hit. Cywick with his W active is not able to damage targets with basic attacks if they are too close to him, and thus he must deactivate the ability allowing more time for the enemy to act. Overall the best way to deal with him is to get up close and personal.\n\nItem Build Example\n{{item:3158}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3085}} \n\n\nThanks for taking the time to have a look at my concept! Any feedback is more than welcome! I am working on the lore atm and any help would be most appreciated.\n\n**LORE**\n\nProfessor Stanwick wanted to leave one last invention for Zaun. An army of sentient guardians to protect, but most importantly destroy any opposition to Zauns ever growing power. Stanwick began modifying the steam golem concept, turning what once was a heart of gold into a collection of precise killing tools. The Grand General of Noxus heard broken whispers of the professors plans, riled in furry as his paranoia, in the shape of a blackened rose, sought out the professor to end his treacherous scheme.\n\nThe prototypes exterior was complete. All that remained to fill the hollow machine was programming to create his perfect sentient guardian. Stanwick worked day and night to create the protocols, struggling to integrate everything together. Before he could finish, an assassin crippled him with dark magicâ€™s, Noxus sent its regards, leaving the crazed scientist for dead. Stanwick would not leave this world yet, not until his masterpiece was finished, in his last hours he integrated his own mind with that of his prototype, completing its sentience.\n\nStanwick emerged from his laboratory as a machine, fuelled with a passion for destruction as he fights his aggressive programming. He seeks the Rift to test his capabilities. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-04-12T04:35:38.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump!","replies":[]},{"poster":"NZredeemer","date":"2016-02-08T05:47:37.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like an interesting concept.
