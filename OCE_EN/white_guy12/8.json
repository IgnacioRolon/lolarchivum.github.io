And to me I don&#039;t think this update was really needed, but to others, they think its going to &quot;bring him back into the meta&quot;. Now, I&#039;m going to be outlining the reasons why I think this &quot;rework&quot; is going to &quot;kill&quot; Ryze and why Riot should reconsider. I shall begin to explain:\r\n\r\nSo, the link to the post about Ryze and what they did and why they reworked him is here http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-update/champion-update-ryze-heads-pbe \r\nand the link to surrender@20&#039;s Ryze post is here\r\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/04/49-pbe-update.html\r\n\r\nNow my first point is about Ryze&#039;s new passive. The oce.leagueoflegends.com post has the reason why they changed Ryze and the basic information about the abilities. And the surrender@20 post has the more advanced information about his abilities and some notes. And now as you can see where RiotRepertoir states in the post: &quot;while consistency isn&#039;t usually a bad thing, Ryze just ended up flat and predictable. Changes were needed.&quot; Yet, I don&#039;t know if he is being serious or not. If you look at surrender@20&#039;s post on the changes you will see something that would go against what Repertoir just said. &quot;Note: by turning Ryze&#039;s passive into a model that has uptime and downtime, we can let Ryze be really strong within that window, and allow opponents a clear opportunity to fight against him outside of it, or cc him during it.&quot; Is it me or does this seem downright predictable. I mean come on, seriously? &quot;Note: by turning Ryze&#039;s passive into a model that has uptime and downtime&quot; So its good to know that Ryze won&#039;t be &quot;able to fight&quot; when his passive is down, cause that&#039;s obviously not predictable. \r\n\r\nMy second point is about his Q in Midlane. Which is probably the most talked about change in the update. As you all know it&#039;s moving from a Point and Click to a Skill shot format. and with this comes a slight &quot;buff&quot; as some people might call it. Althought this is no buff at all. It practically makes Ryze useless against mobility based champions, and in teamfights. Why might you ask would this not be a buff, Does this kid/bronzie know what he&#039;s talking about? Well from the information I&#039;ve gathered from my sources on the \r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3229w4/on_the_ryze_qrework_and_the_importance_of_point/\r\npost, I can tell you that this is a nerf. now back to the reason why he becomes useless. Against the top tier meta champs at this very moment. He would lose fights to about 75% of them, Ofcourse this is all dependant on the situation. lets just go with early game levels 1-8. now the champs I am talking about are LB, Ahri, Zed and Viktor. His Skill shot q can no longer deal damage zed, and lb at around level 4 because of their W, and he will no longer be able to trade or fight Ahri past level 6 fortunately Viktor doesn&#039;t have any mobility but what he does have is a shit ton of burst post-level 6. Thus only making one option for this match up - All in before 6 so you can atleast deal damage with your other abilities. Ahri would be the same but she has a charm making her harder to all in before 6, and zed, well you&#039;ll be dead because you&#039;ll only have 1 ability to deal the damage required to atleast bring him down 200 hp. And dont get me started on lb, I mean she already counters Ryze with her Q-W combo, now having to poke with a skill shot through minions will make him and unviable pick. Oh wait what? The q gets blocked by minions? well there goes his early game poke. Just forget about Ryze&#039;s early game. We&#039;ll move straight to mid-late game. now His mid to late game potential is.. umm. Oh wait was that a tank that just blocked his Q? Indeed it was. Ryze can nolonger make it straight to the carries when they have 1-2 meatshields standing right in front of them. I guess you might as well remove Ryze from the game He no longer has team fight potential. Wait, I know what he could do. He&#039;d make for an excellent minion farmer mid-late game, With all the damage he won&#039;t have to poke when he can hit minions 100% of the time he uses it. Maybe he might get enough gold to become stronger! wait. If you look at the stats from his old q to new q, there is a slight nerf in damage if he is going with a generic Ryze build:\r\n&quot;Q damage comparison:\r\nOLD: 55/75/95/115/135 (+ 40% AP) (+ 6.5% of max mana)\r\nNEW: 55/80/105/130/155 (+.55 AP )(2/2.5/3/3.5/4% maximum mana)\r\nThe ratios and:\r\nBased on a normal Ryze build with RoA/Seraphs/FH/Banshees/Sorcs/Void Staff with 0/9/21 masteries at rank 5 Q:\r\nCurrent Damage: 475\r\nNew Damage: 459\r\nThe nerf&quot;\r\nSo we&#039;re not only removing Ryze&#039;s ability to poke, and make it to the back line, but we&#039;re also removing some damage he can deal. and maybe in a few weeks we&#039;ll buff it to the point he becomes ridiculously strong that we have to nerf him to the point of S2 Eve 2.0 If he isn&#039;t already at that point post rework. \r\nThank you ladies and gentlemen for reading my rant, and thank you to the comment section which will hopefully fill up with hateful comments, This is the end of my rant and I will not make a tl:dr because I&#039;d rather waste your time. If it already wasn&#039;t wasted just by clicking on this thread. Good bye.\r\nPosting in miscellaneous because I really can&#039;t be bothered finding a suitable board, Hopefully this thread isn&#039;t taken down.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-04-11T00:04:44.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 - Ryze’s Q change will have way more negatives than positives. Yes he can now face check with Q, yes he has slightly more range and whatnot, but now he has hardly any lane poke since it only hits the first target damaged so enemies could hide behind CS, or in messy fights he can’t land that last Q on a low HP enemy for a kill because other tanks or front liners are in the way. \n\nAlso, the dmg me8y\n\n2 - His E is actually somewhat better now as it’s more reliable as a damaging ability since it’s not bouncing randomly.\n\n3 - His passive is weird because it somewhat needs preparations for fights like Yasuo stacking up Qs before entering a fight for maximum output or something. Yes he gets a nifty shield’n all but hey, a late game Ryze? no one’s gonna focus him anyway…he’s naturally gonna be 3tanky5me","replies":[{"poster":"white guy12","date":"2015-04-11T03:15:00.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With that being said, He will gain damage towards his other abilities (in a way) but he still wont have as much use for his Q as he used to, meaning he wont BE as efficient at doing those thing he used to be able to do.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OblitzerO","date":"2015-04-10T17:38:41.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR","replies":[]}]}
