I'd specifically look into the following steps:\n\n* Run the game as administrator\n* Disable User Account Control\n* Temporarily disable your firewall\n\nYou could also try a reinstall and see if that helps.\n\nIf you still have issues, I'd suggest opening a ticket with the support team, who should be able to help you further.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-17T05:39:12.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You could also try a reinstall and see if that helps.\n\nSo casual, man.","replies":[]}]}]}
