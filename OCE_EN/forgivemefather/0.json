It's good to see people so excited about gaining Honour levels, really brings back some faith that the community wont go downhill.\n\nThat said, I'm a little surprised people have already started getting Honour level 4, I would've thought it would take a bit longer (even for those putting several games per day). Maybe it's just easier to get level 4/5 than level 3? Or maybe Riot had progress \"restricted\" for a few weeks to make sure everything was working properly, and it's just not as difficult to gain levels as it has appeared so far?\n\nGreat, now my curiosity is getting the better of me... I should ask someone what the go is.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-14T23:52:18.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am almost certain that this is true, since honour level ups seem to be happening in waves, despite players playing at different rates and getting various honour frequencies.
