I was just curious and to be perfectly honest I am finding a lot of the behavior and language offensive and preventing me from enjoying the game. Not ALL but many of the male users are either cruel and disrespectful or sleazy :( I actually avoid the whole \"I'm a girl\"routine in actual games because I instantly become a target.  I am not seeking special treatment or attention based on my gender. Simply curious as to whether or not playing with other girls might improve my performance.\nOCE compared to any other server has definitely got the highest amount of bullying and I'm kinda fed up with it.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-06T05:11:59.810+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do guys ever said \"hey I am a guy\" in the game chat? I guess not.\n\nSo when you say \"hey I am a girl\" you become a target not due to your gender sadly, it's the impression that it gives people. People will think you're an attention XXX.\n\nMuch like how everybody was in a team doing something and someone suddenly said \"hey guys no know what, I am pretty good at math btw\". Ofc people would instantly go \"u wot?\"\n\nI am pretty sure there are plenty of girls in our community, just like guys, and I am also pretty sure that most of us are actually more interested in the game instead of what gender the teammate or enemy team has.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strat","date":"2014-12-06T11:50:34.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to break it to you, but bullying is rampant on all servers. Every server says their server has the highest amount of toxic players for X or Y reason.\n\nI consider myself a feminist. I've never gone out and said \"I'm a girl\" or \"I'm a boy.\" Which one am I? I won't say, because it's irrelevant to this discussion. That's the brilliance of games like LoL. Everybody's equal until proven otherwise. In game, I will treat everyone with respect as a fellow competitor in the game.\n\nNow, if someone goes out of their way to say \"I'm a girl\" in a game, I will GO OUT OF MY WAY to be toxic to them. I've never been warned, never been banned, and I'm not a toxic person in general. Why, then, am I toxic in this situation? \n\nBecause if you have the sort of mentality to say \"hey guys I'm a girl,\" you're basically saying \"I'm a special snowflake and I deserve more attention because I have a vagina.\" It's the EXACT opposite of feminism. So if you want to be anti-feminist, I'll go ahead and be anti-female (towards you) too.\n\nNow, I didn't mean to be rude, but I hope you understand why people treat you that way now. This view is common on the internet. You only have to look at other places e.g. 4chan where they say \"titz or gtfo\" to people who say \"I'm a grill\" to see the same concept in action.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Noki","date":"2014-12-08T11:08:35.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am grill.\n\nBest Sluzza Oce.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:14:02.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG A GRIL PLAYING A GAME WHAT IS DIS SORCERIE","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-08T11:57:48.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"told ya","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:08:04.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reported for being misandrist! xDDDDDDDDDDDDD","replies":[]},{"poster":"adc onIy","date":"2014-12-06T06:33:30.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a diamond female player add me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-06T04:35:50.742+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am gender binary, so sometimes I am female.
