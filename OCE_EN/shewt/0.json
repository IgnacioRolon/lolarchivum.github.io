With this new found guilt, Ahri wants to avoid taking more innocent lives and this is when she made a deal with the League. In exchange of Ahri&#039;s service, they will help her retain her human form....\n\nThe League however fooled Ahri. They pit Ahri to steal the essence of other champions and the minions in order for her to sustain her human form. Through a binding pact already made with the League, Ahri has no choice but to comply.\n\n\n**INFO**\nAhri has 3 forms she can alternate between but she starts with form number 1 and comes back as Form Number 1 everytime she revives\n\n**Form Number 1 - Beastly Ahri**\n _To turn back into this form from form number 2, Ahri needs to fail to collect an amount of essence with essence theft in *insert a time*_\n \n - Ahri has untamed hair, her fangs and claws are much sharper as well. She also features more hair on her face and limbs and other fox features (nose etc)\n - Her clothes arent really worn on properly (imagine a kimono as an e.g. for now) and have loose clothing items (e.g. waistband)\n - She has a deeper, raspy voice when she speaks and she is very rude, deceptive and uncaring of life at that state\n - Recall animation is she get anxious and starts panicking as she is about to turn into full fox again until she just made it in time to the nexus\n \n **Attacks**\n - Orb Of Deception has a violent aura and is purple in colour. Once full charge with by passive, it turns into crimson red\n - Fox Fire are 3 hungry skull flames that is ready to pounce onto their closest target\n - Charm has Ahri throwing a flesh beating heart onto a direction\n - Spirit Rushing has her pouncing like a tiger and as she maneuvers, debris from the ground kicks up and fly towards a target\n \n\n\n **Form Number 2 - Hybrid Ahri**\n _To turn into this form, Ahri needs to collect *insert number* of essence with Essence Theft in FORM NUMBER 1\n If in FORM NUMBER 3, Ahri needs to fail to collect an amount of essence with essence theft in *insert a time*_\n \n - She will look like how she usually look but with a different set of clothes and palette\n - Ahri now wears her kimono? more properly like how its traditionally worn, nice and tight\n - When she speaks, she sounds like how she would normally but much kinda and not as flirty\n - Recall animation is something...\n \n **Atacks**\n - Orb of Deception now glows in it&#039;s normal colour, green and blue\n - Fox fire is the same\n - Charm is still the pink flying heart\n - Spirit Rush is still the same dash?\n\n\n\n**Form Number 3 - Seductress Ahri**\n_To turn into this form, Ahri needs to collect *insert number* of essence with Essence Theft in FORM NUMBER 2\nTo maintain this form, Ahri needs to constantly meet the deadline of souls to collect_\n\n- Ahri turns into a full human, loss the scars, ears, tails etc. She now have really long hair that kind of replace the missing tails\n- Ahri will now wear clothes are bit loose to tempt the unfortunate\n- The voice is sweet and breathy, she is constantly flirting and teasing her summoner or opponents\n- Recall is Ahri using her orb to swallow her away and back to the base or something\n\n **Atacks**\n - Orb of Deception now shines in yellow and white in full charge\n - Fox fire is a trio of pink love heart shaped flames\n - Charm has Ahri blowing out a kiss to a direction\n - Spirit Rush will have Ahri perform a twirl towards the direction instead, elegantly rotating to her spot while launching projectiles\n\nHer death animation is her turining into a full fox upon death and her dance is something for each....\n\n\nSo what do you think of this? My idea is ofcourse i will love it but how do you guys find this?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-23T16:20:00.299+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a few tweaks here and there, I think this would be a good skin and I LOVE this idea. I just wonder if the Essence Theft mechanics will distract players too much from the actual game. But I would be SUPER keen for an Ultimate Ahri skin.","replies":[{"poster":"ShewT","date":"2015-10-26T06:32:32.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yea, a few tweaks would certainly help but I wanted to get the idea out more than giving a thorough adjustment to it.
