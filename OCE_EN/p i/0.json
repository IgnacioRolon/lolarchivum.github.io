This week it is happening at 3 mins into the game for about 3 mins. Is there any way to fix this or find out what it is? It's never done this before. I usually have 39 ping, but when the spike occurs it exceeds to about 400-500. FPS is unaffected(standard 60). This happens to me both on the new and old rift maps.\r\nGimme any advice/help you can~!!\r\nThank youu <3 ~ lag is {{champion:103}} tarded thing ._.","replies":[{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-11-20T08:36:10.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"#PunsOfDamage","replies":[]},{"poster":"AweClaw","date":"2015-01-16T09:25:54.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having the same issue ever since new patch.\n\nonly happens once a game.\nmy fps doesn't drop.\nmy ping can be anywhere between 300-1300\nplays fine after its done the lagging\nlasts for around 2-3 mins\ncan largely impact a game\nnothing has changed in my pc settings or internet connections I run it through Ethernet Catagory5e cable directly through the modem\nany enlightening on this situation would be great thanks","replies":[]}]}
