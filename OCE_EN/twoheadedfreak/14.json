It really sucked. I added them to my block list and I had to play with them two more times today. They&#039;ve completely ruined 3 games for me today, and I don&#039;t want to play with them. I&#039;ve also reported them.\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t you make it so we get the option of accepting a game with known blocked players or not? If I leave, I&#039;ll get leave buster, it&#039;s a no win situation. If given the chance, I would&#039;ve said no to playing those additional 2 games, but instead  Riot, you made me suffer through them.  Not happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-10T00:16:02.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really sorry to hear that and something our team here is cracking down on. If you could submit a player support ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\nWe can look at the match you played in and investigate from there. Thanks for helping us clean things up.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSparkle91","date":"2015-12-27T02:51:04.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a solution, either temporary or permanent.\nI've been dealing with these things for roughly a year now, and lets say every time I play an ARAM game I have to submit a ticket. I would be spending more time describing tickets that I would playing the freaking game! \nThe solution, to me, is simple: Change the reporting system in ARAM to reflect the system used in SR. All this means is that _when you report a player on SR they seem to be removed from your matchmaking pool._ This is not the case in ARAM and we are forced to either play a losing game or cop a leaverbuster punishment. I obviously don't know how script writing works, or if you can even combat an issue like this on such a level, but for the love of all that is holy - when I report the _same account three times in three days_, **TAKE THEM OUT OF MY MATCH MAKING POOL!** Reporting these accounts seems to count for nothing, so why the hell would I waste even more time submitting a ticket? \n\nI hope this get copy-pasted and plastered EVERYWHERE!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"El Vuur","date":"2015-10-04T12:16:58.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Linked [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/hojaHuRE-riot-have-you-noticed-the-number-of-bots-in-aram)","replies":[]},{"poster":"minnimum","date":"2015-07-12T05:03:21.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has effected me also.\nI am absolutely sick of the bots in OCE ARAM not to mention the amount of bots in dominion NA, It is ruining the game and I think something needs to be done about this, ARAM and dominion are good game types for casual players like me. I have Quit the Q lobby several times , because it is obvious I have a team of bots , SO of course I get penalised! I Have sunk money into this game which I now think is a waste because of the lack of customer service in this issue. I have reported and reported that there are bots and with each patch no bug fixes have been applied.","replies":[]}]}
