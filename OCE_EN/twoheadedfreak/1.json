That is seriosuly broken. He&#039;s untargetable and deals so much damage when in his blood pool. He nearly got a penta doing that in one game.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-22T14:18:16.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC and move on, the same can be said about yi, fizz etc. It's all in your timing.  He doesn't have perma troll pool so stun him b4 or after his troll pool. If no one on your team is taking any hard cc then just dodge. Sona and Ali are great counters for vlad.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-04-22T20:08:14.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that doesnt work against them either, they  can buy zhonyas, well fizz and vlad can","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-22T22:04:40.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played vlad in urf, I have changed my opinion now, he has a perma pool and is so hard to kill. I just got reported by the whole enemy team for playing vlad.\n\nEDIT - He has a 0.8 second window where he cannot go into pool. The animation needs fixing as it shows the he still is in a pool when not. Or it's a bug as renekton was stunning me at the end of my pool but still in it and Aatrox was knocking me up also.\nSo he does not have a perma pool and can easily be countered. \n@riot please make a QSS for ap champs ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SenpaiLion","date":"2016-04-22T13:51:22.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-24T03:22:08.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im still surprised nobody complains about Xin Zhao","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-23T18:01:00.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he still has cast times, which are a major hindrance even on regular vlad. vlads the same as most urf champs, just dont feed him. i played against a tank braum+taric and they were unkillable cos the idiot nunu+alistar fed them so hard.
