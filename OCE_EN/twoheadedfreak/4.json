Insta-lockers tilt me hardcore before the game even starts. Tonight, I called mid first, but another guy says, Nah, I&#039;ll go mid and insta-locks in talon. Please, for our sanity, put in the role selectors that are in the dynamic queue for blind pick, don&#039;t have to put in bans, just the role selection mechanism and you&#039;ll eliminate a large amount of toxicity from the game.  I have a mental illness and LOL usually really helps with that, but when someone insta-locks on me, I want to smash my computer.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-16T12:44:22.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree 100% I actually made a post about it a not too long ago but no response from riot just the green members saying their usual shit","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-06T02:55:43.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if it was me that responded to your post, the only one I remember responding to about that recently was to a player called Gloric. I entirely agree with the OP here actually, what I usually disagree with and try to explain when I respond to most other posts of this nature is that we won't be getting *draft* pick for good reasons, as that is what most people ask for rather than the OPs \"we want role select\", with which I couldn't agree more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-01-06T01:30:23.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Green Member:\n\n\"Here's an essay on why you are wrong\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-06T02:58:51.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is hope. It's likely that New Champion Select (i.e role select) will show  up in Blind Pick soon. Especially with Draft Pick being removed from all regions, I get the feeling it's something they're planning fairly soon (my best guess would be just before or just after the full release of the new client). No guarantees of course, but given what has been said and the direction they seem to be moving in, I'd say it's fairly likely.\n\nThey've recognised that no role select for Blind creates problems so I can't imagine them doing nothing about it. It could well be a case of \"we don't want to promise something before we know we can follow up on it and cause problems again\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-05T14:37:45.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. The cancerous \"call your lane and then not get it half the time coz someone else instalocks instead of calling\" makes me hate playing normals. Not getting any time to select the right runes and masteries for the enemy comp and mirror matches are the icing. \nFor some reason my computer just hates changing screens, going to champ select or player profile etc are always delayed by a second or 2 meaning queuing for normals is basically like selecting fill in ranked, 95% of the time i get left with support. You are meant to play normals to practice a champion to get better for ranked, not being able to select roles is pretty counter productive. If they had removed blind pick for team builder and just implemented the same filling mechanics they have now for ranked in team builder then it would solve the queue health problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T02:53:45.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a person call mid after me, picks zed( not locked in yet) he acknowledges he didnt get mid, says hell go support, then instantly locks in zed, doesnt get support item and ks every possible kill\nhis reasoning\nchill its just norms\nCAN THERE PLZ BE A PUNISHMENT FOR USING THAT PHRASE TO TROLL","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-12-16T12:25:07.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"was he actually trolling? not building support items and taking kills isn't trolling.
