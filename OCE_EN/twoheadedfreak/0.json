I got my favourite champ tonight which I rarely get and someone dodges. Got me so mad I&#039;m tilted all night because of one player, one player wrecked my whole night (don&#039;t bother replying that it&#039;s a game, get over it, because that just doesn&#039;t cut it). Even more annoying, the simply solution would be (as previously suggested) to make it so that when someone dodges in aram, they must play the next game with that champ. The current penalty is obviously not enough.\n\nYes, aram at the moment sucks because all champs are available - who on earth thought that would be a reward, OMG. The thing is, you know (should) this, so again, if you&#039;re not prepared to play any champ, **DON'T** queue for a game of aram!!!","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T17:18:33.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should people be forced into playing a champion they don't want to play?

The rotation updates very fortnight, and people have play styles, no? So it's reasonable enough to say, that if they are very good in one area, they won't be as good in another.\nI like to play marksmen.\nI like to play mages.\nI like to play fighters.\nI hate playing engage tanks. If I can't roll the engage tank, or trade it, I will seriously consider dodging a game.\n\nAt the end of the day, dodging is something WE ALL COME ACROSS, and is very clearly a community wide issue.\n\nSeeing as how many people are willing to dodge there should be a new system implemented that allows these players to not be forced into doing something they don't want to do.\n\nTl;dr your enjoyment doesn't mean more than anyone else's.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-01-31T08:39:09.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I never said that my enjoyment was more  important, but seriously, if you're not prepared to play any champ available, don't queue for aram. Go make a smurf with only the champs you want for aram, then you've only got to worry about the free rotation. It's not just me that's affected by the dodge, there's 8 other people affected by it too,  but I guess that one person that wants to dodge is more important than the other 9 based on your post.

I read that in a Q&A with Riot.\n\nSee, you're sensationalising. The example you gave before was \"People dodging when I've got my favourite champ greatly reduces the fun that i have.\"\n\nThis example isn't about you and the other 8 people, this example is exclusively about YOU and the dodger. You having someone you really WANT to play, and them having someone they really DONT want to play.\n\nLike I was saying before, I have rejoiced when games have been dodged before. Taking a no poke team into the howling abyss can be a really sucky time.\n\nSo you can't just say that you and all other 8 people are inconvenienced, because that's just an assumption you've made that everyone else is like you.\n\nI personally will never hold it against someone for dodging, I wouldn't force them into a game they don't want to play. \n\nI purchased the beginner bundle when I started playing, without knowing that I was going to go on to only play Arams. Rolling Yi, Garen, Warwick makes me upset. I don't enjoy the gameplay they offer, and nothing in this world can force me to play them if I don't want to. Yet, I enjoy the howling abyss, I just don't enjoy being forced into playing champions that I regret buying.\n\nPlease don't tell me to make a smurf... I've spent hundreds of dollars on my account and I'm not starting again just because I don't want to roll Garen...","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-01-31T09:41:31.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The punishment isn't more severe because riot can't tell the difference between a dodge and a legitimate dc.
