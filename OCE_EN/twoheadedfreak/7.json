ATM, I want to smash my computer because of the fukked up toxic shit that you get from role calling. OMG, I miss  ADC most of the time (trying to practice to play it in ranked) or get the worst sup ever coz they missed top. FML. No, I don&#039;t want to play ranked adc yet, I just would love to not be so incredibly tilted before I even start a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-05-31T02:30:32.932+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"flex queue?\nI think most players use flex queue as a training ground to mess around and learn champions for soloq. I play alot of top and jungle in flex queue as I'm trying to adapt to more roles, but I'll primarily play my main support in soloq. You'll be able to get your role more reliably in flex, especially if you duo or play with a group or team and it's basically the same as ranked, minus stable matchmaking but at least you'll get experience playing against a range of skill levels.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-30T23:01:25.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Befriend a support main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-05-31T02:01:11.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an FYI, Riot has *nothing* to do with \"role calling\". It's a method of deciding who gets which role that the community created and mostly accepts as the best way to organise random individuals into a team in a queue that is inherently disorganised (being blind pick). It's a bit like the META. Riot doesn't decide which champions are commonly recognised as the best for any given role/position, the community does.\n\nIf you find it's hard for you to get the role you want, you could try keying some macros for role call in champ select. This would (theoretically) reduce the time it takes for you to call a role, thus providing you a better chance of getting a role you want and/or am capable of performing on. While macros are generally frowned upon, there is no definite rule against using chat macros in champion select and it would certainly seem that it's extremely unlikely for any kind of punishment to come from using macros in such a way. That said, I would definitely **NOT** recommend using macros for anything else.","replies":[]}]}
