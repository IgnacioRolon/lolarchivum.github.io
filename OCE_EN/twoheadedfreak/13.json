He was hiding in the bush and cast his ult. It was invisible, couldn&#039;t see anything. I noticed a slow as I approached, but it was too late as I then died from full health. It detonated pretty much the moment I stepped inside the radius which was invisible to me. This isn&#039;t fair imo, Riot have taken that stance with Aurelion Sol&#039;s passive, so why is Nunu&#039;s ult invisible when it can 100-0 you instantly on detonation.\r\n\r\nPlease fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-25T09:14:22.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever meet a Nunu in aram again you might want to get your team to stack on the far side away from the bush.

I made the mistake of assuming  that the bushes had been checked, so I wasn't fussed with walking close to them. Should never rely on your team, but still, for it to be invisible and deal they much damage is not fair, especially since Aurelion Sol's passive is visible for that reason and deals less damage.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-03-25T00:20:05.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you missed the part of  the thread where I said that he time it perfectly so that it detonated the moment I entered the zone.

However, Nunu is very weak right now even having that strength. It also may not be visible, but it is still very noticeable as you leave a trail of snow and are slowed.  So if you ever notice getting slowed near a bush turn around and walk away, as he has to channel for 3 seconds.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-24T15:19:47.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whos nunu? 1.48% pick rate i havnt seen a nunu played in 6 months, so for you to actually run into this situation again is rare even on aram","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-24T15:19:45.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because it has a 3 sec channel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-24T14:47:00.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm I'm my move speed went from 400 to 300 what is this and I have a ice trail behind me is this nunu no cos I cant see him lets walk move into the bush","replies":[]}]}
