However, now I find myself wondering.Playing ascension, I scored 73 points, kda was average, but seriously, 73 points should be an S. It was with Karthus too, hardly played. I think the mastery for Ascension needs to be reworked.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-02T13:03:28.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Points don't actually count to the grading to my knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-10-03T10:32:48.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If that's the case then it definitely needs to be changed. It's the main aspect of ascension. 73 points and only an A is not fair. It also happened on another champ, can't remember which one or the points, but it was 70+.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-02T12:27:54.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The things with hardly played champs _(at least from what I've noticed)_ is that the only people who play them are mains, therefore most of them are good.\n\nSo while champs like Karthus and Aurelion Sol arent picked much, pretty much the only people who pick them are Karthus/aurelion Sol mains _(unlike champs luje Yasuo and Zed who everyone and their dog picks)_ so naturally the average success rate will be higher with Karthus/Sol becasue only the people who know how to play them, play them. \n\nFor example when was the last time you saw a bad lee sin? probably a game or two ago, when was the last time you saw a bad Azir? Probably a lot longer ago. Even though Azir is harder to play.","replies":[]}]}
