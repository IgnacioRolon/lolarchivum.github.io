It wasn&#039;t verbal, I got bullied out of my role by someone who decided that an ADC sup doesn&#039;t need gold items and can just take all CS and kills he wants. I didn&#039;t report after the game as I was too tilted and couldn&#039;t think of how to do it at the time. IMO, bullying is a serious issue in LOL that seams to be ignored, there&#039;s no specific report category for it. one only has to look at the underlying case which prompted Bullying - Brodie&#039;s Law to realise that it should have zero tolerance. Someone told me to suck it up and support him as he was going to deal more damage, but that&#039;s just condoning bullying and makes the problem worse.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a very serious issue that needs to be dealt with appropriately.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-04-25T08:46:45.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, your perception of life is a bit warped then, but then again, most bullies usually is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-04-11T19:25:51.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"really bullying ? if you are that soft lock your self in a room by your self and never come out. on the other hand this guy was just being a %%%% and probably falls under grifing the whole notion of cyber bullying when you dont even know the person is absurd all you have to do is mute the block them or in your case be able to play your role and last hit","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-04-11T21:46:09.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pedojuice,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9bZT25qQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-11T19:25:51.233+0000)\n>\n> really bullying ? if you are that soft lock your self in a room by your self and never come out. on the other hand this guy was just being a %%%% and probably falls under grifing the whole notion of cyber bullying when you dont even know the person is absurd all you have to do is mute the block them or in your case be able to play your role and last hit\n\nWow, seriously? \n\n1. Muting  wouldn't have done anything. \n2. Did I say I say sat and cried. \n\nI'm pointing out a major issue with behaviour and all you can do is get abusive. If you're not part of the solution, then you're part of the problem. \n\nWhen graves kills multiple cs with one aa, it's impossible to get any decent farm. He wrecked my game and wasted my time, why should I just let people do that? Don't care what you say, it's bullying, and there are many people that play this game with mental illnesses. So bullying is a very serious problem. Given that 1 in 3 people have a mental illness, what you're proposing is cutting the huge oce population by 33%.","replies":[{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-04-20T01:33:50.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or its a game get over it and move on ? this is such a first world problem and your sitting here trying to justiy bullshit ohhh i didnt get adc where as people have real problems like dying of hunger k good talk","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-04-21T15:28:09.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=pedojuice,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9bZT25qQ,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-04-20T01:33:50.492+0000)\n>\n> or its a game get over it and move on ? this is such a first world problem and your sitting here trying to justiy bullshit ohhh i didnt get adc where as people have real problems like dying of hunger k good talk\n\nBullying is a real problem and people commit suicide from bullying.

However, in regard to how he played, it can be said that he did nothing wrong. By not verbally abusing you and deciding to take the dominant role in the game, he didn't break the summoners code. One reason why I am saying this is because when we first started playing 8 years ago the game was about experimenting and finding out what works. Ashe was a mid lane champion and there was always a level 1 fight on top lane. The only thing I can suggest is, keep playing and don't let his actions affect your future games.","replies":[]}]}
