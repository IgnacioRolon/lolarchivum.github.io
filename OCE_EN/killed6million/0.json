My first instinct would be that your firewall and/or anti-virus are blocking certain elements when patching. Ensuring there is an exception for League in both, and running a clean reinstall (via the Hextech Repair Tool) after that would be my first recommendation.\n\nIf that doesn't help, submit a ticket to player support and they'll be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Killed6Million","date":"2019-12-21T11:56:50.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client fixed itself after playing 1 game, but then came back after relogging.
