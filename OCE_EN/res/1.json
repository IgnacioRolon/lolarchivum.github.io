I'm not sure if this is true or not but I might as-well try right?\r\nI went on support and they said to try the forums. So.... Are there any riot members out there willing to play with me for my 1000th win? My IGN is Res. Thanks anyway if you don't. I don't really care that much I just think it would be really cool to play with riot.
