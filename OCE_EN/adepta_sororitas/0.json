I finished seasons 4 and 5 at plat 2 but haven&#039;t had time to play league since and just did my promos (G5 currently). Climbing as support is a pain so would like a friend to jam some games with.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n-No flaming. I&#039;m super serious, I don&#039;t care whose fault it was, the focus always has to be on getting better as a player. If you&#039;re not being constructive, shut up.  It&#039;s just a computer game, behave like an adult. Winning is nice but contrary to popular belief, this game is supposed to be fun. \r\n-Whilst it&#039;s a game for fun I would like to hit plat again this season, so I&#039;m terribly sorry but if you&#039;re silver 3 or whatever it&#039;s probably not going to work. Happy to play a normal with you and see how it goes though. I do do coaching over at https://www.lol-coaching.com/coach.php?id=23482 if you want some tips :)\r\n-My favourite supports are Thresh, Leona, Janna, Nami and Lulu, but if you ask nicely I can play them all, I just don&#039;t like them as much. \r\n-If you want to support me that works too :D Get ready for lots of Ashe and Vayne though... my champion pool is less diverse for ADC :P Mixing it up to keep it fresh works too (probably preferred honestly). \r\n-Don&#039;t play Ezreal. Seriously.... just don&#039;t. The Odd One says it better than I can. http://www.nerfplz.com/2011/12/theoddones-compiled-ezreal-quotes.html\r\n\r\nWhy do people post their IGNs in these sorts of posts? My name is RIGHT THERE. Message me in game if you&#039;re keen. But no salt. You&#039;re wasting my time and yours. And complaining, whining and anything remotely close counts :D","replies":[{"poster":"TO VALHALLA","date":"2016-06-28T02:38:28.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo im down\nG5 Jhin main :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Saint","date":"2016-06-27T05:21:31.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me, \"The Saint\" i main ADC currently Gold 4 been playing since season 1 shaco release and a wealth of game knowledge, i look at the game like a sport and treat everyone with respect. \n\nIm at work atm or I'd just add you xD this is so I don't forget.","replies":[]}]}
