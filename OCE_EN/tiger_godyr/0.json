I Think a SPRengar skin would be awesome, your confetti idea sounds good. What i was saying is that you could add what i said to give a real jumpscare, to surprise them, albeit being partly a joke. Seems like you jumped the shark and went on the attack thinking i was talking %%%% when i wasnt.\n\n3. I wasnt spitting in any \"poeples\" face's you spastic, and even if i could, i wouldnt waste it on insulting you.\n\n4. You talk like a prepubescent, \"how would i like it if someone was doing it to [me] ???\". One, i wouldnt give two %%%%s, my ego isnt as easily offended as yours seems to be, grow up and learn not everyone thinks the same thing and people are going to disagree with you. If you think that, you truly are an immature kid.\nAnd two, you use that as a way to try and guilt trip me? Please, im past that stage of immaturity where stuff like that works.\n\n5. Your telling me off as if you have already won an argument? Im laughing at you now.\n\n6. Jesus Christ, learn to spell. I cant tell whether your genuinely a %%%%%%ed snotty nosed school kid/ dropout or trying really hard to bait. Both by the way are bad.\n\"thort\" isnt a word, \"idear\" is not a word, here ill help you. You mean 'thought', as in the past tense of think, and 'idea' which is something you come up with in your head, or head cavity in your case.\n\n7. Please dont use more than one ? or ! in a row. It truly is poor grammar.\n\nBut On-Topic, I think a Surpise Party Rengar is a pretty good idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tiger Godyr","date":"2015-02-09T11:23:51.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tiger Godyr,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=nELO4QPg,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-07T02:25:00.865+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:107}}  hello there i am Tiger godyr and i have been playing rengar and i thort would it not be cool to see a surprise party rengar\n> it would be cool , funny and it would give him a new tip of look.\n> \n> when he ult a cloud of confetti comes out.\n> \n> and more \n> \n> it would be a cool thing to see\n\nso give it some thort plz \n\nit would be cool to see more surprise party skins \n\nother people that could have them is someone like\n\nrengar \ntalon\nevelin\nteemo\n\nand some other but i cant think of them :D \n\nplz give some thort and get back to me play","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-07T05:10:51.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah he has the jump the %%%% out of your seat and cry ult, could work","replies":[]}]}
