LET ALL THE PLAYERS IN THE TEAM VIEWING EACH OTHERS' LAST 3 OR W/E NUMBERS OF MATCHES KDA OR MATCH DETAILS,\r\n2. AND MAKE  A VOTE BY ALL THE TEAMMATES TO DECIDE WHETHER THE BANS/PICKS SHOULD BE CONTINUED \r\n3. THE PLAYERS OF THE TEAM WHICH VOTED NOT TO CONTINUE PICKING WOULD BE RANDOMIZED AND MATCH AGAIN WITHOUT ANYONE GETTING PENALIZED\r\n\r\nSo the purposes are \r\n1. To make sure that no one in the team will get disappointed by the teammate who had already doing bad in those previous games WITHOUT knowing or noticing .\r\n2. Although the previous matching details can be viewed online, but isn't it more convenient to view those information in game?\r\n3. If someone in the team met a player who he doesn't want to work with due to these reasons ( negative attitude, unskilled, etc.), he can make a vote WHICH EVERYONE IN THE TEAM GETS A CHANCE TO MAKE DECISIONS instead of quit the game with LP losing. \r\n\r\nThis was what happening in 14/1/2015,\r\n\r\nI won 3 ranked matches in a row previously and I went into the promos of bo3 ( http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA/38683928 ) \r\n\r\nThen in the first promo, my team got a fiddlesticks ( http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/75467473/200036732?tab=overview ) who fed so hard and being negative and dragging the team down. \r\n\r\nFor more details of the fiddle player, please click here ( http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=selari%20telorali )\r\n\r\nAs a result, I lost the first promo, and as soon as I get into the ban/pick lobby for my second promo, I met the fiddle again. What I did was quit the game instantly as I cannot allow that scene happens again.\r\n\r\nAnd of course I failed my promotion to the next tier.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am just unlucky but if there is something like what I said above in league, people would be much more enjoying the game but not suffering from unskilled players and negative players.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2015-01-14T08:09:34.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You need to stop blaming your team, when you lose be glad and see what you could have done better, you learn more from losses than wins, but you can't just say \"oh this guy fed so I became powerless, it is his fault we lost\" sometimes this may be true, but you need to ignore that and look at what **YOU** could have done better.\n\nIf you look to improve yourself, and not your team you will have a much easier time climbing.

I mean you sure called Panth retarded a lot and then stopped trying and started trolling after the 5 minute mark for the remainder of the game.  Not coming here to rage at you or anything I just actually cracked up laughing when I looked into your profile and saw you pretending to be a really positive player.  Oh yea and before you tell me to get a life and stop wasting my time looking into people's account online remember you are the guy who spend around 5 minutes of a League game pressing the dance button over and over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2015-01-14T15:59:23.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr","replies":[]}]}
