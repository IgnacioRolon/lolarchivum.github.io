This is very frustrating for me and yes it is quite simple to out play but in early game he is very hard to get a solid hook onto him. im happy to make a short video to show what happens but only if its needed. If you are able to fix this that would be amazing because a lot of people go ezreal to counterpick blitzcrank but it just seems stupid. Thank you.{{champion:53}} {{champion:81}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:30:49.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey quaZeR,\n\nWhile we do appreciate you taking your time to report a bug, because this is the Help and Support boards, we try to limit posts to technical issues and general questions. As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
