I have League in game full screen on my main desktop and often another webpage, stream or music etc open on my second monitor.\r\nHowever when I Cmd + Tab (Alt + Tab for windows) my League game minimises until I Cmd + Tab back to it again and it reappears. \r\nJust wondering if there is an ability to Cmd + Tab to another screen while the in game client remains active on my main desktop but I would be able to actively use the second monitor and client etc.\r\nThanks in advance, it&#039;s hard to find Mac support items that are relevant because I know we are the unloved counsins :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T12:40:31.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sportsta,\n\nTry running League of Legends in Windowed Borderless mode.
