Lost around 600ish lp so far from this too, stopping me from hitting plat multiple times now (Would currently be plat 2 if this bullshit didnt occur constantly). I've put in Multiple tickets but Nothing happens.\n\nJoin game like normal. Game loads but doesnt enter me into the loading screen. I wait, get tilted by the fact its a ranked game and wont let me enter, close client then reopen it just to see \"game in progress\" without any reconnect button or allowing me to rejoin, thus losing a lot of LP in the process. \n\nAnyone else having this problem and riot completely ignoring you too or?\n\nEDIT: It's currently happening right now for me","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-08-03T03:08:50.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just end process tree via Task Manager, i look for the client (The actual game itself), End the Process Tree, gives me the reconnect button on the actual client and it works fine, i miss at most one of the minion rounds, which isn't really an issue, since i don't get anything in them anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-08-03T01:55:15.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had this same issue, found that restarting my PC allowed me to load into game.\nWe're currently tracking this issue, if you [contact PS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) they'll give you instructions on how to collect logs to help the devs resolve this.","replies":[]}]}
