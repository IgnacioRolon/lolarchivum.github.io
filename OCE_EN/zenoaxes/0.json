I don&#039;t regret buying Ezreal, but his basic attack, when I first used him I couldn&#039;t even tell if I was doing damage or not, his basic attack looks like a tiny array of yellow lines just flying by freely. I would love to see a change to it&#039;s looks. That&#039;s all I want Riot, that&#039;s all I want.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-28T16:07:02.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yellow Liiiiiiines, floow maaah waaaay...","replies":[{"poster":"Zenoaxes","date":"2015-06-28T23:02:02.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still trying to figure out whether this is an actual song or not.
