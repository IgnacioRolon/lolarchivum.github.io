View at your own risk.\nTLDR at end.*\n\nAs any Oncer knows the Dark One&#039;s dagger has the name of the person who holds it&#039;s power on it, which will change as the power gets transferred to another person. In the season 4 finale a lot of stuff happened which resulted in what is, in my opinion, the best photo of the dagger (Below). Basically, I want to change the name but can&#039;t do it myself. For now change the name from \"Emma Swan\" to my summoner name \"SparksElm\" but without it looking out of place. I will pay using in-game currency (RP) for someone who manages to achieve this and will probably want another done (which can be discussed further when it comes to it).\n\nTLDR - Look at picture below. Replace the writing \"Emma Swan\" with my summoner name \"SparksElm\". In-game currency provided for ideal outcome.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/OnceABC/photos/pb.168914433164059.-2207520000.1432174855./815959698459526/?type=3&theater","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-05-21T08:11:30.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is another option for you, I haven't watched the show so i don't know the exact specifications of the text but here is my attempt.","replies":[{"poster":"SparksElm","date":"2015-05-21T08:23:17.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks to me like you got the text right.
