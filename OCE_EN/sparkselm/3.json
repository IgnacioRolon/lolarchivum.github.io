I want to improve and become more versatile in the roles, positions and champions I play and figure that will be easier to achieve with a reliable team. Be warned, I do have this thing for 2-in-1 champions (&quot;Quinn and Valor&quot; and &quot;Wolf and Lamb&quot;) so you&#039;ll probably see me playing them a lot more than other champions. In fact, I have been tempted recently to learn to jungle just so I can play Kindred a lot more.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t played a PVP on SR for several months, I think, with the rare Co-op VS AI match in that time (usually with friends), so I am a little rusty on &quot;normal&quot; game-play (I enjoy ARAM, sue me). I did play my 10 provisional games last season (in the 36 hours leading up to the end) and got placed in Silver III, though I will admit I got carried in a couple games. I didn&#039;t end up playing any more ranked after that, mainly because I knew I wouldn&#039;t be able to get gold in that time and then, this season, I just never got around to it.\r\n\r\nI can use VoIP programs to communicate, though don&#039;t ask for Skype because it hates me (I tried everything to fix it and it still has terrible quality). I have Teamspeak and Raidcall installed and are willing to try other programs. I&#039;m available pretty much whenever at the moment and don&#039;t see that changing until the new school year starts (there&#039;s a course I&#039;m looking to complete). As for positions, I&#039;d say I&#039;m best Top and ADC (though I do need to work on my CS), and am willing to Mid and Support. I can&#039;t jungle, though I am looking to change that (as I said earlier [for Kindred]).\r\n\r\nYou can feel free to check my match history, though don&#039;t be surprised when you find it full of ARAM games. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss Pixl","date":"2015-10-23T05:46:58.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, Whitefox Esports are looking for players.
