However, maybe someone like Lee Sin could be a good person to try, because he has a similar playstyle in the sense that you can jump in and out of battles as him. Maybe other assassins would be a good choice too, like Zed or Kat. Fiora could even be a good choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bc5081","date":"2014-12-28T14:32:11.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Guys","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2014-12-28T14:52:03.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also i must say, you shouldn't really make a montage of you killing bots.. doesn't take that much skill to kill bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-28T17:18:46.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it does, i saw a diamond 1 getting owned by bots they r seriously op freelo","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bc5081","date":"2014-12-28T16:03:16.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea sorry that was when I first started","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2014-12-28T14:10:56.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would advise you to really play around, get good at other people that you wouldn't normally play, because when you get higher and you have only played one person, you are back a step from other people your lvl, try out adc, even support, cause when it comes to ranked games you will have your fair share of not getting the lane you want. trust me play around now and you won't regret it. also maybe try out zed, he's fun to play and is really good to. also try out lux or even talon. talon would probably be a likely person you might chose cause he does crazy damage, has a invisible (ult) and has a teleport.

Akali in this instance) and then see if they have worked on any other champions.
