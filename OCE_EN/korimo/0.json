After i click LAUNCH it turns orange again and then just sits there, i&#039;d then have to wait for five to ten minutes just for the first terms of contract to appear and need to click accept, another five to ten minutes for the second then a whooping thirty minutes before i can log in. Once i log in i don&#039;t have any problems until the next patch. Also I need to restart my PC 9 / 10 times before it will launch.\r\n\r\nI have checked my firewall\r\nI have switched my DNS to Primary: 8.8.8.8 and Secondary 8.8.8.4 \r\nI have used compatibility mode\r\nI have used admin\r\nI have re-installed and also cleaned my registry\r\nI have also done a repair\r\nI have checked the compatibility with other programs to check if that is the problem\r\n\r\nI use Win 10 with 18 gigs of RAM, 760 Geforce Graphics card and i7 Processor. 1TB of space with at least 500GB free.\r\n\r\nIm not sure what i have to do now to fix it but hopefully you have some sort of an idea as this is a very annoying bug in LoL and a few people have also gotten this.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:42:13.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you tried [reinstalling the game completely](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Korimo","date":"2016-04-24T12:20:34.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I have, sorry that i have not replied as i have been away.","replies":[]}]}]}
