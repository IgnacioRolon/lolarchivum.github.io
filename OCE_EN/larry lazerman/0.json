None of this is to do with people&#039;s races or origins. This is purely for gameplay.\r\n\r\nI would like a system to limit my queue searches more specifically than just server wide. I have been running into (for lack of a better word) &#039;issues&#039; when it comes to playing ranked queue and being paired with players of different nationalities that don&#039;t speak English. As Riot pushes more for a team based feel instead of individual play, communication is becoming more important. Unfortunately if we don&#039;t have the same language in common I can&#039;t understand them, and I assume they can&#039;t understand me. It makes it too hard to provide information or form a team strategy. I would like it if in settings there was an option to narrow down search parameters. I had this same issue for a week or so in Counter Strike but was able to find an application that refined game searches based on location (country). \r\n\r\nSorry to anyone I offend by this but that is by no means my intention. I just need to be able to communicate my with team. Thanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-03-27T07:54:46.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it may be a good idea in theory, our server is _**way**_ too small to pull something like this off. Even as is, queue times can be 60+ minutes. \n\nBeing able to type in chat to discuss strats is really useful, but you can also use pings to convey your intentions. It is less than ideal, but it works the majority of the time (you can't mute pings after all). \n\nIn terms of clearly being able to communicate with your team so you can claim victory, [I would suggest joining a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). You build relationships, can learn to fit with each others play styles, have A+ communication and avoid toxins like feeders/afks/general potatoes. With all of the incentives being thrown at you such as, increased IP, mastery points and hex tech stuff, there is literally nothing to lose.\n\nSomething else you could do is learn a couple of phrases in languages that come up often. I would suggest Korean and Mandarin (these are the main ones I have encountered). \n\nLearn:\n\n*  To call roles\n*  Lanes\n*  \"Rotate x lane\"\n*  \"Dragon\"\n*  \"Baron\"\n*  \"Push x lane\"\n*  \"Back\"\n*  \"Buy\"\n*  \"x tower\"\n*  \"gank pls\"\n* \"please\" \"thank you\"","replies":[]}]}
