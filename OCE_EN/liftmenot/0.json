I&#039;ve been trying to isolate this incident and it only happens in rotating game modes when I am in base after a load.  If I move out of base and then reconnect it solves the problem, however it pisses my team off because I have to automatically reconnect to fix the FPS drop issue.   Hope this sort of helps but Riot needs to get on top of this asap.","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-08-05T11:00:25.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Simple solution to your problem:\n\nDon't use a mac.
