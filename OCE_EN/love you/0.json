In all my Chinese chat groups, what happens is that a booster receives an order, and asks for 5 men queue in the chat and people with elo similar to the ordered account respond. In fact, 5 men queue is going to benefit for both booster and other 4 players.\n\nFor booster: The booster still stomps and directly outplays 1v3 because he is vastly superior, even if other team has slightly higher mmr. He also never get troll or feeding teammates, because its premade 5 men queue and other 4 will just make sure they don&#039;t feed =&gt; 100% win. There is also a huge advantage because the booster can vocally command and organize on Skype or other voice apps. It&#039;s like a gold rank team not only has challenger smurf playing, but also live coaching from a challenger player.\nOther 4 people: They are just going to afk in lane or play the safest option possible, and wait for the booster to carry. Yes, they win the game that they actually play in, but does their new rank mean anything? No. They probably win another couple of games because of luck, or keep 1win 1 lose for a while because their lack of skill is not reflected immediately. But for sure, they will start a losing streak sooner or later. I have never seem a player actually stuck somewhere and had to &#039;climb&#039; via 5 men queue method, climb again through solo queue.\n\nIn the end, the booster will have much better organized way to climb and continue their business. The casual players are going to be less active in terms of queuing up for rank, and just going to wait for the booster to organize 5 men queue. This is what most people think, &#039;why would I constantly risk 60% winrate solo queue to climb, if I can duo with booster for 90% winrate?&#039;. It sounds reasonable, but it is also the fault of dynamic queue. I personally worry that this is going to influence the queue time, which is already pretty damn long now. I really wish the old solo queue will be back or Riot somehow implements a new solo queue system. {{champion:32}}\n\nTL DR: Booster looks for 5 men queue to prevent trolling/tilting teammates. Casual players know about this and thus will always wait for 5 men queue for dramatic higher winrate. If this keeps happening, casual players become inactive, not solo queue up as much and heavily rely on 5 men queue. It will result in longer average queue time, and the unreliability in determining a player&#039;s skill based on 'solo rank'.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-03T05:10:23.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post, and very true. We need solo queue back. Lots of people's ranks are totally out of whack. Dudes that build rageblade on Vayne are platinum?? Tristanas using E to engage in Gold?? Dudes that were Bronze 5 0 lp last season are now suddenly in platinum? (see Shakarez's twitter).\n\nVery unhealthy for the game, and lowering the standard of play in OCE. It's no wonder that we can't compete internationally. I would even say that Chiefs are actually weaker than they were a year ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KenanIsApEMaN","date":"2016-05-03T03:50:12.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kapok,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Em5wbsAA,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-05-03T03:20:08.899+0000)\n\n> In all my Chinese chat groups, what happens is that a booster ...\n\nSo you admit you're in a chat group with boosters.
