We've been working on an issue affecting RP purchases tonight, which might be the cause of what you are seeing.\n\nIf you've already bought RP and it hasn't shown up - I'd suggest you [get in touch with the support team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to make sure it goes through correctly.\n\nIf you're still waiting to purchase it - I'd say check back in a few hours / tomorrow.  You can check the latest info on server status [here](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce). \n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"BekFast","date":"2017-02-15T11:01:58.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone else having this problem?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BekFast","date":"2017-02-15T10:12:11.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe there is a big delay happening right now,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warside","date":"2017-02-15T10:10:14.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happening to me aswell but its taken the 20$ and not added rp","replies":[]}]}
