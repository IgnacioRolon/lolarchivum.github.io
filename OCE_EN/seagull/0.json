{"poster":"Seagull","date":"2016-06-24T11:27:04.730+0000","title":"The Beast","subforum":"FanFiction","up_votes":18,"down_votes":16,"body":"Every so often, a truly terrifying monstrosity storms the battlefield. Screams of agony and anger can be heard as its victims struggle for their last gasp of air. Hatred for the beast has no limits, and its menacing laugh is feared by all creatures, great and small.\r\n \r\nAs the warm sunlight swept across the battlefield, Leona treaded carefully through the thick grass. Shield in hand, protecting her every being from what could lie ahead. Sweat dripping from her brow, paranoid that at any instance, she could become the beasts prey.\r\n \r\n&quot;Leona!&quot; Cried Lux, crawling with much difficulty, out of the muddy waters.\r\n \r\n&quot;Heavens, what did this to you?!&quot; Leona exclaimed, as she started to race towards her fallen comrade.\r\n \r\n&quot;Don&#039;t come any closer! It&#039;s here. Stay strong, and be safe.&quot; The pained look on the Lady of Luminosity&#039;s face made Leona want to rush to her side, but she remained still. Not wanting to anger what could be lying in the shadows.\r\n \r\n&quot;I will avenge you, my Lady. I will destroy that beast.&quot; Leona gripped the handle of her shield tightly, as she watched her friend fade away into a beam of light. A single tear ran down her cheek, as she struggled to come to terms with the loss of yet another comrade to this vile monstrosity.\r\n \r\n&quot;Show yourself, coward!&quot; She screamed, taunting the beast. She was ready. &quot;This is the last time you step foot on these grounds!&quot;\r\n \r\nSilence. Nothing but the howl of the wind, and the rustling of the trees filled the air. It was unsettling. Gritting her teeth, she took another step towards the shadows, then another, and another, until she was at the edge of her comfort zone. No longer would she be under the sun&rsquo;s rays once she stepped foot into the muddy waters. She would be in its territory.\r\n\r\nGathering herself, Leona took a deep breath and stepped one foot into the darkness. An overwhelming cold aura surrounded her, but she couldn&#039;t go back. Not after watching her comrades fall before her at the hand of the beast. Composing herself, she made her way deeper into the unknown.\r\n \r\nIt wasn&#039;t until she heard distant footsteps, that she stopped dead in her tracks. Whoever was approaching was running, and running fast. Leona was sure that any second, the beast would launch its attack at her. She closed her eyes, and began charging herself with what little sun she could muster, to brace for the incoming attack.\r\n \r\nCRASH! The sound of metal hitting her shield echoed through the forest. Peering over her shield, she spotted two long, blue braids dragging in the mud.\r\n \r\n&quot;Owwies. That really hurt.&quot; said Jinx, as she rubbed her behind. The impact of the shield threw her to the floor with a surprisingly hard thud. &quot;Fishbones! Are you okay?!&quot; She petted her gun gently, soothing it after the sudden collision.\r\n \r\n&quot;What the heck happened. Since when is there a wall here?&quot; Jinx exclaimed, rising from the ground. She looked up and met Leona&#039;s eyes. &quot;Hey, what&#039;s the big idea?!&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;I&#039;m terribly sorry, I thought you were hostile. I heard you running through the forest.&quot; Leona looked apologetically at the young girl. She had obviously been through a lot. Mud smeared across her pale face, anxiety filling in her eyes. She was in a hurry to get somewhere, or to get away from something.\r\n \r\nJust as she was about to bark back, Jinx was interrupted by a not-so-distant laugh. Terror overcame her. The thing she feared so much, the thing she was running from, had found her; and it was coming for her. Looking at the bulky woman in front of her, she quickly came to the conclusion that she was better off in the company of someone else, especially this heavily armoured woman branding a massive shield.\r\n \r\n&quot;It&#039;s coming. We need to leave.&quot; Jinx whispered to Leona. Knowing that neither of them were safe anymore, the two ran through the forest, not knowing when they could be ambushed by the beast. Neither of them stopped until they were sure the beasts laugh could no longer be heard.\r\n \r\nSpotting a clearing in the forest, with the sun overhead, Leona slowed her pace. &quot;We should rest here for a while, we must catch our breath.&quot;\r\n \r\nJinx agreed and made her way to a fallen log to sit down. Leona looked up through the trees, the sun was directly overhead, it was noon. This was when she was at her strongest. If the beast chose to approach now, she would be ready. She would avenge her fallen comrades.\r\n\r\n&quot;So why are you out here?&quot; Jinx interrupted Leona&#039;s thoughts.\r\n \r\n&quot;Deep in this forest lies a monster. It has committed crimes so unspeakable, and I must destroy it. I must avenge my fallen comrades.&rdquo; The venom in her voice pierced the air. Her hatred for the beast was so apparent, and Jinx knew she would stop at nothing to obliterate it. But Leona knew nothing of the beast. She had not experienced it&#039;s terrifying presence. Jinx thought she was a fool. No one could stop the monster, it was too fast, too powerful, too hungry.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;I don&#039;t think you know what you&#039;re going up against.&rdquo; Said Jinx, twirling her dirty braid around her fingers.\r\n \r\nLeona glanced at the gauntly girl. It was obvious she had encountered the beast before, but how did she survive? &quot;Have you seen it before?&quot; She asked, but was almost certain she already knew the answer.\r\n \r\n&quot;I never saw it. No one ever sees it. It&#039;s too fast.&quot; The coldness in Jinx&#039;s voice sent a shiver down Leona&#039;s spine. Could she really defeat the beast? Laying her shield down on the ground, Leona planted herself on a pile of grass. They would rest for a while, then continue their hunt.\r\n \r\nOpening her eyes after what felt like a few minutes, Leona let out a cry of fear. The sky was cloaked in the darkness of night, how long had they been asleep?\r\n \r\n&quot;Wake up!&quot; Leona hissed to her newly found companion, who was snoring ungracefully on the fallen log she had seen her last.\r\n \r\n&quot;Heh?&quot; Jinx yawned, rubbing her eyes. Realising their circumstances, she shot up. &quot;What the heck?! How did it get so dark?!&quot;\r\n \r\n&quot;We must have fallen asleep for hours. I fear we are no longer safe here, we need to move.&quot; Leona looked around her, scanning the fauna for any signs of movement.\r\n \r\nJinx stretched and reached for her guns. &quot;Man, if I hadn&#039;t have run into you, I would be out of this stupid forest by now.&quot; She begun to move towards Leona.\r\n \r\nBOOM! An explosion encompassed her. The air around her was filled with a poisonous gas.\r\n \r\n&quot;NO! It&rsquo;s here!&quot; Jinx gasped for air, falling to the ground and looking helplessly at Leona. The beasts laughter filled the air as Jinx took her final breaths. &quot;RUN! Just run. It&#039;s too strong.&quot;\r\n \r\nLeona frantically looked around. The beast was not anywhere in sight, though she could still hear its taunting laughter. Turning to run, Leona held her shield in front of her.\r\n \r\nBOOM! Another explosion, as the poisonous gas crept its way through her lungs. BOOM! Every step she took, more explosions. This was the power of the beast.\r\n \r\nAs she fell to the ground, she called to it. &quot;Show yourself!&quot;\r\n \r\nThe beasts laughter grew louder, as it stepped out from its hiding place. Such a small thing was responsible for such devastation. Leona crawled towards it.\r\n \r\nIt reached behind it and pulled out a small stick, which Leona soon realised was a weapon. Loading its weapon with a dart from its belt, the beast took one last look at Leona. It smiled a terrifying smile.\r\n \r\n&quot;Never underestimate the power of the Scout&#039;s Code.&quot; It taunted her, as it blew the dart at her already limp body.\r\n \r\nAs everything went dark and the blindness overcame her, Leona called to the sun that she would never see again, and the beasts laughter taunted her until her final breath.","replies":[{"poster":"MemoryStickGuy","date":"2016-06-26T13:28:50.349+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo conform..........it's 100% Teemo.....{{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"thisissofake","date":"2016-06-25T08:09:48.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this based off an in-game experience of yours? xD\n\nawesome story btw haha, congrats on being the first story writer to get over 10 likes","replies":[{"poster":"Seagull","date":"2016-06-25T08:28:45.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha nope actually.
