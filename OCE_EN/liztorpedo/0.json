In the mission you see Sander in Bioshock, you are to kill people and take pictures of them for his art piece, thus finding art in death like Jhin. To me, is Sander Cohen if he was placed into the world of Dishonored, the art style being very similar to me. Jhin and Dishonored gives off a  a sort of Victorian-Steampunk vibe. \r\nAnyone else think so? \r\nHere&#039;s some reference pics: http://imgur.com/a/bpLe9","replies":[{"poster":"GeoKit","date":"2016-09-30T15:08:01.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was sure i wasnt the only one realized it","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-28T03:36:39.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"corvo attano jihn skin... do it rito","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-28T01:22:47.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh dude","replies":[]}]}
