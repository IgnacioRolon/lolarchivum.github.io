It was fine until then but however, as we got in game this shaco called support but wasn&#039;t going any type of support items and he was never coordinating with the team&#039;s ping and he never really helped but chasing an enemy champion when we were in a teamfight, we would have won if shaco joined. Riot please can you get him banned or punish this guy in some sort I am just so sick and tired of so many trollers in the game. \nthis guy&#039;s name is &#039;[REMOVED - no naming and shaming]&#039;\nhe was saying nice things as well so he can&#039;t get banned even if we reported him but he was intentionally feeding.\nEveryone in our teammate seemed mad as well.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-04T01:38:06.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No name and shame, and meta conforming ISN'T a requirement","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-03T22:29:35.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I point out, that things like AP mid, bruiser top, ADC with support bot and jungler as a team composition, is not part of the rules.\n\nThat's meta, and often it is meta breaking things that win games.\n\nYou should not be able to report someone for not conforming to 'rules' that never existed in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-12-04T04:20:29.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah except riot banned someone for playing singed \"support\" with smite.\n\napparently because it's what the \"community wanted\".\n\nso according to riot's ethos, yes you can report people for anything and if the \"community\" as a whole feels the same then it becomes against the rules.\n\nedit: downvoted for facts yet again","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-03T21:28:35.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest you remove the name of the person as it is against the board rules to name and shame, further more you can send a support ticket to riot with this screenshot which is probably your best option.","replies":[]}]}
