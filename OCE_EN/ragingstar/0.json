In fact, getting a skin shard might be even bigger of a bummer if the said skin is either dirt cheap and/or badly designed, or is for a champion you never touch; meanwhile having more champions is never really a bad idea assuming you aren't an ARAM spammer or that the champion you got is within 450 or 1350 IP tier.\n\nSo in the end of the day, it all depends on the perspectives.","replies":[]}]}
