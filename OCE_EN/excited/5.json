Her current E hitbox is actually the most meth infested thing in League, and it's not bias, I love playing LB from time to time too. But I think the W nerfs are a little much, it's TOO slow now. Not only will this be really awkward for frequent LB players but it'll be too easy to land point blanc charms and other cc abilities on her in lane now. That was the whole point, if you had good enough reflexes to CC her mid dodge then it was really rewarding, seems a lot easier to do now. At the end of the say she IS an assassin and her shit is MEANT to be fast","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-03T06:44:08.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot so sh*t.\n\nWhy not buff a few underpowered Champions for a change instead of nerfing everyone to sh*t.\n\nGame will be like a game of pong soon.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-03T09:14:21.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because **Power Creep**.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-03T10:33:13.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but if they continue to nerf at the rate they are, eventually the game will be so super balanced it will come down to two Champions and which one positions slightly better in a fight then the game will snowball in that teams favour.\n\nThey're nerfing a Champ with high mobility that does so quickly so that you can attack her during her distorts or to help you dodge them when this is a key component I her kit and Champions like Yasuo etcetera dash around the field being relatively untargetable and this is a recent design.\n\nThey have no idea how to balance they're just nerfing favourite of the month Champions and leaving the ones that are actually hard to deal with - with a wide selection of Champions untouched.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-03T10:43:56.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KiStorm,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PW1zqREz,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2015-06-03T10:33:13.731+0000)\n>\n> Yeah but if they continue to nerf at the rate they are, eventually the game will be so super balanced it will come down to two Champions and which one positions slightly better in a fight then the game will snowball in that teams favour.\n> \n> They're nerfing a Champ with high mobility that does so quickly so that you can attack her during her distorts or to help you dodge them when this is a key component I her kit and Champions like Yasuo etcetera dash around the field being relatively untargetable and this is a recent design.\n> \n> They have no idea how to balance they're just nerfing favourite of the month Champions and leaving the ones that are actually hard to deal with - with a wide selection of Champions untouched.\n\nthat is a horrendous way to view things, I have to admit I don't play the game thinking like that even if I can be negative","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-03T12:06:56.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:83}}  rework is intended to be make him more viable and more fun.
