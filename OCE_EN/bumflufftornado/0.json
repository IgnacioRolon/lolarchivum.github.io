My internet connection remained stable and connected through the entire event however the game would not reconnect, and instead showed the inaccurate \"Firewall\" error. I was unable to log back in until the end of the  match.\r\n\r\nAfter logging in I got a warning from \"leavebuster\" asking me to agree to stop AFKing in games or I will be punished. This must be some kind of error with the system because if everyone gets punished by leavebuster when the servers screw up there are going to be be lots of innacurate reports.","replies":[{"poster":"da Tungsten","date":"2014-12-04T10:39:29.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had something similar happen, internet problems disconnected me from the game and i could not get back on and when i do leavebuster pops up saying i left the game and makes me agree not to leave again, i cant help it if my internet drops for long periods no one really can, i understand why its in place butthere must be some way to tell if you left the game of your own will or your internet dies","replies":[]}]}
