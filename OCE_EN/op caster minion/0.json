He has no fighting potential (No abilities that damage). His W slow is to big, make it go up per level, not duration. His R makes him go back to the first cast upon using last cast, so if 3 people are chasing you, and two people stay at where you first cast, you're screwed, make it an option to go back to first cast. I really, REALLY like the concept of the Q and E, but with the q, there is no point of it since he is squishy and would die by dragging them with him.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Caster Minion","date":"2016-01-14T01:51:16.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The r stacks decay, so he doesn't have to use the last one if he doesn't want to. Also, his gameplay would be grabbing an enemy from far away and then bringing them towards your team, so indirectly assassinating them. Also, the slow is the same amount as Zilean's slow at max rank, except the duration is a lot shorter, even at max rank. It is mainly used to stagger the opponent, rather than a generic slow. Also, his damage mainly comes from from his high base ad. Thanks for commenting though :D","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-15T05:28:36.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The E's stun is way to short, maybe buff that a little and make it do a small amount of damage :).\n\nAll the timers on everything of his (Stun, Slow and Speed Boost) are way too short.\n\nThe stun is pretty much just cancelling their next basic attack, it doesn't stun them long enough to do anything. If his E is for getting away, stun is not the way to go.\n\nThe slow is too short to be useful. Period. If you wanna keep it, probably increase it's duration, otherwise remove it.\n\n1 second of movement speed is nothing. Even if you have 3 charges, 3 seconds of 10%-30% is barely anything. Make the movement speed larger and the duration longer.","replies":[{"poster":"OP Caster Minion","date":"2016-01-23T11:39:03.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, I can't understand what you are trying to say, the English is a bit bad, but the e is used to get away mainly, not to stun.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-28T00:22:52.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking back, I read it wrong...
