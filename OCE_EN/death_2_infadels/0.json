Yes, you may have gone 14/1, but I find one of the biggest contributing factors is CS. Frankly, your CS is trash compared to what an ADC Tristana should have. \n\nOn the other hand, not many people play Mid Lane Caitlin, so there aren't many scores to compare her's with. Chances are, all the other Caitlin Mids fed their faces off and CSed poorly, so her score is S compared to those. \n\nI hope this makes sense :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"x KaceyTron x","date":"2017-09-21T13:12:01.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 death, feeder.","replies":[{"poster":"death 2 infadels","date":"2017-09-21T13:26:14.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare I","replies":[]}]}]}
