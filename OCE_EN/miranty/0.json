I was gonna use the icons that came with the skin, but when i went to use the icons they were MIA. I relogged several times, just incase it was kinda like a server error thingy, but it wasnt, the icons and banners were still MIA. Is there anyway i could get them or is it gg?","replies":[{"poster":"Vent","date":"2015-09-07T13:12:33.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only get banner and icons as a bundle if you *BUY* it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-10T23:59:55.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be that the skin was only programmed to give you the icons if you purchased the skin yourself. Since you were mystery gifted it, it may not have gotten you them.\n\nIf you really want them, then I suggest you make a support ticket about it. It'd be the only way you'd get it fixed.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
