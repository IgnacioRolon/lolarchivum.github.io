So, if set to normal priority it would net the same result, but just take way longer.\n\nThanks for the explanation; I just like to know what I'm doing exactly before I do it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zeryth","date":"2015-02-12T06:06:12.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No idea why but this fixed it by\nstep 1: downloading [http://www.mediafire.com/download/19i8fnbu2va56xt/S_OK.rar ](http://www.mediafire.com/download/19i8fnbu2va56xt/S_OK.rar )\nstep 2: going to C:\\Games\\League of Legends\\RADS and deleting both the downloads and solutions folders(IMPORTANT if you do not delete them you might get stuck in a loop)\nstep 3: extracting the S_OK.rar into the latest folder in C:\\Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.129 it is now 0.0.1.129 I think it was 0.0.1.126 or something\n\nNo idea why it works but it works for every single patch that keeps failiing, you just have to copy and paste it every time into the new folder","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-02-11T20:55:24.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Unrealz,\n\nThanks for posting a potential fix to this issue.\n\nIf any other players experience it please try this out but it would be great to know how many players are affected.","replies":[{"poster":"Fade","date":"2015-02-11T21:08:31.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it normal to have like 3 identical LoLPatcherUx.exe*32's going at the same time? \n\nCurrently have 5 LoL Related processes all set on high with 6,000 files scanned.\n\nWill update if it works :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-11T23:40:58.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legit I think it's normal.
