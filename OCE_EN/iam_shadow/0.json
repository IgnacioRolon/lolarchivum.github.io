I&#039;ve never been one to hate a champions as theres many ways to outplay everyone BUT Tryndamere is really getting to me. The dudes on edge start-mid game but boy o boy level 18. If you don&#039;t have defense he can basically kill you with his ult while under a turrent almost every attempt. I say this because come on, until you reach Ranked game you are on your own, the tipical LoL Player wont make team plays unless it benifets them. If you could just nerf the amount of life steal his ult posses ignoring the fact he cant die for a few seconds, thatd be great.

But there's plenty of ways to counter Tryndamere if you see him in Draft Pick:\n\n1. {{champion:10}}  Kayle basically shits on this guy. The top lane match up might not be great ATM, but if you can pick into him from jungle or support then you can greatly reduce his effectiveness. Your ult is a better version of his, you have peel, heals and longer range as well.\n\n2. Nautilus {{champion:111}} You're tanky but can provide Janna level peel on single melee targets, sounds perfect for a bit of a Tryndamere counter.\n\n3. Any of the following {{champion:24}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:80}} and this guy I guess too {{champion:17}} \n\n4. Get to lane early and try to fight him. Before he gets rage he's actually quite bad, if you can zone him right from the start you can keep him behind until the first back.","replies":[{"poster":"IAM Shadow","date":"2015-11-20T00:16:55.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Telecasterdude this really helps alot. Funny that I've never used these champions actually. I tried to rebel by getting all the 450 champs to master, not the greatest idea aye lol. I'll be sure to buy Kayle and learn how she works to counter Tryndamere.

Yeah I'm only Lv.18, still got a long ways to go. Thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
