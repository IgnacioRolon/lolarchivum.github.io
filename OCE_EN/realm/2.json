People wouldn't just use it when someone is trolling, they'd start using it if they get to many mid mains or jungle mains or whatever on the same team and it'd end up taking forever to actually get into a game. Wouldn't be worth it imo, its not that often you get trolls, and you hardly lose anything for dodging the occasional game if you have to.\n\nIt'd make people way more likely to pick something troll if they dont get what they want as well, since they know their team will almost certainly just dodge","replies":[]}]}
