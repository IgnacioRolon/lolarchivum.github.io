And, considering they&#039;re now on seperate teams, and apparantly have confusions about their relationship together, I reckon it would be great to reunite the two in ALL STARS. This would be amazing... please up vote this if you agree.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-05T14:48:58.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reunite them for allstars? no, that would be awkward af","replies":[{"poster":"Celciyuki","date":"2015-11-14T22:17:45.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Poor them because it looks like it could happen.
