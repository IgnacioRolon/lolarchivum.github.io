SUPPORT PROBLEM","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"**SUPPORT SHOULD BE MORE FUN.**\r\n\r\nThe supports I play such as {{champion:25}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} etc, are all boring...  I mean, I can understand in high elo support being fun considering the fact that you need to carry your adc early etc, but when you have an incompetent adc, and your team starts to go downhill you just start to feel useless. Support needs to have a bit more of an effect in the game, I cant just stand around making good engages when my team does no damage to follow it up... please, find some way to spice support up a bit, possibly a damage support item, or a different summoner purely for supports where you get twice the gold or something for a kill if you use it on the targeted champion - just an idea that im making up at the moment on the spot, but something along those lines would be nice... more of a way to impact the game, such as a roaming/ganking item for supports - idk, might be a good idea - might be too op - but honestly, in lower elos (like the elo im in) people rage over getting last pick and having to support - they even literally just afk if they get support because it is such a boring role to play - everyone wants to carry. Anyway - thanks for reading :) - PvPRealm","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-26T04:09:58.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is fine as it is. Even in the lower elos you end up carrying your ADC through the early game (and the rest of the game). The supports you listed aren't boring, they are super fun (especially Morgana). If you think the support role is boring then you should probably look at what you could do to make it more fun, e.g: play off meta supports like Syndra and Orianna and end up carrying the game. Or play relevant meta supports with high levels of damage such as Morgana and Karma and still end up carrying your team. \n\n*(Granted, as a support you should itemise to cover the weaknesses of your team but you don't have to sacrifice every single item slot for this)\n*\n\nPeople who AFK in troll in games after being made to play support are annoying and stupid not to realise the potential for supports to have in the game.","replies":[]}]}
