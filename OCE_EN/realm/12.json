Please do something to change this skin, the blade looks completely stupid, the jagged edges around the blade look particularly bad; so does her outfit, it may as well have been a purple Chroma pack... cmon.... \r\n\r\nPlease change this skin before release, nobody is a fan of it. For the people that grinded to Gold+ in the last moments towards the end of season, they&#039;re disappointed. Please... **change. **\r\n\r\n**Up vote** this if you agree that Riot should change this skin, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Nao Tomori","date":"2015-11-01T13:22:28.131+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I was really hyped when riot announced victorious sivir (even though I'm only silver, lol), I really like the purple and gold theme to the more recent victorious skins (Elise and Morgana) and I was really excited to see what riot could do with this colour scheme. When it was finally previewed, I was left feeling a bit disappointed, don't get me wrong I'm not complaining about how riot should \"be making cooler more high quality skins for victorious skins\" but I do feel like the colour scheme and design of her boomerang blade and some other minor features could have been done better. But that's just my opinion. So think what you want of it, I'm just somewhat disappointed (hopefully we can see some changes before it come out :D)","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-11-01T13:51:23.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly the point I'm trying to make, thankyou.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-11-02T23:26:44.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only sivir skin i will never get ðŸ˜¢","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-01T11:55:13.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"MFW people complain about free things.

The like and dislike bar isn't solely representative of peoples opinions on the skin, it could be the video format, the quality, the length, the thoroughness of the spotlight; who knows? My point I was trying to make was is that if you have a look at the other champion skin spotlights made by that same YouTube channel, you can see that approximately 95% + people constantly like the videos, and the videos are always made the same way, with the same format. Because of this, when the dislikes all of a sudden reach approximately 45% of the total likes/dislikes, then what's changed? The skin, the skin is the only thing that has changed. Using this video as a justification method is reasonable considering the circumstances. Also, if you take a quick glance at the poll you may be also able to see the community tending to agree with my opinion.

It's a reward, you don't complain about free things! That's a basic rule about receiving things, you do not complain! Riot isn't going to put much work into a skin they give out, what the hell do you think they are? A charity case? Even if you put in work to get the skin, you still get the damn skin! This community is so garbage if you're going to complain about climbing to Gold and getting  a bad skin in return, wtf lmao, flawed as hell logic.","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-11-01T12:10:12.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then again, it's the skin to celebrate the end of a FUCKING SEASON?
