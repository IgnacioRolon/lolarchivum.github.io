Looking at your most recent match history you have significantly poor KDA's and poor CS score. Whilst you can always argue your KDA's are a result of your team, every death you have is ultimately your fault. Regardless of the contribution of your team. Most deaths are a result of poor positioning rather than a lack of team support. Whilst your team can still contribute to your death it still mostly comes down to you. Poor positioning can be from an underestimation of what the enemy team can do to you and a lack of understanding the enemy. This includes lack of vision and a lack of understanding in terms of damage difference which leads to fight initiations (you choose to fight thinking you can win but the odds are stacked against you). You place very little wards outside of your trinket. You place close to 0 pinks. Try working on increasing your warding abilities and ward efficiently. By efficiently I mean ward around you. Warding efficiently in your immediate surroundings will allow you to determine correct courses of action and plays. Whether you should push out a lane, whether you can roam etc. Work on your CS. Your CS is very lacking. Especially since you tend to play carry roles. Whilst you may be thinking of going for kills over cs. Remember. CS is a constant flow whilst kills come down to opportunities to be presented to you. It's like choosing to work for 30 years or waiting for X amount of time to win the lottery for the same amount of money. I would personally choose to have the constant flow of income. Last but not least I would work on your itemization.\n\nHope this helps,\n- Crown","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-09T01:22:30.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!

If you're having such a hard time improving it's most likely because you're doing poorly at less obvious aspects of the game like where to be on the map, when to be with your team, when to fight for or give up towers/dragons/barons, where to ward, attitude towards teammates etc.\n\nI'd suggest changing to more simple champions as well. Sure you can make big plays and 1v5 with stuff like vayne and lee if you're a challenger player, but lets face it, if you're still silver 5 after that many games you're probably not a god at them. You don't need to make big plays to stomp in silver, play something with simple mechanics so you can focus more on map awareness and taking advantage of enemy mistakes (which are abundant in silver), and where you can't have your good decisions messed up by mechanical mistakes, and you'll probably see alot of improvement  (And the only really simple champ on your most played, Jinx, has a much better winrate and KDA than the others, which should be kinda proof of this). \n\nAnd try to die less, you can't carry while you're dead, especially if your teams doing badly. Trading one for one when you're the fed one on your team isn't worth and suiciding at an undefendable tower or because your teammate got caught will just make the situation worse.\n\nThat's my 2c anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-08T16:43:24.728+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is you're not learning when you're playing, you're playing for the sake of playing, you need to actually take notes in your head of what you're doing that's wrong and what you need to do to change that, it also helps to watch better players, for example i watch Dekar173 and that's how i learnt everything i know about Rengar.\n\nI'd say watch a streamer that plays the champs you play, make sure he's good too not some plat scrub, challenger/master minimum, watch what they're doing and learn, ask questions in chat if you have any, you need to actually put effort into learning because spamming games expecting to climb is never ever going to work if you aren't learning as you play.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-09T01:16:23.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unseen Predator,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=i8GTr0pn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-08T16:43:24.728+0000)\n>\n> I'd say watch a streamer that plays the champs you play, make sure he's good too not some plat scrub, challenger/master minimum,\n\nGotta keep those high standards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-10-09T01:25:01.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou everyone for leaving your comments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-09T01:12:43.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a movie by Sky Williams it's for bronze but silver is kinda like bronze https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b52kZtDunBs\n\nP.S. in my opinion (Yes I know this makes me say I'm bad, but reality is I'm bad.
