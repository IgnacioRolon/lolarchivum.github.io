He takes the dmg as a shield then regens 20% (Or less) of the dmg, he still takes the dmg. if it was 300 dmg it would be by fountain laser not a kat or anything like her","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-24T10:55:32.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what...\n\nHis E active means the he turns the damage he has taken into a Shield and can tank it again...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SexP3ke","date":"2015-06-24T05:59:46.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah his an amazing design, because supports weren't cancerous enough, They didn't protect their adc's enough. I cant even kill a braindead carry anymore due to champs like morgana, thresh or Leona. Protection fucking overload.

Will depend how much spitting an minion does as to whether he will be a good laner or not. Seems like an ok support, will probably end up being a tank jungler.\n\nPeople saying he will be good in team fights since he can eat the adc or someone for 2 secs, but he has to get 3 stacks on them first, so we'll see if he even gets to eat an enemy at all during a teamfight.\nMost likely, eat someone like Alistar or Morgana, Righteous Glory into the enemy and spit them out.\n\nHe can Reksai Ult half the map with a teammate too.
