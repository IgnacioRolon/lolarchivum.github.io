If you're 100% sure they could not be interpretted in any sort of negative fashion, then it could be that your account has been compromised and that someone else is posting on your behalf.\n\nIf this happens again, submit a support ticket and inquire why.","replies":[{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-05-11T17:49:43.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do I submit a support ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-12T06:51:27.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a link immediately to the left of this message, but I'll also provide it here:\n\nhttps://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new\n\nAsk them why you've been punished, if you truly don't know why, and maybe tell them that you think your account has been compromised.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-05-07T11:05:49.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happened AGAIN?
