His name is Minato Sensei, he changed his name from timmsy13. Whenever I mouse over his name in my friends list it shows the character he is playing, the game mode he is playing, but not how long he has been in game for. Whenever I scroll over any of my other friends names however, it displays it perfectly, but just never seems to for my friend. I then asked a few of my other friends who were also friends with Minato Sensei, and they said they too could not see the timer for how long he had been in game. I then asked Minato Sensei if it was a setting he had changed or something, he said he didnt know whats wrong with it, but apparantly it&#039;s been happening to him for ages, he&#039;s tried to search for a solution, but to no prevail. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T10:52:15.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is he in a different time-zone to you?
