If you consistently cannot make the scrims without a valid reason, you will be cut. This however can be given leniency.\n \nRequirements:\n - Your elo DOESN&#039;T matter\n - You need to have played League for at least a year, this is so any rough or newer players won&#039;t need to learn the game while playing seriously.\n - You need to have skype\n\nConsidering, of course, people DO have lives, and therefore sometimes cannot make it to the designated time slot in which was arranged to play, there will be open slots for substitution.\n\nThe roles that are currently open are:\n - Top\n - Jungler\n - ADC\n - Support\n - Substitution (you can play a variety of roles and are willing to)\n\nI intend to take the role of MID. We do need substitutions as apart of this team, as not everyone I suspect will be able to play in the designated time every week. The substitutes will be able to play with us an equal amount, if online.\n\nThe application is below:\n\nIGN: \nDesired role:\nSubstitution roles if applicable (in order of preference):\nDo you have skype?:\nHave you played for at least a year?:\nAge:\nHow long have you played League for?:\nBio:\n\nOnce you&#039;re done applying, add me on league. \nIGN: PvPRealm\n\nThanks for applying to be apart of this ranked team!
