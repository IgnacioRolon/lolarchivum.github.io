OCE has enough players to make Dominion still a relatively short queue time\r\n2. There would be plenty of people playing it, because who doesn&#039;t like capture the flag once in a while?\r\n\r\nDominion should become a gamemode like that of Twisted Treeline in the sense that it is up every so often, because otherwise it would be stomped by normals/ranked as a standardised gamemode. Making Dominion a period based gamemode would increase gameplay, and would also enable a wider audience to enjoy League of Legends as a game as a whole. \r\n\r\nPlease make Dominion an actual gamemode in OCE\r\n\r\nComment what you guys think, and also Vote in which position you stand.","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2015-07-26T07:01:09.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NEVER FORGET!!!\n {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-27T12:04:47.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cry everytime","replies":[]}]}]}
