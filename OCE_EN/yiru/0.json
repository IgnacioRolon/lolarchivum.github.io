For now, if you'd like to play on the OCE servers, you'll have to level up a new account. Sorry; I know that's not the answer you're looking for. If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Yiru","date":"2015-12-10T14:05:57.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know, dont worry, i know that they dont have that transfer, but i rmb we have that before lol :\"( but that time im not come here yet, but now im looking for it, so i hope we have it again then i can have that convenience :( btwe, thks for that, help me a lot man hahaha","replies":[]}]}]}
