This new notification would be &quot;Insta-Kill&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis notification will only occur when a player&#039;s champion eliminates an opposing champion **within one second** and when the (soon to be eliminated) **targeted champion has over 85% or 90% of their health**. It will be *delivered similar to the way the announcer delivers &quot;Double Kills&quot; and &quot;Triple Kills&quot;*. \r\n\r\nI think this would positively affect gameplay because players who are far ahead will gain greater satisfaction in delivering their large amounts of damage. Those who are behind and somehow &quot;delete&quot; an opposing champion would give them better satisfaction as well.\r\n____\r\n\r\nIs Riot considering multiple announcer voices?\r\nA good example is that of Dota 2. They not only have announcers voices of the heroes/champions that they have, but they also feature announcers with voices from different games, such as Bastion (my favourite). These voice characters would have differing personalities shown by their different language and voice-pitch use.","replies":[]}
