I was last pick, a Thresh locked 3rd pick. It was me (5th) and 4th pick. I wait for the 4th player to tell me where he/she is going and then she/he picks Zed into a top lane at 3 second before I had to pick my champion. Drastically trying to find an ADC within the 2 second window before I accidentally dodge the match. \r\nDoes everyone just block everyone else from chat other than their ranked partners? Does anyone know how to fucking use chat, Jesus!\r\nYou literally can&#039;t SoloQ ranked with this shit! Trying **really hard** to be *communicative and friendly* but no one responds and tells you that you suck at your role when you already told them what role you are best at! A support that keeps going aggressive in lane when the match up heavily disadvantages me on damage early. I try to CS but the support keeps stirring up trouble.","replies":[{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2015-07-10T01:05:55.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always assume that if 4th pick don't lock in quickly, then they are giving you the time to pick first.\n\nSo pick first. :D\n\nIf they aren't, they'll certainly let you know!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-07-09T15:21:02.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just lock who you want in those situations, fuck em","replies":[]}]}
