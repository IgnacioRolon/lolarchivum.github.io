What I think at the moment of Wukong's E is that it could should be more unpredictable. At the moment when you cast his Nimbus strike Wukong will dash forward to a target dealing damage upon impact while two other images of wukong does the same thing to the two nearest enemies near the prime target . To decrease Nimbus Strike's predictability, (what I think) Wukong's E should do is that when you cast it instead of the two other images targeting the nearest enemies near the prime target. The two other images of wukong should dash to the nearest enemies from the wukong current position (that is prior to casting the dash). So instead of the Wukongs being tightly packed together, you would be able to juke better when there are enemies behind and in front of you. \r\n\r\nFor example, you are being 'ganked' by an enemy champion/minion from behind, while chasing your initial (enemy) target. When you dash to your initial target, (provided that the enemy ganker is also within the range of your Nimbus strike), the other image of wukong would dash to the jungler/ganker while both wukongs would deal similar damage. This would be really cool for escaping were your enemies would be confused for a split second, which way wukong attacked.\r\n\r\nNow, I think this would be better because juking would be a bit more complex with Wukong. At the moment he only has his W as his prime escape/juke ability and being in the middle of a fairly dispersed enemy team it would be better that his current Nimbus strike. Seeing as his main role is to be in the middle of the intense teamfights. It would be possible to make people uselessly burn different abillities like flash in the fear that they could be the one being targeted for wuk's knock-up.\r\n\r\nI know that there is a great advantage to wukong's current E that is not present in my version. I know for one that the fake dashing-decoys can hit targets farther away than the real wukong can with his maximum cast range. like dashing to a nearby target in the hopes that the champion you want to kill near that prime target will get killed by your own images. Situations, like these, that make me wish I had Wukong's Nimbus Strike, really doesn't happen that often though.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-16T10:02:52.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He already has somewhat complex juking if you can manage to play with his clones, any more than that I am afraid it will be either borderline or straight up OP.\n\nTrue, it can be a cool thing to have, but consider the game as a whole and taking other champs into consideration, imo No.\n\nI don't want a second {{champion:64}} , whose mobility is toxic to the game's health by design. If you make mistakes then you take consequences, simple as that.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2014-12-16T10:07:10.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't really be OP though, because the 'E' clones would last, not even a second. This is just to expand the idea of clones with Wukong. I don't think anyone pays attention to the other 'E' clones and I think it should be more emphasised.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-16T10:15:22.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Wukong has that much emphasis on his clones when they designed his kit.\n\nThe original Wukong in the mythology had the ability to clone indefinitely, being a staff and martial art master and able to transform into various objects and animals.\n\nDota seems to have the idea around cloning on Lancer, Smite has that around transformations, I guess LoL's is more about his staff mastery.\n\nThat's just they way I see it though.\n\nHe already has decent defense, real nice aoe cc, damage and chase, with the ability to juke on the side. And the juke potential isn't even bad it's ok. I don't think he in the current stage of the game, needs more in that category because imo that really would make him a second or a lesser Lee Sin which I really don't want.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2014-12-16T10:25:01.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't quite see the similarity. Lee Sin has in built sustain, a shield, seven abilities, an AoE slow and an AoE knock-up. Other than his ult {{champion:64}} isn't really similar.\n\nIf you mean, the juking potential, I still wouldn't agree IMO. Lee Sin doesn't have a clone which means attention is always on Lee Sin himself. \n{{champion:7}}  or  {{champion:35}} would be a better comparison, seeing as both can go invisible and both have a targettable clone. They would still be more effective jukers than {{champion:62}} in any case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
