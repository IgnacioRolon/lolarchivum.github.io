His Ultimate ghost and Parallel Convergence Ghost. Now, if you replace the techno-ghosts with Zed&#039;s Shadows you get a really cool looking skin. He can sport a bandana like his current Shurima skin but also have more armor  and his weapons be sharp on the edges but blunt on the tip like he has now. \r\nHis Q would be a red orb surrounded by black mist.\r\nHis Dash and Blink would have shadow effects.\r\n\r\nThe only problem that I can see with this skin is that {{champion:245}} will actually end up cooler than {{champion:238}} himself.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-06-02T06:53:16.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko's skin has nothing to do with shurima, its a prince of persia skin, the same as katarina's (which came out long before Azir and the while shurima buzz)\n\nbut this skin sounds soooo amazing ","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-10T18:11:07.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Come on Riot, You got to do dis!\n\n#JUST.

Also, to make it fair, they could give Zed a sort of Ekko-themed skin. I mean, Zed's classic skin is amazing, and so is Shockblade, but the only other skin he has is SKT. That's not a super popular one, and plenty of people play Zed and it looks like Ekko will be really popular. Why not get a ton of money by making skins for both of them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrewd","date":"2015-06-02T05:36:13.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be amazing. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-02T04:31:44.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes because Ekko from the past and Ekko from another dimension are ghosts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-11T00:15:41.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"#No. Just.
