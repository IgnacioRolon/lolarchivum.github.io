This means that some of his body would be flowing and shifting from time to time similar to Lissandra's movement animation of her legs; imagine Default Zac's idle animations where he flexes his body but this time he's made of shifting True Ice. The head will be largely static during idle and movement but not for abilities. \r\nThe eye sockets will be hollow, glowing light blue similar to the colour of Default (Skin) {{champion:34}}. He would still have his \"hairstyle\" but it would taper from the base of his brow to a sharp tip and maybe veer off to the back. It would be idle during movement and idle.\r\nHis idle animations will still have him flexing his mass.\r\nHis movement animations will have tiny minuscule shards of True Ice falling mainly from his leg or feet.\r\nHis voice could be reverberated or echoed like Lissandra's.\r\n\r\n____\r\n\r\n* Passive:\r\nShards of True Ice fall and pierce the ground. These shards will always be trembling and shaking; full of energy; seemingly unstable.\r\nDuring his revival animation, the shards shakily and tremblingly merge to the main body which would be a spiky trembling mass of True Ice, similar to Lissandra's ultimate except more sporadic and having more sharp spikes.\r\n\r\n* Q:\r\nHis arms become gigantic sharp but thick lances that stab enemies. It could also gradually brighten slightly from his body to its tip.\r\n\r\n* W:\r\nHis mass explodes sending minuscule shards of True Ice around him.\r\n\r\n* E:\r\nHis body generates extra mass of True Ice elongating his body similar to his current animation. Upon launching his shoulders and upper body visually become very rugged, stony, full of small protruding spikes. \r\n\r\n* R:\r\nThe True Ice releases its compressed and unstable form becoming a leaping sphere of shattering and bursting lances of Ice.\r\n\r\nHis whole nature would be unstable, shaky and kind of magnetic. Note: This is simply a basic conceptual and probably unfinished idea that might not cover all aspects of Zac. Feel free to judge and put forth your own ideas.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-04-07T10:01:50.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How he grows with health.\nCould make it how he starts off with nothing as like a bright blue colour maybe like 5-6 ice around his body, Then when he's gets like over 1500 he could get like 15 then more and more depending on how much health he has becoming this massive thing with heaps of spikes looking tough and hard to beat (because he's so god dam tanky!!)  :/ might not be good just an idea that i think would make it cooler","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-07T09:19:59.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meddler pls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-19T14:28:51.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, come to think of it.\nA Zac made out of shit would be interesting...","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-21T00:52:01.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A ZAC MADE OF CHOCOLATE YAY MAKE {{champion:432}} MORE OBESE NOT SAYING HE NOT OBESE ENOUGH THO {{champion:432}} WILL DIE COS HE ATE A MOUTHFUL OF BARON SHIT AND ALSO {{champion:432}}  IS FAT","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T14:55:59.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
