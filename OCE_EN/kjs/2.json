{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-01T16:17:15.769+0000","title":"Quinn is really ******* strong","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:133}} \n\n\nGo into matchmaking, call Top. If top isn&#039;t available go ADC because it doesn&#039;t even matter either lane. Take {{summoner:4}} and {{summoner:12}}. It works for ADC as well. You will lose a bit of lane phase strength by not taking {{summoner:7}} as ADC but it doesn&#039;t matter once mid game hits. If you really want to, you can get Heal but you will lose out a lot on Global presence when not taking teleport. I don&#039;t think {{summoner:7}} with {{summoner:12}} is safe enough for lane phase and teamfights though.\n\nMost effective when jungler/top and support are decent tanks who can prolong and/sustain fights for your whole team.\n____\nBuild closely the same items at both lanes with\n{{item:3142}} first if top lane. \n{{item:3031}} first if ADC.\n{{item:3072}} for mid or late game.\n{{item:3153}} if they have multiple tanks or one really annoying top laner you&#039;re laning against.\n{{item:3270}} coupled with {{item:3142}} active will get you anywhere in the map in a split second. \nYou can opt for {{item:3071}} if you want more durability. This will probably be a must if none of your team mates are decent tanks that can sustain team fights. Black Cleaver isn&#039;t the best at times because **you are going to be an Assassin in ADC&#039;s clothing.** The total 30% CDR does help with more Valor forms though.\n{{item:3087}} if available to increase splitpushing.\nI&#039;ve yet to build {{item:3085}}, but it doesn&#039;t provide raw AD for assassinations. \n____\n\nYour passive proc is pretty much 70% of your damage when you don&#039;t have sufficient crit.\nAll Quinns know the basic combo of letting the passive proc by itself, AA then Vault to manually proc the passive again. You can fit the Q blind before or after depending if the blind will really affect them, if they&#039;re running away or fighting back. \nYour W is there so that you don&#039;t facecheck brushes. It lets you reveal monsters in the jungle to escape to with E and lets you see any hidden junglers in or incoming your lane. \n____\nWhat you do is you splitpush when everyone else is dancing around on the brink of a teamfight. The Homeguards from {{item:3270}}  plus {{summoner:12}} will let you take down objectives (open inhibitors, low health towers and soloing dragon) with lighting speed. You destroy towers with your high crit high AD build; with the attack speed steroid from {{item:3142}} and Valor Form. Whilst the enemy team&#039;s tanks are busy with teamfights you can destroy their towers and solo dragon once you have {{item:3142}} and {{item:3072}}. You run away with {{item:3142}} active if you didn&#039;t use it already and/or with Valor Form. As a bonus you have {{item:3270}}  for being slippery, most champions won&#039;t be able to catch you without CC. They will just give up. \n\nEven if your team lost the teamfight, most champions won&#039;t have the mobility to collapse onto you whilst you splitpush. {{champion:77}} probably could. Usually when my team loses a teamfight I&#039;d already got one inner turret or inhibitor turret. After destroying the objective you can teleport to another lane after you&#039;re sure they are all going to the lane you left and push that one as well or most likely recall to base to teleport to other side of the map with homeguards. They will be very busy hunting you down and pushing their turrets. As long as you get a tower or make a strategic opening for your team by making the enemy team busy (or delete the ADC whilst half-healthing the other carry), it doesn&#039;t matter if you die in most cases. \n\nDuring Teamfights, you target their ADC/Yasuo. or if their AP carry is squishy enough you delete them. Any champion that relies on basic attacks or basic attack abilities, like Yasuo, you will most likely destroy in a 1v1 because of your Q blind. The only thing you have to worry about is in bating out any CC from their teammates, which your tanks should be able to partially deal with.\n\nOnce you see an opening you use Valor Form, strike with Vault then Q to stop them from dealing AA dmg for a couple of seconds. These couple of seconds are crucial to getting them low enough for you to execute them with Skystrike (second ultimate use). \nQuinn does \"clean-up\" duty really well as well. I&#039;ve had many double kills with just Skystrike alone. \nIt&#039;s best to get as many people affected with your blind around the enemy ADC or Yasuo. Time it well. If you have an {{champion:61}} Ult, then even better.\n\nNotable counters are heavy CC and champions who have them; as well as APC who don&#039;t need Basic Attacks to kill you. Another {{champion:133}}  or a {{champion:17}} can destroy your burst completely with their blinds. \n\nMake sure you take {{item:3362}} {{item:2043}} to teleport back to the enemy lane for further splitpushing and to catch any Rengars or Vaynes who try to delete you. The unlimited duration of Vision Wards lets you know that you don&#039;t need to stress about using it ASAP.\n\nEdit: Barely saw the Captain Boot Enchantment mistake. Using f.lux automatically colour blinds me from a mix of colours.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-02T06:07:24.917+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, what the fuck!

Win rate is not the most accurate way to tell how good someone is with a champion. 50% win rate is good because that is where I should be at if I'm not improving or deteriorating. \nI rather look at CS, Objective participation and K/D/A, seeing if I can improve on all of these things.","replies":[{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-06-03T09:18:49.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bubgu2En,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-06-03T09:04:11.610+0000)\nI feel that Ranked and Normals have completely separate matchmaking records.
