Health increases its heal whilst AD scales its damage very well. It deals physical damage. \r\n\r\n&bull;Every Shield Ability scales with AP and Health. \r\n\r\n&bull; Duration of taunts scales with AP. Duration of taunts heavily anti-scale with AD, to avoid utility Assassin Shen. e.g. Duration of taunt +0.2 seconds per 20 AP with -0.3 seconds per 40 AD.\r\n&bull; This taunt is incorporated into a dash ability (like live Shen). However, said dash ability also scales with AD relatively okay-ish e.g. 55% or 45% AD. So there is a trade off. You can&#039;t have both an epic taunt and epic damage into one ability. The damage of this dash ability is now physical.\r\n\r\n&bull;The (or a) Main damaging ability both scale with AD and AP but AD scales far harder than AP, in terms of damage, to avoid OPness. \r\n\r\n&bull;Ultimate is reworked into a large AoE ground targeted shield than can protect an entire team (including yourself) with a similar functioning teleport. Base shield is low but scales very well with AP. In addition it can deal physical damage in a smaller AoE that scales semi-shittily with AD for a bump of extra damage. \r\n\r\n&bull;All abilities must look fucking cool and thematic to a ~~ninja~~ Shen. \r\n\r\n____\r\nSummary: Shen has two pathways. AD = Single target Assassin| AP = Tank/Shield/Taunt Utility\r\nIt must be designed so that going hybrid won&#039;t work (as effectively). AD is where most of the damage is at whilst AP is where the tankiness and utility is at. \r\n\r\n{{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-27T10:52:15.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no get lost.
