It is a very minor annoyance, but something that would improve the game flow of creating masteries. \nWhat I mean is that there is no way to swap mastery pages between two spots i.e. swapping Mastery Page #1 with the position of Mastery Page #8. It is a simple organisation improvement for the players so that when a player must change from a Jarvan IV Top Lane set-up to a Jarvan IV Jungle set-up (for various reasons) it would easier to locate them with previous organising of mastery pages into groups by the players. \nA good idea might be to enable the \"For this champion(s) only\" feature with Mastery Pages to reduce visual \"noise\" similar to the Item Pages present.\nI feel that this would smooth out the interface and overall the pre-game experience.\n\nIf I somehow missed this type of feature please let me know. Thanks for your time.\n\nP.S. Same feature for Rune Pages (but not as important).","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-27T01:53:58.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not saying its a bad idea though, maybe if you attached the things to the champion instead of the other way around.\n\nexample: \njarvan > item sets\n           > runes\n           > masteries\n\nnot really;\nfinish your masteries+ finish your item set+ finish your runes + change it if you need to swap champs\n\nI hope that makes sense","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-27T01:52:22.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they would need to change the layout of the mastery page if they were to make it champion specific and I can't really see it fitting in well with the perk tree style.","replies":[]}]}
