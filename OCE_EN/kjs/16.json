Honest Question.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Why don&#039;t you promote and place Teambuilder as the prime queue for playing League of Legends?**\n\nHave it as a part of tutorial or those pop up tips saying that Teambuilder allows you more freedom. \nReplace the order of game modes when creating a lobby so that Teambuilder is at the top, not Blind Pick. \nMove the free IP bonus to Teambuilder only to bring more people into it. \n\nI feel as though there is not enough emphasis on Trambuilder in the client UI. Seeing as how Teambuilder is superior to Blind Pick.\n\nTL;DR: Discorage Blind Pick use and promote Teambuilder.
