One of the most mobile champions there is; his W may not be his most potent ability but you can leave the shrines at key points (tower, or outside of teamfights) to give allies a safety net. Plus, it boosts their movement speed, can allow for some clutch escapes. His ult is unique because there are so many ways you can use it either offensively or defensively (I once ulted their support, allowing my lane partner to nuke their adc without being interrupted). His chimes are great for poke/slows, and his Q has the potential to stun both of your lane opponents as a follow-up.\n\nI'm not active on the forums so I'm unaware of the alleged complaints, I just find he's a pretty damn unique and fun support to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-29T12:15:08.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-04-30T06:02:50.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jb3navides,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Ew4EbTs7,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-04-29T12:15:08.444+0000)\n>\n> Make it teleport them to a random place in the map.\n\nUnder your fountain","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-29T04:30:03.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2015-04-28T23:39:06.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good idea!","replies":[]}]}
