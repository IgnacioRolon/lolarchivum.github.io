His right hand is used to cast spells and create plasmic energy projectiles for his basic attacks. It normally has a purple colour but switches to yellow for his empowered auto-attacks. \n\nI did not draw nor do I own the photo in the link provided. It should be used as an approximation of my character&#039;s gear and age. The concept art is by **Hercool.** \n\n**Background**\nBorn as Erlonus Spiritmight, Erl was a boy from the wealthy noble-class family of the House Spiritmight in what is now known as Demacia. \nErl was a promising swordsman and battle-mage. He surpassed his peers in all studies of magic, history, penmanship, politics and swordplay; training with seasoned mages and veteran swordsmen. As a young man, ladies fell in love at the sight of his grace in spells and swordplay. Erl often combined his magic and swordplay into dazzling dances - blinding assortments of colours with speed, precision and grace, matching *even* the duelists of the House Laurent. Crowds would cheer and noble-women sought after his hand in marriage. \n\nAn expedition, forwarded by King Jarvan Lightshield the *First*, the Exemplar of Demacia, in which ten of Demacia&#039;s greatest combatants would travel together in search of battles against the mightiest of creatures of Runeterra lured Erl, believing that this is his chance to test his skill in magic and sword in  combat against the supernatural. To prove his worthy to his House and beyond. \nFarewelled with the most deafening barrage of applauses and celebrations; praised and gifted charms and trinkets of all sorts, Erl began his journey.\n\nWading through the mud and smells of the marshes, venturing through the scorching heat of the Shuriman desert, Erl trekked through freezing, burning and the most humid of climates suffering through the discomfort of all known and unknown ailments. His comrades slept and pushed through much the same as he. Until one night the nine woke up to find no sign of their tenth.\n*Erl. *\n\nErl woke up to the strangest lights and smells of the home of the Fae, the enchanted place of the Glade. The rugged texture of dirt, mud and sand were replaced with the soft warmth of red, green, purple, yellow grasses that seemed to embrace him, catching his every footstep and healing his very body. There the strict properties of the world of size, shape and colour seemed to change as frequently as he breathed. There *everything* sustained him. He needn&#039;t food, water nor breath. The mere presence of *anything* siphoned strength and vigour unto him. There was no day nor night, Erl never felt the unpleasant feeling of tiredness nor unhappiness.\n\nStone monkeys with one eye across their rugged faces, squirrels with two noses nibbling on nuts, wolves with three heads barking, rabbits with four sets of ears along their fluffy backs, every tiger had five stripes etched on their back, birds with six wings arpeggiated along their sides, fishes with seven fins, toads large enough to eat eight bunnies in one gulp, foxes with nine tails speeding through the forest, and wildcats with ten legs either ignored him or followed him. His magic, speed and strength were  amplified. \nHis very being, enhanced. \nErl marvelled at his skill in pyromancy, cryomancy, and his control of light. Light was something he could *actually* *feel* and *hear* as well as see, he created all wondrous works that you simply could not *begin* to understand. \n_\nFor what felt like only a moment later, Erl remembered his nine companions and the quest he was to follow. Believing that he had now surpassed all mages and swordsmen, even his masters in Demacia and Ionia, he decided to leave the Glade and fight the creatures they were set to find. Carefully remembering landmarks and footsteps Erl trekked for what seemed like an hour hiking through the Glades in hopes of finding a way back to the world - back to his *brothers and sisters*. \nThe unfamiliar feeling of exhaustion and drowsiness struck him. Just as he decided to lay down and rest he was stunned to see the gates of Demacia. Merchants in wagons and Yordles in horseless carriages sped past him as they went through the rows of toll gates. Yelling, \"Get out of the way!\"\n\nDemacia&#039;s familiar trumpets horned. \n\"Demacia: now and forever!\" All cheered.\n\"All hail the Exemplar of Demacia, Prince Jarvan Lightshield the *Fourth!*\" \n\n____\n**Strategy**\nErl is strongest in top lane or mid lane. He&#039;s not innately meant to deal massive amounts of (100 to 0) damage, but if built this way, can deal substantial damage as a mage. He can be easily kited due to his long cooldown CC abilties and slow base movement speed. He is also easily hard-countered by silences.\nGoing Top focuses him into a off-tanking role. Erl is a little bit squishy early and is easily overpowered by CC engage compositions (Stuns, silences, displacements) during early game. \nHis inability to passively regenerate mana with his high mana cost abilities is to offset his utility and strength. A careful Erl should not spam abilities until mid to late game with the appropriate items.\n\nYou will notice that he has the ability to render all passives of one target useless. This temporarily deletes those passives from the game for a few seconds. This can be really mediocre or even useless against some champions like {{champion:16}}, {{champion:36}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:111}} but can be incredibly debilitating against champions like {{champion:14}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:8}} and a host of other champions. However, he can not delete stacks of passives. Careful not to pick passive reliant champions to increase your effectiveness when counterpicking. \n\n**Position:** Top and Mid\nTop is a more durable Erl whilst Mid is more damage Erl. \nErl will be a strongest at the mid-game; his utility is most useful late game where his armour reduction and slows can be used to peel for carries whilst allowing him to tank some abilities and auto-attacks for a short time. \n\n**Item Picks**\nYou should notice that the Mana Regeneration stat on items will not work with Erl because mechanically it won&#039;t interact with him. Other mana giving effects like Essence Reaver will work but is not the most effective buy.\n{{item:3124}} Guinsoo&#039;s Rageblade  would be a great item to pick up for its attack speed and sustain during mid game as well as tanking abilities during teamfight. The item allows him to land more autoattacks after his *Transference* and *Nullification* casts as well as giving him more damage with his *Transference* and *Cryoember*. \n{{item:3115}} Nashor&#039;s Tooth allows him to cast his abilities much more often as well as give *Cryoember* more DoT. This item also maximises the number of autoattacks during *Transference*. \n{{item:3100}} Lich Bane would be a good item to pick up for its much needed movement speed and Autoattack buffs.\n{{item:3025}} Iceborn Gauntlet is a tankier alternative for Erl. The mana is welcome for his high mana costs.\n{{item:3146}} Hextech Gunblade is also a viable item because its AD and AP benefits Erl as well as its reliable lifesteal and spellvamp.\n{{item:3153}} Its active magic damage is amplified under *Transference*. Its lifesteal is welcome to give Erl durability and its active allows him to catch up to targets whilst during ability cooldowns.\n{{item:3155}} Might be a good MR pick up for its MR. Erl is not meant to have tanky base stats.\nIf one wanted to be tank Erl, the common picks such as Randuin&#039;s Omen, or Frozen Heart (20% CDR) will suffice.\nItems like Abyssal Sceptre or Bashee&#039;s Veil are viable picks.\n\n\nChampionw with plenty of silences such as Fiddlesticks {{champion:9}}  and Garen {{champion:86}} temporarily nullify his damage potential. Erl is also relatively slower than most champions in the League which makes kiting him whilst he&#039;s low on mana and with his CC on cooldown easy.\nDuring early game, Erl will rely on his *Transference* to deflect and to maximise damage as well as to sustain his mana. *Transference* however,  automatically selects the closest enemy unit within the range so staying behind minions will allow anyone opposing him to reduce Erl&#039;s damage and durability if trading ensues.\n\nErl&#039;s mana costs are meant to be high to offset his strong abilities.\n____\n**Base statistics:**\nHealth: 530 - 1900\nMana: 210 - 988\nMana Regen: 12 - 30\nAD: 70 - 102\nAuto Attack Range: 615\nArmor: 30 - 80\nMagic Resist: 38 - 70\nMovement Speed: 310\nAttack Speed: 0.68 \n\n\n**Passive:** *Eccentricity*\nMana Regeneration Items and his own base stat Mana Regeneration does not provide any mana.\nErl siphons the energy of the impact of his basic attacks.

If you don't mind I'd like to try make some of the abilities clearer.\n\nPassive Eccentricity - Erl  does not regenerates mana instead 8 mana is restored per melee auto attack, mana regeneration items increase this by the percentage provided. Does not provide mana return when silenced. (For example morellonomicon would increase mana returned to 16 per hit becuase of 100% increase)\n\n(Something I thought of that might fit the concept, and everyone needs double passives these days!) \n\nAdditionally Erl can cast auto attacks at a range 350/400/450/500 (1/6/9/16), converting 50%/60%/70% +0.2 AP (6/11/16) of total AD into magic damage and consuming 8 mana, reduced by mana rengeration items. Does not apply onhit effects, silences disable this ability.\n\nA little more detail on how the abilities operate would be nice. Is Cryoember would be like an Xerath E with an Ekko Q return portion if it hits 3 enemies or is it more like a Karma mantra empower Q with a Ekko Q return mechanic.\n\nFor the Transference I'm assuming it's targeted because no skillshot vector is given. Riot has a design philosophy not to include resource steal, perhaps instead transference can grant an AD buff when used on a Fury or Ferocity user, an AP buff when on mana, a MS on energy users and a CDR buff against resourceless champions. Also reduce the resistance steal values a little, maybe like 10/15/20/25/30\n\nSpellsword seems kind of generic, perhaps when Spellsword is active make it so melee auto attacks apply Transference with 50% diminishing returns and deal his passive mana return as true damage on hit. If you take the mana regeneration item suggestion then perhaps he could become a mana regeneration carry LOL.\n\nNullification seems kind of odd. While the passive disable does seem interesting the extension mechanic kind of seems counter intuitive considering it already crowd controls targets, that and it has no upper limit so if someone moved 1400 units (Champs move on average 330/s leading to a 7s duration) then based they would effectively not longer have a passive or have to wait like 30 seconds. Disabling a passive can be extremely strong and difficult to play against. I think Erl should have to proactively deny a passive, something along the lines of: \n\nR: Nullification - Erl's next auto attack removes the targets passive (ability passives unaffected)  for 1 second, increased by 1 second for every instance of damage he deals to the target (up to 5/7/9 seconds).\n\nor if you are intent on it being a disable as well\n\nR: Nullification - Erl's next basic attack disables the target's passive (ability passive unaffected) for 1.5/2/2.5 seconds. If the attack was a melee attack it binds the target in place, if it was a ranged attack it silences instead.\n\nPersonally I prefer the first one as it provides some interesting counter play.\n\nOverall I like the concept but you have to find a fine balance between being a caster and being an auto attacker. If that's what you are looking for try to find ways for his abilities to encourage auto attacks. If you didn't like any of the suggestions just tell me and I'll remove them.","replies":[]}]}
