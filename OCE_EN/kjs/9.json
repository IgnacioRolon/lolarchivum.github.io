Long cooldown, magic damage devour, may also be an execute.\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/395qnf/new_champion_leak_raatul_proof/\n\nThe ~~reddit~~ 4chan leak that came out a couple of weeks ago, mentioning a new champion with lore links to Varus and who wouldn&#039;t normally benefit with lifesteal does not match with this though. The reddit post also mentioned that he could be an ADC, but a devour ability wouldn&#039;t match up to that role right? It&#039;s very very odd indeed.\n\nThere is also this River Laugh in the PBE.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJZlDVeDGMs\n\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-06-18T22:52:33.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The gambler...
