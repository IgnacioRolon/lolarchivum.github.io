One also had a massive heal. I&#039;m talking about {{champion:245}} of course. He outclasses {{champion:131}} in almost everything except possibly damage. {{champion:245}} Has essentially everything Diana has, except\nmore, better and mechanically easier. \n\nI&#039;d really like to know what you think of my evaluation between the two. As well as what you just think about just Ekko or just Diana.\n\nI'm aware Ekko is still in his balancing stage and is new so he has a higher chance of being tweaked than most champions like Diana.

Q -> R.\n\nEkko can escape with a dash, has an opportunity to stun and even if not landing, he can get a strong shield with it. If he fails a chase or gets counter ganked he ults and heals and repositions himself.\n\nI can see what you mean by Diana being easier; Diana is sort of easier to dish out damage with, but she has an unreliable escape. Whilst Ekko is far easier to manoeuvre with. Not to mention the benefits of blink abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-12T08:56:45.775+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically it's a matter of Diana is an easy champ with a low skill floor, and honestly a pretty low ceiling, but Ekko has higher in both those and a lot more utility on the damage that diana has.\n\nHowever the reason you'd pick them is different.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-14T06:00:33.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must vote for swag","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-12T09:54:30.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.
