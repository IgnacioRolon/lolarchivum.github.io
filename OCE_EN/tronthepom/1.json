But lately I haven&#039;t seen any rotating game mode whatsoever I wouldn&#039;t mind whatever rotating game mode it is but just the fact that it&#039;s not there really does make me sad. Don&#039;t get me wrong the default game modes are great  but when you just want to take a break they were the way to go, now I don&#039;t feel like there is something that replaces them.","replies":[{"poster":"Daktar1","date":"2018-12-05T08:12:25.752+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-12-05T05:58:05.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed","replies":[]}]}
