I got there first so I wanted to take it, we were both on the pad and then it went to me, after it went to me he proceeded to run it down mid several times blaming it on &quot;lag&quot;. I then proceed to try and talk to him but all I get back is insults and him claiming how he will never get banned. Honestly I don&#039;t understand why this kind of behavior is tolerated, as of yet he hasn&#039;t gotten banned and I have had many cases like this in my games and they never get banned. The only reason I bring this to the boards is just something about it seemed to much maybe it was one of his insults or just the way he acted. On a side note I do have clips of the game where he is seen inting but I&#039;m not sure how/if I should show them.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-05T08:12:28.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are still bots in aram so unless they are gone this shit ainâ€™t gonna be fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Tronthepom","date":"2018-03-05T10:23:34.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing they were no bot they were talking to us like a real person and with insults I don't think a bot would use","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-07T05:21:06.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but I THINK they gonna remove bots before they deal with toxic in aram XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-03-05T07:51:06.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.tenor.com/images/cc8879b3b9a5b1d8d9bd246605189676/tenor.gif","replies":[]}]}
