I played it with friends all the time and they convinced me to try out ranked and get better and I did, in a year I went from Bronze II to Plat V, I was amazed with myself and I could not have felt more accomplished. But 3 days ago I got banned from league. I found this to be confusing but once I had a look at what I said I understand I probably deserved this ban. Something I have just found out however is that I do not get my end of season rewards, I am absolutely devastated by this, this game was my life I played it with friends all the time and had heaps of fun. At first I thought I only lost honor rewards which I was fine with just losing a gold ward skin. But once to found out I lose everything I felt cheated. I have never been banned before and in the last week before season ends it happens. Again I understand what I said in that game wasn&#039;t right, but the thing is they were doing it right back to me and it was 2 of them against one. One of them was swearing their head off at me calling me an F***ing noob and the other kept treating me like I was some kid and he was my mother trying to wipe my chin and after the game I could have reported them but I realized it wasn&#039;t worth being petty over. But the other 2 they were full on for it they reported me and rightfully so but I even offered to make things up in that game but nope now I get a 15 day ban. The reason I find this to be so unfair is because I have never been banned before and I behaved well most of the season, even achieving honor level 5 yet after everything I worked for, for the past year and a half this game has been my life and then the last week before season ends they rip it away from me and I get nothing. This is why I think the system is unfair. \r\n\r\nOne last comment this post probably wont receive much attention and I understand that, I also know that most likely nothing will come from this and some will say I am making a big deal over nothing but this has been my life for over a year now and sooner or later I believe this system should change.","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-11-06T09:12:54.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tronthepom,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=y8FHNMr1,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-11-06T08:34:33.351+0000)\n>\nSomething I have just found out however is that I do not get my end of season rewards, I am absolutely devastated by this, this game was my life **I played it with friends all the time and had heaps of fun**\n\n[Emphasis mine]\n\nLooks like you've already been rewarded for playing league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2017-11-06T16:33:52.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it sucks, I think it is fair in a way. The toxicity gets worse around the end of the season, so while it's nice to be able to say _\"but they were doing it too!!!1!!1!\"_ it kind of just makes all the hard work you put in pointless. Don't stoop to their levels. The mute function exists for a reason. \n\nAnyway, as far as not getting any of the end of the season rewards, well... Riot aren't going to reward people for being toxic. It's good you understand why you were banned (most don't), but it's probably just a lesson for the future.
