Im just here to say screw you riot for ruining one of my favourite champs","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-30T11:45:38.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You now know how I've felt about Quinn for over 2 years.\n\nWelcome to the club.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-30T13:30:59.946+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I don't *dislike* Quinn now, but the ult really just can't compare. I wish they'd taken her more in the direction of a ranged bruiser like Gnar than kept the semi-ADC route and changed her ult. I liked her old Q better but I also understand why it was problematic. \n\nThe ult I feel was more problematic for her than for anyone else (squishy diving in head first and all that) but still there's nothing quite like turning into a freaking raptor and running em down. Despite being a supp main, Quinn has a special place for me. Phoenix was the first skin I ever bought and Corsair my first ever cosplay :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-30T23:37:34.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must say, it is a real shame to have her old ult removed from the game.\nIt was just such a neat ability.\n\nPerhaps she should have had a little more choice in her kit when they reworked her. She could have been a little like Kayn/Kha'Zix/Kai'Sa. In the sense that she gets to choose between upgrading her abilities to favour Valor, a speedy melee burst, or Quinn, a ranged sustained DPS. \n\nOr maybe she could have gone down the Kindred angle, where you control Quinn as the champ, and Valor is a bit more like a permanent autonomous pet. (maybe even a pet you can switch to by pressing R, and you get a new set of abilities like her old ult, and Quinn becomes the pet for a few seconds? So they are both always on the battlefield, and you switch between them.)\n\nAfter all she was intended to be released as 'Quinn and Valor' it was a last minute change to name her 'Quinn'. and as it stands, apart from a couple of her abilities being vaguely bird shaped, Valor has next to nothing to do with her anymore. Which is a shame.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-01T00:42:29.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with both of you. I'd definitely like to see Riot give Quinn and Valor (Valor in particular) some well deserved attention, and bring their kit more in-line with the concept of a \"Ranger Duo\", to better reflect their place in the world of Runeterra, rather than the focus being on Quinn and Valor essentially just being a prop.\n\nGot to say, those concepts sound pretty interesting, and I'd honestly like to see them turned into a full concept (who knows, I might do that myself at some point, wouldn't be the first time I've tried to do that for Quinn). Of those, I'd be more inclined towards the \"speedy melee burst vs ranged sustain dps\" idea, keeping it true to the original Tag Team, allowing the ability to swap between the two throughout the match, but being able to specialise in one like with Kayn/Kha/Kai.\n\nInterestingly, it seems like a lot of these kinds of concepts are for champions whose names start with K. Maybe Riot would be more inclined to give Quinn some love if her name were changed to Kwinn...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2018-06-30T11:13:11.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, once I got used to him he's not too bad.

This new aatrox completely changes his playstyle, removed his identity, and ruined his voice. You used to be able to jump in and keep fighting no matter what was happening. New aatrox you got to play a mini game with his q and you have to play around his cooldowns which means you cant go as ham as old aatrox. Now whenever my q is on cd I have to run away like a little bitch instead of being able to always fight with W","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snow Bataleon","date":"2018-06-27T12:50:25.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before he was a click to win champ. Now he requires a bit of skill/finesse. I think this is an improvement. The Aatrox just before this update was super nerfed anyway; his undying only worked with a full bloodpool.
