In game he trolled for the first 5 minutes of the game following me around and abusing me I first ignored it but when his premade started to abuse me as well I couldn&#039;t take it and had to say something back, the thing that scared and disappointed me the most is just because i was alone ( even though I had a super cool teammate support saw everything and also reported them with me ) and the way they behaved and what they wrote in the chat was just unacceptable, things like ( &quot;go kill yourself fuckwit&quot; &quot;do this world a favor and neck yourself&quot; &quot;you lowlife loser nobody likes you&quot; ) I can continue writing the things they wrote and I found it very wrong since this is a game that a lot of children play or people that are easily hurt and can get heartbroken by these peoples words and could do something to themselves like one of my friends who hanged himself yesterday.\r\nI am very hurt at the moment and as I am writing this I am in tears and the fact that Riot straight after the game gave me a chat restriction and took away my rights to earn rewards just shocked me. Here&#039;s the chat log of only my messages that popped up, I wish i could copy everything they said and how much energy they drained from me. I am going to email Riot with their summoner names and I wish they are going to look into this as I don&#039;t find it fair at all that just because they are premade they have the right to abuse people and get away with it and cause the 3 of them reported me I get the punishment :&#039;( \r\nwill keep you guys updated if they do anything about this\r\n\r\n\r\nverywere: ?\r\nverywere: you didnt call it tho man wth\r\nverywere: just cause u r premade\r\nverywere: call mia?\r\nverywere: thanks :D\r\nverywere: why u guys play with this toxic dude on your premade?\r\nverywere: well atleast he went top\r\nverywere: looks like he wants this win\r\nverywere: can we report urgot pls? even tho he is premade with other 2 he was extremely toxic in champ select claiming that he called jg first\r\nverywere: then just flaming me all game long its all in the chat so he will get a ban \r\nverywere: why are you being toxic to me and flaming me, when even nami agreeing that u just tried to steal my role\r\nverywere: tell urgot to stop trolling then\r\nverywere: and tellin their team where i am\r\nverywere: he is your premade after all\r\nverywere: why you doing this dude? anything bothering you in your life?\r\nverywere: or you just enjoy trolling\r\nverywere: you didnt\r\nverywere: ask nami\r\nverywere: the only one that is not premade with you\r\nverywere: ofcoz they will agree with you\r\nverywere: they are with you\r\nverywere: ty nami btw\r\nverywere: being real champ\r\nverywere: lets report them\r\nverywere: theres no place for toxic ppl in this game\r\nverywere: nami gonna honor you for being a good person and stating the facts\r\nverywere: &lt;3\r\nverywere: urgot will get insta ban after this game not only for trolling but for being extremely toxic\r\nverywere: go\r\nverywere: need help\r\nverywere: they dont wana take a free baron\r\nverywere: no worries i can carry this\r\nverywere: BARON\r\nverywere: stil dont want it?\r\nverywere: sure\r\nverywere: 10/2\r\nverywere: no team around\r\nverywere: just group, win, move on\r\nverywere: tb i feel sorry for ppl like you\r\nverywere: when are you going to stop being toxic and rude, there are alot of kids playing this game that you can seriously hard\r\nverywere: just by your comments\r\nverywere: i am not playing the victim card dude, you seriously need to grow up and try and play the game without being so toxic and trying to insult everyone that&#039;s not on your side\r\nverywere: ?\r\nverywere: can we take the free baron and end\r\nverywere: well you are obviously trolling and dont want the free win\r\nverywere: if we group and push its over\r\nverywere: go\r\nverywere: if you got something to say feel free, otherwise continue smacking the keyboard\r\nverywere: i am not the one being toxic\r\nverywere: gg\r\nverywere: not sure why you guys just dont want to end it yet\r\nverywere: if only i lived with my parents, would have loved it\r\nverywere: do you want them to win?\r\nverywere: ic\r\nverywere: gg wp dudes, pls report toxic urgot &lt;3 u all","replies":[{"poster":"Storm A Knife","date":"2017-08-14T04:49:03.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty shocked that you got the punishment not them..

Namely I have seen 2 false positives in a place where people come to complain about those exact things in 3+ years of being here with an opportunity for more exposure than most players.\n\nHowever you think it's coded, or whatever you think it's flaws are, I trust the system with the low fail rate more than the player who would be tempted to lie for a perceived chance of getting the account unbanned. Ofc, that doesn't mean this isn't a false positive, and I'm not a guilty until proven innocent kind of person, but I have significant doubts about this persons innocence if they got banned.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-08-15T18:48:13.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The issue with fail rates is to know the true fail rate the system must be able to tell when a false positive has occurred and alert you to that fact.\n\nOtherwise your \"failrate\" is actually the percentage of players who came to the boards pissed off about their ban and turned out to be right.\n\nFurther more for that \"failrate\" to be accurate a riot employee would have to hand review every single complaint made on the forums about a ban.\n\nBasically what im saying is your low failrate stat isnt accurate because it only takes into account the data you do have, and not the data you dont have.\n\nYou arent factoring in the number of people who get punished then just frankly dont give a shit, or dont go through the forums.\n\nI am one of those false positives fyi, i had a 2 week suspension in the early part of last year that was triggered due to the dynamic ip on my modem changing my ip in the middle of games due to random outages of my net, this made one of the automatic systems flag me as either A) an account sharer, B) an account hacker or C) something else ip related that im not yet aware of.\n\nI contacted support and had the suspension lifted after explaining it to them.\n\nMy false punishment would never have been included into your \"failrate\" because i never went whinging on the boards about it, i went through the correct mediums to get it handled the fastest (mostly because i have zero trust in the staff moderating these boards, for instance remember soviet and toxic, after 2 years whinging here and getting no results i went to support, got them permabanned in under 24 hours, that is the efficiency of the riot staff on the OCE boards compared to the NA staff who handled my report, and now that i think about it also handled my false ban)\n\nI know from first hand experience that the system doesnt work.\n\nI also know through logical deduction that the system shouldnt work.\n\nBasically you are using the logical fallacy of \"well i dont see the false positives so that must mean they dont exist\"\n\n\nFurther more saying \"reports only dont work if they are false\" is frankly retarded, if i report someone because they stole one of my teammates lanes, decided to berate them everytime they fuck up by telling them they played that well, then ctrl+3 spam while our nexus is going down (a real example btw) and they dont get punished, thats not my report being bad, thats the system handling my report poorly.\n\nSee the difference, you put more trust in the system than you do in the people feeding the system data, as such the system gets a faux pas whenever it fucks up allowing toxicity in the community to breed like rabbits, because for every 4-5 people trolling or being toxic that just dont know how to avoid the system, theres one person doing it in some weird way riot hand even thought of that the system cant catch due to that, and because no one in the fucking riot staff will listen to anyone about the flaws in their system it never gets rectified to catch that type of behavior.\n\nLike the example i gave earlier? lets break down what the system would have to be able to look for to punish that player.\n\nIt would have to be looking for champ select chat stating that the two players swapped lanes, then when it doesnt find that and sees that the top laner is in the same lane as the mid laner flag that (and even then that would only work in ranked where roles are predetermined before the game starts)\n\nIt would have to be looking at in game chat of that player and every time it sees that player talk it would have to analyse every play that happened within a few seconds of that message being sent to find the specific player he is talking about and determine if that \"good job\" was congratulatory or inflammatory (an impossible task fyi as you are missing context data like which player it should be looking for, or if that player's death was actually a bait etc etc, not to mention the system resources that would be expended running a simulation of the game for every chat instance in every report due to the fact that you cant know weather or not this type of behaviour was actually occuring ahead of time so you either have to not do this check at all (the option riot chose) or do this check for every report (the option riot wont choose because its too resource intensive, and i agree with them there, but its also why i believe the report system shouldnt exist in its current form in the first place))\n\nIt would then have to look at the behavior of the player in question towards the end of the game and judge if he made actual attempts to stop the loss (again an impossible task because without context data i guarantee you half the playerbase would be banned if you implemented an end of game effort check due to the number of players who sit in the fountain while the enemy team ends, which is different from antagonistic behavior like dancing around the fountain while the nexus dies knowing full well it will piss your team off, an automatic system cant tell the difference between someone being antagonistic and someone just behaving as per normal if the actual tangible behavior is the same with the difference being in the context)\n\n^ and that logical breakdown right there of what checks would be required to ban that report is why the automatic system doesnt work, because with a human audit that player would be banned tootsuite, because the one advantage humans have over automatic systems, is that they can see data that they arent specifically looking for, aka contextual data.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-08-17T02:57:55.013+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  because i have zero trust in the staff moderating these boards, for instance remember soviet and toxic, after 2 years whinging here and getting no results i went to support, got them permabanned in under 24 hours, **that is the efficiency of the riot staff on the OCE boards compared to the NA staff who handled my report**\n\nHey man, in most cases of negative behaviour, the best course of action is always going to be report them in the post game lobby. Even if you feel the system is not yet bullet proof, every report on negative behaviour adds to our data which lets us improve the system - the system is not fixed it is continually changing all the time.\n\nFor the case you mentioned here however, that was one that required special attention and ultimately lead to some changes to the system (I cannot divulge details on this).. \n\nI also want to clarify that it was OCE Rioters (myself and Riot Gehirn) who handled that case (I replied to your ticket) and not someone from NA. We were made aware of this special case through the boards - so your assumptions were a little off... we are listening :P!\n\nYou may see a lot of people posting about being banned, or posting up about encountering toxic behaviour and see no response from OCE Rioters - thus assuming that nothing is happening. Most of the time, we look into it and find that the systems we have in place are working correctly and no action is required. As some have mentioned, OPs tend to warp their posts or potentially have incorrect perceptions of their own, and other player's behaviours.\n\nI have personally read through chatlogs for games where players are saying they were abused (and ended up getting punished themselves) and found that they were in fact the abuser to innocent players - but not realizing it in the heat of the moment.\n\nI'm sorry that you had such a negative experience in the past with that case that's left a bad sting - it really struck a chord with me at the time which is why I personally took on the task of making sure that the appropriate actions were taken (I'm actually not a Player Support staff... I'm a designer!). I hope that the extra context this response provides can start to earn back some trust from yourself and other players in Oceania and we can strive for a more sportsmanlike community together!","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-08-19T07:15:30.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I stand corrected on the na staff thing in that case.\n\nIm also happy to hear that my case led to some changes in the system, and i fully appreciate why you cant divulge the details (as i mentioned in my own post, if you can figure out what the system is looking for you have also figured out what you shouldnt do if you want to avoid the system so personally id rather you keep that stuff under lock and key anyway)\n\nIf i can make one suggestion though a little more communication would go a long way, even something as simple as what you just did right now makes a huge difference.\n\nA few people have mentioned it in the past, but consequences are all well and good, but if people dont have the preconception that they will be faced with said consequences then there is nothing actually stopping them from misbehaving aside from their own morales (which lets face it when you are hot under the collar those go out the window haha)\n\nStill good to know you are actually part of the oce staff, I must have assumed you were with na because you are a designer (also good to know oce staff actually gets design jobs, i originally though it was just an office for customer service staff and the general nitty gritty stuff that goes on in the background)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-17T01:17:25.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet you are also only using the data *you* have, so your arguments carry the exact same flaws.

Also worth noting that you got it fixed immediately by support, so where was the problem? It would only be a problem if such cases weren't getting fixed or were happening all the time.\n\nBoards or reddit are exactly the places that people would go if they were falsely punished and it wasn't fixed, and yet it isn't happening.

We strive to create a sportsmanlike community and hope experiences like this become rarer and rarer. We definitely don't believe the behaviour of a few other players in that game were okay. I just wanted to touch on a few points to clarify the situation and hopefully ease some of the pain.\n\n1) Your chat restriction - you should have received TWO chat logs that lead to your 10 game chat restriction. If you never got the other one let me know and I will investigate why this is. As for the chat log you have shown, there are some minor discrepancies between what you have listed and what I have in our system, but that's not important now.\n\nA 10 game chat restriction is the very first punishment tier. Make sure you review these logs and try your best to prevent adding fuel to the fire in future frustrating games. You mentioned you already ignore and don't react to bad behaviour and I hope you can continue to build that skill =D. In future I highly recommend muting at early signs of unsportsmanlike players and reporting them after the game, they can waste their time typing, you dont need to listen to that.\n\n2) While we don't usually do this, I will say the other player in question definitely got punished as well. If they continue behaviour like that they will escalate through our punishments quite quickly.\n\nI understand how draining a game like that can be (I myself had a very draining game just last night, actually tilted me so much I straight up logged off and played Path of Exile for a couple of hours to cool off). But I do my best to never talk to players that are behaving like that, and focus my communications only on game objectives. I know how much it sucks to go through a game like that and I hope we can all work together to continue to reduce these kinds of experiences in our game. We must all play our part to create a culture and mindset around sportsmanship.\n\nI hope that helps Verywere, and I believe you can be a beacon of sportsmanship within our community. GL HF in your future games.","replies":[]}]}
