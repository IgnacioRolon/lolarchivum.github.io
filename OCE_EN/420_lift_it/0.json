Wont count to a border or anything. Just wondering if you guys have any idea when the rank will reset so I know when to probably start playing ranked again?\r\n\r\nMany Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-13T04:11:01.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your rank won't matter anymore but winning games in ranked will still increase your MMR which will place you higher when you do your provisional games next season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"420 Lift It","date":"2017-11-13T00:23:24.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So is there really any point to playing ranked right now?","replies":[{"poster":"Rito POS Client","date":"2017-11-13T02:05:09.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes. The reset is soft so you lose your rank but it will mostly retain your MMR. Pre-season ranked MMR improvements will help out with placement matches. Improving your MMR now = better placement matches in January","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-13T01:56:04.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be January 2018.\n\n https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-11-13T01:53:03.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh great, so this game will be utter cancer for the next 3 months or so.
