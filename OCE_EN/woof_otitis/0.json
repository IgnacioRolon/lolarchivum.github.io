I myself would love to be on a team, that played for fun, picked champs they enjoyed, worked together and kicked ass, but it seems that be it LoL, or world of warcraft, or Star wars the old republic, or any other generic MMO, you have your basic 5 (or 4) man team, a tank, a healer, and some dps, be it caster, or melee, but why, why do we have to run by these rules, why can&#039;t people be original, and pick, for argument sakes 5 casters, that work, have great crowd control abilities or what ever works for the team and just have fun, why does every game have to be defined by these &quot;so called&quot; unwritten rules? to me personally, the moment you tell people how they SHOULD and SHOULD NOT be playing a game, it stops being a game, it&#039;s not fun, instead of insulting a struggling player, why not offer help? or assistance / guidance to help them enjoy the game more? but it&#039;s an undying wish that will never be fulfilled, and I have a feeling that I&#039;m going to get a lot of replies saying, &quot;well stop being a noob, or feeder and learn a role&quot; well my response is why should I? if I want to play kennen, I&#039;ll play kennen because I like playing kennen, not because he&#039;s a mid, or a caster / support, ect ect, just because I enjoy that character, plain and simple.\r\nif you genuinely feel the same, add me on League of Legends, maybe we can create a team that thinks outside of the box, and tries something out of the ordinary, thinks outside of the box, and the mentality that: &quot;well the best strategy is we need one adc, one tank, one carry, a mid, ect ect&quot; I don&#039;t care, that isn&#039;t original thinking, that&#039;s being a sheep that&#039;s following a formula, I&#039;m sure even Riot themselves would agree that they would love to see a team that thinks outside of the box, and breaks the formula that people seem to have, and wow people, this for me would be an enjoyable game, one where you aren&#039;t told how to play the game, you can just enjoy it. however you see fit.\r\n\r\nnow that you&#039;ve read my rant and rave, thoughts and questions please :D\r\n\r\n{{champion:20}}","replies":[{"poster":"KrimsonDeath","date":"2015-08-30T03:52:25.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like playing kennen everywhere no matter what dey think, For the love of god I will play him trinity tank top no matter what they say, But im gonna get \"reported\" I think every player needs to take a good read of the summoners code","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T04:01:38.797+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the Summoner's code doesn't make sense anyway since summoner's don't exist since a year ago when they destroyed our lore.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-30T06:41:23.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ooooooooooooooooooooo true","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-29T09:14:28.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't play a game of soccer where everyone plays on the left wing.

Teams just have the common sense not to risk it, especially in professional level.\n\nIn LoL, it's actually 1 such case. Because if you play a full left wing team in LoL, you'll either be given a heavy ball, subpar shoes or other random shiet that is only there to intentionally screw you over until you play the game the \"right\" way.\n\nIf there is indeed 1 such rule in that sport, well well, I can see why people are more over video games these days.\n\nThat imo is just not right, teams should have their freedom to do what they want as long as it's not harmful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-09-05T07:02:41.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In normies rift go nuts, in ranked well, a good team comp matters","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tekken Lord","date":"2015-09-05T03:30:59.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In competitive play, yeah.\n\nThe reason why we have this meta is because it's the most effective and efficient. For example, we have the ADC and Support bottom lane, which usually the ADC is a hypercarry that gets stronger the longer the game goes, and usually they have relatively low base stats and high scalings. Accompanied by the traditional meta support,high base stats, tanky and has a lot of CC, the reason why champions like Alistar, Thresh and Leona are top tier supports because they have good, reliable CC that can peel/engage for their ADC, and that they don't need that much gold to be effective, compared to their ADCs.\n\nAlthough in norms this really doesn't matter, unless you're super tryhard","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jubly","date":"2015-08-30T08:49:53.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what you're trying to say but It's all about efficiency, you need a spread of AD and AP otherwise each piece of gold the enemy spends on armour/MR is much more efficient. \nYou need all lanes filled and a jungle otherwise you're losing XP and gold.

And instead of fixing it (and give us the strategic diverse they have always wanted), they use it as an excuse to make meta completely rigid until Riot changes it for you because they think sub-optimal and situational team comp don't work in video games for whatever reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-29T12:42:28.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is playing optimally is playing by them set rules.\n\nYou don't have to play with the roles, but you will be losing something somewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-08-29T08:42:37.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The formula exists for a reason.\n\nYou mention the dungeon style of MMOs like WoW and SW:TOR.\nVery simply put you'll find is almost impossible to run a Dungeon/Flashpoint without filling those roles two DPS, one Tank and one Healer.\nEspecially since those Flashpoints and Dungeons are specifically designed for you to need that group.\n\nNow let's take a look at MOBAs, specifically LoL.\nBack in the beta there wasn't any real meta, same for season one.\n\nWatch over season two and three and you see the meta we use today stick in place.\nSure at times the bot lane meta can be annoyingly stagnant (Looking at you Vayne, FUCK OFF) but the overall meta allows room for every champion in LoL's selection to be played.\n\nOften you'll see someone say \"FUCK THE META\" and go Teemo mid and get destroyed, why does that happen?\nBecause there are like two champs in mid lane that Teemo counters and everyone else ruins Teemo's day.\n\nI love playing Urgot, he's fun, so I take him top, the majority of the time I win my lane with him, same as when I take Thresh and Taric top.
