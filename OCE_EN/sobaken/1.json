Players from this team may\ndrop into Team 2, if seen as severely under-performing.\n\n\nTeam 2\n- This team will also be an OOL team, but is more suited towards players without much team experience and \nlooking to try out the OCE competitive scene. Any player that is Gold+ may join this team. Players may get offered a chance\nto move up into Team 1 if they display strong improvement.\n\n\nTeam 3 \n- This will be a team that is mainly for players that want a better grasp of how to effectively communicate with teammates.\nAny player wanting to play in and experiencing a team environment while also building there skills as individuals is welcome! \nANY player in ANY rank may join this team. As is the same for all other teams, players in this team also have the opportunity to move up \ninto more competitive teams within the organization.\n\n\nThe main thing we ask from you before joining any of our team is COMMITMENT.\n\nBest of luck\n\n- Sobaken","replies":[]}]}]}
