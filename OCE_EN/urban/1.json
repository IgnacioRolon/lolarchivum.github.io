I then got disconnected from the game because of a file error and had to rejoin. My league was pretty fine from there on until I exited to go for a walk. When I tried to reopen league it said I had corrupt files and told me to patch them. I have being trying to patch them since yesterday but it won&#039;t work because I keep getting an &quot;Unspecified Error&quot;. Anyone know how I can fix this without having to reinstall an overly large amount? (my internet is awful)\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Urban","date":"2015-12-09T01:58:25.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried repairing my client and I had the same problem \"Unspecified error occurred\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-09T01:24:37.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey UrbanAngel,\n\nYou may want to try [**Repairing Your Client**](http://www.wrenchmen.org/resources/knowledgebase/1?view=article)!","replies":[]}]}
