Like not to have it at a low number like 6300-10k. I'm meaning have skins for sale to IP use for 20k IP +. I've seen people in streams with almost 1 million IP point and nothing to use them on. Is there anyway you have thought about this or have got something in mind to bring this one into the light of LoL?","replies":[]}
