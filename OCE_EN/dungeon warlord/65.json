Where is the schedule for the Challenger Series relegation/promotion matches?\n\nLast thing I saw was Exile5 get beaten my Regicide, and Tainted Minds get Beaten by Abyss, and I onlly managed to see those games by chance as I just happened to be on youtube at the time.\n\nI am guessing, but I assume Outlaws, Tainted Minds, Renegades and Exile5 all have to play some matches to see who gets a spot for the next split. \n\nCan somebody please fix this, I have no idea who is playing who, or when so it makes it a bit hard to stay informed about the lower levels of the competition.","replies":[{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2017-04-12T13:37:04.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't know exactly when these matches are live, but the OPL Promotion Tournament replays can be watched on the League of Legends - Oceania YouTube channel. Also, there is no OCS team called Renegades; only Outlaws and Regicide.

Also found out that Regicide plays Tainted Minds on Friday 12pm as one of the players posted the time on facebook.\n\nIt's sad that the Riot team doesn't even bother to promote this and it's left to the dedicated fans and players to do.","replies":[]}]}]}
