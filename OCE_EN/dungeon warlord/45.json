Form a team to represent us in the OOL.\n2. Meet for group activities in the local area. (Viewing parties for OCE, game reviews for team etc, or even just a bbq.)\n3. Set up a gaming facility for members to get together and play.\n4. Find something interesting for everyone who wants to be involved. (Example: A B5 player wouldn&#039;t make the team, but maybe they could help set up equipment or organize events etc.\n5. have fun.\n\nI live in Ulladulla. Anybody interested could you please leave a comment below, so I can find you and add you to the group, or you can just friend request me, I'm on the OCE server most of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2017-03-08T21:43:06.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have read this post and thought, why would I join this guy, he's bronze so obviously knows nothing and has nothing of value to offer.\n\nI have been watching the pro leagues NA,EU, LCK, OCE and some LPL, all stars, and Worlds, MSI for 3-4 years, even watched Ranked Soloq in every division from Challenger to bronze spectating games. This gives me some really valuable knowledge of the game. \n\nI have a degree in computing graduating from RMIT in 2013 with distinction, and understand Calculus and other complex maths. I would be valuable for people having technical issues with computers and networks, or with helping to setup and maintain a network of computers and other fun computer stuff.\n\nMy nephew told me I should have a go at shoutcasting, as I am loud and expressive when I speak and can Identify anything in the game by sight, but I am shy and a bit too sensitive for that I think.\n\nI am 45yo male, retired basically, and League is my main hobby/interest.\n\nAs this thread suggests, I am looking to do more, and be even more involved in the League community as a whole. \n\nAnyway, without ranting too much, that is just a little bit about me.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-03-09T09:23:19.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont care so much for your qualifications.
