The new top laner from SIN who was given a harsh time in commentary did manage to play the split pushing Camille{{champion:164}}  very well and made good decisions about when to push and when to hold. He did fall behind in cs early and was caught a couple of times after DW send resourses towards him, but delayed long enough for other member of SIN to gain an advantage elsewhere. \r\n\r\nIn the second match SIN built up an early lead with Lucian{{champion:236}}  and Caitlyn{{champion:51}}  only to throw it all away after a bad team fight which saw Braum{{champion:201}}  and Zac{{champion:154}}  lock them down(while all had flash to avoid it) and the rest of the team able to take advantage of the SIN error and bring Kassidin{{champion:38}}  back into the game. Shernfire on Zac{{champion:154}}  was a highlight, finding great engages for his team throughout match.\r\n\r\nThe third game was fairly even again, however it was Juves who cost SIN the victory as  he went in early for the engage only to be burst down and killed in team fights time and again, while the rest of the team did well to hold on with some nice plays.  I thought the biggest mistake they made was in picks and bans when they banned Syndra{{champion:134}}  instead of Jax{{champion:24}}  which allowed DW to lock in the best split pusher in the game(in my opinion). I don&#039;t know if Juves plays it but I feel Sejuani{{champion:113}} would have been a better pick than Rek&#039; Sai{{champion:421}}  for the SIN team comp as well as the Sejuini ult would have given Juves the lock down he was looking for without having to dive the back line to initiate the fight. \r\n\r\nOverall it was a close series and for me it was SIN&#039;s mistakes that cost them the victory. Well done DW for their ability to force the errors and capitalize on the SIN mistakes.","replies":[]}
