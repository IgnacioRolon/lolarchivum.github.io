At around the 4 minute mark Wolf&#039;s {{champion:43}}  and Bang&#039;s  {{champion:110}}  gained a small advantage in bot lane poking Ruler&#039;s {{champion:22}}  and coreJJ&#039;s {{champion:412}}  out and pushing them in to the tower.\n\nAt around the same time Haro&#039;s {{champion:121}}  set up for the gank as he and Crown&#039;s {{champion:13}}  successfully take down faker&#039;s {{champion:61}}  in the mid lane getting first blood.\n\nSSG hold a 1000 gold lead around the 7 minute mark, As Haro&#039;s {{champion:121}}  goes for the play on faker&#039;s {{champion:61}}  with Crown&#039;s {{champion:13}}  again, however this time Huni&#039;s {{champion:98}}  steps in with his ult and SKT survive.\n\nA technical problem for SKT&rsquo;s jungler Peanut caused a 2 minute pause.\n\nAt around 8 minutes SSG send Ruler&#039;s {{champion:22}}  and coreJJ&#039;s {{champion:412}}  top and force a turret race as the team trades top turret on blue side for bottom turret on red side. SSG initiated the play and easily taking 1st turret gold.\n\nThe 10 minute mark saw the first grouping of the teams as they all converged towards the infernal drake. A team fight broke out with a fairly even trade with Peanut&#039;s {{champion:64}}  taking out Crown&#039;s {{champion:13}}  and Haro&#039;s {{champion:121}}  finding the kill on faker&#039;s {{champion:61}}  again. SSG do secure the infernal drake after the trade as SKT back out and give it over.\n\n**10-20 Munutes**\n\nFairly passive play up to the 13 minute mark when Wolf&#039;s {{champion:43}}  finds the pick on coreJJ&#039;s {{champion:412}}  locking him up with the tether as the rest of the team burst him down giving the kill over to Peanut&#039;s {{champion:64}} .\n\nAt 15 minutes SKT stacked bot lane while SSG stacked top lane, resulting in yet another trade of kills SSG taking  huni&#039;s {{champion:98}}  out while SKT take out Crown&#039;s  {{champion:13}} .\n\nAt around 17 minutes SKT send resources top and take down the top turret, giving up a 2nd infernal drake to SSG. They then move into a nice rotation mid and take the mid turret as well while SSG take down the bottom lane turret.\n\n**20-30 Minutes**\n\nAt around 23 minutes both teams converge on the 3rd infernal drake of the game as the team fight breaks out SSG get caught chanelling through the jungle and faker&#039;s {{champion:61}}  hits a huge 3 man shockwave resulting in a double kill for her and one picked up for Bang&#039;s {{champion:110}} .\n\nSKT take the infernal drake and head straight towards baron and as SSG try to defend they lose 2 more giving another kill to Bang&#039;s {{champion:110}}  and one over to Huni&#039;s {{champion:98}}  as they take out Haro&#039;s {{champion:121}}   and Cuvee&#039;s {{champion:57}} to secure an easy baron.\n\n**30-40 Minutes**\n\nSSG hold on for the next 10 minutes or so but as Peanut&#039;s {{champion:64}}  steals the Dragon SKT push SSG off, taking out 3 more players rotate to baron burst it down and close out the game in 37 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-02-18T22:14:18.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My fav game and now fav sup pick is Kayle in their second game when they subbed wraith in :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-02-18T10:56:08.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT Pine at your service","replies":[{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2017-02-18T22:00:05.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was my first attempt, wanted to see what sort of feedback I received before putting in the effort to do more.
