It's not about getting win streaks to climb.  It's about making the system believe that you are of a certain skill level. Getting a lucky 12 streak isn't gonna prove that. Winning more games than you lose will prove that. Yeh, sure, for the moment if you win 2 lose 1 you will continue to lose LP. BUT FORGET ABOUT LP. just win more than you lose and you will slowly climb. \n\nThe key word is SLOWLY. You've played a lot of games so it's gonna take a lot of games to improve your standing. My advice?  Forget about this season, play 100% ONLY to learn and improve for next season","replies":[{"poster":"Dungeon Warlord","date":"2016-07-15T09:52:29.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"been playing 3 years dude, how slowly you want me to go?\n\nThe thing is if I stay in Bronze I won't really improve, as that's all the game offers me. If however I was moved up and down levels(even with extreme fluctuation) at least I would get to play with/against some  better players which in turn would improve my skill level and knowledge of the game. Plus it would give me incentive to try more to be a better player.\n\nAt the moment I play champions I like to play more than champions I think i can win with. Which is why I have a poor win rate, as I played support {{champion:267}}  for 40 games and only won 10 of them, apart from that experiment I am pretty much even in my win/loss record. \n\nI actually have a 27/9 record on {{champion:113}} this year, but I like to play a variety of champions, learn new champions etc. \n\nAnd I play mainly support,  so i make it extra difficult for myself anyway, but that's just me, if I manage to get out using the hardest scenario then I would really know the position and the game pretty well don't you think?","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-15T13:06:50.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dungeon Warlord,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=kUReTA2b,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-15T09:52:29.872+0000)\n\n> At the moment I play champions I like to play more than champions I think i can win with.
