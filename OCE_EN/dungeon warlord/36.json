I did find that the Chiefs have built there own website(fairly basic,no stats or match history and links to social media but nobody online to use them). but apart from that there is not much information about the Pro teams in the OCE that I can find.\n\nIf I had the resources I would have a website for each team with stats of each players professional career and Information about favourite champions they like to play etc.\n\nThey could at least have a link for each team showing who is in each team.\n\nIn the VOD section, possibly they could have the final from last split, the Qualifying games so we can see how the new teams made it into the league. And any International games the Region has played in. ATM they have nothing.\n\nIt all seems a bit incomplete to me.

I have no idea who they are talking about when I watch live or on youtube. I would really like to see some team lineups and info on the OPL teams. Also, an about page explaining how many rounds in each split and how the OPL league works would be handy. I took me forever just to work out what a \"split\" was. Currently we are in week 6, I believe. Week 6 of how many weeks total? How many weeks are there left before the teams enter playoffs? I wouldn't have a clue. How much of the season have a I missed? You get the point.","replies":[]}]}
