Why would he have upgraded Illaoi, a random human? Not only that, but she doesn't even serve Viktor anymore, her augmentation process wasn't completed and she's gone rogue and is fighting against him. that is a cool concept, but that is already what the PROJECT: skins are. So that niche is already filled.\nShe doesn't resemble the actual battlecasts (beasts turned machine like Cho and Skarner) and she doesn't resemble the PROJECT: Resistance. It just seems like a weird skin to give her. _(in my opinion of course)_\n\nOn the other hand, the adventurer skin suits her a bit more, she's an outdoor-outgoing type of person, she's strong and hardy and her whole concept is about challenging oneself. So It works for her, it's just not the prettiest skin, the colours are kind of average.\n\nMeanwhile the space one is a pretty skin indeed, but it works well for her, as her role is about spreading her religion and her morals, and the skin takes a different turn on that and has her spreading the infection instead. It works super well being paired with Nautilus _(if you read his lore you'll see why)_. and it hints at a bigger story about her/naut/teemo on a space mission.\n\nYou also have to consider where the tentacles come from.\nIn her base skin the sea goddess makes them materialise from anywhere, in her void skin they could break through from the void and so can spawn anywhere.\nIn the adventurer skin, it shows that they come up through holes in the floor from a temple underneath, and in the space skin, its all about infection, and no one knows what surfaces could be infected and could spawn a gooey appendage. But in battlecast it makes no sense, where do they come from?\nAll theses things and more should be considered when making a cohesive skin.\n\nOf course all of this is my opinions, but I think it has a solid foundation.\n\n_(also where did you see that the other two skins are unpopular? id love to see the source.)_","replies":[{"poster":"  TheShdowReaper","date":"2017-11-06T06:47:09.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this champion.
