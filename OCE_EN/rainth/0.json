In this Programme we&#039;ve been asked to do A project for our community.\r\n Myself being a big gamer all my life, and being only 17, I thought, what the heck, Leagues taken up a majority of my life and many others, and let&#039;s be honest here, League&#039;s Community doesn&#039;t have the best reputation, with the online harassment taking people&#039;s lives [](http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-pro-attempted-suicide-after-tournamen-1542880793) is an example.\r\nNot to mention Sky William&#039;s video, where he covered this about (if my memory serves me) 4 Professional players that had their lives come to an end because of all the hate after LCS. e.g. this [](https://youtu.be/Wo69qGjYNJ4?t=1m26s) \r\n\r\nSo what does this all have to do with you? Well as i said i&#039;ve been talking with my Coaches (of the course not the game) to set up some kind of massive charity/fund raising event for the people suffering with Depression, to try and impact and give reason to why this is a big thing in the world. I&#039;m going on a Limb here as a 17 year old, full time high school student from Australia, Queensland, asking **MILLIONS** of you, to support me in this cause of Raising money for a good cause.\r\nSo what I&#039;m asking, with the help of the League of Legends community, friends, families, companies, anyone and everyone. Is i want to hold a tournament, one day bigger than any LCS/Super Bowl, the biggest event you know, and double that!, Triple it!, QUADRUPLE IT! In our hands right now, is the **LARGEST** Active unique daily player base in the world, made up of gamers. All i want, is to hold a Casual Tournament, for every single player on OCE to play/watch/donate/talk/socialize and overall support the community, to stream this massive event and have all the money donated to charity.\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBERS\r\n&gt; League of Legends by player numbers: 67 million playing every month, 27 million playing every day, and over 7.5 million playing at the same time during each day&rsquo;s peak play time.\r\n\r\nYou can&#039;t even begin to grasp, the amount of people that is, playing the same game and you&#039;re telling me, you all can&#039;t take 10 seconds out of your day, in your 20-60 minute game of LoL, to say ONE, nice thing. Not one paragraph, Not one sentence, 4 words as simple as &quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot;\r\nTHAT COULD CHANGE SOMEONE&#039;S ENTIRE MINDSET, FROM HAVING ONE BAD GAME/TEAM/START/THEY MISSED SMITE/THEY DIDN&#039;T TAKE THE RIGHT RUNES/MASTERIES. \r\n\r\n&gt; In 2012, an estimated 56 million people died worldwide.\r\n\r\nHow many people play LoL each month on average? \r\n&gt; 67 million playing every month\r\n\r\nCan you now seem to grasp how bad this is?\r\nI understand that League probably isn&#039;t the best place for this sort of post, trust me I understand. But you&#039;re going to tell me, NOT ONE OF YOU, have ever seen/experience first or second hand depression, have never seen the impact it can have on people and the people around them&#039;s lives.\r\n\r\nI can understand i&#039;m asking for a lot and to be honest, i couldn&#039;t stop myself from crying ATLEAST 4 times writing this, all i can ask is you help this get shared around, get it noticed, get as many people as you can to help this cause, share on social media, try to get media coverage of this, I&#039;m physically pouring my heart out to 38 Million people living in Oceania, at the very, very slim chance this is seen by maybe 1000 people...\r\n\r\nJust please take 20 minutes out of your lives to read this, connect with it, cry/empathize with it, share it, vote it up. It&#039;s a small loss of your day, compared to the impact and power that this could have on someone or anyones lives.\r\n\r\nThank you all so very much... it means the world to me.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-01-09T14:35:10.010+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, everyone, help contribute to this cause! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-01-09T23:43:52.637+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give this man (soonTM) a medal.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaze Enigma","date":"2016-01-09T23:22:44.979+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hear Hear!

It's not like cancer, it's not like people with depression can't afford a surgery or something. \nNobody exactly knows how to solve the depression, not even doctors or experts. Again in many cases I have seen, including Gosu and myself, even professionals on depression hasn't been useful at all.\nAll you can do is give them love, although even that is not 100% efficient, but at least that prevented Gosu from suicide, which doctors wasn't able to do.\nBut anyway, IMO a fund is not necessary, people with depression are not lack of money. What they need is attention, understanding and love. That money could be better use to some starving kids in Africa.\n\nTL;DR: There is noting you can **buy **to help depressed people.","replies":[{"poster":"Rainth","date":"2016-01-09T16:44:42.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that. That's not the point of this cause, the cause is to raise money for the awareness and potentially help those suffering in the form of \"Kids helpline\" and \"Suicide hotline\" and going towards other causes like those. It's not so much as \"Finding a cure\" it's about raising enough awareness to the point where we can make it a permanent solution to an otherwise temporary condition.\nThey're not sick, it's not a gene so it's not passed down through family members and even saying that it's a \"State of mind\" is iffy, even though personally i believe that it is, purely because people who have depression, can still laugh, like generally laugh and laugh so hard they cry, but that doesn't mean that they're faking it. Depression is so different and unique there just isn't enough research on it. Which is also why i want to raise money for it.\nMost people with depression don't know how to self express or open up to someone, so they've done what a LOT of people have done, they turned to gaming, if the games they play had a community, that was dedicated to ensuring everyone was happy and not swearing, cussing each other out every game, then life would be easier for everyone.\nRiot can then focus on the game and not so much on punishment systems.\nThat's not to say LCS players trash talking from time to time on twitter can't be funny or good for hyping it up. But when they go out of their away to directly attack another player, then they aren't helping to the cause. Examples of this are Nein and Maplestreet, both stepping down from their teams position's because of the amount of hate they received.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SINISTERsystem","date":"2016-01-11T21:49:22.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I just wanted to have a good time in a bot game, instead I had a shitty teammate give me crap for no reason at all. I right now am suffering with severe, chronic depression and I struggle with suicidal thoughts daily. I can't believe I even play League because it honestly makes my mindset worse.

Depression is a thing that is hard to see in people and hard to talk about for many. There is almost a taboo around having a mental illness. As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety for around 5 years, I can honestly say that this is a much greater issue in the world than people make it out to be.
