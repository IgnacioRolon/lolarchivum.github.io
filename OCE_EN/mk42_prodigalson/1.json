And what happened was I finished a Yasuo mid game with S+ rank, but nothing showed up, I thought I misclicked, but when I entered my loot box, it appeared that I didn&#039;t get a token for that. The only problem is that I didn&#039;t screenshot that S+ section. So, how would you solve this issue?{{champion:157}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[]}
