MUNDO\r\n\r\nP: No Pain No Gain\r\nWhen Dr Mundo takes Magic damage from a specific enemy champion after 3s he gains a bonus % MR based on the enemy champions damage dealt to him for 6s.\r\n\r\nP: Adrenaline Rush\r\nAt the start of the game and every time Dr Mundos ult finishes he can choose an injection to buff himself with which fills up his Injection bar (mana bar) over time. The injections he can use to buff him with are movement speed, Damage, Life Steal or AR and MR. The injection he chooses will also give a slightly bigger buff when he activates his ultimate.\r\n\r\nQ: Deranged Slash\r\nWhen activated, Dr. Mundo slashes his clever in front of him slowing and dealing physical damage.\r\n\r\nW: Burning Anguish\r\nDr. Mundo hurls a homemade Molotov at a targeted area which sets the ground on fire in the area it lands, If Burning Auguish hits an enemy champion with it they will take burn damage and the ground will light on fire where ever they move for a short duration.\r\n\r\nE: Healthy Injection\r\nDr. Mundo Injects Himself with a vial which heals him for a percentage of health over time. Using Healthy Injection removes 15 from his Injection bar.\r\n\r\nR: Maniacal Rampage\r\nDr Mundo Injects himself putting him into an enraging overdose. Dr Mundo starts swinging his clever infront of him repeatedly. Dr Mundo gains increased combat stats during this time including movement speed, life steal, attack damage and AR and MR, but Dr Mundo will get a bigger buff depending on which combat stat he chooses from his passive Adrenaline Rush. Dr. Mundo cannot use any other abilites during his ultimate.\r\n\r\nYouTube Video:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoqJTefywII&amp;t=131s","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-01-28T23:02:40.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying its amazing doesn't make it amazing.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelhead2928","date":"2018-01-29T00:30:55.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the person looking at it.","replies":[]}]}]}
