Placed in Low Priority Queue after a ranked game with 2 trolls who afk'd.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay. So I just played my 8th placement match, the third in which at least one person has afk&#039;d (that&#039;s right, over a third of my ranked games for this season have had a player afk). This game was different in respects that not only one person had trolled and afk&#039;d, but two. \n\nIt all started in champ select where the two seemed to have previous beef. One of them claimed they&#039;d feed the opposing team when the game starts, and the other spat racial slurs regarding Chinese people. I was hoping that it was some kind&#039;ve joke, but nope, as the game started they both remained at base without a word. Naturally, the 3 of us who did play saw no hope in winning and disclosed the situation with the opposing team who came to terms with it quickly. They grouped to push mid lane and end the game a soon as possible in order to save everyone their time (props to them). Negative, I did NOT afk during this time, I simply typed in all chat and traversed the rift while waiting for the inevitable to happen.\n\nIf a Riot employee so happens to be reading this, and also has to authority to do so, please review this particular match and reconsider my placement into the Low Priority Queue: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/120410045/35024905?tab=overview\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-29T12:33:18.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFirst off, please remove the offending players names from your post, naming and shaming is NOT allowed on the boards and will only result in your thread bring deleted by the forum moderators. Now, onto your issue.\n\nThere would have to be some reason for leaverbuster to penalise you with a low priority queue, you wouldn't be placed in a low priority queue for just one game being afk, it takes multiple offences for leaverbuster to punish for leaving/afk.\n\nRiot are unable to reverse any leaverbuster punishment as the system is automated, please read more on leaverbuster [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\n> **CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?**\n> No. We will not take your account out of low priority queue under any circumstances.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juma22","date":"2016-01-29T11:44:07.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me its because they would rather stamp out swearing in game than stamp out people who AFK/Troll intentionally feed.
