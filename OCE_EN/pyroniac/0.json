So you will most likely have to re do a few promo games, you you ought to still be at 100 LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-05T06:15:57.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woopsie, I know I'm late to the party on this one but I thought I'd clarify, Loss Prevented is something turned on server side (i.e for everyone) when there are issues with ranked. If loss prevented is on, then you will see it in the post game lobby (it will say loss prevented instead of defeat). If you are one of the unlucky ones who are the first to experience the issue before prevention is turned on, unfortunately there is nothing that can be done.\n\nLP is designed so that it cannot be changed, even internally. Essentially it's to maintain the 'purity' of LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-05T07:02:35.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I know they had to shut down the server because of it. So maybe some people got Loss Prevention, but not the OP?\n\nAlso, Riot can change your LP and MMR. They do this when pro players go to another region for MSI or Worlds. They give them an account which they've purposely given ridiculously high MMR just so they aren't stuck playing agianst Golds for 10-20 game, but get placed against Diamond+ players right off the bat.\n\nThey also deliberately mess with a player's MMR if they have a win streak, to make the MMR gains less and less. I actually had a Rioter [*Templar Iytsuna*] confirm this for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-06T04:48:43.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll go backwards here just to get my head around it. To the very best of my knowledge the MMR trend with win streaks isn't done manually, it's curved by the matchmaking system, so yes, your MMR is messed with, but it's done by Riot's calculations (to curb gains from boosting or lucky streaks etc etc, if you deserve those wins you'll keep getting them), not manually by Riot (going through every single player on a win streak would be a bit of a nightmare). So yes, that is a factor, but not a *manual* one, which is what I'm talking about with LP.\n\nAs for LP, setting a new account to an MMR is different from changing or removing LP gains/losses. To clarify, they aren't changing those players LP at all, just setting them at an MMR more appropriate for their level of skill and then matchmaking takes care of the rest. It'd not your LP that determines where you are placed. Their LP gains/losses are still completely organic.\n\nI don't know how much control Riot has over MMR, though I would imagine it's set up so they can only set a fresh account, not change an existing one for much the same reasons, but they cannot change LP. \n\nYou earn LP essentially based on your MMR compared to that of your team and the enemy team, so you could technically argue that by changing MMR they are changing the rate at which players lose or gain LP, but they can't just say \"you lost this much LP we'll give it back or visa versa\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
