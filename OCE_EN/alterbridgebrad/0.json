Normals Draftpick + Rotating Game Mode + Glorious Champion Capsule(Kayle shard, Sanguine Garen shard, salughter fleet ward shard and  500 orange essence) +Access to normal free rotation\n\n\nPretty boring in general, but i think the catcher is they don't even get first win of the day missions any more, and isn't the champs given supposed to be **simple **and **easy **to play? why are they getting brand at lv 4 and caitlyn 5. And hell, I mean those shards, they aren't even provided the damn blue essence to even unlock them all, by level 10 most people were able to afford between 10-16 new champs, in the new system they get not even a handful.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-15T05:47:49.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">you forgot the ultra rare option that happens more frequently than it should of simply x2 450 shards, probs designed just to piss people off.\n\nIf you get this, you are supposed to go contact support.\n\n>by level 10 most people were able to afford between 10-16 new champs, in the new system they get not even a handful.\n\nBut they have to try and get money somehow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-11-15T07:28:19.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of earning Influence Points/Blue Essence after each game, you get a capsule each time you level up, and the capsule contains champions shards, blue essence, etc. You earn Blue Essence this way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkyJacked","date":"2017-11-14T22:02:13.647+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, they don't give you BE unless you level up and then only if you exchange the shards.  Its a lose lose update.   They wanted to get more money out of people so they made it harder to earn anything by playing.  I used to spend money on this game, now I am extremely disappointed in this whole change.  Its so disheartening.
