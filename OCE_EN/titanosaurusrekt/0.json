I beg you.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beseech you Riot, please hear my heartfelt, impassioned plea: Create a 1v1 Mode.\n\nIn the same way as I only play ARAM on this account, I only play normals (and hopefully ranked one day) on another.  Playing normals on that other account is almost exclusively frustratingly painful, due to the proliferation of people who have this odd notion that 1v1s are exclusively the judge of a summoner's skill and prowess in League of Legends.\n\nWhen they invariably fail in a 5v5 mode, they single-handedly ruin the game for the rest of the team.\n\nToo many players refuse to play this game as a team, and only seek to play 1v1. They refuse to listen, and ultimately feed.\n\nI am supremely confident that a 1v1 mode would provide Riot with multiple merchandising opportunities, and provide the community with a clear choice of their playstyle - self-seeking glory, or true team champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-20T00:45:34.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should make a 1 v 1 rank ladder.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2016-06-20T01:07:40.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The possibilities are endless, amirite?...and all for the betterment of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-20T22:10:17.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just imagine the hype on who is the better 1 on 1 player, Faker vs Bjergsen etc.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2016-06-21T01:57:20.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would pay to watch a formal 1v1 between those guys.

It runs into a few hurdles from my point of view however. \n\nDrafting:\nBanning of Champions is all well and good, but the only way you can fairly have a 1v1 is through blind picking. There are a lot of problems with this in the scheme of things as the ability to randomly HARD blind counterpick is common. Second to this there is no room to optimize runes/masteries against your opponent so it becomes luck of the draw as to who has picked the better champion and runes/masteries for the situation.\n\nIf you have it where it is NOT blind pick, then it is easy for each person to just simply wait til the other picks and then counterpick the opponent, or simply both wait and just lock the champion last second, which in reality only fixes the summoner spell/runes/mastery adjustments. \n\nFurther to this the gamemode removes so many elements of the game that in the long-term it will have some growing pains due to the limited gameplay opportunity within it. I can see a huge initial rush to the mode and a very quick drop off from there, which makes matchmaking very inconsistent due to the low playerbase and wide skill gap.\n\nDon't get me wrong I totally see where you're coming from and have thought about this myself, but I can also understand the flaws within the system. What you ask for is currently there as I mentioned, it is just a small 3rd party community. Maybe look to promote this among your friends or facebook groups (or on the boards!) to try and get the ladder rolling :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2016-06-20T19:56:08.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump for Justice","replies":[]}]}
