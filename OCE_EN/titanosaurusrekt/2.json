If that's not enough, or you have some kind of proof, submit a ticket to support (button on the top right). If you do submit a ticket to support there isn't an option for reporting players, I usually just go \"gameplay: feedback\", so they should transfer the ticket to the player behaviour team.","replies":[{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2015-03-16T06:29:17.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx all (especially HeartyVine).  \n\n\"May all your games be full of fun, and free from rage\"\n\n (and bots;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-16T04:56:30.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I legit swear I had a sona bot once.... Ruined the whole game! She followed the jungle around all game until he finally had enough and quit, as soon as he quit so did she, exact same time, I also know they weren't working together because I was premade with him, but then the bot also rejoin the exact same time he did.\nIt would not help anything or anyone except kha! I then looked up the games for that player and guess what, exact same position build and champ, she had no masteries or runes, and had a total of 29 wins the whole season. She also didn't communicate, we all reported her after, and I suspect our opposition did too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-16T04:20:16.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was the bot woodcutting yews or oaks?
