Yasuo has been nerfed plenny of times boy.\n\nYou know this was a bug for like 2 years after his release. they finally fixed it a while ago i believe.\n\nNerfing a champ by making them clunky or buggy is not a good way to do it. unless its borderline abusive. yasuo landing an auto after his ulti isnt even that bad. its not like it makes it impossible to counterplay the champ.\n\nShit like alistar being able to auto attack mid headbut was and is an example of abusive mechanics. yasuos ulti isnt. It makes the champ more fluent, which suits his playstyle. and there are champs that can beat yasuo early and late game :)","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-06T09:34:20.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yas has been nerfed once, exactly once in the last 3 years.\nAnd all the yas players cried so hard that that nerf was immediately undone.\n(the lowered his movement speed by a tiny amount so he couldn't tower dive pre 6 so easy.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-06T09:14:52.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate Yasuo, yet i don't mind his kit. His wind wall is infuriating but has a long ass CD, bait it out then ham on him when its down. His mobility from the dash is also infuriating to play against, but again  each dash is a click targeted ability. It needs great APM to do well. The two problems I have with him are; He doesn't need mana or energy but also has very short cd ability's. This makes him both very harass heavy while letting him out sustain practically all other mid lanes. The other is his wind shield passive; I have outplayed a Yas so many times only to have that come back up at the last moment and stop a killing blow. You just feel cheated. That combined with the fact he doesn't use mana means you are constantly spending mana to poke down a shield for no damage. This is constantly compounding the sustain imbalance. \n\nI main Lux and can play around his kit a bit. Dropping my e right in front of but not on the wind wall to get dmg regardless. Holding my Q for when he goes ham and using auto attacks to knock the shield of his down before using ability's on him. But its a hell of a lot of work, more work than i have to put into any other match up and that work costs me farm. I can beat him but he just isn't \"fun\" to play against.He isn't fun because his wind wall is so absolute, you never feel outplayed just cheated. He isn't fun because his wind shield is free and recharges so fast you feel cheated out of mana and damage, all the effort of getting a skill shot on a very mobile enemy only for it to not do any damage. He isn't fun because he doesn't use mana, every time you outplay him or out farm him (Very hard to do because all of his harass ability's can be used to farm WHILE harassing you.) you then have to back because oom and he catches up or surpasses you..\n\nEdit; Oh yeah one more thing I AM SICK is missing cs because Yas wind walls my autos on what would be a string of last hits. He has to be the only champ in the game who can actively deny his opponents farm that's even less fun to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-06T01:23:09.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone seems to think his damage is the problem when really he just needs more windows of space to poke him down in lane and in fights. Which is why I've been suggesting about nerfing his E CD. If it was 0.5 seconds at all ranks it would give opponents just a bit more time to react when he dashes in at you and when he tries to dash away gives opponents a chance to actually get him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Poh Tay Toe","date":"2016-12-06T00:50:58.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is balanced :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-12-05T12:29:00.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Breathing is intensive though..","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-05T04:44:11.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly I don't know why you are complaining about Yasuo.
