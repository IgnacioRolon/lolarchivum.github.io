Getting the chance to try new champions I&#039;d never have played before, new builds and gameplay styles, without having to play against AI bots that, lets face it, give us no real feel for the game, was great!\r\n\r\nNow that U.R.F is gone my sudden approach to playing LoL has gone back to it&#039;s roots of why I stopped playing in the first place, the community.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m not saying the community as a whole but it would be a fair percentage. Like most people I like to play LoL for a bit of fun and to take me away from the daily grind that is life, but the last week I&#039;ve barely made it past the champion select screen.\r\nBeen forced to play a certain role or play style because &#039;I called &#039;x&#039; first&#039; is a joke. If I want to play a normal game for a bit of fun I should be able to play whatever champion I so choose, I shouldn&#039;t be forced to play a certain role just because the &#039;meta game&#039; tells me to. I for one can&#039;t jungle for the life of me, yet I get forced into playing a role I&#039;m terrible at and let the team down resulting in abuse or I play a role I enjoy that&#039;s filled, resulting in..... abuse.\r\n\r\nThis is something U.R.F completely removed from LoL, you could play whatever, whenever, wherever you wanted to no complaints, no arguments and not been constantly ridiculed in game because you didn&#039;t fill a specific role. _It was genuine fun_, which is what gaming should be about.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to see U.R.F returned as an all year round playable game mode or maybe even added to ARAM.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-15T02:57:52.309+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we don't have dominion at all, and we don't have TT full time.\nso no, it shouldn't be around all the time. it's called a limited game mode for a reason. because it's limited. besides, OFA > urf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-04-15T08:58:24.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope riot permabans you from playing urf, and they disable all your accounts for multiplayers so that you are only left with league, making you suffer next year when urf comes back and everyone but a minority (you) is able to play it. \n\nand they should permaban you from anything which isn't ranked solo queue or normals. u would still be allowed to play customs, but only on summoners rift. Rito plz do this, thanks!","replies":[]}]}
