To avoid to be a pain in the butt for someone else I try on my own the very best i can, Beside the bad performance I never AFKed, I never Quit the game and I never flames Enemies or Teammates especially when i Do Good.\r\n\r\nSo many times happen that i have to Fill the last spot and the role that i&#039;m used Jungler or Mid laner is not available so covering top or Carry bot is pretty hard for me.. (sure can learn but i usually perform bad).\r\n\r\nSo people rush to occupy those roles and pretend, roles they basically gave to you, you DO GOOD.\r\nWell it&#039;s not working like that. I have to follow my Runes unfortunately with this thing about Buying for 6300 IP the rune page I have few Pages not covering all the roles and my Champ Select Depends from the Runes.\r\n\r\nAs support I have to play a Mage because i have AP runes as Jungler I can play Udyr but I can&#039;t play RekSai.\r\nAs Ad Carry I can play Teemo but i can&#039;t play Jinx.\r\nSo fore so fore.. so fore... \r\n\r\nPLUS\r\nI have a metered connection and it is a Wi Fi (similar to those ones in Universities).\r\nNow my problem is that the Modem is shared with 20 or 25 persons and in Peak time, often when the data is restored and the meter is reset, My connection is very weak and i have ping around 200 with spikes to 500 up to 1200...\r\nvast majority my ping is 25 to 65. \r\n\r\nToday with a community of 60 million people there&#039;s no a way to test your ping before to go in game.\r\n\r\nYeah i know there is the Prompt test from windows but it&#039;s Not official and is not in the client i&#039;m not testing every time before to start a game.\r\n\r\nSo my request There is any way to test my ping on OCE server ? easy way ?","replies":[{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-10-18T06:04:54.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I check my ping by opening Command Prompt (cmd) and type in something such as\n\nping oce.leagueoflegends.com -t\n\nIf that's not enough, I go into a custom game, and check the ping there.
