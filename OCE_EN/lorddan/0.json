The Nautilus artificial reef was the final reward in Ocean Week 2015. Players from all around Oceania played games with specific Ocean Week champions (like Fizz, Nami or Nautilus) to contribute one point per win.

Which is why your name is not on the reef.\n\nYou did however earn 20 points during Ocean Week 2016 (this year). That means your name will be on the Ocean Week Community Wall - which is currently in progress and we will have updates in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"LordDan","date":"2016-04-11T20:25:26.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that makes sense....
