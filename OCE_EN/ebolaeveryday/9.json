I never lose my lane, ever. Why? Because I was higher ranked last season but am currently stuck in gold. I always out cs my opponent, always out skill them, sometimes even kill them and their jungler when they come to gank. Yet I'm still stuck in gold, because other lanes don't just take it easy and farm.\r\n\r\nIf you're being pushed, farm under turret and call for ganks. I'm more than happy to come bot and get a double kill if they're pushed to turret without wards. But please, don't just give away free kills because you're trying to out trade them.\r\n\r\nI can win diamond games but can't win gold. I wish I could carry harder but I actually think it's impossible, re my last game. Me mid (8-2), jungler 1-9 and top 1-7. Most of my kills were from roaming top, everytime I would say \"WAIT UNTIL I GET THERE, DONT ENGAGE\", followed by them engaging, dying and me cleaning up. We could have had no deaths, 1 kill and 1 assist....","replies":[{"poster":"basíc","date":"2015-03-22T06:22:54.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you sound like one of those players who just plays safe and consistent every game in diamond and ends up with a ~50% winrate because you only need one playermaker to win games in elo heaven, an aggressive player like boxbox would go 20/0 in the laning phase if their enemy laner was gold and totally zone them of any xp or farm turning it into a 4v5","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T06:26:53.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, I generally dominate my lane in Diamond, I just don't play on it because it's technically not my account and I want to get there on my own will.\n\nI usually wreck the other mid laner, force the jungle to come gank me and usually wreck him too. This is why I win my lane in Gold, people just don't focus objectives in Gold, they're more focused on KDA","replies":[{"poster":"basíc","date":"2015-03-22T06:29:31.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why not just play a cheese champ like riven mid and snowball like crazy","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T06:40:52.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might look into doing that :D I'm thinking Anivia might be worth while too","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-23T08:16:55.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest this happens way too often in my games too...\n\nI trade when I KNOW I have the advantage and I only go in for the kill when I KNOW I can get the kill, but some people just trade whenever they can and don't care if they can win it or not, they'll just do it and hope for the best...\n\nBest tip I give for anyone out there at any level.
