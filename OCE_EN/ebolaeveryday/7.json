So I literally have no motive to be a positive player. Back to abusing people again, chat restrict me I don't care but I've tried being positive in every game today, and every single game it's just toxic morons. So if you see me, enjoy the abuse you're about to get","replies":[{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-24T06:01:50.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This really depends on your mentality, but to be honest I feel like there is immense personal satisfaction in having other people appreciate my presence.  I don't believe that there needs to be a tangible motive to every action or idea, especially when it comes to basic human decency.  Being positive is its own reward, and I think I'd feel really unfulfilled if I forced myself to link positive behavior to reward in every scenario.\n\nRegardless, statistically speaking you are significantly less likely to encounter toxicity if you yourself are not toxic.  Turning it around and being just as abusive back doesn't solve anything, and almost invariably just ends up making the situation worse for both the instigator and everyone else in the entire game.  The fact you're validating your behavior with basically \"he/she started it so I'll ruin his/her day\" saddens me a bit, because it's a pretty inherently negative ideology.","replies":[{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T17:13:37.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Daen,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=NufoOE8P,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-03-24T06:01:50.776+0000)\n>\nI feel like there is immense personal satisfaction in having other people appreciate my presence.  \n\nYeah man..

Obviously this isn't always (or even usually) the case, but there's a lot of satisfaction in helping facilitate a fantastic in-game experience.  For me, at any rate.\n\n...that being said, it's pretty great to have teammates complimenting me on my play.
