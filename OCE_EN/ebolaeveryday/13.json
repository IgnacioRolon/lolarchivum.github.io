Is demoted and depressed about it in end game chat. Told by 3 people that he should kill himself and one of them I quote, said \"I hope something kills you before the cancer\". He's logged off now and was very distraught about it. All three were reported, nothing will be done about it as per usual.\r\n\r\nI'm really depressed with human beings today......","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-03-06T06:35:34.142+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nThats very unfortunate to hear.

You need to try and cheer him up if you are genually worried about him. Sometimes you got to step in and try to do something.

It's kind of hard to tell someone who is inveivitably going to die of cancer not to worry about it. I'm just more disappointed that people would say something like that. Sure you might feel distanced and disconnected to someone as its only text on a screen, but I think people forget there is a 'real person' on the other side of the line. \n\nAll I can think is cancer clearly got the wrong person here","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-09T08:45:40.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bullies gave him cancer, \nthe myth about bad (asshole) players and cancer is tru believe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-03-06T08:12:05.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you ever heard of hunter teemo? it is about this kid that died from cancer, and the only time he wasn't in pain was when he was playing league of legends. you have to try and make him happy as well, when ever i was sick and i played games i felt like i wasn't but when i got off then i always got sick again. try to pllay some games with him and tell him to mute other players.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-03-06T08:36:23.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be in your best interest to not be a %%%%.\nhttps://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10461943_10153211733685625_767135677411730683_n.jpg?oh=2f5f36cf01d1a630d1d3f5c6f46d47c7&oe=559265C4&__gda__=1434705147_06d276ced16c08fd6a02e8c2e070a7be","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-06T08:47:47.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=VENI VIDI VICI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uHeo7pi2,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-06T08:36:23.973+0000)\n>\n> It should be in your best interest to not be a %%%%.\n> https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10461943_10153211733685625_767135677411730683_n.jpg?oh=2f5f36cf01d1a630d1d3f5c6f46d47c7&oe=559265C4&__gda__=1434705147_06d276ced16c08fd6a02e8c2e070a7be\n\nThat's false, the fact it was on facebook backs up my claim.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-03-06T15:22:34.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow you're one of those douchebags that goes Thomas Edison on someone.
