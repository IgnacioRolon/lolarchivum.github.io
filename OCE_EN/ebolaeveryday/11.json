I'm ok with that considering I dropped from Plat last season.\r\n\r\nWin every game up to promos, skip gold 2.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I cant for the life of me win games in Gold 1. I'm playing better, generally win my lane but every game I play every other lane loses. I'm not saying that the loss is their fault, but how is it that every game I get the losing laners. Duoing only makes it more difficult because I get matched with silvers vs plats.","replies":[{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T11:52:24.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your ranks and elo mean nothing the matches aren't made by an algorithm they are made by fallible human hand, lift scumbag","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-25T10:12:05.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are able to hang around gold2, then when all the other players elo's round out properly you should be getting more competent teams.
