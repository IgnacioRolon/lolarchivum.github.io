I play this game as a way to forget about everything in life, but I feel like this game might be the end of me.\r\nWas getting bullied last game and told them to back off, that I was literally almost at breaking point\r\n\r\nEveryone in the game encouraged me to kill myself, followed by users adding me afterwards and suggesting I use a rope or a train. One said they wanted to skype me to watch me do it.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just writing this, maybe as a final message, but I&#039;m just really disappointed in the human race right now","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-28T11:58:25.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play games where it's more single player oriented, also maybe sandbox.\n\nSo would have yourself as a god in that world, nobody would bother you, and nobody can stop you. It's perfect for distractions and a little bit of escape.\n\nHowever though, remember this, it's only a matter of time before we all need to turn back and face our issues once again. They have to get fixed, one way or another, because no problem solves itself.\n\nHowever for the time being if you are really not willing to take it, I can understand, for now, a little bit of ignorance is definitely allowed I would say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-31T03:52:42.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to beyond blue dude.

My advice from someone who's been in your position would be that if you're gonna play then if you meet people who are friendly or nice then just add them. If they made the game better or more enjoyable or made you laugh then just add them and play with them. There is seriously nothing better then having fun and enjoying the game with someone who's easy to get along with. I met a guy online when I was in the pits and I now talk/skype him pretty much every other day. It does get better man, believe me :) I'll add you as soon as I'm out of this game :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-30T00:57:49.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A really easy way to deal with it all is to of course mute them all. But, if you don't decide to mute, just remember this: the people who throw these insults around are either 10 years old or under and don't understand the possible consequences of their actions or have spent their life doing nothing, so they just become keyboard warriors that insult others behind a screen because they know nothing can be done to stop them.\n\nBasically, the human race are dicks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-03-29T14:37:11.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mentally speaking I myself am a few thousand sandwiches short of a picnic, I have a lot of anxiety issues, repressed anger, mood swings, homicidal thoughts, depression, suicidal thoughts basically the whole barrel of monkeys. League is not a game that should be played by people in such a frame of mind shit was getting to much for me and this game just made me more angry/irritable so I just went off the radar and went back to playing some chill solo games like Borderlands, Skyrim, Terraria, Osu etc when I feel better I might come back but I reckon taking a break could be a good thing to do for you boo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BoundedByHentai","date":"2015-03-29T14:16:29.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy mother of fuck dude, this is me, i play to escape reality and my depression, this game and monstercat have saved my life. but the assholes in the game are pathetic..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-29T07:36:18.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They act that way for a few reasons.\n\n1) They realise there's less than 5% chance of someone actually being affected by them.\n2) It's the internet, so they're anonymous.\n3) They fail to control themselves because they believe they're invincible and unstoppable while behind their screens.\n\nIf you want this to stop, then play with friends, mute flamers instantly, and stop accepting friend requests from people who have been abusive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T10:16:57.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute anyone who talks like this\n\nThese people sicken me.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-28T10:45:14.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They add me after the game and continue to bully and encite suicide from me...","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-28T10:56:23.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you accept the add... don't accept adds from people who bully you","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-28T11:04:28.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah sometimes it's someone that hasn't said anything at all, and throughout the game they'll be like \"dude don't think like that, let's have a chat\", so I'd think it's someone positive trying to help.
