Like really bad, so toxic that it's awkward thinking about it. However I've cleaned up my act and now have a favourite thing to do\r\n\r\nIf someone is abusive/racist/toxic, just be really positive about it. It is the same as bullying, nothing frustrates a toxic user more than not getting a response. It's great to see them just dig that ban hole deeper and deeper, giving Riot more and more fuel to restrict or ban them. That is what I get my pleasure from now, not by being a toxic scumbag to people, but slowly one by one acting as an organic tribunal :D","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-02-26T19:53:27.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But sometimes its hard to not react when someone is flamming at you...

I tend to be a very emotional player; if someone is being negative towards me I will go on mental tilt. \nA few things that I use to keep things in context:\n1. Ranked is a grind; that single game is fairly insignificant in the grand scheme of your rank and ranked experience. This also applies to ragers, trolls etc; their threats mean nothing because all they have on you is a single game. After that game you are free to play on without them, and their negative mentality. They will continue to lose, you won't. \n2. Everyone makes mistakes (even pros!), it is natural and should be expected. Do not be too hard or put too much expectation on yourself.  \n3. Ignore other people's expectations; all you can do is try your best. If your best isn't good enough is a game, so what? One team had to lose, you got outplayed. Always try your hardest and accept losses happen. \n4. Keep learning! Every situation is experience and a chance to learn. After every fight try and list at least one thing you could of done better, there will always be something. If you can't identify what that is yet , try watching high level stream or pro-matches. You can pick up pretty quickly what you should be doing from there. \n5. Have fun and remember you're playing because it makes you happy!\n\nGood luck in ranked and I hope this helps,\nSkyprus.","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-02-27T04:33:48.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro thank you a million!!!
