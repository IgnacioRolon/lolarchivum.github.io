I've noticed I've been having difficulties with the game due to the amount of abuse I'm getting, I'm so stressed out that I'm literally pulling beard hair out. When I get some wins I feel great but I'm finding im losing more and more, leaving me unable to sleep. Some days I don't even eat until I get a win, that can be over 8 hours. All of this because some jerk hacked my account and dropped it out of Platinum. \r\n\r\nI understand that it's just a game and that's why I'm thinking I should give my account away. I just can't deal with the abuse and bullies that I constantly get in games.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-22T14:31:56.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just letting you know I've contacted some of the riot players i know personally and requested your account be flagged.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-22T06:27:47.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Against the ToS.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T06:39:00.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wouldn't be sold, I would give it away","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-22T07:57:47.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still against the TOU and EULA.
