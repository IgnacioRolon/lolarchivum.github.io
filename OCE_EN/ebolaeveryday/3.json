You want someone who you get yourself fed with, someone with escapes, a strong laner, can 1v1 and roam. Basically someone who you don't have to rely on team mates for.\n\nMy Solo Queue mid lane pool goes a little something like\n\nAhri, Lissandra, Talon and Zed. I also SOMETIMES pick Ori if the team comp allows it. (Strong front line and peel in the team comp, strong initiation and strong teamfight).\n\nSyndra, Cassiopeia, Fizz and Nidalee are also not bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-03-30T20:47:07.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think malz is strong for a couple of reasons.\n\n#1 Strong lv6. Laner is either forced out of lane, or dies.\n\n#2 safe farming. You dont need to be that close to the creep wave when you have e + void baby early, and later you dont even need the void baby\n\n#3 forces ADC to buy QSS, half of them dont buy it anyway (low elo)\n\n#4 can remove the strongest enemy team member from the game each fight\n\n#5 people in soloq are less reliable to CC him during ult.\n\nAs for those matchups, diana can be hard, zed is easy up until (if) he gets QSS, twisted fate is relatively easy, leblanc is pretty even IMO just be careful pre6.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuwazza","date":"2015-03-29T17:19:12.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find for ADC jinx is awesome. As long as you know how to lane correctly and build her, she facerolls mid game. I second the Malz. One of my fav AP champs. Ziggs is also good (think of his W) I also find teemo carries really well top too IF you know how to play and build him properly If you build him right, you will almost never get caught, and always catch champs. Yi is easy and good for Jungle but easily countered by teemo. Another great pick is amumu top.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-03-30T12:17:16.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ebola here.

I'm carrying myself out with nautilus and there are easily plenty of better hyper carry junglers than him, I:e vi, xin, lee, rek'sai, ect\nMalzahar can carry games, but he's dependant, in a way to his team to peel aggressively so his ult don't get fucked over.\n\nAll about what you want to play, dont get sucked into thinking you have to flow with the meta :)","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-03-30T12:16:02.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ebola here. I mostly like Malz because he is great for catching out of position people (which happens a lot in Gold). Their support step out of position too much in a team fight? Boom, they just got ulted and malefic visions chunked someone near them. Now it's a 4v5. This happens so often, sometimes their mid, ADC or jungler\n\nAnd trying so hard not to just flow with the meta, but when everyone else does it can be a bit tricky :( like legit, mid every game is zed, LB, Diana, TF. And lately randomly Kass.
