Your team and the other team are formed from the same pool/level of players. Both teams are around the same level. Your team isn't worse than the other team 80% of the time you have actually won 11 out of your last 20 were wins (55% winrate).\n\nIt looks like you posted this after a 4 game losing streak though, so I can see why you were frustrated. Just remember in every loss you played a part, try to learn from every game win or loss and you will find League of Legends a lot more enjoyable.\n\nFrom your complaining it sounds like you're complaining about a situation normally referred to Elo Hell.

So I think your answer of stop blaming other players is completely flawed and is using the pretence that a) people aren't on smurf accounts or getting boosted and b) your team mates aren't trying out a new champ in ranked\n\nI have since dropped from Gold 2 100 LP to Gold 4 0 LP over the weekend. Some games my fault but the majority there was nothing I could do about it. Honestly, if you don't believe me, duo with me and have a look at the filth that I get matched with.

Or jungler, to get other lanes ahead. Choose early game champions. Watch the map and when you see a typical solo queue moron about to do something dumb like chase, ping them back. Bark orders at the team when they are playing mindlesly (e.g. BARON NOW!!!!!!).

I can understand why he's irritated. There's nothing more infuriating the just playing safe in your lane but just hearing the constant \"An ally has been slain\" announcement. Obviously this is just my personal preference, but I found a lot last season if I was forced to play top then Shen is a very good pick, his laning is good, he has excellent global presence and he can also split-push pretty safely,  not as effectively as Shyv or anyone with Hydra but a good Shen is a goddamn nuisance to deal with.  The split-pushing thing does sort of work. Hate to sound like a T2G wannabe but I've won more than one game just constantly splitting top with  {{champion:102}}  and forcing them to send 2-3 people to come and deal with me. It's worked against me as well. I always remember one game where a {{champion:67}}  top just stomped our Riven and just kept pushing and pushing the entire game. The rest of her team was getting stomped but we had to keep sending at least 2 people top because she was one of the best Vaynes I've seen at my elo and she just kept taking turrets and killing Riven if she tried to stop her, even at early levels she just chunked away at the turret. She had about 10 deaths by the end of the game but that was mainly because we always had to use so much to kill her. They ended up winning that game after her team started taking objectives whilst we gooned her top,  and we ended up losing the game, there was no doubt it was because of the Vayne.\nIf you just pressure the lane enough the enemy team is either going to have to force a dive at mid (For some reason the game seems to turn into an aram as soon as one of the first tier bot towers is taken) or come and stop you. And diving is not going to be successful without taking a lot of damage or casualties, meaning even if your team loses one tower they have the chance to defend the next if the entire enemy team is on 1/2 hp and missing one player. You mentioned you played Trynd as well, he's another one of those champs you have to expend quite a bit to kill because if you don't he's just going to roll up and two-shot your squishies, more people top or mid means less to defend other parts of the map.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-27T02:12:05.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried just hyper-carrying your own lane? Maybe you could push hard enough to relieve the pressure from the other lanes, or get fed yourself before your enemies get fed from your team-mates. The problem is though (I have said this before), with LoL, it's safer to initially assume that everyone on your team is retarded and everyone on the other team are Professionals or some other really good guys. This stops you from doing really team-orientated things that rely on the work of team mates you know won't help/realise what you are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-27T03:14:18.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always assume my team mates are much worse than my opponents, generally because its true 80% of the time.\nI've tried playing champs like Trynd where you just push top lane so at least one lane gets an inhib but I find that even when I bring up another champ, my team still loses 4v3.
