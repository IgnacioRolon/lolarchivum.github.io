(serious)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am genuinely interested. After years of playing, working my way from silver to platinum I've realised that other than the improved likelihood of having a more structured game, there isn't much else point to solo queue. \r\n\r\n- You more or less have to pick string FOTMs or else the other team will\r\n- People give up way earlier (just had two games surrender @ 20 on the dot, both    games I was 4/5-0 but other lanes had had a bad game therefore \"it was over\"\r\n- The amount of second accounts in this ELO is insane\r\n\r\nSo after all these years of caring, trying hard to climb up by myself I've realised whilst you can try your best, even if you carry as hard as possible, you'll still probably end up with a 50-50 win rate (I argue this as I have played on diamond accounts and still won). So I'm going to give 5 man teams a good go in the new season, and I look forward to playing with my friends, and remembering why I loved this game rather than it feeling like a chore sometimes haha :)","replies":[{"poster":"GnarkillAU","date":"2014-12-05T13:25:45.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really valid point OP. At the end of the day, people have a lot less invested in games were they don't know anyone. If I'm playing with friends, and we do an insane turn-around - then that is definitely going on the minutes at the pub. If I don't know anyone however, then when I am doing bad, I don't really expect anybody on the team to really have my back. So, I think the real problem with solo-queue is that teamwork is entirely intuition and a 20-minute game is not nearly long enough to work out how people are thinking / playing, and consequently, how you can best help them. \n\nThis - leads to why FOTM picks are so common - the intention is to carry because you can't rely on your team. An also, to why people want to surrender at 20 when the game starts to go bad for them  - again, because you can't carry. Teamwork is a crucial component of the game, a component which is sadly entirely unreliable in Solo-Queue because of its nature, (not knowing your team). Real teams play lots of games to build up intuition with one another. \n\nAlso, I find victories are rarely satisfying in Solo-Queue. Often the enemy defeats itself more than you actually win - because of these very reasons. Those are just my thoughts and hey, I think after mulling over my take on solo-queue I'm off to put together a proper team with my buddies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MouseDestruction","date":"2014-12-07T10:44:24.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definatly win more duo's than solo's because i pick my friends from the good ones lmao (1 less feeder on the team). However a team is a lot different than solo/duo in that you cant really just login and start a match, they pretty much ALL use a microphone headset combo (making the calls a lot faster and deadlier),  the tactics vary a lot more and people will group a lot faster for things like 4 man bot lane ganks or dragons because its less about YOUR GOLD and more about TEAM GOLD (or gold going to the right people at least)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-05T17:23:10.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id love to be able to have a stable duo/5 man team setup. Problem is people have thinfs to do jobs, repsonsibilities, maintain proper sleep. So I might get like 10% of my daily league time a month to playing with a friend. The rest cause I'm on during off peak times is on to solo q. It's just how it is really.","replies":[]}]}
