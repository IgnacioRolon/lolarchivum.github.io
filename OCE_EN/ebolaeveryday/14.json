I had a 25 game penalty which I played out and as mentioned earlier, was pretending to be a bot so was barely talking. \r\n\r\nLogged on today to find that I have a 16 game ban. This isn't the first time it has happened, finishing a set amount of chat restrictions to only find more randomly appear later on. It's really annoying as I enjoy chatting to people and generally only get frustrated when someone AFKs or trolls, which in my opinion deserves all the abuse they get\r\n\r\nBasically, is the system just automatically giving me chat restrictions without human processing or am I just getting screwed over?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-03-21T14:27:58.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\ncheck out our player behaviour FAQs http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq\n\nJust a quick thing about your specific situation though, no matter how bad you think your language is when talking to others to get a chat restriction means you are getting reported but other players quite a bit.\n\nThe fact that you got a 25 game penalty and now it is down to another 16 means you have shown slight improvement but not enough to get you completely off.

Can you please explain how can you justify ruining my game experience, when the person that AFKd will have no consequence for their actions? And how you can possibly restrict someone over getting frustrated over something like that? Honestly, two restrictions was all it took?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-03-24T23:43:39.375+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI know its frustrating getting AFK's in your games. I looked through your last 5 losses briefly and couldn't see at a glance who was afk except for one game where you were katarina and a lucian afked (I was looking at gold earned time line graphs). Would you mind going through your last few games and letting me know who else afked?\n\nHowever, that does not excuse you flaming and abusing other players in game. Two wrongs don't make a right. Not only have you been reported multiple times over the last two days (way more than 2) I also went through your chat logs just in case your concerns around our system being inaccurate are correct. The language you used was terrible, and you're always blaming your team in chat. If you would like I can quote some of your chat logs that probably got you reported.\n\nIf you would like to receive less chat restrictions, I highly suggest typing less in game. Only say things when its positive, if your teammates screw up don't berate them and put them down, they probably already know they screwed up. Encouragement works a lot better than flaming and calling out other peoples mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-25T00:58:16.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If you would like I can quote some of your chat logs that probably got you reported.\n\nYes please.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T05:13:01.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been reported for failure to communicate...when I was chat restricted. That is obviously a problem right there\n\nI had a game before where a teemo fed my mid lane 10 kills from running down the lane. He said his dog died today and was sad. No one yelled at him and we ended up winning a 4v6 as he continued to just run down lanes and die. I don't abuse someone for doing stuff like that. What I abuse is people blatantly bullying people, hell one guy even said he hopes my dad (who has cancer) dies. And then I get reported for saying that guy is an a-hole. \n\nI love the game, but sometimes I think I should just remove league from my life because the community is riddled with people that think just because their typing rather than talking their words have zero repercussions.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T05:47:30.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So this weekend I have had:\n10 games with AFKs\nFailed 5 sets of promos due to AFK or intent feeders\n80% of games I have received bullying or abuse\n\nYet I'm still the one that gets chat restricted?
