It's making progressing impossible, if anything I'm dropping due to unluckiness of when I win. I play the same, I've stuck with playing the one champ{{champion:90}} , I always win my lane. Is it literally just a matter of luck with getting good team mates and bad team mates in a row?\r\n\r\nI'm assessing my play style, trying to improve but I honestly think my ranked games just come down to luck of the draw with team mates","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-03-24T19:41:14.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personal experience I can relate with you here. I would not say it's on luck however it depends on the day and the timezone that you are playing on but don't let that be a huge factor in your games. If you are winning your games in a streak that's good for you, keep up. However if you are in a losing streak and this in my opinion means 2-3 games, stop and call it a day due to the games pressure and how are assessing the situation right now. I would advise on having a duo partner to play with you or take the solo queue path to continue on with improving your games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T17:28:50.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should stop playing as soon as you loose one game and do something else then come back.. and if you loose again then just leave and come back untill you get your winstreaks again lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-03-23T09:27:26.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO I believe the prime source of losing streaks is losing 1 or 2 games, and then becoming frustrated or annoyed which affects your gameplay/attitude to teammates resulting in more games lost. \n\nAnswer is very simple, take a break from ranked (or normals if your at that stage).","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-03-22T05:16:28.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malz is decent if you know what you are doing, sort of like Heimer in a sense that you shove all day.... after shoving extract  a cs lead, then get kills, then 1v2 (you shove their mid in, their jg arrives for a gank, their laner rly wants cs, their jg dies, the laner tries to go for you, you kill them too, or just flee. or your jungler does a counter gank and they get rekt in a 2v2 fight, Malz weakness is cc champions (leo/amumu/ww)","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-22T00:51:28.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar is a pretty awful champion to 'carry' or win games with there is a reason I haven't seen him win a game past plat, he is far too tied to his high cooldown ult which is incredibly easy to interrupt or cleanse off, outside that he offers literally no cc and ok damage at best.\n\nIf you're serious about laddering you need to learn mids like Ori / Syndra / Zed / Ahri / Fizz etc.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T01:06:46.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got to plat with Malz last season and he has a 60% win rate, so I don't think he's as awful as people seem to suggest\n\nBut I guess I can try and learn to carry with Ahri, she seems pretty simple","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-22T01:14:05.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EbolaEveryday,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ZVzEYAYM,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-22T01:06:46.713+0000)\n>\n> I got to plat with Malz last season and he has a 60% win rate, so I don't think he's as awful as people seem to suggest\n> \n> But I guess I can try and learn to carry with Ahri, she seems pretty simple\n\nHe can obviously win games, but nowhere near the level the suggested champs can, I can promise you if you get to diamond3+/master with malz you'd lose 70% of your games simply because his kit is so easy to counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-22T02:00:38.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who do you reckon is the best out of the recommended?
