I think the only counter to Zac when his team&#039;s ahead is having a backline with dashes or something to dodge his Q because if he lands it on you, as a squishy, you&#039;re pretty much dead because of all the hard CC and damage, even when he builds full tank and that&#039;s kind of fucked.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s been too many team fights I&#039;ve had where he can just engage and combo on the backline, kill a few people and then have his team steam roll the survivors for me to believe this guy is healthy.  Am I the only one on this train of thought?  It&#039;s entirely possible I&#039;m missing something pretty key to playing vs Zac because I am low elo afterall.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-10T22:03:45.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think Zac Is too much of a problem, he is a very strong champion, but is not without weaknesses. Buying items with grievous wounds, like morellos or mortal reminder, or just igniting him at the beginning of a battle, actually gets rid of a lot of his tankiness. \n\nThe one thing i would nerf, if i was in charge however, would be the cooldown on his elastic slingshot. I think its fine for engaging a battle, its strong and sets up awesome ganks. But when he can use it a second time during the fight, to chase fleeing low HP enemies, i think it becomes a little too strong. \n\nMy advice would be to play Zac for a while, learn how he plays and when he has his moments of downtime, then next time you fight him, you can recognise when he is at his weakest. ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-10T20:11:30.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean his long range engages are easy to step out of if your paying attention, especially since the nerf he got with the added visibility on his E.\n\nThat said in low elo, no one is paying that much attention.\n\nAlso basically any CC stops the Zac E, the main thing you need to do is just have a lot of vision and see him before he gets into position.","replies":[]}]}
