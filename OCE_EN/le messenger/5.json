How does this system work?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, \n\nI just wanted to know how the match making system works?  I was silver last season so I have the banner around my portrait. A lot of games I&#039;ve played in ranked the last couple of days have had an abundance of people on my team who were gold / silver last season while the opposition has no banners around their portrait. I&#039;m assuming they were unranked last season so it doesn&#039;t seem very fair to be vsing them in ranked, especially since I&#039;ve been winning a lot of those games.  I was Bronze II on Tuesday and now I&#039;m Silver IV but suddenly every game I&#039;m getting dumped on which brings me to the next question:\n\nDoes the system have a way of keeping you at around 50-60% win rate by matching you with people who have been on losing streaks or something?  I don&#039;t play consistently well in every game and even a game where I&#039;ve messed up is easy to turn around in my division but sometimes it&#039;s clear some players on my team have their own agenda.  C&#039;mon, I know you know what I&#039;m talking about. Also what&#039;s the deal with promos?  I&#039;m guaranteed to be matched with people who are unranked in at least one of my promo games.  I&#039;d expect that in a promotion to Bronze IV or III but not Silver... Anyway it&#039;s not the end of the world but I just wanted to know if my suspicions are warranted about the 50-60% theory.\n\nSincere thanks for any answers,  \n\nRyan (le Messenger)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-01T09:13:49.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">an abundance of people on my team who were gold / silver last season while the opposition has no banners around their portrait.\n\nThe portraits of your opponents are hidden from you. This was because people were complaining about the fact that they were versing people who were higher than bronze.\n\nRest assured, your opponents have roughly the same division spread as your team.\n\n>Does the system have a way of keeping you at around 50-60% win rate by matching you with people who have been on losing streaks or something?\n\nDo you know how MMR works? It basically confirms this.\n\nEvery player has a hidden value called their match-making rating (MMR for short), and this value determines which other players they get matched with while queueing. When nine other players have been found who have similar MMR to the queuing person, they are divided into two teams which have roughly the same total MMR (if you were to add up the total MMR of both teams).\n\nThe way MMR is calculated is simple. You get an \"average\" MMR score (which from memory, I think is around a thousand points), and then every game you have affects that number. As you play more games, your MMR is slightly less affected than it was before, until you reach a cap, where all your future games affect your MMR in the same way. When you play a game and win, you gain MMR based on the MMR difference of your team compared to the opponents in a logical fashion. For instance, if you played a game where your team's MMR was lower than your opponents MMR, and you win, you'd gain a lot of MMR (relatively speaking, of course) because the game expected your team to lose that match. Inversely, if you win a game where you had greater MMR than your opponents, the MMR gain you reap will be minimal.\n\nThe very nature of this system kind of ensures that you have a 50% win-rate, as the higher MMR you get, the more likely you'll lose your next game, as you'll be continually be matched against opponents who are outside of your real skill. For people who are having losing streaks (be it from tilt, lag or other reasons), they will be matched with the lower classed players and will dominate until they reach their proper MMR again.\n\ntl dr; MMR makes sure you roughly have a win/loss ratio of 50/50.\n\n>I'd expect that in a promotion to Bronze IV or III but not Silver\n\nIn most games, you are expected to verse people from one league higher/lower than yours. For example, if you're silver, then you might have a few bronzies or goldies mixed in somewhere. If you play during the more popular times, this is less likely to happen as there is a larger pool of waiting players to pick from.\n\n\nHope this helps clear some things up.","replies":[]}]}
