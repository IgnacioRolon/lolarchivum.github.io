At the moment my knowledge of which champion is &quot;end-game&quot; and &quot;early game&quot; is from watching LCS or streamers talk about the champion but I don&#039;t understand why.  ADC is pretty easy to tell because they shit all over everyone end-game but I mean for bruisers and assassins (I want to say tanks but I figure all tanks are end-game as well.) Is there a pattern in certain champion stats that make them end-game or early game, or is it in the level ups to the abilities? How do people know which level is the &quot;power spike&quot; or which item is a &quot;power spike&quot; for the champion? \r\n\r\nAlso I hear streamers say things such as &quot;cooldown reduction scales really well with this champion&quot; for example and I was wondering how you can look at a champion and know which stats just work better for that champion?\r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated, \r\n\r\nMessenger","replies":[{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-12-08T03:11:11.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey mate, so you ask some really good questions which would probably take a book to truly answer, but you'll no doubt get enough answers from people here to give you a good idea.\n\nSo the first thing you seem to ask about is early game versus late game. The easiest way to tell is by two factors.\n\n1. How many of their abilities (Q, W, E, R) are primarily damage dealing? and\n\n2. How much does the damage increase as each ability is levelled?\n\nIf a champion has 3 or 4 damage dealing abilities they can generally be guaranteed a strong late game. This is because, unlike some of the 1 or 2 damage ability champions, they are doing more damage for every level up to 18. This is part of what makes a champion scale. A good example of this is Jax, who has 4 damage dealing abilities. If he can get to the late game without either falling behind or by being really fed he will be a late game monster. \n\nSome champions have multiple damage dealing abilities but these do not increase by a large amount each level. A good example of this is Sion's E, which does not scale well into the late game because it's bonus damage is built from AP, which Sion rarely builds.\n\nIf a champion is said to have high base stats (in AP or AD or whatever) it means that their natural level increase for their stat/s keeps them in the game. Tanks usually fall into this category, and some juggernauts and bruisers, because their high base (or natural) strength will slow them to build armor, etc without being useless in lane.\n\nAn early game champion is pretty much any assassin and mage where their ability damage increase in the early levels allows them to get the jump on their opponents. Some of these champions do not need item bonuses early, but if they don't have the items going into the mid-late game they will lack any pressure on the map.\n\nItem Power spikes come from a suddenly increased strength from the item which directly supports the champions kit. Kayle with Nashors Tooth, Akali with Hextech Gunblade. It allows their champ to get a big boost to what they previously had. If used will the power spike can catch their opponent off guard with less items.\n\nLevel power spike is based on abilities, and what they allow. Warwick for instance has a huge power spike at level 6 because of his ult.\n\nI want to write more but my lunch break is over. Hope this helps a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-12-08T06:42:03.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Geez thanks for using your lunch break to answer the post mate!  So let's use Darius as an example.  What you're saying is since he has high base stats and 4 damage dealing abilities, he's classified as an end-game champion?  Darius seems to be strong at all stages of the game to be honest. So what makes him different from an end-game champion like Jax and who would you say is stronger?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-08T07:27:37.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is primarily classified as a **fighter**, with **tank** being his secondary role which means he fits into the same category as jax who also is primarily classified as a **fighter**. However, jax's secondary role is **assassin** which means he functions similar to katarina, talon, rengar etc in terms of progressively getting stronger the more items and kills he gets. Now because darius is also a **tank** he is able to build health, fed or not, and still able to comeback and fight higher fed opponents. This is just the way tanks work, there primary focus, unlike other champions, don't come from **offense**, but from **defense**. This is why with darius you can build black cleaver then just build straight tank and still have a major impact in fights and solo a lot of the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
