I began to play the game by logging on my smurf/alternate account. I was thrilled to start a game with my friends. During the process, a strange occurrence was present: my main account, Arashi was online. Now, this happened 5 days ago and the anonymous person on my account was in-game and played ranked matches. I was displeased to see this and thought he was hacking me. I attempted to log in and observed a wrong password text box: the anonymous has hacked and changed my password in my account. A few days later, an unpleasant event has happened: my main account has received a permanent ban for hacks, scripts or 3rd party programs. I understand that League of Legends is a fair game and everyone is required to have a fair gameplay. However, I do not recall any suspicious programs that can enhance my gameplay to the extent of receiving a permanent ban. I do admit I have used MKLOL once before just to experiment it. Not only that, the only program I have been using is &#039;Baron Replays&#039;&#039;, a program with the sole reason to record games and view it as replays. This is not a program that can enhance my gameplay but a program for me to view various plays or mistakes presented in games. I ask this to you: Has your company banned any innocent players who have not used any suspicious gameplay enhancing programs? A friend of mine has also received an identical ban which is permanent with the exact same reasons. Therefore, I request your company, Riot Games, to unban my account that I have put a considerable amount of effort to increase my rank. Thank you for reading this. \r\nFrom Oceanic League of Legends player, Arashi.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-05-20T04:20:43.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the short of it is, your account was caught in a ban wave detecting the use of MKjogo, but the ban was overturned as it appears the application is no longer in use. Please avoid using applications like this in future as it may still lead to a ban of your account.","replies":[{"poster":"4 7","date":"2016-05-26T06:21:08.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can give warnings to other players but instantly ban others that have been playing since the game came out how ridiculous. i feel so defeated with the crap reply's i receive during my tickets. mr Gehirn id love for you to investigate my accounts as i have been falsely accused and been fighting with you guys for over 2 months about it now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arashi","date":"2016-05-20T06:19:40.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, yes about that one, I deleted that about 7 months ago, but there was no way to Uninstall it, seriously, my friend told me to download it for testing, but that was 2 years ago, the time when I was using it for skins, but I never used that feature again for a long time, and then I knew it was time I should not use those skins ever again, so I chose to delete it,  but for some reason as I was about to delete it, there was no way, I went online and there were forums about people asking and I couldn't find any solutions to it at all, as well as the 1 day ban I got last time, I chose to delete it again, but yet again, no way, I tried looking online but no solution again, so I'm not sure whether the program lasts even If I delete it or not.","replies":[]}]}]}
