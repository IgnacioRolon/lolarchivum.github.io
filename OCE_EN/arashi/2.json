But what i think does matter, is the public's perception of Yasuo.\n\n**Straight up:** Most people hate him.\n\nWether he is the highest skilled champ in any game ever and is pathetically weak, or wether he is a braindead OP monster, is irrelevant. People HATE him.\nThey hate his spamabillity, they hate his guaranteed crit-strke lifesteal, they hate his windwall, and they hate his mobility. He just isn't fun to play against for most people.\n\nSo for arguments sake, lets assume that he is perfectly balanced. If such a high population of people don't like him this much, can you really call him healthy for the game? Even if numbers-wise he is balanced. \n\nI personally would tend to vote \"No\", it isn't healthy. \n\nVayne sits in a similar boat atm, she is an awesomely fun champion, with a normal win rate. But people just despise playing against her. \nAnd in a game where \"fun\" is the goal _(which is the fundamental point of ALL games.)_, having a champion that no one likes except the people who play them, does negatively affect the game, even if they aren't OP in terms of gameplay. \n\n\n____________\n\nThis is why I think Yasuo is getting nerfed, not necessarily because he is OP, but because the people's view of him is so tainted with red, that Riot feels the healthiest thing to do, is to bring him down a peg or two _(wether his gameplay needs it or not.)_\n\nIf they didn't, and Yasuo just kept getting worse and worse in people's minds, it would get harder and harder to fix their perception as time goes by, until the point where there is so much hate for him, that Riot have no choice but to re-work him. \n\nSo a flu-shot now, prevents Yasuo being crippled later on. \n\nThat is what I think Riot's strategy is.\nOf course this is just my speculation, but it makes sense... \n_(The alternative is that he truly is just broken and cancerous... What story do you want to believe?)_","replies":[{"poster":"Arashi","date":"2016-12-13T23:56:58.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Well if people hate yasuo that much, shouldn't their #1 priority be learning how to counter yasuo? I mean their are many salty silvers, bronzies and even more, yes I understand that his damage is completely broken, but his skill cap becomes 10x harder in higher elos, even though I do well as Yasuo in ranked games he is really easy to counter, as long as Yasuo feeds then he is no longer capable of doing anything, once he is so behind he is literally useless, it's a 4v5, and I have vsed Yasuo several times, yes I can agree he is cancer at times to face but I often win the lane because I know what mistakes they will make and I will expect them to do things that are obvious, I think yasuo is in a perfectly balanced spot right now, he only got nerfed a few patches ago with the Phantom Mallet and does not need another nerf, This nerf forced yasuo to build normally, nothing has changed really if you ask me as a Yasuo main.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-14T01:24:00.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The #1 priority of many medical centres is trying to cure diseases, but even though they can cure them, they still hate disease. \nIts no different here, its not a matter of wether people can play against him or not, either way they just don't like him!\n\nYou talk about low elo like it doesn't matter. Less than 10% of players are higher than Gold, that means that the vast majority of gamers ARE low elo. By saying \"Yasuo isn't a problem because high elo players can counter him\" Are you saying that the needs of the majority should be ignored, just because Yasuo isn't cancerous for less than 10% of players?\nWhat makes higher elo so special? They are a minority here. \n\nYou say \"I think that Yasuo is in a perfectly balanced spot right now\" but you are a huge minority, you're a very high elo player who mains Yasuo. \nYou are NOT a low elo player who has to fight against Yasuo in every second game. Your perception of 'balance' is going to be vastly different to the rest of the world's.\n\nand we all have a soft spot for our favourite champions, they nerfed Rylais recently, and i moaned about how that would affect Azir/Sol/Taliyah because they are my mains, my concern for them made me argue against the nerf, and so blinded me to how powerful Rylai's actually was, and how much it negatively affected the game. \n\nNone of us want to admit that we are doing well because our champion has an unfair advantage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-13T08:41:12.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I myself am a Yasuo Main, i think he is 100% balanced, he has lots of counterplay\n\nThat's what everyone says about their main and it's not necessarily true, and just because everything is fine in high elo doesn't mean its ok not to do anything to the champ, every elo matters and if everyone in the lower elos are in hell because of a stupidly broken champ then something has to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"F6fire","date":"2016-12-13T16:54:06.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There's a champion ban system in place for that.

The problem doesn't lie in high elo though, it lies in lower elo. Yasuo was a decent pick throughout early season 6, then something happened, and now Yasuo is a godly pick, if you don't see anything wrong with that then you should've gone to specsavers. The problem with Yasuo is that any player can just pick him up and do well with him without knowing anything about him or his matchups. A good Yasuo player will demolish, but so will a bad one because of how Yasuo is being played/built. His build allows him to go tanky making him stronger than crit Yasuo in the mid/late game while still being strong in the early game. The thing about this Meta is that if someone is going tanky, you have to be able to kill them early to shut them down, that concept alone is hard enough to follow for someone i low elo. The fact that Yasuo can dominate both early and late game while still having a good mid game is just not balanced. The nerf to his ult only hits his early game which i hardly think it's enough IMO. Yasuo's win rate goes up the more the game goes on, people struggle with Yasuo in the late and mid game more than they do in the early game, so the fact that they nerfed his ult in the early game is kinda pointless. I hardly think that this only occurs in low elo and i'm sure some people in high elo feels the same way, I personally know that counter play exist for Yasuo but building items or picking team comps are not the way to go.  Sorry if i didn't explain anything properly feel free to ask if you don't understand anything, not very good at explaining. Hope this helps clear why Yasuo is getting nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-13T11:41:32.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am yet to see a single person who has just \"picked him up and done well\"\n\nAnd the winrate goes up as time goes on because it gives team mates longer to carry his ass.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-13T11:37:39.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is even if a yasuo is 6/13 people call him broken because they died to him a few times, most of the time a yasuo does feed anyway, they still call him broken because they got cocky and caught off guard.","replies":[]}]}
