Get him in there now! We can&rsquo;t lose this one if we can help it!&rdquo; hissed the stern female voice once more.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working as fast as I can Sandra, but if I don&rsquo;t do this right, it won&rsquo;t matter anyway&rdquo; replied the young whitehaired man.\n\n----\n\n&ldquo;Where am I? Who are you? What have you done with me!?&rdquo; rasped an echoing voice. &ldquo;Who are you? What have you done with me?&rdquo; repeated the voice once more. &ldquo;Let go of me, get off.&rdquo; Echoed the same voice, but clearer than the last words he had said. The young man continued his procedure, grabbing the man&rsquo;s left arm and locking it against the inside of the chamber. &ldquo;I said let go of me!&rdquo; yelled the man as he swung his right fist into Weisholder, flinging him across the room and knocking him unconscious. Quickly the man scrabbled at his left hand in an attempt to get out of the coupling holding him. \n\n&ldquo;Damn failure&hellip;&rdquo; spat Sandra, drawing her sidearm, taking careful aim towards the subject&rsquo;s head. \n\nThe man sensing the danger doubled his efforts, finally breaking the coupling and freeing his hand. Sandra pulled the trigger and a thundering roar echoed throughout the room. Feeling a familiar weight his hip the man faster than lightning drew his weapon and slashed the air in front of him, creating a pulse of energy that stopped the projectile dead in its tracks. The small pellet clattered to the ground. The woman stared shocked and wide eyed, before loosing another 3 bullets, each with the same result as the first. The man with his weapon in hand dashed to the woman within the blink of an eye, and without remorse plunged his weapon deep into her chest.\n\nThe man scanned his area, before finally locating the exit. As he exited the room he noticed a small lit up board inlaid into the wall, slowly blinking two words, one of which he knew very well&hellip; Yasuo. Ignoring this he dashed around the building before finally finding his way out&hellip; \n\n----\n\nThe world this man once knew was gone, replaced by machines and buildings which could only exist in the imagination, Buildings taller than even the sacred oak of Ionia, standing tall, glowing with a multitude of colours and symbols. \n\n&ldquo;Never have I seen such sorc&hellip;&rdquo; he stopped short as he realised. His body plated in armour, but unlike any he had seen or even heard of, and his sword was not just steel, but combined with a glowing substance, the colour of the sun&hellip; Masking his face was a visor, transparent on the inside as to seem he was wearing nothing, but a deep orange on the other, which hides all within. Astounded the man dropped the helmet which he was wearing not moments before, &ldquo;What is all of this? Where am I? What happened to my home&hellip; what is this place?&rdquo; \n\n----\n\nWhat seemed like hours had been but mere moments, a figure flickering in and out of existence between the shadows, with naught but red streaks of light to trace him. Yasuo dashed as fast as he could through the empty streets, ducking and weaving so as to avoid the menacing metallic disks which flew at him from the shadows at all angles. \n\nA scream echoes through the streets catching Yasuo off guard, he paused for but a moment to triangulate the source of the sound, but that moment was a fraction too long, as one of the accursed blades nicked his thigh, biting through his armour as if it was never there. Quickly, he began his dash once more, though his destination altered. \n\n----\n\nThe young woman, elegant auburn hair, falling to her shoulders and wearing but a simple bliaut. The woman slowly edges backwards, stalked by a woman with ashen hair wielding knives. It was a long chase, but now she was trapped. Nowhere to go&hellip; Nowhere to hide. She took one step more before tumbling over the side of the colossal building, screaming as she began to plummet to her doom, her hair flailing in the wind, revealing glimpses of a small bird like trinket.\n\n----\n\nWith increasing power in his strides, Yasuo dashed ever faster, releasing such force that the earth buckled beneath him, before finally leaping through the air towards the falling woman, gracefully catching her before landing with a slight thud. Another blade flashes past Yasuo, &ldquo;AHAHAHAHA, you would throw your life away for what? A speck of dust? Pathetic.&rdquo; Spat the shadow shrouded figure. &ldquo;Every life is precious monster&hellip;&rdquo; responded Yasuo before he drew his blade, &ldquo;If you want me so much, come and get me.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;With pleasure&rdquo; replied the shade, &ldquo;None escape their shadow... only the worthy will survive!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Kill me? You can try.&rdquo; Not even before Yasuo had finished speaking the shade rose out of his enemy's shadow, slashing towards Yasuo's nape, but Yasuo managed to avoid the attack, clutching the woman close to his chest as he swiftly side stepped, and as if in one motion, thrust his blade into his foe&rsquo;s chest. Realising the tactic did not work the shade changed his approach, instead creating a multitude of shadow figures, each simultaneously dispersing razor sharp shuriken towards him. Yasuo slashed the air and a barrier formed once more, stopping all of the blades dead. Enraged the shade yelled, &ldquo;No technique is forbidden!&rdquo; before fading away. \n\nThe gathering energy was all that Yasuo needed to warn him, swiftly weaving to his left as the enraged fiend materialised beside him, once again dodging the following slash, and once more, Yasuo thrusted his blade into his foe. The blade began to hum with a powerful energy, an energy that Yasuo knew well, but could not quite remember. Carefully, Yasuo lowered the frightened woman to the ground, &ldquo;No matter what you hear or see, do not move from this spot, do you understand?&rdquo; Wide-eyed, she nodded. Without another word Yasuo turned and dashed towards his enemy, releasing the energy build up into his blade, blasting the shade airborne. With this he remembered the sensation... three swift strikes and fight was over, the shade no more. &ldquo;Sh&hellip;sh&hellip;she is coming.&rdquo; Stammered the woman. &ldquo;Humph, well whoever she is, she isn&rsquo;t going to find us.&rdquo; Replied Yasuo before picking up the woman once more and continuing his dash towards the outskirts of the city.\n\n---\n\n&ldquo;Are you alright&hellip;&rdquo; asked the man, &ldquo;Talia, my name is Talia.&rdquo; Answered the woman. &ldquo;Are you alright Talia?&rdquo; asked Yasuo as he gently put her down. &ldquo;Yes, quite so. Thankyou&hellip;Mr.?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Yasuo.&rdquo; He replied bluntly. &ldquo;Yasuo&hellip; I have heard that name before&hellip;&rdquo;responded the woman gently. &ldquo;\n\nThat trinet looks familiar&hellip;&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Hmm? What trinket?&rdquo; asked the woman with a puzzled expression, before realisation came over face, &ldquo;Oh this?&rdquo;, gesturing to the trinket resting in her hair, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ancestor Taliyah&rsquo;s, this trinket has been passed down from mother to daughter for generations now. You’ve probably already guessed, but I was named after her.” \n\n&ldquo;Little Sparrow&hellip;&rdquo; the man gently whispered to himself, with a slight smile.\n\n----\n\n&ldquo;Run, get out of here! I&rsquo;ll hold her off!&rdquo; yelled Yasuo towards Talia as he ducked and weaved, avoiding the knives flashing towards his head. &ldquo;Intriguing, I didn&rsquo;t take you for the sort of person who would care.&rdquo; Sneered his enemy. &ldquo;Why are you doing this, you could be so much more!&rdquo; said Yasuo through a clenched jaw. &ldquo;Why? Because I can&rdquo; hissed the ashen haired woman in response, breaking into a laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made my choice.&rdquo;\n\nA loud scream came from behind Yasuo, he turned in time to see the same shadow cloaked monster he killed but a few days ago, melding into the shadows, taking Talia with him. Yasuo stood frozen for a moment, unsure how to proceed. \n\n&ldquo;Only fools hesitate&rdquo;, several blades buried themselves into his back. \n\n----\n\n“Well hello there, remember me?” jeered Weisholder. “Humph…” grunted Yasuo, “Don’t think I have. Who could forget meeting a talking snowball?”\n“Amusing. But you killed Sandra. So what do you think would be a punishment worthy of that?” Yasuo gave a steely gaze without response. “Well if you won’t provide me with one, then how about this? I will finish what Sandra started. And once that process is complete, I’ll force you to kill that girl you tried so hard to save?” sneered Weisholder, “How about it?”\n\n“You bastard!”, Yasuo Roared, “I’ll Kill you”.\n\n“Yes, I’m sure you will” he replied sneering.\n\n----\n\nInitialising&hellip; \nHelix link established.\nStart-up protocols engaged. \nXX-250 ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER UNIT ENGAGED//\nMC-2 FIRING PISTON ENGAGED// \nProtocol LAST BREATH// initialising&hellip;\nPROTOCOL ENGAGED//\nPROJECT: YASUO ONLINE&hellip;","replies":[]}
