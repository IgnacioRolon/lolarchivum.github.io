Then Dreadnova Darius was released and as a Darius main (I know....don&#039;t ask) I had to have it. From just opening Boxes and Keys I was rewarded and buying Boxes and Keys / Capsules I finally unlocked him. Pretty happy with it except for 1 particular aspect of the skin, this being his shoulders. The skin as a whole is insane and I love it to bits but the shoulders just bugs the hell out of me, mainly the fact that the shoulders (or shoulderpads?) look very thin and like tiny platforms or hot plates instead of proper mean-looking bad ass shoulderpads. Don&#039;t get me wrong the whole fiery metallic look of it is perfect, just the design of the shoulderpads is the issue here. Anyone else agree or disagree? Why?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-12-30T02:08:50.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought since they are a pretty rare set of skins they would at least have some minor vfx changes like with dreadnova darius since he has a breathing mask his voice would sound a bit muffled and robotic like something out of mad max.","replies":[{"poster":"Wording","date":"2017-12-30T11:36:56.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, especially if some people spend hundreds of dollars just to acquire said skins (not saying I spent hundreds of dollars on mine), especially if these skins are exclusive to hextech crafting and not obtainable off the bat through cash. In my opinion they should spend a bit more effort in the hextech gemstone skins, like you said Dreadnova Darius to have a bit more of a muffled robotic voice, maybe Soulstealer Vayne to sound more ghastly, etc. It would be such a shame if they just leave these skins the way they are, like any other easily purchasable skin, especially since these skins are extreme exclusive and have insane potential.","replies":[]}]}]}
