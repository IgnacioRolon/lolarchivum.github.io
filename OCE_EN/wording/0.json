For some reason almost every match I get paired with and/or against people with over 2000 wins and are in gold/platinum. I thought you are only queued with others within the same level/skill group. I constantly get destroyed ofc and its extremely frustrating because there is nothing I can do about it. Is this supposed to happen? Why am I going against such skilled and high ranked players all the time?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-18T02:25:46.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few reasons for that:\n\n+ **Friends are playing as a duo**\n\n It's fairly common for high elo players to play with friends that they've recently introduced to the game.\n\n When this happens the system has to pair them in a game together, and it can sometimes lead to matches which aren't perfectly even in skill. This happens most often at lower levels, once you get better this should happen less frequently.\n\n\n+ **You're playing very late**\n\n I don't know when you usually play League, but your most recent 3 games were between 12:00 am and 1:00 am (AEST). \n\n After midnight the population of players on the server usually drops quite low, which means that there are less people at your skill level to match you up with. In this scenario the matchmaking system will match you in a game with a wider skill gap between players.\n\nThese things happen more often on OCE because we are a smaller server than most. \n\nIf you want really close and competitive games, I'd recommend you play in the ranked queue. Ranked is balanced very seriously and has more restrictions to stop some of these issues.\n\nI hope that helps :)","replies":[]}]}
