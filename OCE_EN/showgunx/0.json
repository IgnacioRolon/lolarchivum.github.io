Do a youtube search for \"worlds 2014 LOL matches\" and watch how the top teams and players in the world play, focus on the players that play the roles you like and what items they tend to get, and whether they swap their trinket up and when. Look at where they place wards - green ward is the invsible sightw ard, pink ward has more hit points is more expensive can be seen but reveals invisible green wards, the warding trinket places an invisible sight ward with a lesser duration to one bought in the shop, and the red trinket reveals in a small area the invisible wards, attack them and kill them. Beyond basic wqrd knowledge an gameplay pick a player from the worlds teams you like in terms of style. Whilst worlds 2014 was a different map, those players stille xist and many have streams you can then follow or watch as they play live. Watch their gameplay, and learn. Have patience and remember that many of the more advanced skills and tricks ingame take a lot of practice. Above all have fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShowGunX","date":"2015-09-24T05:48:11.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you guys for tips. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-31T07:15:26.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be nervous.\nIf people start to piss you off mute them immediately. dont give them a 2nd chance, just makes your mood worse.\n\nFarming is of the utmost importance. You enemy could be 3-0 with 100 cs and you have 180cs. you are much stronger.\n\nIf you play support, Sightstone/Boots should be your first completed item.\n\nIts important to get something from your kills. Whether its a Dragon or tower damage or something. Anything that helps you get a bigger advantage than just the kill alone.","replies":[]}]}
