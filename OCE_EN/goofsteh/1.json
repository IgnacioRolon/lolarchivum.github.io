Im looking for a team/duo to play with with the idea of playing ranked when 30 with the idea of getting to gold for our 1st goal. I currently enjoy playing in the bot lane in both roles with ADC as a pref. \r\n\r\nHit me up ign Goofsteh","replies":[{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-08-09T00:34:39.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do the league community a favor and don't jump straight into ranked when you hit 30. I made this mistake and lost a crap ton of games, you'll be flamed at every game for feeding as well, it's not fun at all. Trust me everyone wants to do ranked straight away but just wait until you get at least 300 normal wins and full Tier 3 rune pages. It'll be much more enjoyable for yourself and your team.","replies":[]}]}
