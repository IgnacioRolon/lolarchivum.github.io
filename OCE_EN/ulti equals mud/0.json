His entire job is to assassinate the high priority targets, and his current combo will easily 100-0 any ADC, and most mages.\nSo regardless of whatever else you think he should be capable of doing, he IS doing just what is expected of him. \n\nHowever! (and here in-lies the problem) There is very little that Talon can do, that other champs (Specifically Zed) cant do better.\nIf you want an AD champion whose purpose is exclusively to eliminate the enemy carries, there is absolutely no reason you should be picking Talon over Zed. Zed's combo is easier, more reliable, not limited by mana consumption, Zed is tankier, less useless without abilities, is 10x better in lane, and has a free escape that doesn't compromise his combo. \n\nThe 1 thing Talon can do better, is roam. \nBut if you are picking a champ purely for roaming purposes, you would be silly to pick Talon over champions like Aurelion Sol/Twisted Fate/Taliyah, who can all roam far more reliably than him, AND offer ~~more~~ actual utility to the team. \n\nThis means that in order for Talon to be a viable pick, you need to have a scenario where you need a roaming mid laner BUT Sol/TF/Taliyah are not viable picks (maybe in a tanky AP heavy team, with a lot of sustained damage, for example) So this makes Talon a very niche champion. \n\n\n**So to clarify:** He isn't bad! he is just only useful in certain situations (much like Galio and Rammus are). Which is perfectly fine, no champion should be useful in every single situation. \n\n________\n\nI think people confuse him with Zed, they think that Talon is just a less-good version of Zed. and so they expect him to be picked into the same situations that Zed is good at, and still do well. But that isn't the case, they are different champions and fulfil different roles. So when you put Talon into a situation that requires Zed, HE WONT DO AS WELL! and because he doesn't do as well, people just think \"Well Talon is rubbish!\" and stop playing him. \n\nIf you actually pick Talon into his niche situation, he is brutally strong. The only problem is: that situation doesn't come around every often. \n\nTherefore, people pick him into situations where he isnt the ideal champion, and then complain that he doesn't do well. Imagine if i picked Galio into a full AD team, and then moaned about how crap he was. Or picked Rammus into a full AP team, and then moaned that i couldn't do much. Everyone would look at you and go \"Dude you're a bit thick.\"\n\nTalon is the same! Of course he wont be good if you pick him into a situation that doesn't suit his playstyle. \n\nThe only problem is that because he is so niche, people who want to play Talon, cant play him anywhere near as much as those people who play champs like Zed or Yasuo who are far more well-rounded. \n\n______________\n\nThis is my view on the whole matter, but I'm not a game analyst, and i could be very wrong. But as a mid laner (who does play Talon, among many others), these are the observations i have made, and the conclusion I have come to. \n\nI hope that seeing a different angle on it, helps your thinking on Talon's situation. \nAnd if you disagree with this, then maybe its me that has it all wrong, and we can have a discussion ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-12T07:02:18.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unlike zed yasuo doesn't have a reliable escape, and as you said zed is tankier.

Yasuo's escape is far better than Zed's, BUT it is very unreliable and requires good planning beforehand, which makes Yasuo a champ with a far higher skill ceiling. \nAnd yea Zed counters Yasuo. The main advantage Yasuo has over Zed, is multi-target sustained damage and utility. But i do think a good Zed will usually beat a good Yasuo, mainly because by the time Yasuo has his tornado ready to fire (which is his turn-the-fight-around move), Zed has dealt all the damage he needs to, and is back under his tower enjoying red wine and chocolates :P\n\nAnd thats true about Talon bullying melee champs (I've been at both ends of this), but Zed and Yasuo are expert lane bullies as well (but unlike Talon, Zed is a bully to ranged champions as well as melee.) and unlike the other two, if Talon tries to bully, he finds himself out of mana very quick.\n\nLike I said, Talon is powerful, but in more so in certain situations than others. \n\nAll 3 assassins have strengths and weaknesses, but i (personally) believe that Talon's strengths don't come around as often as his peers. (but that doesn't mean they arent game changing when they do come around!) It just means that like Galio, you can't pick Talon into as many situations as his peers. \n\nDo you think the same?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-12T08:55:14.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think yasuo is a fighter not an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-12T10:24:06.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No doubt his primary role is fighter but his secondary is assassin, and I reckon the line between the two is very blurred these days..\n\nBut its all subjective I suppose, on what our view of \"assassin\" is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
