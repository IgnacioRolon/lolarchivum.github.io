I came from EUW where i played S1/G5, but got placed in B3 here (yay...). I main jungle and my second is top, although i do very much prefer jungling.\r\n\r\nLooking for somebody who:\r\n- Doesn&#039;t rage. First toxic words out of your mouth and you&#039;re blocked. I don&#039;t play this game for the toxicity.\r\n- Has skype (and mic).\r\n- Isn&#039;t stupid.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s face it, none of us are challengers, we all make mistakes. If we didn&#039;t, we&#039;d be playing in challenger. But trying to duel a 11/3 cait with double farm and 3 more levels, is not good, no matter how good you are.\r\n\r\nAdd me on lol and let&#039;s play some games!","replies":[{"poster":"Smevis","date":"2016-05-23T13:13:27.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to help ;) trynta escape b2 ahah","replies":[]},{"poster":"Horizonn","date":"2016-05-23T12:24:05.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man.
