Went 2/8 in my promos, somehow placed Bronze 2 and just lost from there. I stayed in Bronze 3 for a while until eventually I went on a MASSIVE loss streak and demoted to Bronze 4 0lp, and you guessed it, I quit. But not so much quite but took a break from League. Season 7 rolled around and I decided to have another crack at league. went 3/7 in my promos which didn&#039;t really matter, I still was only able to get Bronze 5. But something sparked in me, and I started actually climbing. It only took me a week to really get back in the swing of things, and after a 5 win streak, I got my promos, went W-L-W and got Bronze 4. But it only went downhill from there, I basically play 4 games and lost all of them, making my elo low enough for me to only gain 15-18 and losing around 21 lp. So far my highest win streak from there so far is 4 games, which I then lost won, and won 2, despite that I&#039;m still standing at this elo.\n\nHere&#039;s my question. What exactly is it going to take to be back at an elo where my 50%-ish win rate will actually mean something in that I&#039;ll be climbing. Pretty much my normal gain and loss being 21+, 15-.","replies":[{"poster":"GunflameSmurf","date":"2017-01-25T21:37:34.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What exactly is it going to take to be back at an elo where my 50%-ish win rate will actually mean something in that I'll be climbing.?\n> \n> \n\nWin games.\n\nAnd for those complaining about not being able to get off Bronze....\n\nI'm currently Silver I Solo, Gold III  Flex\n\nI had a secondary account that my little 8 year old nephew was playing with... he was Bronze 4.\n\nHe said \"Uncle, being bronze is not cool, I want a better medal\"\n\nSince I have a sweet spot for my nephew, I decided to boost his account to gold. 40 games or so later, about 35 wins and 5 loses I'm Silver V (he mostly plays vs bots)\n\nMoral of the story? If you are good enough you will get out of Bronze.  You do not have to be platinum or diamond to carry yourself out of bronze.  Being a high level Silver/low level gold should be enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-25T21:58:51.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Reported for boosting.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-25T22:56:20.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't know, he could have just done duo queue with the little tike and carried.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-27T08:24:33.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I decided to boost his account to gold. \n\nThat was the biggest clue for me.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lovic","date":"2017-01-25T22:32:03.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like I'm not saying 'How do I get out of bronze\" or something like that, I'm just asking how much it will take to raise my elo so that it isn't going to take me all year to get out of bronze...","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-27T08:58:15.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a difficult question when we can't see the exact mmr formulae.

Using the scrubbiest champions out there. Old garen was meh jam. The days of 500 armor, 300 mr, 4.5k hp, 200 ad and 470 movespeed were the days.\n\nJanna is good too. Janna is very good. And they kep buffing her itemisation (with the exception of redemption, which just got a big nerf to its early game.

They don't really try to dodge a tornado you've been charging up for the full duration, they don't really play around your shield or your q cooldown, so if you play around theirs, you'll win pretty much every botlane trade. I don't know why people in bronze think janna is the worst support, but she's actually amazing, easy to play, has better kill potential than most other shield supports barring morg and karma, has amazing disengage and decent damage and the most stupidly ridiculous shield in the entire game. \n\nYou'll also see alot of low elo teamfights where literally all you have to do to win, is stand in the middle of your team, wait for the enemy to use their dashes to engage your backline and then just stand there and ult, maybe use locket and redemption, and because the enemy is bronze, and your team is bronze, nobody will try to cc you, nor disengage, and so the enemy will just brawl it out, despite the fact that you are literally healing your team faster than the enemy can burst them. It is beautiful. Unfortunately this sometimes won't work in silver and almost never work higher than that. People often say soraka is better for low elo, but I strongly disagree, if you can play janna even just a little bit, she has so much more carry potential.\n\nAlso there is nothing funnier than sticking a yolo ludens echo in your build as your 5th item and then bursting the hell out of the enemy master yi when they try to fight you and watching them start throwing a hissy fit about how your champion is broken, op, no skill, ect...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-26T01:53:30.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found it funny when you could build 3000 hp and still have enough supporting items to laugh, and because you look tanky they try target you (i don't know what it is but bronze have a need to focus tanks...) so while they try to kill the disengage queen your carries wipe the floor. Seriously... the only way to kill a janna is to gangbang, or have enough damage to kill her off the bat from an unwarded bush, or (not as easy because of her speed during ur cc) have enough dashes to get her, which im pretty sure is only akali (maybe not her anymore after the double r cd but yea) and kassadin, I mean sure, yasuo would work... if she didn't move faster than he could dash in an infinite minion wave. But back to the point, while they stuff around trying to kill the \"tank\" your team are free to do whatever the fk. And if they do focus your team you have more than enough heal, shield and cc to peel them for a few years. Janna opp.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
