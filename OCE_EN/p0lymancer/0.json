Then we responded by saying yeah right, and then Caitlyn responding using toxic words, so we used toxic words back, Caitlyn did feed that game. Afterwards I got banned, looks like they did report me. Riot can I please have my account back, I admit I said some swear words, but only to reply back to Caitlyn and Varus. Please.

Besides, what the actual f\\*ck does a person's *performance* have to do with their attitude?\n\nSome important things to consider:\n\n1. Someone else breaking the rules does ***NOT*** give you a free pass to do so as well. You will be judged on *any and all* behaviour that is in breach of the established rules and agreements. TLDR: Retaliation is considered to be just as bad as the original offence.\n2. Whether it's one person or a dozen who report you, the end result will be the same. It only takes a *single* report to trigger a review (besides, I'm fairly certain that pre-mades reporting together is weighted differently anyway), and action will only be taken if there is a breach of the established rules/agreements.\n3. Swearing, in and of itself, is not something that is punishable, rather it is how that profanity is used that can result in a punishment. Why the hell do you think there's an *optional* profanity filter?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-07-04T13:48:14.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR; Roast noobs without breaking the rules.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-02T08:28:12.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st wrong board and 2nd you admitted to breaking riot's term of use.","replies":[]}]}
