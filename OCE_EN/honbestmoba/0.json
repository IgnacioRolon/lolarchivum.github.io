Really enjoying playing with friends, but my only issue is the price of the champions... Like wtf. If the entire game [see: every champion available] cost  50 USD i&#039;d be like, sure, take my money. but 10/champion? is this a joke?","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-02-28T09:32:47.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you expect for a f2p (free to play) game? It's all about the micro transactions.\n\nHence why the game is still in a pathetic state full of trolls, intent feeders and assholes.\n\nRiot really don't care as long as people are shoveling their money into skins etc. Hence why they continually and constantly release skins. They are the only solid and constant think about this game.\n\nIt's estimated Riot made $1.6 billion in revenue in 2015, how do you think they made so much cash?\n\nIt's all about the dollars and little focus is actually put into fixing this POS of a game. I mean we don't even have a proper or working support/ban system in place. Sure it works for those who are abusive/toxic which is probably the easiest thing an automated system can pickup on, but the rest and majority who actually ruin the game for others go unpunished. There are still accounts who are known to be scripting, boosting, botting etc playing on to this day months after they have been reported. Riot know their system isn't working as expected yet they sit idle and do little to nothing about it.\n\nYou were probably better off playing dota than this, you'll soon learn just what League is about.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-28T12:08:00.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JesusForgotHisGA,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PM660G8p,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-02-28T09:32:47.281+0000)\n>\n> It's all about the dollars and little focus is actually put into fixing this POS of a game.\n\nHave you heard what job boundaries are sir? Because skin departments and player behaviour department are not directly connected and neither should their schedule and scope of tasks overlap. It's common knowledge.\n\nAlso have you played or even know Dota2? Besides all heroes are f2p by default (they mostly only do that because the game is heavily based around hard-countering), the game is filled to the brim with microtransaction (and it's connected directly to the marketplace like say TF2 or CS:GO so it's so big it's an individual economy now), and the community is just as \"competitive\" as League's, so what's your point?\n\nConcerning punishment: Valve has a myriad of innate advantages when it comes to cheating and player management thanks to the fact a Steam account is just a different beast that has a much heavier responsibility/consequences attached than say a random online game's individual account like League's. But even that being said, it's not like Valve games are cheat or troll free or something considering the games, TF2 and CS:GO in particular (I do not know if Dota2 is also like this) are still known for being quite marked by cheaters and trolls; nor is Riot's punishment system highly ineffective or whatever otherwise why do you think there are so many \"I got wrongly banned\" on forum (especially on NA) in the first place? Trolls, scripters and boosters in LoL just like to always boast that they can go for months and years without ban, to try and justify their position that's all.\n\nReally, besides the balance of the game being constantly really quite questionable and/or just garbage, and Riot's weird fetishes with Esports, otherwise I honestly fail to see how Riot is even doing remotely wrong in the other areas to gain this level of aversion from those fields. But hey.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2017-02-28T15:04:36.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The current system benefits people who do their research.

That rule was introduced when the 6300IP/975RP champs were seriously clogging up the ranks. Currently there are about 30 champs in the 6300IP tier out of the 134 champs, and most of the \"reduced\" champs being now-4800-then-6300 champs, so yeah it kinda helps a bit.\n\nSo nowadays sure, champs cost, but it's actually not that much if you play very frequently considering the amount of people there are who's earned basically the entire game and no longer has anything to spent IP on. But yeah, it's can still be rather annoying for those who don't play often and are just looking to buy champs instead, considering the RP price of champs being pretty darn overpriced in that regard as a whole.\n\nBut aye. For the moment, buy champ with IP instead. As long as you're not a \"disposable\" kind of player, I think you should do fine, just give it some time.","replies":[]}]}
