A good team battle before game determines the kind of strategy your team will place, you will learn a few things, your opponents courage and how strong they will be in a team fight. This way you will need to change the way you will play your champion! \nYour enemy might be a lot more powerful than you, with good teamwork you can always get each others backs\nDon&#039;t fight like rivals with your allies, fight like legends! \nOther tips that are just too important are Warding, scouting, vision,items,runes,attack and spell ratios with champion stats!\nI would Remember to go in early. By this getting the first blood or first minion marathon before level 6 might be the easiest way to get a head start!","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T09:19:31.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"league games arent won","replies":[]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2015-12-16T13:16:30.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just watch the finals of a tournament.
