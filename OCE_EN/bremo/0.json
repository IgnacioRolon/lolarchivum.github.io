So the next day i open my league and sign in and a message appears that i have abandoned a game. As frustrated as i was that i had to reconnect when the game had finished long ago, the game would crash and bring me back to the reconnect stage!  Before this i had to update my directX and reinstall league just to get it working from an DirectX error.  Over and over i tried reconnecting but there was no game to reconnect to. Once i had closed my league on the victory screen, when i had opened it up it would show with the statistics of the game.. i did not leave a game and i am not guilty of it~~~~ {{champion:201}}  and i used Braum Support, which went epic for me!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:41:46.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bremo,\n\nThis is probably a visual glitch.
