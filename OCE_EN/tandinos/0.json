If a person is consistently behaving in an anti-social manner, enough people will report them and they will get a temporary ban for their troubles. Continued violation will result in a more serious case that a red reviews.\n\n>its been %%%%ing ages and yet still nothing\n\nThe Tribunal is not planned to be put back into action.
