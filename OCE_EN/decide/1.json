Especially on smaller regions like OCE, auto-fill is a necessary measure to prevent queues from deteriorating badly.\n\nIt only takes one game of fill/support to get autofill protection, and it doesn't take much to learn a tank support to cover those games. That is the best advice I can offer.","replies":[{"poster":"Decide","date":"2019-04-08T09:48:16.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS IS THE 20TH TIME I HAVENT GOT MID WHAT IS THIS","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-08T09:50:16.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mid is a highly contested role at the moment, so if it's your first pick you're going to be seeing it less.","replies":[{"poster":"Decide","date":"2019-06-22T11:02:56.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want my lane I requested for it so dont waste my time on another role thanks\n'","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-22T12:19:50.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot aren't going to force everyone into hour-long queues just so a small percentage of players who only enjoy one role can always get it.
