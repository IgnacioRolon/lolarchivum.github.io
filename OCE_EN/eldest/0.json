This will be in the local time for each region. The goal is to have it up once the weekend starts (that’s Friday night right?! :P) so we should get three evenings of fast game mode funtimes. This is just a first implementation, if the queue proves to be exceedingly popular, we can always lengthen the window.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-01T09:24:38.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you URF fanboys step aside and admire Draven's special day?\n\nAll jokes aside, something is catFISHY here. Tahm Kench has a skin for Draven Day, and the skin is called Urf Kench, and it looks a lot like the original urf model. This is very obvious, obviously, but why would they release an Urf skin on April Fools if Urf isn't coming out?
