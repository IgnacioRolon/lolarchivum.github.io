His hands bruised, and his stomach empty, he was undoubtedly preparing himself a meal inside. The red haired mercenary couldn&#039;t pass up such a simple shortcut to glory. In her minds eye she saw everyone back at the Crimson Elite thoroughly impressed with her skill. Some would call it luck, but she would pay no heed to that. \r\nCutting the generals throat had been easy, but it was not without reprieve. Her own camp had been ambushed weeks later. She sustained heavy casualties to her men. She sent the rest home to Noxus. Some had asked to come with her, but they now sported bruised faces. She would not tolerate disloyalty. No matter how small or large. \r\nIt had taken weeks. _Weeks_ of tracking through a dense forest near The Institute of War, which the soldiers had been squabbling for territorial dominance of nearby lands. The councilmen at the Institute were not pleased in the slightest. Her red hair a complete mess and her legs ached from sleepless nights making ground on the soldiers, she spotted her adversary. The general stood tall in the centre of the camp. Had more men been added to the battalion?\r\nA fury like no other came over her and she dropped from the treetop. The impact flared pain in her legs hotter than Shurima&#039;s sands. Slowly she started her walk. She wanted to been seen coming. She wanted bloodshed. She wanted vengeance.\r\nHer walk became a jog, and the jog became a run. And when the shouts of guards echoed off the surrounding forest, her run became a sprint. She drew her daggers and cut down the first crowd in her way with superior skill and deftness. As the thickness of the soldiers grew, so did the warm crimson liquid dripping from the front. She slashed out with wild rage and felt the crowd thinning. As she dispatched the last of the men with thrusts through the chest, She slumped with tiredness. Her eye throbbed badly. The captains eyes wide with realisation of death, She threw a single dagger. \r\nKatarina stood strong amongst the weak.\r\n                                                             *           *           *\r\nTale 2-\r\nBraum awoke to the sunlight reflecting off the dust particles of his little farm house that barely housed his massive frame. After a hearty meal of eggs and more eggs, Braum was struggling though the door and out to his sheep and goats. Braum also had a few chickens he liked to give breathtaking hugs to. The cold air of the Freljord whipped around him, making him flex even more. He picked his farm in the mountains out of convenience, as it was near  Rackelstake. The sight of his rams had his heart melting. Even after years of doing the same thing week in week out, Braum was content.\r\n&quot;Baaah&quot; Called out one sheep.\r\n&quot;Yes little one, I am awake!&quot; He replied in his deep and established accent.\r\nThe sheep was only a few moustache twirls away when Braum heard a cry for help distant in the mountains. Braum always kept his ear out so he could lend a hand. Braum considered taking tools, but decided on his massive beceps instead.\r\nBraum approached the mountain to see a huge door. People gathered around the door, and a larger bearded man was hammering away at it with, well, a hammer. \r\n&quot;Help, a little troll boy is stuck inside!&quot; Called one of the crowd members.\r\nBraum cracked his knuckles and went to town on the door. He punched, kicked and asked nicely for the door to open, but none of these worked. He finally took a seat on a nearby boulder. The sun set four times over whilst he sat atop the freezing stone. On the fifth morning it came to him.\r\n_I shall beat down the mountain like father ram_! thought Braum\r\nRock trembled beneath his blows time and time again and soon he was in a pile of treasure bigger than himself! Braum picked up the boy as the mountain started to collapse. Braum grabbed the door and staved off the rock until they were clear of being crushed. Towns people clapped and Braum twirled his moustache and waved, shield in hand.\r\nHe looked down at the boy &quot;What were you doing down there troll boy?&quot;\r\nThe boy answered in a barely audible whisper &quot;Troll King! King!&quot;\r\n                                              *               *                  *\r\nTale 3-\r\nJinx&#039;s smile was like lit fireworks waiting to brighten up the sky. She beamed at the idea of destruction and mayhem. \r\n_This&#039;ll peeve her off_ thought Jinx as she drew Vi&#039;s face with obscenities coming from her forehead. The can of pink spray was half empty so she shrugged and drew a fresh one. Wait. She was at the Piltover Treasury. An idea boomed in Jinx&#039;s head and she put a time and date on the front door of the Treasury, people eyeing her off from inside, but not daring disturb her.\r\nShe planned and planned. EVERYTHING HAD TO BE PERFECT. Of course most of the planning involved half-assed ideas interrupted by other thoughts of mayhem, but oh well! What was a woman to do when so much fun was to be had all day every day??? \r\nAfter a casual armed robbery one day Jinx thought she saw Officer Caitlyn amongst the sent law enforcement. \r\n_If those thing were any further out of her top she&#039;d have to register them_ giggled Jinx.\r\nCaitlyn gave chase, and Jinx led her on a mighty one before coming to a blocked off alley. Jinx drew her blaster and pointed it at the wall. Boom! The wall crumbled and Caitlyn was having second thoughts. She aimed the blaster at Caitlyn as she ran away, Caitlyn not daring overstep such a boundary. Lucky the hole in the wall was big, because it was the last of her Mana!\r\nThe date and time of Jinx&#039;s threat neared. She just couldn&#039;t pick which weapons to bring! She settled for  Fishbones, Pow-Pow, and her Chompers. Riding in on a cruising missile, she jumped off just outside of the treasury. Vi stood at the doors, big fists smoking and all.\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t you get bored of being boring all the darn time?!&quot; Jinx called out.\r\n&quot;Punch First! Ask questions later!&quot; Vi started to charge up her fists. Just as she sprang Jinx tossed up a Chomper and fled inside the building. Dingus thought Jinx.\r\nVi soon appeared inside the evacuated building. She had soot marks all over her body. If she didn&#039;t like that, then she really wont like this. Jinx pulled out the detonator and brought the entire building down. \r\nVi awoke to find herself crushed beneath stone. When she finally resurfaced she saw big pink bold words written in the sky that spelt &#039;GET REKT&#039;","replies":[{"poster":"Topanga","date":"2016-07-05T12:00:33.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh em gee, this is by far the best fan fiction i have read so far. i mean like, the concept of three tales rather than just one whole story really speaks to me. my favorite one is the one about jinx. and man cmon, the humor behind the story is ridiculous! the characters personality's are portrayed brilliantly through this text, and the way you interpreted the lore makes me really want to read the actual lore. i also like how this had little conversation in it - gives you a better opportunity to describe the complexity of the lores. u r cool, this story is cool. xoxoxox gossip girl meets world","replies":[{"poster":"Eldest","date":"2016-07-06T05:44:44.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the heartfelt comment Friend {{champion:21}}","replies":[]}]}]}
