When you first cast Q you can launch it as a wide, but shot range, little knock-up.\r\nAs you let it charge the telegraph will narrow and the knock-up will increase.\r\n\r\nLet me know is this broken? Would this destroy Janna? I feel it would be pretty balanced.\r\nLets discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-08-14T10:46:19.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAs a Janna main (400k+ points) I feel the 'narrow' gale would make it much harder to peel off primary engagers like Zac or lee q. \n\nLike the picture above appears to be a VERY narrow howling gale. To which I don't think I'd be able to get a knock up on a champ, not to mention the hitbox might not even hit some of the smaller/bigger champs. \n\nAre you also suggesting that it continues to have its increased knock up duration the longer you charge it?\n\nAlso if we are to nerf Janna ( I don't want her to get nerfed :( ) BUT... her shield is kinda a 'spamable' kinda ability so the focus should be there or her passive should have more impact/be changed.  Keeping her Q for disengages IMO is crucial to her kit.","replies":[{"poster":"TheHobbits","date":"2017-08-14T20:42:16.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that the narrow would be hard to hit.\nWhat if the full charge was exactly as her Q is right now? But at the start of the charge it is a short, wide small knock up and becomes the spell it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-14T23:47:56.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"janna doesn't really need a buff. Imo they should raise her e mana cost by 10mana (considering how much mana enemies have to invest to break it) or maybe increase the early cooldown by 1s.\n\nIf you wanted to do something interesting to janna's kit, I'd say change her passive such that she gives her allies a big movespeed buff to allies, but only when she hits an enemy champion with an ability, and give it a cooldown like 30s.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-08-15T10:31:10.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a very good [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6sgp3m/which_way_the_winds_blow_how_the_meta_shifted_to/) about why Janna is good at the moment.\n\nAt the moment they have reverted Janna nerfs and are nerfing the Coin generation Item (needs more nerfs IMO), and Ardent Censer (not a big enough nerf IMO - they should make it back to season 4-5 stats, not this health drain thing), and Riot say they will review the changes in time for the 7.18 World's patch. Let's hope Riot make the right decisions about it all, and not double nerf items and a champion like they have done in the past.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-14T23:17:38.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to change her q imo.","replies":[]}]}
