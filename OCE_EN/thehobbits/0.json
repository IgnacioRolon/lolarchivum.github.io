However, if an enemy is caught between you and your desired target, you collide with them instead.\r\n\r\n> **What is meant by this is:**\r\n> \r\n> Champion X point-click-dashes to champ Y.\r\n> X ----------------------> Y\r\n> \r\n> However, if champ Z is caught between X and Y, X collides with Z. \r\n> X ----------->Z- - - - - - Y\r\n> \r\n>Z has Intercepted X's dash to Y.\r\n\r\nPlease do not shoot me down for this, but this mechanic would, in essence, balance champions like Lee Sin, Akali, etc, who can freely click on an enemy and dash through the tank, bruiser and jungle, hit the adc and fly out back the way they came. \r\nIt would add better Risk / Reward for these champions and make tanks and bruisers more viable at the jobs they are trying to achieve.

If you allow a tank to intervene like this then you're giving ADC's too much lee-way to do their job with almost 0 risk as long as they have beefy tanks in their team.\n\nBest example I can think of: \n\nConsider the enemy team has a chogoth, fully built, tanky AF, has an iron elixir, has a lulu on their team to ult cho.\nHow would this *interception* play out for your team?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-14T05:03:21.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't really do this, because it would make gap closers lose their purpose, which is closing the gap between you and your prime target, if you could intercept Shen or Lee Sin from jumping their target, why even play them? they lose a lot of power and it doesn't make the game any more balanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-13T09:57:46.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in other words makes adc impossible to kill and left to destroy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-13T06:54:32.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can make ideas\n\n\nriot will just do what ever the crowd want for $$$$","replies":[]}]}
