What do you see?\r\n\r\nThis question was not so simple to answer. &ldquo;The path is lit, I must choose my destiny,&rdquo; Lux recited as though spoken one hundred times and again. There were more elements than Light alone, but none had come so naturally.\r\n\r\n    Is your soul a fading light? Strengthened by fury? Hardened by heat.\r\n \r\nThe chapters of Fire, Magma and Stone were the wrong place to search. &ldquo;It burns with pure light, but has no remorse&hellip; Unmoving when cold, but shapes the earth when under pressure.&rdquo; \r\nWith a sigh of frustration it was back to the start of this dusty tome. Smoke, Lux noticed, had begun to curl its threads through her fingers where she held the pages.\r\n&ldquo;Shoot! Patience is not one of my virtues.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThoughts are like water, shallow or deep. It always seeks its equilibrium...\r\n\r\n&ldquo;A liquid by nature it harbours life. Yet, still frozen is True Ice atop Freljord&rsquo;s peak and lost is water under the Shuriman Sun&hellip;&rdquo; The Tidecaller spoke of following the currents and never to swim against them. Sitting in place would cause one to stagnate. A river will always find its way back to sea, eventually. \r\n\r\n  The seeds of conflict bear bitter fruit, but life still blooms even if they are weeds...\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nurture that which nurtures us. Soil and Sun provide us means to grow and thrive, but both are likely to be our end&hellip;&rdquo; Memories began to surface. Memories with a harsh lesson to be learned.\r\n&lsquo;Closer to the flower, closer to the thorns.&rsquo; With a shiver down her spine Lux skipped these pages.\r\n\r\n    From gentle breeze to cyclones rage the air we breath we share the same&hellip;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do not fear the winds of change &ndash; they will always be at your back,&rdquo; Her journey to Zaun had proved the most successful. Following a trail of sighting by Seafarers Lux had found the one they praised in song and shrine. The Tradewind Spirit had wise words to share. The night air breeze blew through an open window, flicking at the pages. With a grin, Lux continued on.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A dream to some, a nightmare to others.\r\n    We often become what we fear, so fear nothing&hellip;\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fear nothing. Limits were meant to be broken. Mistakes only prove you&#039;re trying.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n    Search deeper now. What do you see?\r\n    Whatever you find, you must keep. You cannot fear what lies beneath.\r\n\r\nWith this as her mantra she begun, &ldquo;Elements of change, heed my call. Break these bonds and show me the path. Strange alchemy fuels my--- WHOOPS DAMMIT&hellip;&rdquo; The incantation went awry. Scorching wood and melting stone where lightning struck from a storm of smoke. Rain and wind, hail and snow, the room was in chaos. As sudden as this happened it was over in an instant. \r\n&ldquo;oh, for the love of... alright, everything is still where it&#039;s supposed to be?&rdquo; Nursing her bruises, cuts and burns, she was all in one piece. &ldquo;Great...&rdquo; Finding the book through watery eyes Lux kicked aside what remained of her table and sat legs crossed.\r\n\r\nLook within yourself. What do you see?\r\n\r\nWith her head in her hands she muttered softly to the floor, &quot;We began in the dark, we end in the dark.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSo what do you think so far? Constructive criticism is appreciated. \r\nThanks","replies":[]}
