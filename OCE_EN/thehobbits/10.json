Its her animations. Particularly her W Flail transition into auto attacks. \r\nI recorded it for an example.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU5Szk2eakU&amp;t=1s\r\n\r\nThe transition from W into an auto attack causes the flail to derp a little mid swing and you get this rushed animation that breaks the flow. After seeing Irelia&#039;s animations it made me feel all warm and fuzzy. The way the blades slice and dance. The way Irelia herself transitions from slashing left to right.\r\n\r\nSejuani&#039;s flail needs to follow this pattern. I feel as well it would be good if Bristle acted more like a mount. Trotting around in the direction you click while Sej herself faces the nearest enemy or the most recent enemy. \r\nShe would turn and stand in the saddle to aim at her targets while Bristle moves and faces in the direction of your move commands.\r\n\r\ntl:dr\r\nWhoever worked on Irelia&#039;s animations please see if they can improve Sejuani&#039;s animations on her W flail into auto attacks.\r\n\r\nps\r\nDid you see how her waist twists into a noodle? Funny.","replies":[]}
