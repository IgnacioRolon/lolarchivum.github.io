Riot needs, and I really mean this, NEEDS to make an ARAM map for the Arcade Theme just like Butchers Bridge.\n----------------\n&quot;What&#039;s a Butchers Bridge?&quot; I may hear some of you say. That&#039;s okay. It was a part of the Burning Tides event with {{champion:41}} vs {{champion:21}}  as well as the new Bilgewater lore update and skin set. Riot did an entire new map for ARAM.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3fGYandWds\n-----------------------------\nPretty cool right? Now picture Arcade. Cant imagine it? Here&#039;s some things to help:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBtmQ9bCkQQ\n\nI can see it now, the colours, the lights, the bit sfx!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO3XLE_eRPk\n\nOne side good and the other evil. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxvG6RLeVVk\n---------------------\nhttps://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/a/ae/The_Final_Boss_approaches.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20140811215139\n\nNow Riot you have 1/3 the assets done already! The Summoners Rift looks cool, but picture the Bridge as an Arcade arena. One side green and lush like a town and the other side a dark and menacing tower.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCz2d6ZGJg4","replies":[]}
