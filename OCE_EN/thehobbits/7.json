Dreams are weird. \r\n\r\nSo I had a dream the other night about League. I was watching the e-sports as I often do, but what caught my attention most was that one of the teams picked the new champion set.\r\n\r\nThis new champion set was made similar to {{champion:497}} {{champion:498}}. The 5 champions were made specifically to be used altogether. A team designed specifically for e-sports. In the dream they had a teamfight then all begun to recall. The recall did what the two love-birds do and sync teleport.\r\n\r\nThe team comp was designed with a coordinated team in mind and it made me think, would Riot actually do this? The team looked like a group of soldiers (Damacian or Noxian, I&#039;m not sure) An elite squad of soldiers there was one with a shield, one with a long bow, a sage or wizard, a 2 handed sword and I&#039;m sure there was another, but I don&#039;t know.\r\n\r\nWhat if Riot actually did this? What if they made 5 champions designed for e-sports play in teams?","replies":[]}
