Runes right now have to many variables. You could build a champion in so many ways with just flat stat boosts (which many will argue gives the player the choice to be adc sorraka in top lane with smite build), but I feel that Riot should be able to balance the new runes with their fancy &quot;Adaptive&quot; stat runes.\r\n\r\ntl;dr\r\nRunes reforge will allow Riots job to balance the rest of the game a little easier.","replies":[]}
