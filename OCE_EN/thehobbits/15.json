Do I give it to the one who said &quot;no worries&quot; when I derped a gank or the one that didn&#039;t give up?\r\n**Good Shot Calling** - Is this used when someone uses &#039;omw&#039; ping and successfully ganks or when they say to get Dragon or Herald and we get it? Do I honor the one that made a good play jumping on a good hook or the do I honor the one that made the hook?\r\n**GG** - I just end up only ever using this one. \r\n\r\nDo the different honors actually do anything? Probably not. Does it feel good when you get them? Yea it does.\r\n\r\nI would like it if the honor was like the old days of GG, Teamwork and Friendly (and let us honor an opponent too)","replies":[]}
