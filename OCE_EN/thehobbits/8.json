I saved up my tokens and bought my 3 orbs of Order (yea that&#039;s right. I support the Order!) \n\nFirst orb. I crossed my fingers:\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/portrait/gragas-vandal.jpg\n\nHow you taunt me so, but its an element for crafting. The Vandal.\n\nSecond orb. My chances were low, but I still hoped:\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/images/champion/skins/portrait/vayne-vindicator.jpg\n\nThe sexy lady element. Perfect!\n\nThird orb.

Yea, that&#039;ll do.\n\n---------------\nAnd so with these 3 pieces and using LoL-Logic I should be able to, in theory, craft Road Warrior Miss Fortune. Here we go.\n http://i.imgur.com/cgBrRdc.jpg\n\nI hope this works.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/WyLisxi.png\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nOH GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE!? This isn&#039;t Miss Fortune. This isn&#039;t Miss Fortune at all. \n\nRiot, please. Can you help me? It was never meant to be like this. It was meant to craft into Road Warrior {{champion:21}}.\nhttp://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/e/ea/Miss_Fortune_RoadWarriorSkin.jpg\n\n-----------------\n\ntl;dr\n\nCan Riot take my 3 legacy skin tokens and make them into Road Warrior MF for me?
