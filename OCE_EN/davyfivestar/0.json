Low quality videos aren't going to get you far, in this day and age people can easily find better content with higher quality than 480p\n2. No mic is another big no-no, people don't like watching streams of low elo players without even a mic to offer some levity.\n3. Streaming on YouTube isn't great for a new channel, maybe switch to Twitch and look for ways to improve the quality (overlays, music, alerts, etc) to atleast match what others are doing\n4. Longer highlight clips, 7-12 minutes is a good estimate to aim for. Short clips like that with no fanbase won't get much traction in the current algorithm. If you make longer, quality highlight reels you can also post to some forums online to get some views and you'll appear in the YouTube recommended\n5. You're low elo, you need to be funny. Simple as that, people either watch because you're funny or skilled. The only other time is if people want to find others to duo with.\n\nEDIT: Apparently you do have a mic, you need to talk then. If people do happen to stumble across the stream and you aren't saying anything whats the incentive to stay. Furthermore, avoid streaming while tilted. Nobody wants to watch someone who's tilted","replies":[]}]}
