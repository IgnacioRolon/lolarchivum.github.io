I was wondering what your opinions where on this, if this is due to massive amounts of luck or if its a viable option, and if not/so what could her counters be ect\nthankss guys :D \n(typical build: Morellonomicon, lich bane, deathcap, echo, rylai&#039;s and abyssal)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-17T11:43:08.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried it and got the highest kda in the game kek","replies":[{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-07-18T03:11:52.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see? proof tysm{{item:3100}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-18T10:41:27.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They thinking banning lich on sona, show us 100% winrate then","replies":[{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-07-29T02:56:44.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omfg what nooo\nsurely you cant ban an item for a champion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-07-18T11:54:19.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried this twice since I've seen this and i actually it might become a viable pick there are ups and downs but i think it can be better then some mid lane champions right now. I would say used like Lulu or Orianna with their utility. But still not sure what masteries are good on her, Thunderlords is 3 skills to get off and early game trading your not really going to get it off seeing as you q auto run away, Deathfire maybe but late game it will fall off. Other keystones are basically useless on her :/ and ahri would be like 50% counter to her she's way too bursty for sona to deal with","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T06:33:10.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, any champion can be played anywhere if played right. Ranked is another story but even then, if you know how to do you're job properly the only difference the champion choice makes is execution. Having said that, in higher elos Sona is average at best because shes predictable but in lower elos she is broken.","replies":[{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2016-07-16T07:02:14.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I've noticed that in lower elos","replies":[]}]}]}
