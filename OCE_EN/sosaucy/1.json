The culture of Blue Flame Islands is deeply tied to Bilgewater, the island's nation.

Could this leviathan be a new champion in the future? I reckon the idea is pretty awesome, the last champion to have ties with Bligewater was Illaoi, so maybe its time.

T_T But with abilities that made them not op as well though to make them balanced x_x (e.g a tiny fairy that can get out of melee range  before you even turn to face it while your under the effects of a cc or a giant champion that almost blocks a jungle path/entrance.)  https://i.imgsafe.org/fdea6efe78.png I'm not being racist or any thing, I just like how his character in the tv show Zoo says 'Oh my god' as 'My got.' At least that's how I heard it the last time o.-??? That image isn't even from Zoo, I just couldn't find any images with him saying it. Got was just a juicy coincidence. I don't think were allowed to say the full title of got since it is got after all. That sounds fun to play...a champion who's like a vessel that can release the WHOLE kraken as an ultimate or plainly playing as a giant az monster!%$@#% O_O lol now I'm thinking about that show with \"Sm and Dn.\"","replies":[]}]}
