Onto why it might be the case that it wasn't an S rank. The first thing that we need to look at is what [Riot has officially stated](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/ask-riot-how-you-get-s-urgot) is accounted for in the system for getting mastery score.\n\n---\n\n> **What is in the champ mastery grades formula?**\n\n\n> The grades you receive are driven by how you stack rank against all other players in your region who also played your champion and position across various performance categories. We don’t reveal the exact formula so that it can’t be min-maxed as we really want to avoid incentivizing playing for stats like CS or K/D/A rather than playing to win. However, the variables are fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winnin\n\n---\n\nNow since this is ARAM this does actually make this case quite interesting as I am assuming the system accounts for what map you are on. \n\nARAMs are a game mode where there are constant team fights, a lot of kills, poking heavily on the opponent, champions building differently and lots of kills. With this in mind we need to account for this when thinking about the mastery score. For example since a lot of champions build differently and you will find champions such as Soraka often building full AP, it might be the case that with the system, damage done might be accounted for. A full AP soraka can do a ton of damage when it comes to poking with her Q, so it might be a stat to keep in mind.\n\n---\n\nYou are right though about CS, while the Riot quote doesn't specifically state that CS is one of the things that the system looks at, it might be the case that it is. However in the case of ARAMs and Soraka, I don't really know if it would be when you think about it. Last hitting with Soraka can be very difficult, and most of the time quite a lot of the ways that you get CS is through your Q poke.\n\n---\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on towards getting that S rank is KDA. In my personal opinion kills do carry a very heavy amount towards getting that S rank even on supports. So looking at having 5 kills, to 2 deaths might be something to look at, as in ARAMs its very often that people don't really mind who gets what kills because of the nature of the game mode.\n\n---\n\nAll of this mind though the main thing that you should think about is the reason that the mastery system is in place. It is there to give you a goal to get better, and see where you made mistakes that you can improve on. If it is the case that you didn't get an S rank one game and you feel like you should of, see what parts of your gameplay you could have improved on so that next time you have a better chance. Riot said themselves they don't want people farming for specific stats to get their S ranks, rather doing things that go towards winning the game for your team. \n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is anything I can clarify on or any questions I can answer that you have let me know. Good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"SoSaucy","date":"2017-01-17T13:48:03.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"beautiful reply tyvm <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-15T02:24:12.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would probably a S if you played it on Summoner's Rift, but your match was ARAM, then it's different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-15T02:22:09.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because real Soraka ARAM players would spend 18mins on the deathbridge star-raping with flipping godlike meteoric Qs every few second.
