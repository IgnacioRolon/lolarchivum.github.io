It works more often than not in my opinion and I&#039;m glad that this step has been taken to drop toxicity in the Oceania server because of the removal of players that simply ruin the game for others.\n\nSo what&#039;s the issue I want to address and why?\n\nFirst and foremost the term that has been growing and been used more and more frequently that is my reason for making this topic is &quot;Kill Yourself&quot;. In almost any singular context it is not acceptable and in Australia (The MAIN playerbase of the oceania server) it&#039;s a term that is actually considered encouraging suicide. The max penalty for that NATIONAL CRIME is actually 14 years of imprisonment.\n\nHave your attention yet? The fact that players aren&#039;t getting punished for this term and that the usage of it is going to continue to grow is down right disgusting, there&#039;s a major difference between trash talking and this. Personally it doesn&#039;t affect me that much and I&#039;m happy to mute the person report them after the game and move on but simply put that&#039;s not the case for everyone and that&#039;s why I&#039;m making this topic.\n\nRiot has strived to clean out toxic players with their system and has done an excellent job but in this regard the system doesn&#039;t hold a candle to the punishment that should be handed out and I&#039;m not talking permabans all around for saying it once.\n\nSo here&#039;s what I&#039;m proposing and personally I&#039;d be willing to petition this for the smaller crowd because come hell or high water I doubt anyone else is going to.\n\n- Players who use this term would be punished after the game if reported and the chat log proves it in these steps.\n     1. 48 hour ban first offence\n     2. 7 day ban second offence\n     3. 1 month ban third offence\n     4. Permanent ban from repeated offences\n\nThe players who contribute to this behaviour are given enough chances to straighten up and fly right under this system and quite frankly they shouldn&#039;t even have that many. We have younger players and mentally unstable players. We have depressed players, mentally ill players, players that have recovered from the darkest times in their life and this is simply put a trigger for them. Players still have to see this the first time it&#039;s commented and you can mute them but for some that will sit in their head. I have loved this game but I&#039;ve seen people who enjoyed this game incredible amounts that have turned away due to the toxic nature of the game. Trash talking to a standard is okay and will always happen. Some things need punishment though and I&#039;d like support and help getting riots attention on this post and feedback on my change.\n\nEdit: Until I can give sources for my law claim leave it out of your decision making on supporting or not supporting my suggested change the source I was originally given may not be 100% reliable and I'll be thoroughly checking that tomorrow and updating with information.\n\nTL;DR ? Make kill yourself a bannable offence immediately read the numbered points for ban info. Support me below help me get this to riot.

Remember to keep reporting players after game and thank you for helping us create a more sportsmanlike community for out game!\n\nIt's interesting you say that you agree language such as that has no place in the game. You don't seem overly concerned with the seriousness of comments of this type.\n\nMaybe you should keep in mind Blizzard's experience:\n\nThe case of two Canadian WoW players who killed a classmate and confessed in the game. Both now serving lengthy prison sentences.\n\nThe case of a WoW player sentenced to a prison sentence for grooming a minor in Wow for sex.\n\nIn both cases game logs being part of the evidence in the criminal cases.\n\nYou (Riot) need to be seen to be taking action against this type of behaviour. Sure you might be doing something however if the community doesn't see it then your essentially doing nothing; perception is what matters.\n\nPlayers that make comments such as \"Go kill yourself\" shouldn't result in a 3 step remediation process. It should be an instant ban; zero tolerance.\n\nRecently I played a ranked game with an individual whose account name was \"ChildViolator\". I don't know about you but I consider that entirely inappropriate. I reported the player for an offensive and inappropriate name. Did I get a message indicating action was taken? Nope. Therefore my conclusion is that action wasn't taken against this individual, as a result their account name was not considered a violation of the EULA. Maybe you should have a think about that.

First of all, sometimes when engaged ine friendly banter someone might say kill yourself, and its not offensive in the least. In the context of the conversation its sometimes more about kill (your own champion) not the player.\nSo the punishment system could struggle with that, thought I guess it only matters if that player is reported. Either way giving a harsh punishment to someone who doesn't deserve it sucks.\n\nSecondly, there are a ton of variations of this phrase, for example one guy 2 months ago on the enemy team randomly decided to start hardcore flaming me after I said something like 'dude stop flaming (my teammate).' Saying things like (I dont remember exactly) 'I hope u and ur family die in a fire' 'strangle urself' 'ill kill you' etc. His username is 'terrorism' and hes still playing, maybe he reformed. People that flame literally everyone in the game in /all chat like that will get some kind of punishment immediately now, I think, so even they need some chances to realise what they're doing is wrong, and what punishments will apply to them.\n\nI personally think that trying to add extra harsh measures for certain phrases leads to way too much complexity and less transparency for the players. The thing I hate about the Lol punishment system is that it gives you no real-time, always visible feedback on how you are as a player, instead giving some meaningless chat bans, then 2 week ban. The worst part is you will be perma banned after only 2 validated reports after the 2 week ban, which is absurd. Those validated reports dont have to be actual flaming, if you say anything negative, then get reported by someone, that counts. Riot doesnt make that information clear in ban warnings. ;)\n\nDoesnt bother me anymore that Riot hasnt figured out how to combat toxicity though. Self-mutes, saved toggle mutes and auto mute would fix the issue. Oh well.

This is an issue of self control. If someone can't control themselves then they need to close the chat window, if that doesn't work they need to not play LoL. Players need to understand that if they make comments such as \"Go kill yourself\" or \"i hope you get cancer and die\" that it is of the utmost seriousness and will be revieved by real people who will perma ban.\n\nI get angry at other players, to be honest what I get angry about is those players who are toxic and abusive who won't stop their actions when asked. Generally I end up blocking them however it isn't up to me to address someones else behaviour, they need to address their own behaviour or face consequences.\n\nI generally find that most people eventually learn to keep their mouth shut once players confront them about their behaviour and unsurprisingly teamwork seems to improve; who would have thought! 99% of people should be given the opportunity to reform however there are certain behaviours which should have a zero tolerance; telling someone to kill themselves or hoping they or their families get cancer should be one of those things.\n\nAs a school teacher I have a hard enough time trying to teach young people the need to try and live with a degree of civility with others without companies like Riot facilitating a community where such types of negative behaviour are allowed to foster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"r0b0cop","date":"2016-04-06T08:16:59.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah when people say kill yourself to me as banter I still dont like it but since they are saying it as a joke and banter I just cringe slightly and kind of ignore them.

Another ones were also about a persons privates and about ofc \" Kill yourself \" (Kys for short) If i may get permission to link the names of this 3 man so an investigation can be done i will gladly do it but, not saying that my punishment was not deserve, shouldn't there also be one for a group of people doing the same if not worst as well? The toxicity is more impactful as there were 3 of them compared to the one and less people would report on them based on just numbers and if anyone questions one of them the others would just back them up. I am trying to not be so pacifistic but i feel like just like how i called my gnar in game a retard for int, the 3 man that i played with should also have some form of consequences for telling me again, things that i can't say because it is that bad, tho i did mute them, it still echoes in my head.

Taking legal action against players who break the law, such as those who sell/trade player accounts and, of course, people who think it's acceptable to tell another person to \"kill themselves\".

No one, that's who.\n\n**@Riot** You want us to believe you have 0 tolerance for the scum of the earth? Prove it.
