This has happened a few times to me now and I'm unsure whether or not it's a problem on my end or the clients'. Champ select lets me hover my champ and ban champs, but here is where the problem occurs. As the countdown timer thingo for the ban phase reaches 0 it just stays on 0, meanwhile the champ select is still in progress. The lobby is still active except I'm stuck on the Banning Phase = 0 screen for an eternity, the only sign that the lobby has dodged is the chat logs saying \"X has left the lobby\". If I'm anything but first pick the lobby usually dodges. If I'm lucky enough to be last pick and the champ select goes on long enough the lobby jumps forward, showing the picks for both teams now. My PC and aussie internet is pretty good so I dont really think their an issue.\r\n\r\nKinda slightly made this post because my super uber important promo game got dodged because the client is being a lil lazy and now me lost a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-30T11:24:22.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be a connection issue, but I'd lean towards local client issue.\n\nTry running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair.\n\nIf that doesn't work try **reinstalling the game** with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).\n\nIf that still doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-11-03T06:20:43.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bug within the client, but Hextech repair tool won't work, it's due to issue within the client in it's current edition.\n\nPlayer support tickets get deleted.\n\nJust have to put up with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-03T10:08:16.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any circumstances where tickets get deleted except account recovery tickets.\n\nIf the tickets are solely bug reports, it's possible they are pushing you to use the Report a Bug board on NA rather than a support ticket for such, but as far as I'm aware tickets are used to track such issues also, so I don't think that's the case, and even if it was you should be redirected.\n\nIn my experience, the timer stalling at 0 is usually either connection related or bad patch (local) related. \n\nOn the other hand, the issue where the accept/decline interface remains visible and prevents you from interacting with champ select (which seems to be the one you are referring to) is not (as far as I know) a local issue and last I heard was being worked on though is also quite rare. Regardless it is not the same issue that the OP is experiencing.\n\nThere are also cases where two people can have the same symptom from different problems. A client repair and clean reinstall *can't* hurt, which is why we generally recommend it.\n\nGiven it's a different issue, I'd encourage you to make your own thread (if only as another visible report of the issue we can pass on) if you want to talk more about that particular issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
