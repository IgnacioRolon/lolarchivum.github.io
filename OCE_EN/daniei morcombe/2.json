We are looking for players who can stick around for a long time however, as this organisation is trying to extend it&#039;s Esports professional teams to include League of Legends.\r\n\r\nPlease comment below as my friends list is maxed, I will contact you if you make an effort to show your interest.\r\n\r\nP.S.
