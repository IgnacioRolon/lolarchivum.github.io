I don&#039;t know what riot were going for, other than &#039;more interactive laning for supports&#039;. I don&#039;t have a problem with the passive per-se, but I don&#039;t see the incentive to buy this as my support item.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of {{item:3301}}  was that it offered sustain. Now it offers only a nominal amount of mana sustain, buoyed by an infrequent spawn of a mana coin, which you may or may not actualy be able to pick up. It has the same mana regen as {{item:3303}}, no longer gives ANY HP regen, and offers gold? which all support items give you anyway...\r\n\r\nEven the quest rewards don&#039;t really feel that useful. An extra skill point is nice, but at the levels you are getting it (7-11, depending on how well you are doing) don&#039;t really give it much of an impact. If it werent for the fact that {{item:3069}} is still (IMO) the best of the finished support items, I would never use it again (and even now, I&#039;m resolved to just get {{item:3303}}  on everyone.)\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind having stuff to do in lane. I mind that the item no longer has a point. I don&#039;t get any meaningfull amount of mana sustain that I wouldn&#039;t get otherwise. No HP sustain, and only the promise that it will end up OK, after the game has gone on too long. Having fun in lane is fine. But that isn&#039;t the issue with supporting, it has never been the issue. \r\n\r\nPlease give coin SOME form of lane sustain. Even if it means HP pickups, I would be ok with that. Until then though {{item:3301}} is dead.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-06T00:31:56.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the health and gold you get from being near a dying minion. \n\nNow you only get mana and coins but not for every individual minion kill instead it's like after x amount of minions have died.\n\nI don't like spell thief's edge on Janna since the hp sustain felt so much better to lane with.\n\nHope riot adds HP pickups like you suggested.","replies":[]}]}
