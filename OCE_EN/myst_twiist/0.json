As fallout from this issue it looks like some players are having lingering problems with their connections despite the root cause being fixed.\n\nDepending on ISP this might have affected you - and it might possibly be a lingering issue as some players are seeing (depending on if your ISP took any actions to route around the problem provider).  I'd expect this to be resolved soon enough - but it might be worth getting in touch with them if the issues are continuing tomorrow.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"xNightShadex","date":"2016-03-31T13:30:46.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am now getting this error message.
