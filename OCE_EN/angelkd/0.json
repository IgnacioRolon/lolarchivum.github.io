Cheer me up boys! I wana hear your success stories. I wana hear how many ranks you climbed. How low did you get? How high did you claw to?\r\n\r\nI want to know it&#039;s possible to get from low bronze to gold.","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-25T04:00:55.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When season 4 finished I was bronze 4, same with this duo partner that I had. We both finished at the bottom of bronze. In bronze elo, I easily won my lane but failed to carry teamfights and the team in general. When I was having really bad teams one time, I dropped down to bronze 5  where I stayed. I then became carefree and was like **** ranked and continued to spam it without caring for lp. That was when I started to climb and learn and adapt on the way, I went all the way to silver 2 in preseason 5 with syndra, kat, akali etc. \n\nWhen season 5 finally started I played my provisional and got bronze 4 again. This made me angry and I tried climbing again. I failed my bronze 4 promos 4 TIMES. Always some bad teams to get in my way. When I finally got to bronze 3 on my 5th promos I went on a winning streak, skipped some divisions (the more wins and streaks u have, the more lp and more chance of skipping divisions, at that point I was getting 30 lp per game). I constantly duoed with my duo partner and we had like a 90 percent win rate together and we both climbed. At the end of season 5 I finally ended up in gold 5 (as did my duo) using the season 5 statik shiv, infinity edge and trinity force yasuo build.\n\nIn preseason 6 I went up to gold 2 playing leblanc (before teamfights I would usually catch the enemy adc's out, farming down their mid lane by w, r, q and e resulting in a 4v5 teamfight) my duo partner got gold 3 in preseason and then the new season started. I got silver 1 in my provisionals and climbed to gold (currently gold 3 now). I played less ranked games and My duo partner went on to plat. Funny how we were once trapped in bronze once. We play a lot of roles but we both main mid. My advice to get out of bronze 5 is constantly spam ranked, learn to adapt in matchups (e.g. once I was playing leblanc against galio and galio was supposed to be leblancs biggest counter, I constantly auto attacked him in lane as my autos were ad and dodged his skillshots and got 3 kills on my before I roamed and carried the game), League is not all about winning lane, it is how to progress from thereon forth","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-04-23T11:37:52.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hai! Add me and maybe we can rank together. I was bronze 5 after placements last season and I played lots of game but couldn't get up to silver. So instead of getting mad and flaming my team I instead went to watch my replays and point out the common mistakes I do in almost every game. After watching lots of replays and trying to fix those problems I had by playing normal games, I started playing ranked again and climbed all the way to silver 3. This season I won 7/10 placement and I am bronze 2 atm. I'm kinda doubtful if I should rank or not since I had 3 afks in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"AngelKD","date":"2016-04-24T07:32:31.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iAkeno,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=idr6gYA2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-23T11:37:52.062+0000)\n>\n> Hai!

I know I can be bad from time to time and recently I have been spiraling. I should rewatch my games. I also think I should just take a break for a few days and just focus on other things for now because my game play has been getting worse and worse over these last few days.

If you put your mind to it, don't derp and you'll be good. The best advice I got was from a friend who said just think as if the world was watching and say everything you do aloud and if you say something like \"Their team is aced instead of pushing inhibs or getting baron lets recall and buy items so they can spawn and maybe win next team fight\" you will seem retarded.
