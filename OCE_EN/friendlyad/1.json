First thing I&#039;m gonna suggest is making Taliyah&#039;s &quot;w&quot; - seismic shove available on herself, like {{champion:115}}. Of course this discussion is not limited to recent champions, or even champions only. It will give players a say in the development of changes to come as well as suggestions even the techies and schemers at riot can&#039;t think of.\r\n\r\nSide note: {{champion:43}} &#039;s empowered q - soul flare has two hit. Shouldn&#039;t the second proc deal more damage like many other mage&#039;s (e.g. {{champion:161}} ) skills?","replies":[]}
