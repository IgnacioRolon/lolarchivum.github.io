This afternoon, I opened the application as usual. Nothing out of the ordinary until it did its thing and then the LolPatcherUx showed up. There is no launch button in the top, or a loading bar, just white.. I can&#039;t click on the question mark or the settings button in the top right, so i&#039;m really left with a white screen with nothing there. I have tried everything to fix it from reinstalling, deleting package contents, basically anything recommended. I have another mac in my house that it works completely fine on, and i desperately need help to get this fixed. I have been at it for 3 hours now, and absolutely no results what so ever. I uninstalled everything, even manually a few times. Even using another client from a working computer, but that ends up in the same results. Anything i can do to fix this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"jebony","date":"2016-07-03T14:22:20.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you found a solution?
