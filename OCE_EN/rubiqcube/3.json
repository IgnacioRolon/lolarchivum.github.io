She was the first champion I played and pretty much the only champion I played for the first year. I discovered other champions and had a lot of fun, but I would always come back to my little fire wielding angel. For the last 2 seasons, I have been playing pretty much everything but Annie because my friends think that I am a one-trick silver III Annie main (LS would be ashamed).\r\n\r\nAnnie has always been hovering around a 53.00% W/R with a fairly average pay rate of around 2%. Over the last couple of patches, I&#039;ve noticed that her W/R is slowly dropping towards 50%. I can already hear what you&#039;re thinking.\r\n\r\n&quot;RUBIQCUBE! 50% IS PERFECTLY BALANCED&quot;\r\n\r\nYes, I agree that in most cases it is, but not in the case of Annie. Annie probably the easiest champion in the game. Her kit is simple and it&#039;s easy for new players to pick up. There is not a lot of potential for outplaying in her kit. So, this means that sadly you need to rely on your opponent making mistakes. Which is fine at high MMR, but for newer players who don&#039;t generally pick up on other players mistakes. This leads to a frustrating experience for a few reasons.\r\n\r\nissues with Annie.\r\n\r\n1) Her Q &amp; W are both very low ranged. They both have 600 range which makes playing against champions like Xerath, Orianna, Azir, A.Sol, and Velkoz unfun and almost impossible unless you are very good at dodging abilities.\r\n\r\n2) She absolutely gets destroyed by champions with mobility such as Akali, Dianna, LeBlanc, and Zed. Playing against these champions is annoying because unless you get ahead really early, no matter what you do they will 100-0 you every time. You have no escape other than your stun, so unless you&#039;re sitting on your stun you can&#039;t walk up to CS because you&#039;ll die unless you have flash. This would be fine except that you use your Q to CS 90% of the time because her AA animation is slow and generally just awful.\r\n\r\n3) The Doran&#039;s Ring change made poking other low-range champions hard. As you are probably well aware, if you kill a target with Q you get the mana refunded and the cooldown cut in half. When they removed the mana restoration on unit kill, it hurt Annie&#039;s ability to poke as it was essentially a way to have a decent mana pool. Sadly this was an indirect nerf, and it hasn&#039;t been compensated.\r\n\r\n4) Her E has two uses and either aren&#039;t particularly useful considering the high cooldown on it. The damage reduction buff is okay on paper, but realistically it&#039;s not going to stop Annie getting 100-0&#039;d in a team fight. The only reasons that I use this ability is simply to stack stuns and control waves, as it does help mitigate minion damage.\r\n\r\n5) She has real wave clear unless you go W max, which isn&#039;t really very viable. As champions have been reworked or released in the past few years, one thing has been consistent - wave clear. I feel like it&#039;s really hard to push-waves as Annie, and it makes the Luden&#039;s Echo rush pretty much essential.\r\n\r\n6) in order to be effective it feels like you have to do a set build. Luden&#039;s Echo&gt;Orbwalker&gt;Spellbound Orb&gt;Deathcap&gt;Void Staff. If you build Zhoyna&#039;s early as a defensive item, you do no damage.\r\n\r\n7) The Jhin like bar for the stun counter. Why? It was a way to make Annie more difficult to play against, and added more complexity to laning phase. The only way you can surprise stun somebody is by having the bar on 2 and by using a combo like Q E Stun before Q&#039;s projectile hits the target.\r\n\r\nI understand that Annie can be frustrating to play against, but she is in a really weak state right now. It&#039;s true that she can 100-0 a champion, but if you&#039;re playing against her and you&#039;re remotely good at the game- you can avoid 90% of the time.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.","replies":[]}
