If someone starts on me then I should be the better man and not say anything back, but I was already having a bad game and the midlaner who I flamed, starting calling me useless and names. Although I know that what I said and did was wrong - I don&#039;t think it deserves a 14 day suspension, considering I&#039;ve never even been chat restricted before or even been warned. Honestly Riot, I&#039;m from Australia the words that I used although they are bad, it was a way to get the frustration out otherwise the alternative is to smash my keyboard.\n\nChat restrict me, I don&#039;t care. Don&#039;t stop me playing a game that I love and have spent thousands of dollars on. \n\nGame 1\nRubiqcube: TSM is shit, just like your attitude. (this was a joke, because the enemy player was typing in all chat)\nRubiqcube: DIAF (I don&#039;t remember saying this, I think it was just a dhjgufyhedif moment)\nRubiqcube: gj (The player whom was provoking me got a kill)\nRubiqcube: shut the fuck u-p (called me useless and a bunch of names)\nRubiqcube: you *something iDubbz says*  (This point I was done with the game, I was feeding my ass off and mid was flaming me. I&#039;d never say this to a person who could take real offence to it, I&#039;d never say it on the NA servers, but because I&#039;m on the OCE servers it&#039;s a little different whether you like it or not)\nRubiqcube: what have you done to contribute? (He was still flaming me, this point I just wanted to know where his mindset was)\nRubiqcube: you actually heal draven. (this is probably the most toxic thing I said all game)\nRubiqcube: holy this xerath. (copying what he said when i died)\nRubiqcube: legit for 6 more cs than the jungler x fucking d (After he said I had no idea what I was doing)\nRubiqcube: this xerath (again copying what I said)\nRubiqcube: uneducated. (replying)\nRubiqcube: nicew (Complementing another player)\nRubiqcube: that&#039;s your call xerath (Xerath spam pinged me when I was doing raptors to go and fight at mid - so i did and as I predicted I died.)\n\nIf you&#039;re gonna send me a chatlog of things that I&#039;ve said and ban me from an automated system that is made to pick up &quot;offensive words&quot;  that quite frankly and I know this is going to sound bad towards Australians, is used a lot in everyday language over here. At least have the decency to put why i said what I said. \n\nI&#039;ve spent a lot of money on this game, I love this game. 14 days isn&#039;t the end of the work, but I don&#039;t feel like this ban is really going to help anything. I don&#039;t think I&#039;m in the wrong.\n\n\nI'm assuming this is the rule you're saying I broke, which is fine. But if the other guy doesn't get banned you're playing with double standards. \n\nV.

It's treated very seriously and is vehemently *not allowed* for what should be obvious reasons.\n\nWhat you say among your friends/family etc is your own business, but as soon as you drag that onto a public forum like League of Legends game you are subject to the standards of the wider community and of the age rating of this game.\n\nYou are not given anyone else's chat logs because you are being judged on your behaviour, just as they will be judged on theirs if you reported them. There is no point punishing you if you then just justify your behaviour with \"but they said this\". The point is to reflect on *your* behaviour.\n\nHow much money you have spent means nothing when it comes to punishments. Every player is treated equally when being judged on their behaviour. Spending lots of money doesn't somehow give you the right to say *something that iDubbz says a lot*.\n\nJust because you got punished, doesn't mean the other guy didn't.

Take this is a very strong warning. \n\nIf you don't trust yourself to not use chat like this, I would recommend taking steps like muting all at the start of every game, and perhaps unbinding/disabling your enter key with something like autohot key or software like CUE, Synapse etc.\n\nWith a long enough period of good (or neutral) behaviour you will drop tiers, there's no specific timeframe though, it's individual and linked to your behaviour (the more your behaviour improves, the faster you will drop tiers). Don't expect this any time soon though. On average it takes about 3 months to drop *one* tier.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-01T05:56:54.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sit there and take it, or get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-01T06:01:40.618+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or you know, don't call people racial slurs.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-02-01T06:07:47.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"or just sit there and take it. #leagueoflegends2018","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-01T06:40:28.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh yeah i should just sit there and ignore the asshole, maybe mute him, then forget to report at the end of the game because the asshole started talking to a brick wall and thus said asshole gets away with it.\n\nOr alternatively, not wanting the asshole to get away with it, watch him call me a (Insert generic insult here) all game, and then get the pleasure of reporting him, while still having to sit there and take all the abuse he can sling.\n\nNot to mention, said asshole is nearly always the feeder who is flinging shit and trying to blame anyone but themselves, so we can add trolling and inting to that list, but of course, trolling and inting is ok unless you do it 100's/1000's of games in a row non-stop.\n\nYeah not, let's just sit there and take it, can't say anything to him, because he is the salty %%%% that will report everyone post game because we didn't focus on carrying his fat ass.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-02-01T06:09:48.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I got done with this as well man. best to just mute all and ping what you're feeling.
