My laptop crashed once and my internet crashed another time and I've been placed back into the low priority cue once more. I never rage quit. All my DC's are from my internet on the rare occasion going down or the league client itself crashing. I've never really rage quit before it's just technical issues. \r\n\r\nI feel as though I'm not a toxic player and I never intentionally rage quit, so the punishment for this so called 'AFK' and 'Negative Behavior\" is just a load of BS. \r\n\r\nI understand if nothing can be done, but if you'd like to check the match history for both the games that I was \"AFK\" you'd see that not only in the \r\nJinx game I played (I was DC'd for ten minutes at the start, due to having to restart my laptop because the league client crashed), I came back and out CS'd the ADC who'd been in it from the start.\r\n\r\nAnd the Katarina game, my internet crashed which causes two other people to DC as well. (Niky1997, Bacon Baby).\r\n\r\nObviously I don't expect to have the punishments lifted, but I think it'd be neat if maybe you guys at riot could program a way to see when the player DC's for technical reason and DC's for rage issues, maybe by checking the chat history before handing out bans.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRubix.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-03T21:25:48.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If only if only...","replies":[]}]}
