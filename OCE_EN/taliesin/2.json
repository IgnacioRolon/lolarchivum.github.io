Please keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week). During this time do not lodge multiple tickets or continue adding information to your existing ticket, as it may send your enquiry to the back of the queue.\n\nIn the future, be sure to use the end-game reporting screen as consistent reports through this feature is the best way to get a player punished. \n\nDue to privacy reasons Riot can't respond to your ticket with details about if a punishment was handed out or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Taliesin","date":"2016-04-27T00:46:08.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried putting it into a support ticket but this does not match any of the choices given on the page you linked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-27T09:30:08.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just put it in \"I have a question about League of Legends\" then I think the option is General something.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AngelKD","date":"2016-04-27T01:02:51.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why don't they just dodge themselves?
