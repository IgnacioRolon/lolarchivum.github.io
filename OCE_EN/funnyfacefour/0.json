Trust no one knows how to play against them .. so they work out pretty well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-20T14:09:36.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"na play support. nobody plays support. everyone knows only the most toxic of 12 year olds \"main\" mid lane and arent even silver on oce","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-20T15:08:09.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, idk, learn the art of fill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-20T12:54:49.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is less burst and relies on catching the enemy off guard more than anything (then ult, auto attack auto attack, dead, gg, whatever)\nLux is a sniper at heart and is amazing at dealing damage from a distance.\n\nFor burst, definitely go Veigar and Zed. Brand is great if you don't care how fast it takes for your damage to come while not being sustained damage, Orianna if you love positioning, or Malzahar if you're interested in what Brand has, and your definition of burst is more of \"Single combo to get rid of enemy's HP\" rather than \"Deal a ton of damage in a short amount of time\", he has a lot of DoT but when you mix in your ult his combo is really good for killing an enemy.\n\nNote to everyone: Burst is different from poke. Most poke champions have a sub-optimal all in combo that's a bit bursty but I think the poster is looking for a champ that mainly bursts. LB is the queen of burst, if you're looking for pure burst with nothing attached.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-20T06:18:38.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo, if you have the mechanics to use him well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-20T05:53:34.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Janna has the best burst in the game.
