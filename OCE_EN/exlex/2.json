So my question is, why is it that I cannot reactivate my Q when I am stunned? Is this intentional?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nExlex","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-03T02:37:01.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Exlex,\n\nThe second Q is essentially another spell-cast, so being stunned will prevent you from being able to cast it just as you wouldn't be able to cast your ult or flash, for example.","replies":[]}]}
