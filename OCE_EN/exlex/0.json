Back when Summoners still existed, the minions were magical conjurations that were summoned prior to the battle, but now that the IoW is gone, what are the minions now?","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-24T05:04:12.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it might interest us more if we *didnt* know because it would make us think?","replies":[{"poster":"Exlex","date":"2015-02-24T05:47:49.113+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"But mate, seriously, it's the knowing that makes it fun.

Covered fully from head to toe, drugged and gagged. Their short lives end with them walking down the lane, the next thing they know your {{champion:122}}  blade has sliced them in half. All for a bag of gold conveniently placed in their pockets. Can you live with yourself every time you cs, \"Minions\" is a term created by summoners to alienate then, make them seem less human, allows us to kill them without remorse.
