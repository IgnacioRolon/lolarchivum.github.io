It can get rather glitchy at times, specifically when everyone is scrambling to buy a new champion or skin. Atop this, whenever something new comes out the servers tend to have major issues as people go to play with and purchase the new content.\n\nSo I thought of something. What if you were able to preorder new content, such as skins or champions? This way, the moment something new comes out, it could appear just like gifts and do in your inventory, saving massive amount of time that is usually spent playing a game, checking the store, and repeating an infuriating number of times while also lowering strain on the store server whenever something new gets released.\n\nAnother concept that I thought of was trialing skins. Naturally, champs being on free rotation gives you the opportunity to test them out and see if you like them or not, so I was thinking, what if the same could be done for skins? Imagine this, you go to the store, you check out a skin but you are unsure as to whether or not you like it, so right next to unlock there is a button that says \"Try.\" This gives you the chance to play a single game with the skin and then you have the option to get it or not to. The main reason that I think this is a good idea is because I base the skins I buy off character models and particle effects, however even if you watch some videos of the skin played you still don't quite get the feel for the skin that you do when playing with it.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to know what you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"Nekonatic","date":"2014-12-11T08:10:26.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh Yeah You Spelled The Word Riot Wrong In the Voting System \nJust Sayin","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-11T08:34:56.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You spelt the word Rito wrong, what are you talking about?","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-12T11:54:59.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Rito?

I agree one time only, and not in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nekonatic","date":"2014-12-11T08:07:33.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats the point of pre-ordering champs or skins? \nHow about if you pre-order a skin or champ it would be a bit cheaper (5%-%10) and if allot of people pre-order I Don't Know, maybe they could Improve the Item?\nI am not sure Riot will do this cause many people will see Riot as a company that tries to steal their customers  money.\nAnyways Cya {{summoner:30}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Argonian","date":"2014-12-11T05:58:08.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Strider Hiryu where skins would be abused.

There should be a \"cool down\" on it for let say, you can't trial the same skin once per week/month.\n\nAlso, it should only be on Co-Op since normals would be a little weird.\nWell, at least not ranked. We shouldn't be able to trial skins in ranked that's for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hawkrook","date":"2014-12-11T03:50:35.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be awesome!
