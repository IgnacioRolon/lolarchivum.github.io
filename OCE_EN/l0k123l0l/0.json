Mostly when I go into normal games, they tempt to lagg even more when i try to call my lane. \r\nIts super laggy when I play the game aswell, and the sound effects seem to echo more than usual. I liked the old version of the homescreen because that didn&#039;t lagg for me at all! \r\nSo if theres a way to make it less laggier please tell me how, because I&#039;ve been going support for most of my normal games now.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"rondoge","date":"2016-11-20T05:58:54.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get a pc made for gaming, problem solved","replies":[]}]}
