I have a 2 monitor set up for my PC. A 1920x1200 display (main display) and a 1920x1080 display. Every few minutes, my mouse will be able to click on desktop of my second screen mid game. This doesn&#039;t help because I use my mouse for scrolling. This allows for poor scrolling and able to open or click on things. (I have opened &quot;AMD Catalyst Control Centre&quot; more times than I can count. It&#039;s at the top of my right click on desktop). I have tried full screen (1920x1200), windowed (1920x1200 &amp; 1920x1080) and borderless (1920x1200 &amp; 1920x1080) and I get the same issue across the board.\r\n\r\nThis leads to my second issue. Occasionally when I click back into LoL after getting the first issue, the mouse will take control of the mini-map. Once I click on the mini-map, I get control back... Until I hit SpaceBar (centre camera on my champion) then the camera locks. Pressing &quot;Y&quot; (lock/unlock camera) doesn&#039;t work, either does the little camera control next to the mini-map. Only fix I can do is to disconnect and reconnect.\r\n\r\nHave also submitted a support ticket, but posting here seeing if anyone had any solutions.","replies":[]}
