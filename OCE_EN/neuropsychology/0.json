I have played 3 games out of being stomped, as there was 4 real people on the opposing team, and me and a bunch of AI controlled champions on one team. Any comment regarding that?\r\n\r\nWhy even start the game if there isn't enough people lol? I would rather wait an extra minute on top of the 15 that you already have to wait anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-20T02:46:45.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a Rioter but I can shed some light on this.\n\nThe bots you experience in those games aren't Riot made or sanctioned bots. They're illegal player bots made (generally) by account sellers.\n\nBecause they are bots, naturally their MMR is awful, so you'll really only come across them in low MMR and/or low population (i.e late night) normals. Once your level gets a bit higher you'll pretty much never see them again. It's a form of cheating and should be reported as such. \n\nIt's worth noting that bots aren't banned instantly, but are banned in waves to obscure detection methods and catch more bots overall. It's an imperfect compromise, but it's what we've got.","replies":[]}]}
