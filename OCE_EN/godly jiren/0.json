You can get a shitty laptop for like $400 that will play LoL but I would recommend spending atleast $600-700.\n\nBefore going shopping you should look at the recommended specs though just in case:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-15T15:15:58.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, i wouldn't recommend playing league on anything but a high end rig atm, even professional players with high end rigs are having huge FPS drops.","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2017-11-16T02:14:08.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played on a mid range laptop prior with no hassles.

Onboard GPUs are...not great. \n\nIf you're shopping in a physical store the laptop will have either a Nvidia or AMD sticker below the keyboard/next to the trackpad somewhere. If you're shopping online then the specs will usually say \"dedicated [brand][model] graphics card/GPU\"\n\nIn the end though, google is your friend. If you google the GPU and results come up saying how bad it is, avoid it, and do your best to be at least a little above the minimum specs so you're futureproofed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2017-11-15T10:46:39.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use an ASUS ROG GL502VS.

The game runs really smoothly although occasionally (very rare) a driver update from NVIDIA will screw with LoL.
