If you wanted a tanky assassin you're better off going with Sated Yi/Xin. \nTo be honest, I don't enjoy playing him in the jungle. Before Keystone Masteries, Aatrox was actually able to go toe-to-toe and if you knew what you were doing, pretty much smash most champions on the top lane. The problem with him revolves around his pretty lackluster kit coupled with his passive which for some reason gates him from having higher base stats. \nI do share your annoyance on his Q and it pisses me off If I die in mid-air and my passive procs when I haven't even landed yet. His E has pretty much very little use outside of laning phase. It also sucks that after they 'revamped' skill shots, his E cannot be performed at point blank any more.\n\nWere his rework to come, I hope they address these major issues I pointed above but also define him with a proper identity instead of \"that guy who tries to be everything but sucks doing so.\" It would feel so good, if Aatrox was actually the Bruiser/Tank Fighter that we were lead to believe.","replies":[]}]}
