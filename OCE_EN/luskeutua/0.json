Reason It wasn&#039;t in here before the cutoff date was simply because I finished it pretty much on the day it was due for submission, so there was no real point trying to get any feedback.\n\nPosting it now though because... well, it looks like people don&#039;t care so much and just want something decent to read.\n\n(For those curious, 1487 words)\n\n---\n_**Of Firewalls and Fur**_\n---\n\nPoppy&rsquo;s head pounded, vision blurry, ears ringing.\n\nShe tried to move, but the restraints held her down. Last thing she remembered, she was wandering the Demacian vistas, wondering if the new generation of humans had the hero - the digital age is so sorely lacking in heroic figures that perhaps the true hero would arise this era.\nIt took a few moments but the ringing subsided, replaced by the hum of machinery.\n\n\t&ldquo;We have the Demacian. The Zaunite is en-route to another facility&hellip;&rdquo; she heard a voice, accompanied by approaching footsteps. Well spoken&hellip; Ionian accent.\n\n\t&ldquo;No, we have the Void-touched. Do we have the Noxian? I&rsquo;ll check the register. I know we have the Scout. Yes, I&rsquo;ll contact you when I get results. PROJECT wasn&rsquo;t expected to work on Yordles, their physiology mostly being comprised of fur and glee, but the results are spectacular nonetheless. Well, I know but&hellip; Hey, you&rsquo;re the one who said that inducting that little girl into PROJECT was a good idea&hellip; And lets not forget the &lsquo;Artist&rsquo;&hellip; &hellip;Yes, You too, farewell.&rdquo; The distinctive &lsquo;beep&rsquo; of his communicator was heard as he opened the door that lead to Poppy&rsquo;s cell.\n\nShe looked up, eyes finally clearing.\n\nThe sensation was overwhelming at first, diagrams and displays lit up all across her vision. Augmented reality tooltips flooded her view, describing every mundane feature.\n\n\t&ldquo;Awake? Can&rsquo;t have that, psychosurgical conditioning isn&rsquo;t until tomorrow, and that&rsquo;s when we do the loyalty conditioning&hellip; hmm&hellip; I gave you the same dose we had to use on a Freljiordian boar. Not that the pig&rsquo;s rider was any less of a handful&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nHe shook his head and walked to the side, pulling a large syringe from the nearby cabinet. Poppy, finally composing herself, was finding the tooltips were receding, the systems adjusting to her needs.\n\nFor instance, one of the tooltips noted just how underestimated she was&hellip;\n\n\t&ldquo;Hold still, else this is going to&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nThe restraints could easily have held a muscular juggernaut of a human man. Poppy wasn&rsquo;t quite that weak.\n\nWith blinding speed that surprised even her, both hands had erupted through her restraints, one hand had already shattered the man&rsquo;s wrist by the time her other reached his throat.\n\n\t&ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S MY HAMMER!&rdquo;\n\n\t&ldquo;I-I don&rsquo;t-&rdquo;\n\nDissatisfied with the hesitation, Poppy released his throat and punched him in the face. Something shattered under her knuckles. Either way, he wasn&rsquo;t getting up any time soon.\n\nTearing off the remaining restraints, Poppy stood and dusted herself off, stopping to look down when it sounded wrong. Her old coat of chain had been replaced by mechanical augmentations. She felt her face, still fluffy, still the same. At first she felt relief until she recalled the AR. It was an entoptic system - wired inside the eyes themselves.\n\nShe shook her head, there was no time to dwell, as harrowing as she found it. She scanned the room, the AR proving itself useful to her when the tooltip alerted her to a storage locker in the room. She darted over, flinging it open with unexpected force. She knew her body, so she didn&rsquo;t understand why she wrecked the hinges-\n\nIf they could change her eyes, they could change her flesh.\n\nShe tried to dismiss the shudder growing on her spine as she turned back to the locker.\n\nInside was&hellip; her buckler, Shieldy and the hammer, Whomper. Well, she called the Hammer of Orlon &lsquo;Whomper&rsquo; as a nickname, and she was pretty sure the hammer didn&rsquo;t like it, but they&rsquo;d been together a long while. Friends gave each other nicknames, right?\n\nShieldy had been upgraded, but the same steel was in there. It looked kind of like her now with all the fancy technology on it. She was relieved, long as it&rsquo;s not dented&hellip;\n\nAs for Whomper, they&rsquo;d clearly tried to change it, but the hammer could not be scored even by the toughest of their tools. The hammer had a couple of technological add-ons plated over it instead. She didn&rsquo;t get it, a hammer was still a hammer, no matter how fancy one dresses it.\n\n\t&ldquo;Good to know you two are okay&hellip; We&rsquo;re the ones who never change, right?&rdquo;\n\nHappy to be reunited, Poppy exited the room, several corridors branched off from her. A rat in a maze&hellip;\n\nShe figured it wouldn&rsquo;t take long for&hellip; whoever &lsquo;they&rsquo; were to realise something was amiss. \n\nThe structure shuddered, an explosion in the distance.\n\nAs good a direction as any to start.\n\nShe took a breath&hellip;\n\nThen she ran.\n\n\n***\n\nFlesh and steel - Scored, stained and smeared. One corner was all it took for pristine polished panels to twisted burned-out wreck.\n\nPoppy had a chilling thought, maybe she saved that man&rsquo;s life by breaking his face.\n\nThe front door was ripped open by the force of&hellip; the explosions?\n\nShe raised Whomper and cautiously stepped forth, over the threshold, into the open.\n\n&hellip;\n\nConfusion.\n\nAwash in the neon lights of the Ionian urban sprawl, Poppy turned her face upward into the cold rain - the sky cast in the same steel grey as the rooftop beneath her feet.\n\nMovement to the side caught her eye, entoptics highlighting the lay of the steelscape. A figure, Yorlde, moving between the pipes. Designation: Veigar.\n\n&hellip; She knew that name. She knew it wasn&rsquo;t a friendly name, but couldn&rsquo;t quite remember where&hellip;\n\nReflexes kicked in before the thought resolved, a pillar of dark energy slammed into steel plating from above. Poppy shielded her face from molten steel splashed up from the impact.\n\nKnuckles whitened on Whomper&rsquo;s grip. If the Yordle had a name her machinery knew, that meant he was in the facility too&hellip;\n\nAt least, that was the best guess she had.\n\nAnd the technician did talk about loyalty reinforcement&hellip;\n\nAnother bolt of energy whistled out from the dark. Poppy dodged to the side, whipping around and flinging Shieldy back towards the source. \n\nThe impact of buckler against flesh was one Poppy would never forget, the sickening crunch that echoed when Sheildy bounced to the floor. The buckler lit up on impact, casting the dark in a pale blue glow. The hooded Yordle, was clutching his ribs, spitting profanity about &lsquo;tall&rsquo; people as he limped back a few paces.\n\nPoppy ran for Shieldy as Veigar&rsquo;s implants lit up in an ominous purple surge.\n\nShe narrowly avoided the wall of energy that burst up from the floor, and managed to reach Shieldy as a shadow widened around her feet. She reacted by raising Shieldy upwards, her latent Yordle magic caused a barrier to form around her&hellip;\n\nBut something was different.\n\nThe barrier was stronger - rather than a sphere, it was a shroud of triangles all interlocked together.\n\nIt proved strong enough.\n\nThe pillar of dark energy impacted the shield, shattering it, spilling along the floor. Poppy turned to Veigar and charged. Unfortunately for him, he was between her and a wall.\n\nThe wall behind him crumpled as she rammed him with her shoulder. While he still reeled, a headbutt met his face. Just as he regained sense of himself, Poppy followed through with her hammer, hitting with such force that the very wall behind him shattered.\n\nBefore she could renew her assault however, Veigar managed to retaliate. The first surge of energy broke bones, Poppy tried to scream but the air was stolen from her lungs. The second impact from above felt like burning as the cybernetic armour melted into the underlying flesh. The third impact tore some of that very armour off, flaying meat off bone.\n\nEntoptics alight in warnings and alarms as Veigar stood, not recovered, but with the advantage, as he started winding another spell.\n\nPoppy took a breath as the hammer lit in&hellip; a blue cast this time. It used to be golden&hellip;\n\nShe turned to Veigar and slammed Whomper into the ground in front of her.\n\nThe ceiling rippled towards him and upon reaching his feet, a surge of energy impacted with such force that he was flung screaming into the sky.\n\nA sickening crack was heard echoing in the night as he didn&rsquo;t quite make the landing.\n\nPoppy however knew better than to assume that was the end of him. She was in no position to continue. \n\nShe turned and ran.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAn hour, maybe more, passed before Poppy&rsquo;s knees buckled on her. There were&hellip; gaps in her memory. Things that didn&rsquo;t quite add up. She shook her head, it didn&rsquo;t matter ultimately. She&rsquo;d been in worse scrapes.\n\nAfter all, even after all this time, she had a hero to find. \n\nThis PROJECT was an uncomfortable interruption, nothing more.\n\nWho knows, maybe the hero was meant to rise out of this particular mess.\n\nPoppy liked that thought. Maybe the hero was subject to this PROJECT - maybe the machinery was their call to action.\n\nShe smiled for the first time in seemingly an age. That settled it - she would seek others implanted such - maybe she&rsquo;ll finally find that hero.","replies":[]}
