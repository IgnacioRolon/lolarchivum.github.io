Tap.\n\nIt was a bad habit, especially for a psychiatrist. Tapping pen to desk is a good way to appear impatient, doubly so when there was a someone else in the room.\n\nMinnie&#039;s amber eyes were fixed upon her guest, the bespectacled yordle idly running her fingers through her pale blue fur. Her other hand, tapping the pen incessantly.\n\nFlicking stray strands of long pale blue hair out of her face, she broke the silence, &quot;I know it&#039;s daunting, Etha&quot; she slapped the pen into the desk, &quot;but even in your position, you can strive for a sense of normality. I think it&#039;d do you a lot of good.&quot;\n\nHer guest&#039;s eyes never moved from the window. The young yordle tried to hide it, but she was mesmerised by the Piltovan skyline. She swallowed, the purple of her cheek fur was darkened by tear streaks. It&#039;d been some time since she had stopped crying, but she hadn&#039;t bothered trying to try her face.\n\n\t&quot;Doc... you have looked at me, yes?&quot; she raised her arms, which were covered in growths, alternating between fleshy and chitinous. Extra eyes, all sharing the violet hue of her &#039;normal&#039; pair, blinked independently of one another, bony growths somewhere between tooth, claw and spine jutted out at odd angles, &quot;How do monsters fit in, exactly!?&quot;\n\nMinnie cocked her head, trying to look Etha in the eyes through her unkempt curtain of deep purple hair, &quot;If you think you even approach &#039;monster&#039;, you&#039;re naive.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Doc, I get it, it&#039;s nice what you&#039;re trying to do...&quot; Etha closed her eyes, trying to give her words the appropriate weight, &quot;but my chest opens up into a gaping maw. My ribs are teeth. I don&#039;t even know where my own god damned heart is anymore-&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Probably for the best considering where we pulled you from,&quot; interjected Minnie, she still shuddered from the memory of that Zaunite facility. \n\n\t&quot;I have three tongues, all of them harpoon shaped! I have a tail, it has a three fingered grabby-thing on the tip! I can see through all these extra eyes! hell...&quot; Etha raised a hand and some of the eyes detached from her arm, extending out towards the desk upon fleshy tentacles, &quot;I can wrap these damn things up a tree if I wanted to! I don&#039;t think &#039;normal&#039; should even enter my damned vocabulary!&quot;\n\n\t&quot;You forgot the list the mandible jaw,&quot; Minnie sighed.\n\nEtha twitched, her bottom jaw opened out horizontally to expose a set of lengthy, bony needles. She flexed them out as hard as she could, stretching the new sinews.\n\n\t&quot;At least I can hide that one.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;All I&#039;m saying is to look on the bright side-&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Well I didn&#039;t teeth in my nethers, not that it would make a difference to me anyway. And my chest isn&#039;t covered in eyes or teeth, so there&#039;s a plus. Not that it made a difference either, seeing as how you&#039;ve got cleavage you can ski down and I&#039;m flatter than this desktop.&quot;\n\nMinnie grimaced as she did up the top buttons of her blouse, &quot;Now you&#039;re just being petty-&quot;\n\nEtha gesticulated wildly, &quot;but doc, you asked for all the bright sides! Like the fact I haven&#039;t needed to use a bathroom since this all started!&quot; Etha paused, &quot;Actually, that&#039;s really convenient...&quot;\n\n\t&quot;As much as I didn&#039;t want to know, that&#039;s what I&#039;m getting at.&quot;\n\nEtha frowned, &quot;It still doesn&#039;t change anything. I look the part of a monster. I&#039;m not normal.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Is that what you really think? Do you know what I normally do for a living?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Listen to people&#039;s problems? What&#039;s that got to do with-&quot;\n\n\t&quot;I specialise in violence. Victims and perpetrators alike. I mainly deal with soldiers and criminals, hell, the Piltovan police want me to focus every possible effort on the whole Jinx thing. When I tell you, you are not a monster, I mean it. You&#039;re just a yordle with terrible luck.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;My chest cavity can distend you know. I can technically swallow you whole...&quot;\n\nMinnie leant forward onto the desk, &quot;One of the yordles I tend to when I go to Bandle is a scout who does every mission alone. He always returns covered in blood, never speaking to anyone but his superior officer and myself about his missions. He only comes to me because he&#039;s under direct orders to. He worries me. You don&#039;t worry me. Think about that.&quot;\n\nEtha was silent, feeling somewhat guilty for no reason she could fathom.\n\nMinnie got up and went to the window, &quot;Stretching out for miles before you, is a regular, ordinary day, where regular, ordinary people are doing regular, ordinary things. You might not be ordinary, but there&#039;s nothing stopping you from acting it. Being a monster isn&#039;t having extra teeth, its acting like those teeth need a person between them.&quot;\n\nEtha couldn&#039;t look at Minnie, &quot;I just... don&#039;t feel like...&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Like you&#039;d be accepted?&quot;\n\nEtha nodded.\n\n\t&quot;I&#039;m accepting you.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;I&#039;m your patient.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Are you?&quot; Minnie cocked her head, &quot;I get paid to deal with patients. I&#039;m not getting paid to talk to you today.&quot;\n\nMinnie frowned, &quot;then what...?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;You&#039;re just a girl who got too close to something unnatural. You&#039;re far from alone. I remember tales of humans who were similarly void-touched. Their afflictions wrecked their minds, all things considered, you&#039;re lucky to get away with just your body.&quot;\n\nEtha swallowed, &quot;I suppose... I don&#039;t feel lucky. But I have to ask, if you&#039;re not my doctor, then what are you?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Just a concerned yordle just trying to remind you that loneliness is toxic to us, and that I&#039;m willing to watch over you and make sure you&#039;re okay.&quot;\n\t&quot;That&#039;d be easier to swallow if I met other yordles like myself doc.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Do people really have to mirror your experiences to matter?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;I didn&#039;t mean it like that...&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Think of it like this: I&#039;m out of the ordinary for different reasons. Out of the ordinary people get noticed, it&#039;s inevitable. Usually by someone powerful, usually by someone without their best interests at heart. It&#039;s true of everywhere, even here, even in Demacia, even in Bandle. I choose to not draw attention, and live regular, ordinary days in relative peace, doing good things so that when I get noticed, I have friends I can count on. Considering my job, I regularly worry that day might come soon.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;But it&#039;s not like you&#039;re literally wearing your job as part of your skin.&quot;\n\nMinnie reached out and idly stroked one of the eye stalks, causing Etha to recoil it, &quot;Even still, I don&#039;t think it matters as much as you believe. People are surprisingly inattentive, if you don&#039;t draw attention to it, they&#039;ll probably not even notice.&quot;\n\nEtha looked to the floor, she desperately wanted to believe that, but some deeply frightened part of her couldn&#039;t.\n\nMinnie continued, &quot;I can help you have a regular, ordinary life too if you wanted, even if you only wanted it for a short time. You&#039;ve already been noticed, you&#039;ve already paid your toll, no one can fault you if you want something to show for the hell you&#039;ve been put through, even if it were something very small.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;I... guess I do miss the quiet... I don&#039;t know, I feel like I&#039;m putting you out-&quot;\n\nMinnie interrupted her with a hug, &quot;We wouldn&#039;t have made it back to Piltover without you, it&#039;s the least I can do. I want you to take care of yourself Etha, and I&#039;m asking if you&#039;ll let me help you do that. I&#039;m also offering my place to stay if you need it. It&#039;s no trouble at all.&quot;\n\nEtha felt like she was melting in Minnie&#039;s arms. She returned the hug trying to stymie the newly welling tears.\n\n\t&quot;I... don&#039;t deserve...&quot;\n\n\t&quot;A simple yes would do.&quot;\n\n\t&quot;... Thank you...&quot;\n\nMinnie didn&#039;t have the heart to tell Etha that she too felt alone in Piltover. \t\n\n\t&quot;Regular, ordinary people, huh...&quot; Etha rubbed her eyes, &quot;How long do you think that&#039;ll last?&quot;\n\n\t&quot;Long enough to make a happy memory I hope.&quot;\n\nEtha smiled, &quot;Yeah, fair enough call there...&quot;\n\nA strange noise called Minnie&#039;s attention, she turned her head towards her desk to see Etha had managed to wrap one of the eye stalks around the pen.\n\t&quot;At the very least, I can let you know how god damned annoying that was.&quot;\n\nAs Minnie was about to protest, Etha perfectly mimicked the pattern, silencing Minnie&#039;s words before they even formed.\n\nTap.
