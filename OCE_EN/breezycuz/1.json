I'll have a look around a bit and see if I can't find out why you have to login in the first place/why you'd be having this issue.\n\nAs far as the skins go, I gather the twitter code isn't always reliable so support can get it to you, and to get the Ali skin for OCE we've always had to submit a ticket. So once we can actually get a ticket out for you you should get that resolved pretty quick.","replies":[]}]}
