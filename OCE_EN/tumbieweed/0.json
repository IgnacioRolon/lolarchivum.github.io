I also dont know how to format, please forgive.    \n\n== CLIENT ==  \n1. * Masteries page name doesnt change when editing mastery in champ select straight away\n2. * Cannot see recent played players\n3.  Cannot chat with players during champ select as u cant bring up friends list\ntheres no more interactive timeline of the game in match history - really need this back\n4.  Doesnt reorder champs to roles in new champ select still  \n\n== CLARITY ==  \n1. Everything is very hard to see (dull and dim) (especially between dimmed and non dimmed things. Such as : the icons that represent whether u have first win bonus, boxes available, champion unlocked/locked) (also hard to tell in champ select when u have locked in or not or Need to lock in)\n2. * Chat is transparent and hard to see\n3. * Hard to tell when someones online or offline or mobile\n4. * Hard to tell when someone chats to you (mini yellow number- useless)\n5. * Hard to tell when you have a game invite\n6. * Hard to tell whos chatting with you\n7. * The people names who you have chatted with are not rearranged in order of most recent or are highlighted on the left of the chat so if you have many people you talk with, and then one of the people on the bottom talk to you you cant see it on the left\n8. (Things that should be active should be brighter in comparison to things that dont need attention)  \n\n== PREFERENCES ==  \n1. * **Cant hide friends list**\n2. * No LP gains in match history\n3. * Have to press advanced details in after game screen and then click graph tab which is just tedious-Then to get out of after game screen have to press x to close advanced details and THEN quit by pressing quit button first.\n4. * opening advanced details should go to graph first\n5. * Champ select still doesnt show champs you have unlocked box on already for that season\n6. * Have to be IN the lobby to quit rather than clicking the x on the top in legacy client to quit lobby. which is just another step and tedious\n7. * Hard to see masteries in a dropdown list now (good for selection like in champ select but annoying when editing and want to see them)\n8. * Item sets - personally i like to use it to view item combinations and organise them in the easiest way for my roles before games\n9. skin collection - show our skins unlocked. Please ? T^T  \n\n== Patch changes ==  \n1. * Control ward hard to tell apart, red colour should change. it looks too much like the sweepers. Maybe change it to a pinky colour\n2. * Edge of night should show a growing purple ball or meter or something to show that its channeling on your champion model. Too hard to see regardless of what team ur on","replies":[]}
