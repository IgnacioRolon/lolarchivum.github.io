Her level 2 will be crazy with her E root.\n\nHer W auto attack passive has more damage than Zoe's passive. Its even better than Diana's in the early levels.\n\nHer E is basically a Lux Q that does less damage than Lux's one but can hit more targets, so it seems fine. It scales up to a Morgana level root though (3 seconds) which is a bit much. Morgana is already a pain, but this can go THROUGH minions, so it would be insane to be hit by it.\n\nI think her only \"broken\" part is the Ult damage. Seems busted combined with the fact it also has 2 CCs and a Shield.\n\nCompare similar ults:\n\nNeekos level 3 Ult is 650 + 1.3 AP  90s cd   PLUS 50 (+40 for each champion) + 0.5 AP Shield, 40% Slow, 1.25s stun\n\nOrianna Level 3 Ult is 300 + 0.7 AP  80s cd PLUS 1.25s disable/displacement\n\nAmumu level 3 Ult is 350 + 0.8 AP 110s cd  PLUS 2s entangle\n\nZiggs level 3 Ult is 400 + 0.7 AP 90s cd however if you are in the centre it is 600 + 1.1 AP\n\nZiggs Ult rewards accuracy with extra damage whereas Neeko's Ult seems huge and does more damage then a well placed Ziggs ult. Granted you have to rewards getting into Melee range vs long range attacks with more damage.\nSo we can compare Lissandra's damage which is 350 + 0.6 AP or Dianna's which is 220 + 0.6 AP. Granted Diana's combo is to double proc her ult, so we can say 440 + 1.2 AP. But again, this is a single target attack vs Neeko's AOE CC.\n\nHOWEVER, if you compare level 1 ults not level 3, her ult is pretty in line with others.\n\nNeeko level 1, 200 +1.3 AP, 90s cd\nZiggs level 1, 200 + 0.7 or 300 + 1.1 for the centre 120s cd.\nOrinna level 1, 150 + 0.7 AP, 110s cd.\n\nHer ult scales WAY better than anyone else. Maybe they will add a scaling CD to it too, so it comes in line with everyone else.\n\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#neeko2\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n**TL:DR** I was ready to agree with you before doing all this research, but after comparing all her numbers I think she will be relatively ok. I think her kit has WAY too much utility. She has a very good early game, an average mid game then a crazy strong late game by the looks of it.\n\nI would:\nLower the duration of her root on champions to cap at 2s instead of 3.\nLower the damage of her level 3 ult to be more in line with other champions.\nIncrease the CD of her level 1 ult to be more in line with other champions.\nRemove the slow from her ult and the MS from her W passive.\n\nWhich will probably happen after some testing on the PBE.
