After some matches, I do AI for fun and test. Then I met those ppl? They picked normally, then in game, just go and feed all the bots. I&#039;m pretty sure they are some kind of programs cause they don&#039;t talk, doing everything like a bot (worse than LOL bots) . There are no response from them (/ff and only 1 vote). Their lvl are like 8-12 but always the same summoner, no history, no normal matches.\r\nSo I just want to ask is this a new third party to help lvling or they are real people? Cause it made me mad when I met 4 of them in a game. My relaxing game became hell. I already met 5 of these KIA players, reported all but no use. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-01-07T07:38:58.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are bot scripts.

Just backdoor the bots. Other than that play a champion that you are confident you can win a 1v5 with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-06T01:45:41.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So I just want to ask is this a new third party to help lvling or they are real people?\n\nThey are bots 100%. They'll level the accounts and then sell them, they go for around US$10. It's a bit of a black market, most of the buyers are trolls, who want to ruin games in ranked on a smurf or want a replacement account for their banned one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KIADevil","date":"2016-01-06T00:34:10.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait am i a bot","replies":[{"poster":"NamelessSoul","date":"2016-01-06T01:14:11.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, look at my picture.
