Flash or walk around, Need health? HPP, Need Vision? Ward ..\n\nIts just Riot making a \"effort\" they even took away the buffs from the jungle farm like why would you do that!, \n\nWolfs, Krugs, Gromp and Raptors all had buffs that helped and gave the junglers advantaged to gank and defend \n\nthis. is.
