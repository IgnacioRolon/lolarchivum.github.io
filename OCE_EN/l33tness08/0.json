Though this isn't a full fix you can download baron replay, it seems like the code is still there just hidden and baron replay can see it. \n\nI could be wrong but it had the option when I was using baron replay.","replies":[{"poster":"l33tness08","date":"2015-08-02T14:01:02.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might have a look into that, thanks for the suggestion.
