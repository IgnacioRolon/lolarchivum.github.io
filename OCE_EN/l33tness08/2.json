I love when you remove the Featured Game panel that makes spectating easy. \r\nNew Champ released? Might like to see him in a few games? Nah too bad. We need to talk about something to do with Bard in that panel. Coulda taken another panel? Nah, we NEED that &quot;LCS PREVIEW&quot; panel, need it real bad. Couldn&#039;t have featured games cycling through like normal. \r\n\r\nMay as well make an announcement and just say you&#039;re removing the spectate feature from the client. At least that way I don&#039;t expect it to be there and just get disappointed, every, freaking, time.","replies":[]}
