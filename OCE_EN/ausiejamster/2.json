I climbed to Gold V playing nothing but Support but have recently picked up Middle/Jungle as I believe it has more of an impact in the current meta. I am looking for someone to duo with while I improve my gameplay. My end goal is diamond by end of the 2019 season, however, I understand it will be a long journey so i just try to improve a little bit after each game.\n\nIf anyone would like to improve and climb with me that would be awesome! My op.gg is http://oce.op.gg/summoner/champions/userName=Diddy%20Kong\n\nBest of Luck on the rift !","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-10-29T21:41:08.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this guy is good and doesn't tilt at all ( I'm normally the tilted one ).{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n\ngreat at what he does and just wants to win the game hit him up :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Benihime","date":"2018-10-30T12:53:24.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll send u an add. r u on tonight?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pintauro","date":"2018-10-29T10:27:37.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing casually for a few years on and off, mainly support these days with a pinch of adc.
