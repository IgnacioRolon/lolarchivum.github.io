But the thing is, I have coached many teams before and have had gotten 2 teams to plat. I do know my stuff and have been in many ranked teams each doing my best in part to achieve maximum results. I would be higher in rating if I put a lot more time into solo queue, but at the moment, teams is the way to go for competitive play. So that being said, although it is a team full of plats and stuff, I do keep high up with them and can play just about any role required, I am not a casual player so I am hoping I can hear from you soon.\n\nThanks, Sir Jazza.","replies":[]}]}
