I don't leave games but the other day I had trouble connecting, managed to reconnect and came back but we lost (in a Normal) and I got some warning that I had to agree to not leave again. This is fine but things happen like my friend where a whole Internet Cafe disconnected from all games and I don't want to have my account in a low priority queue just because of bad luck.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I think that the players queuing with people in low priority queue should be able to browse the home screen, the shop, check their Runes and Masteries while they are waiting. Why should the good people be punished, only the person in the low priority queue should get this punishment. It's a great initiative but it seems to be a little too 'computer generated' and is negatively effecting those who are a positive influence in the community as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2015-02-01T09:14:11.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure I  understand what kind of answer you're looking for.\nBut no matter the circumstances, even if an internet cafe's connection is unstable - at the end of the day, if your account has a tendency to dc in games then it makes sense that you'd be put in a LPQ. As %%%%ty as it is for us people who do get put into a LPQ, it's even %%%%tier for those who have to deal with a DCer. The way I see it, the LPQs forces us players who have problems with our set up to go out and look for some sort of fix.\n\nwith your little poll on whether the leaverbuster is too harsh or not.\nWhat would you think of as a reasonable punishment?\nIf you have a bunch of people with a tendency to afk/dc in games, then how would you go about reforming this behaviour?\nIMO, the longer timers in the LPQ are effective. It's an effective consequential tool for the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-02T22:02:13.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the current system, it works pretty well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-01T09:24:19.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To address your first issue, that would probably have been your first (or one of your first) DCs in order to get the 'agree' pop-up. You're likely a significant number of DCs off Low Priority Queue. I'm not entirely sure what the number is to get LPQ but I think it's 10% of games, not entirely sure though.  You'd have to ask someone who knows, probably contact support and ask them.\n\nAs for people queuing with people in LPQ, I think it's a reasonable point however it could also provide a bit of incentive for people to not leave games. It wouldn't work on people who get there due to issues out of their control but intentional leavers would be affected in such a manner. Thing is people wont really want to queue with people who are in LPQ, since it will cause them to wait as well, thus meaning that people who get LPQ are left on their own by their friends.\n\nBut ultimately, is Leavebuster too harsh? No. It takes a significant amount of leaves to be hit with Low Priority Queue and it is quite effective in giving people incentive to not leave games intentionally. Sure that means the odd person is caught in the crossfire but that is bound to happen if you want the people who do the wrong thing to get caught and punished.","replies":[]}]}
