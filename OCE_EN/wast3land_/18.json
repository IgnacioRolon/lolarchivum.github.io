I personally use it after finding out about it, not sure if it&#039;s on the Apple store though cause I don&#039;t use anything Apple hehe","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-12T20:21:43.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I miss items sets sooooooo much.\n\nI would be too hesitant of getting banned for 3rd party programs.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-13T01:06:10.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot made a reddit post saying that item sets are not gonna be implemented into the new client and players are welcome to use 3rd party software to make item sets, the only reason yo6ll get banned for hsing third party software is if you augment the game in a way that favours you wich making item sets will not do","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-13T01:36:18.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when did they make this post?\ncan you link it?\n\nIve heard people say that due to community wishes RIOT will implement it back in again.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-13T05:38:18.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't able to find the Riot post because 1. i can't remember what it was called. 2. I'm lazy. But, this is the official Riot website \"No software should interfere directly with the in-game player experience, from when you press “Play” to the end-of-game screen.\" Creating item sets on third party software does not interfere with the in game experience, it will only create item sets which are already implemented in client itself hence no trouble will be caused with Riots TnC. Here is a post on NA http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client-discussion/r9VXPaNP-where-are-item-sets-in-alpha-client\n\n \"Item sets still exist, but there is no longer an Item Set editor.\n\nYou can still create custom item sets by editing them outside the client. Riot expects third party editors to fill this gap.\n\nCurrently, I'm only aware of item set downloaders, like Championify, which downloads popular item sets from sites like champion gg. I hope we'll soon see a straight up item set editor.\" Hope this helps","replies":[{"poster":"Laetitian","date":"2016-12-29T09:47:23.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wast3land ,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BalKn1Rf,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-12-13T05:38:18.378+0000)\n>  &quot;Item sets still exist, but there is no longer an Item Set editor.[\"]\n> \n> You can still create custom item sets by editing them outside the client.

That comment was not made by a Riot employee, and it was not forecasting future changes, but only pointing out the current state of the new client.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
