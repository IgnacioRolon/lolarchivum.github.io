Practically every champion who has been released since Kindred has had a 1350 skin. Just think about it:\n\nShadowfire Kindred - 1350 RP\nVoidbringer Illaoi - 1350 RP\nHigh Noon Jhin - 1350 RP\nAshen Lord Aurelion Sol - 1350 RP\nFreljord Taliyah - 1350 RP\nCandy King Ivern - 1350 RP\n\nThe only exception was Sir Kled, but I think they actually said that it was a mistake and the release price was an error, but as people has already bought the skin they had to keep it at 975 or some shit like that.\n\nAnyway, the new Camille skin has already been confirmed as an epic skin, which is 1350. Case closed.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-11-27T05:40:06.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. But Sir Kled was 975RP in PBE, so no mistake there.

Also, since skins don't go on sale on release anymore, the bundles have gone up in price.
