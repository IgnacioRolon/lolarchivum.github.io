I am a Silver Riven 1 trick. I&#039;ve recently got promoted to Silver 2. Went on a lose streak, and I&#039;m back down in Silver 3. I need some help, any advice. My lanning phase is the only part I strive at. I can push a lead, but cannot get a lead. Was just hoping to get some questions answered, any feedback is welcomed.\r\n\r\n1. How do I know when to TP and weather it will be a good TP or not?\r\n\r\n2. If my bot lane is fighting and I&#039;m at base, and I see an opportunity to TP, but my laner is pushing into my turret, do I TP to my lane or bot lane? \r\n\r\n3. If both me and my laner are low, but minions are pushing towards him. do I back and risk enemy getting 6 first or do I stay?\r\n\r\n4. What do I do if I am behind in lane?\r\n\r\n5. What do I do after lanning phase (20 min)\r\n\r\n6. When do I know is a good time to TP to dragon/baron to help team win fight or to continue split pushing?\r\n\r\n7. What can I do if the enemy bot lane is fed and I&#039;m not?\r\n\r\n8. How do I know where the enemy jungler will be when in lanning phase?\r\n\r\n9. When do I know is a good call for baron and dragon when I&#039;m split pushing with TP down?\r\n\r\n10. Against the current tank meta, what do I do in lanning phase when I encounter; Trundle, Cho&#039;Gath, Mundo ect?\r\n\r\n11. When is a good time to Rift Harold?\r\n\r\n12. When is a good time to use Rift Harold?\r\n\r\n13. What do I do if I&#039;m getting hard camped top (getting doved on)?\r\n\r\n14. When to know if I should talk TLD or Fevor?\r\n\r\n15. When should I ward if I don&#039;t know the enemy jungler&#039;s position?\r\n\r\nThis is my op gg.\r\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Wast3land%20\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the helps I can get, Thanks &lt;3\r\n\r\nPs. I didn&#039;t mean to support Riven, didn&#039;t realise I was autofilled until the last minute (went to the bathroom). Plus, I wasn&#039;t a hinderence to my Tristana that game, got 2 kills for her at 3 mins ( Sona didn&#039;t respect my lv 2 and exhaust ) and she managed to snowball from there. I&#039;ve realise how bad triforce is in terms of cost effeciency and have stopped building it.","replies":[{"poster":"ZoeIsLegaltoFap","date":"2017-09-16T03:55:52.393+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. It's always a bit of a gamble but most of the time your tp presence will cause the enemy bot lane to back away which could save your botlane. A good tp is following the enemy top or mid laners tp but if you want to engage with a tp prepare for your laner to follow you.. You can execute a good tp by telling your bot lane to put a deep ward when they are pushing and then tell them to freeze and let enemy push. There are also lots of cheesy tp from river in fog of war where they might not see it.\n2. Always help bot most of the time because if you are successful you can 3 man push the turret as apposed to the enemy top laner 1 man pushing (or two if jungler helping) and most of the time you will get first turret so it is a worth trade. But sometimes your tp will merely just scare off the enemy bot lane and possibly save your team and then you can cancel the tp and continue top.\n3. Depends if you know where enemy jungle is or not and if you know you can duel him e.g. a malphite or early game nasus. But if you have no vision or not sure if you can duel, just back as it is much better than dying  and making your enemy snowball :D.\n4. With riven I would say go tank as going damage and dying over and over isn't gonna help anyone, but yeah go tank and tower hug, most champs shouldn't be able to dive you and if they can bait with your jungler and you might even be able to turn a kill around.\n5. in silver no one really wards river so you can try cheese and gank mid after you have pushed your lane... Try not to use tp just to get to lane after 20 min as you can use it to make plays around the map. You can also pressure enemy topside jungle and place some deep wards.\n6. make a judgement call, if you know your team can secure the dragon then just continue to splitpush but if you are unsure then definitely tp. If you know they are going to lose the dragon or baron then continue to split push and force 1 or 2 of enemy to back which could save your inhib or even the game.\n7. Not sure what your asking here, do you mean when you can kill the enemy adc? If so that's no biggy you can always peel your adc and go full tank which in most cases as riven will make you successful. \n8. You should know at beginning from if the enemy bot lane is late to lane, but sometimes this isn't true cause rapter start is popular. If they start bot like bost do you should slowly follow them in the jungle. e.g. if you are blue side they are most likely going to go blue to wolves to red and then look for  a gank or take scuttle. You should know where they are if you place a deep ward and see if their camps are up... if they are up it means the jungle is probably around topside and you should play safe, if they are dead the jungler is probably taking botside jungle and you can play more aggressive.\n9. When you know you can your team can get it mainly. When you don't have tp in the late game it is probably a good idea to stick with your team though and just go with the flow unless you know you can get something out of split pushing.\n10. I'm a mid laner so this isn't my specialty. They are some quite op champs but in my experience I'm pretty sure riven outclasses them in the early game so go aggressive and try snowball.(mundo get executioners)\n11. when the enemy jungle is bot and you have shoved your lane.\n12. when the enemy has at least 2 dead and you are grouped with team.\n13. Advise your jungle to put some hard pressure bot and don't worry about it if you keep getting dove without getting kills you are not worth any gold so its ok if you just keep calm and try catch up.\n14. Fevor if you know its going to be a tank riven game. TL if you know its gonna be a one shot squishy game.\n15. When you are pushed or when you know that you want to make a play and engage.\n\n\nBut what do I know, I'm just a scrub platinum.... {{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-09-16T03:57:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: noticed I was logged in on my smurf XD..\nhere is my main for the \"authenticity\" ;)","replies":[]}]}]}
