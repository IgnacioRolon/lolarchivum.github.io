Poeple do that all the time!! But i have eveidence to prove it, but don&#039;t know if it&#039;s enough, i&#039;ve played with him a few games and only won 1, and that was because i went 16/7/14. Here it goes. He has over 100K on Vayne being his highest mastery champion, so its aafe to asume he mains Vayne right? I mean why invest so much time in 1 champ right? Well, it&#039;s been over 2 months and he has only played 4 games of Vayne, lost 2, won 2, has a kda of 1.10;1, 39% kill partipation. The whole of season 6, he played 21 games of Vayne and has a 23% win rate, He has more games on Darius, Morde and Lucian over 60%. It&#039;s been over 3 months since he last played Darius and Morde and 1 month since he played Lucian. The last game he played ranked was 2 weeks ago, he played 4 and lost 4 with a kda of 1.12;1. The games he played were against Silver player and for a &quot;Plat ADC&quot; main to lose to Silvers is just embarresing, 4 in a row as well. As i said, his last ranked game was 2 weeks ago and he has been playing norms, he has a 40% win rate overall and he plays against silvers. You may say &quot;team mates blah blah blah&quot; No, he doesnt even go postive. He has a kda of 1.13;1 AGAINST SILVERS. After reading this, could you pls put your conclusion in the polls below?

The first time I met him I was playing against him in a Riven mirror match and I won 5/3, Granted I'm a Riven one trick, so lets just say bad game. Someone in game type \"TFW a Plat Riven loses mirror lanes xd\" and he started ranting about his elo, saying that \"for a silver, you talk too much shit to Plats\" he ended the game with 5/9 and i ended with 12/6. Point is, why would someone get so defensive and worked up over something they dont need to prove since players can just check his profile?","replies":[]}]}]}
