Then i thought &quot;Hey, why don&#039;t i add variety to my champ pool&quot;. I&#039;ve been playing Fiora lately and having fun with her, although my performance are not too good. Thing is, i&#039;m not the best with Fiora and i don&#039;t know if i wanna continue with her. The thing is, am i overcommitimg to a champ i barely know about? I have lv 6 with Fiora and 1 lv 7 token atm. If i do go back to Riven, I&#039;ll have to play her twice as much just to get my mechanics back on her as i haven&#039;t played her aince the new assasin rework...the thing is, if i&#039;m already that good at a champ i love, should i really be looking for change? It&#039;s not like Riven is boring, give me an option to pick any champion for as long as i play league and Riven will always be my first and only choice. So the queation now is, should i try to improve my Fiora or just focus on Perfecting my Riven","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-11-15T01:41:44.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say play whatever you want and not one specific role/champion, you will learn so much more by this, game knowledge, mechanics, basically anything you would need to know about the game. This concept is similar to the idea of \"Playing support makes you better at adc\".  By understanding what it is like to play the other roles and what each role represents in a team and how they work together and all the different match up's and doing this through your own play on other roles. Your overall gameplay improves a lot faster when you understand each role.\n\nYes, certain champions are meta picks and are \"better\" than others, however playing whatever you want again makes you improve faster. You get to learn match-ups both for yourself and your team. You can improve laning in general as you get to know \"poke vs engage\" and similar match-ups, brilliant for any lane and keeps you from feeding, similarly, could increase the chances of a snowball.\nOverall playing whatever is more effective as you are learning a lot more, vital for you to improve. As you reach higher ranks, you will find that playing anything is less effective as everyone knows what to do in specific match-ups and has really good mechanics, while you are \"average\" on every single champion and role. This is the point where you should change to a main role and set of champions that you can play to the highest of levels. Not only will it help you learn the game, it does you a favor when you are last pick, having to fill. It is not guaranteed that you win every fill lane, but it is certain that you will not do as bad as you would.\n\nId like to say i follow this to a T as i know what i play well and i play that in ranked,I know I can go back at anytime after a long break and still play them well, but this all came in time. when i play norms I tend to pick and play champs I would never touch in rank and just start learning, Ive started to learn Azir and i look like a total dweeb but each game i get better and learn , KDA might not be good but over time i will get there. I tend to have 3-5 champs i learn at any one time to help break it up and also lane pick.  Most people will have roles that they dislike ( mine is ADC!!!! ) Now I know i need to fix this but i dont want to haha. But in this case i have bit the bullet and i have a decent grasp on Ez  so if need be i can play it, So its always good to have something for each lane just in case.\nAnywho Sorry for the book but i can talk about this stuff all day.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-15T02:13:35.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have Yasuo in mid than i am ok with, Diana in the jg that i'm ok with, Lucian as my adc that i'm ok with and Braum as my support that i'm ok with, but my Riven in the top lane (Not to brag) Is phenomenal, and it just feels so good to play her. This is like something a friend told me, \"If you're really good at something, then why stop?\" I guess that's how i got to 1 trick Riven in the first place... I might just go back to being a 1 Trick Riven main again, might be rusty tho, so need to brush up on my mechanics again :3 Thanks hehe xd","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-11-15T03:59:06.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its good to see you have a champ for each lane, however with 133 champs and counting its good to try more, as each champ will have some sort of counter so when picking the other champs to play maybe learn the few that counter what you play. When you do this you will see what they can do, when they spike, dmg at each lv, cd timers ect ect . So when the time comes and your playing your main and they counter pick you have a good idea of what your in for and what you can do to make sure you dont fall behind. \n\nI understand how you feel about one tricking, as I one trick jungle and have for the past 3/4 seasons,skimped on S4 due to bad placements and gave up trying to play with IRL friends who where bronze ( see what happens when your social lol  :P ) but in saying this i have 6 junglers i play very well so no matter what the team needs I know i have a champ to suit.  Trust me you can climb doing this no problem however is they ban that champ, Riven being in the top 10 picks and top 20 bans out of 133 champs there are good chances she may be banned and if people are using sites like opgg and see your a 1 trick the ban may come more often. I get it alot when people see my nid/graves jg( decent win % but high KDA  so my inpact when playing the champs are high) and both being high ban rates so i need something to back it up so I have elise and olaf and a few other to pick from so this very reason, so i would suggest looking at learning your counter picks if your going to one trick just to keep yourself up to date and know what to expect in the lane. ^_^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-11-14T16:26:37.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its always good to have a fallback. im only silver so i dont know how much weight my opinion carries, but I main Ali, easily my most palyed champ, and n ranked i had a 55+% win rate with him iirc, btu there were times when i couldnt pick ali, or the matchup just wasnt good. so i had to fall back on something. its always good to have a backup plan, is what im trying to say","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-14T21:42:31.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchups isn't a problem with me on Riven, i've learn and studied and know how to play against any champions in top (Except Pantheon fuck Pantheon) but with Fiora i only knew a few matchups, and the rest i'm clueless at, plus she ain't really meta atm so there isn't much guides on her, i get that having a backup is good but if i keep going on and persisting on Fiora, wouldn't get rusty on Riven? Isn't it better to be perfect at 1 thing than to be decent at 2 things? That's the same question as \"Isn't it better to be a 1 trick pony than to be a jack of all trades?\"","replies":[]}]}]}
