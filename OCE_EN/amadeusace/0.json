Only thing that really changes is the attitude. \n\nGoes from \"i dont belong here bad teams keeping me here\" to \" im gold 5 jm better than you silver 1s and below\"","replies":[{"poster":"AmadeusAce","date":"2017-08-30T14:16:43.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe people think about others according to their personality and their attitude in life.\n\nyou got the point.. i cant play rank games yet.\n\nNo I dont bait...\n\nIm looking for someone to share the fun because Im playing quite a lot... someone under 30 like me cant carry me anyware...
