I mean, if I spend this much money on a free to play game, taking it all away from me should be classed as theft in the name of the law.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care what kind of stuff it says hidden in the EULA, I deserve a refund. I am going to ask support and if they do not help, that proves that Riot are just a bunch of thieves that only care about the money. That&#039;s like if I buy a game from game store, and they say I&#039;m Perma-Banned, take the game, and don&#039;t refund me. Like seriously, I realize that I&#039;ve hurt lots of people online, and I sincerely apologize for that, and have begun to reform. But I will not agree that the Perma-Ban was fair. I was banned based of some games that occurred AGES ago, and those were used as evidence of my toxicity, even though I&#039;ve reformed some since then.\r\n\r\nLook Riot, I&#039;m posting this to support. I&#039;m not asking for my account back since I have broken the rules, I am just asking for you to be decent people for once in your lives. Give me back my Riot Points and gifts on another account. And if this task is too hard for you, that proves that you don&#039;t actually care about your player-base.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure you understand that behind my computer screen, I am a nice person. I do not deserve to be robbed of money, or my friend&#039;s money.\r\n\r\nLike, my friends PAYED for stuff for me to use, because they wanted to see me in that good skin you know, so you are not only committing theft on a toxic player, but you are basically taking my friend&#039;s money as well, and they AREN&#039;T toxic. That&#039;s right. Not fair. Can&#039;t believe I supported this company with my money I earned from work when I could&#039;ve been saving for a car or something. Obviously I haven&#039;t spent my life savings on this game. But I am expecting to get my hard earned skins, champions and runes back.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-12-06T03:04:07.005+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"i paid $50 to go to a club\nand then  i started to scream at everyone 'assholes', i was told to be quite or i will be kicked out.

It's not your money (or your friend's), it's Riot's money.

You can agree it has no monetary value, but depending on any loopholes/interpretation you can push you could argue it does have monetary value. Just because they've written it there it doesnt make it law, although this example would probably be a lost cause.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elvelt6","date":"2016-01-09T03:33:35.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HA sucked in. next time you spend a few hundred dollars on a game that you can get perma banned in think twice about ruining other peoples experience of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tonight Forever","date":"2015-12-20T07:17:30.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't be stupid.\n\npeople dont get banned on OCE","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-06T08:19:14.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"hard earned riot points\" who the fuck are you trying to manipulate with your pathetic sob story. you dont EARN riot points, you buy them, at your own discretion, keeping in mind it means absolutely nothing in terms of value to anybody but you and the stuff riot offers. also, i know that YOU didnt buy them, your parents did, or more likely centrelink did, you didnt earn anything and you dont work hard for anything except writing this bullshit drivel that you expect everyone to feel sorry for you for","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-06T07:59:49.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all the rp you paid? no, but i do think if you have unspent rp, you should gt money back equivellent to that.\n\nonly problem there? people gift you rp, prepaid cards, and they are legally stopped form keeping your credit details to refund to.\n\n+ perma bans only last 5 years, you will get your money back around when kanye runs for prez, think of it as a... reward(?) for his running.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avago ya mug","date":"2015-12-06T07:35:25.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahaahahahahaha........HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAA !","replies":[]},{"poster":"kiwiboizz357","date":"2015-12-06T03:08:21.760+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"To everyone who in this comment section who has not been banned, you are been stupid.
