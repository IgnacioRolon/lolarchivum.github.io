Making him a general threat to all who oppose him.\r\nQ. Shield wall &ndash;\r\nActive: Titerous dashes forward which if he hits a target he deals physical damage and slight knocking a single target backwards wile marking the target with a Black cross shortly after Titerous will block/parry the next ability/auto attack from the marked champion/monster.\r\nW. strengthened will -\r\nPassive: Titerous gains bonus armour and magic resist around enemy champions.\r\nActive: Titerous gains massive armour and magic resist at the cost of reduction of his own damage.\r\nE. Swing of the ages &ndash; \r\nActive: Titerous takes a slight delay which he lines up his mace to take a massive swing knocking the target sideways, which does damage based on a percentage of the targets max health. In the doing so if the target collides with any nearby terrain the target will be stunned for 1 second.\r\nR. Bring down the gates &ndash;\r\nActive: Titerous takes a second to charge up his gigantic mace and slams it into the ground which creates a massive earthquake slowing the targets struck by the ability, which does moderate damage and reduces the champions armour and magic resist for 5 seconds while marking the champions hit by the ability for 5 seconds revealing them on the map. (Titerous can also use this ability on structures)  i decided to come up with this champion idea because i use to love playign taric and leona but i thought of making a champion that is simalir to these champions bu could actualy do damage. so yeah help me make this champion!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-31T04:48:32.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That passive name is taken... by another passive. that effect, exactly same as another persons concept. and you have spelling errors. also need base stats, also needs scaling's. you can't post it in this condition and even hope for good effective constructive criticism.
