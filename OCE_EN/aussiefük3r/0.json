I know this isnt a full fix but it works fine.\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"NyldÉrkor","date":"2020-01-05T05:52:16.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just click below the select and then hit escape and it passes the reward screen, cant get the rewards but can at least keep playing","replies":[]},{"poster":"NawtSmurfin","date":"2020-01-02T17:37:12.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same is happening to me now.
