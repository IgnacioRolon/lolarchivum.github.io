Blitzcrank is a one trick pony, a Warwick in disguise, but people deny that fact becuase \"hurr he has [one] skill shot xd hard to play\" except he has so much counter-play, the only thing he outplays is himself.\r\n\r\nI honestly would much rather have a NIDALEE support over Trollcrank.","replies":[{"poster":"Sylveonz","date":"2014-12-17T22:18:19.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Improve your reaction time.
