The ethics of alternate accounts.\n2. The actual status of a given account.\n\n1- Should alternate accounts be banned entirely, or should only smurfing be punished? Where do you draw the line and how do you determine intent? Let's take two Master tier players as an example. \n\nPlayer 1 has created a second account, and purposefully dropped it into Bronze to stomp lower tier players every now and again. This is clearly problematic behaviour on multiple levels and should be (and usually are) punished.\n\nPlayer 2 has created a second account to climb the ranks again, either in an off-role or simply to see how far they can get from a fresh start. For 10 or so games this player is still going to be messing with the true MMR of the games they are in, causing inaccuracies. You could argue such players are having a negative impact as well, but there is no ill intent, and in fact, they have a perfectly legitimate reason for levelling a new account. Should they be denied that long-term opportunity for the short term and temporary negative impact they have?\n\n2- Just because an account has a low level and a high win-rate, doesn't mean it's an alt or a smurf. \n\nIt could be a veteran from before uncapped levelling making their comeback (you yourself appear to have played for at least 5 seasons and are only level 60). It could be a player with previous MOBA experience making their foray into League (there's more than a few DotA converts). It may be a player with transferrable skills from other genres of game playing League for the first time (other RTS and micro/macro management type deals). It could be a new player who got placed lower than they wanted and has taken the time in research and practice mode or customs to hones their skills before jumping back into ranked.\n\nAn abnormally high win-rate could just mean it's a player who mostly plays normals and has improved there before try-harding it in ranked. An abnormally high score could be attributed to the polarising nature of gold and below games. An abnormally high KDA but a low win-rate could be attributed to good champion mechanics but average or sub-par macro and game management.\n\nThe thing is, smurfs really aren't all that common. Those that are blatantly smurfing (think player 1 from the above example) are going to get banned real fast for intent feeding or any number of other offences. If they're being sneaky about it it might take longer, but they either aren't playing many games at all or are playing most games completely normally, which will match their MMR pretty well.\n\nThe same goes for high tier alt accounts. Even if you ignore the fact that the high tier population isn't all that large comparatively, the system gets the MMR of those accounts accurate (or very close to) inside of 10 games. For example, my (Plat) alt account, on which I play ADC instead of Support was versing high Golds and Low plats before I'd even finished placements.\n\nOf course, the other thing is, the starting MMR is low-mid Silver, so players who belong in that range through Gold are going to be seeing more of such accounts than any other bracket.\n___\n\nThere are so so many factors that go into an account, and someone having a good game or having experience outside of League etc. etc. is just as punishable as someone having a bad game (i.e not at all). Though naturally, if you see genuinely problematic behaviour, you should absolutely report it.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2019-07-15T12:45:43.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're points are valid and with merit, However you missed quite a few other points which also deserve attention.\n\nThere are more types of smurfs than just those who create alt accounts and go in bronze, to assume its just the lowest of ranks is arrogant presumption.\n\n\n1. **Account sharing**: Regular account which 80% of the time is used normally with occasionally being used by a friend or family member. \nThey owned the desired champ the \"smurf\" wishes to play, so they use the account for practice.\n\n2. **Mate boosting**: Mate plays like a god in norms, other mates figure \"he deserves to not be in iron, bronze or silver etc.\" so they will either \nA: Play on the account while also practicing off-roles and champions they normally wouldn't use.\nB: Duo and just tell their mate to play passive and focus on farm, They will be so nervous they will just do as they are told.\n\n3: **The Sadistic Smurf**: OCE has alot of these! i know because i'm one of them.\nI'm hard-stuck D3. i'm not getting any higher unless i grind a fuck ton, its taxing and on OCE high elo is inbred. if you piss anyone off the chances of them being in the next game are quite high. i don't like playing norms because its not that fun for me, so i'll jump on a \"Alt\" account. it can range from g4 to p1. Generally i wont go below g4 because i dont need a montage real and most of those players are chimps. its not even close.\n\n4. **The Montage smurf**: Don't have alot of these because we have very little content creators on OCE and most of the League stuff on youtube has been done over and over.\n\n5. **The Stream Smurf**: \nMidBeast, perfect example of this, plays smurfs for views on twitch UNRANKED TO CHALLENGER! and will grind. \n\n\nLast thing i want to touch on is the MMR and i'm going to use Midbeast as an example here.\n\non multiple occasions the MMR system has failed to detect he was a smurf, in x2 instances he had a 28 win streak and still climbed like a normal player. never skipped or even vs'ed harder players. Even he has stated that the MMR system on OCE needs attention.  Which brings me to your second Smurf Type.\n\n6. **The genuine smurf**: This account is made for the sole purpose of climbing fast in either a new role or a main role with better stats or a tilt account. However, in most circumstances they encounter the hard stuck MMR., they go on massive win streaks, get frustrated because it isnt climbing and drop the account.\n\nThere are alot of types of smurfs and alot of scenarios that can be played out. but the percentage is smurfs on OCE is quite high, and account sharing has been an issue for some time.\n\n\nTLDR:\nMore than 1 type of smurf, don't just classify them as 2 types when very wrong and misinformation.\nMMR system for smurfing needs QOL attention  ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-15T15:04:36.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.. Account sharing isn't typically punished (despite being explicitly against the ToS) unless it's used maliciously or problematically. Two people playing the same account in ranked is recognised as problematic and is a quick and easy way to get your shared account banned. It basically falls under the boosting umbrella and as far as I know follows the same punishment pattern.\n\n2A. This is boosting. Boosting is banned. Both boostee and (where possible) booster get a 14-day ban with loss of all current and previous ranked rewards, perma for repeat offenders. As far as I know, these are typically done in waves so sometimes they can take a bit longer than would be ideal but more are caught overall.\n\n2B. Duo boosting is a bit trickier.  There can be a substantial skill disparity even in the allowed tier differences, and duo 'boosting' in this manner is obviously fine. Ultimately, everyone has that opportunity so it's not an unfair advantage, just one that some people don't take..well advantage of. Where it's a high-level player levelling a new account to play with a lower-tier friend that gets dicey and basically fits into all the points in my original comment. Where do we draw the line and how should that line be managed?\n\n3.. + 4. See 1 in my original comment. Intent, where's the line, are they causing problems etc etc.\n\n5.. The people that just lose placements I don't think face all that much consequence (which personally I disagree with, but probably it's not enough time for the system to determine intent), but they also are very quickly adjusted to the games they should be in by the system. Like I said, generally inside of 10 games. \n\nNot skipping tiers doesn't necessarily mean it's not accurately reading his MMR. Don't look at his tier, look at the games and the relative MMR of the people he's playing with/against. Skipping tiers comes down to how confident the system is in a more exact visible rank to match the MMR it's seeing. The MMR is generally still putting people in the games they should be in reasonably quickly (in my experience).\n\n6.. This is where the misinterpretation of the term I had comes in a bit. (To be clear, I also was under the impression smurf essentially was interchangeable with alt account). By definition, smurf is an explicitly malicious descriptor. Again though, I addressed this in my original comment.\n\nTL;DR I was not classifying them as two kinds of smurfs/alts, I said there was two key points when discussing smurfs/alts overall. Possibly it does need some QoL attention, but that doesn't at all mean things are as broken as people portray.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2019-07-14T03:26:41.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing XD, if its not a mirco transaction its not worth there time XD lol","replies":[]}]}
