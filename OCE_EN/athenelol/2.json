You guys (Ghostcrawler) really went batshit stupid. I know it&#039;s just your job, and you want to make sure it&#039;s secure to pay your mortages. But fuck me. How do you break the game to this extent. All forms of the original game is gone. ADC&#039;s can frontline (Kai&#039;Sa), Tanks are out 1v1ing damage dealers. WTF is going on?\r\nThe reason your game is dead because your designers are &quot;smart&quot; jokes. Hire the best marketers in the world to get people back, you can&#039;t polish a turd. Every Rioter has sharp communication skills which makes them sound reasonable, but don&#039;t know what the fuck they are talking about. Your game is trash now\r\n\r\nSolution: Remove your shitty silo&#039;s and fire all your new character designers since 2013, get the core group that made the game and focus on it. You don&#039;t need 1000+ staff working on a MOBA for god&#039;s sake.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-29T05:06:57.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao so delusional ðŸ˜‚","replies":[]}]}
