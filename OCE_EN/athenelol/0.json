The games there are also just as trolly, maybe slightly more so due to autofills not caring about the small rank 'splash'.\n\nEarly season ranked tends to be awful wherever you are.  This season is messier with smurfs having to carve their way up from the bottom rather than the middle of the pack. \n\nYes, so many games are being won by stomps, as we still have insane snowballing, and unlike in previous years, playing safe in lane means dominant laners get fed off plates anyway.\n\nSilver 3 into gold 1 is now only 6 ranks different, certainly not uncommon for me in the last 2 years.  Doesn't occur in a typical game, but used to get 1-2 a week though s6-8.\n\nThere are problems, go to NA and they'll all be there waiting for you still, along with 180ms ping (ugh).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pho√©nix","date":"2019-03-05T03:06:16.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game definitely feels worse than it did even just a couple of seasons ago.
