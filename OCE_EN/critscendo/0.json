This way people that leave games because life happens aren&#039;t severely punished, but rage quitter and trolls who are likely to play again once the game ends are punished. Moreover the penalty time can be increased as it&#039;s only one queue penalty.\r\n\r\nI hope this is considered as I know that you know that leaver buster isn&#039;t perfect and will probably never be but this will get it somewhere.","replies":[]}
