That is defined not only by what undersea links exist to get from country A -> country B, but also whether or not an ISP chooses to use them.  For countries around the Pacific, it is often the case that a majority of traffic goes directly to/from the US, because that is where the cheapest links are.\n\nOne thing to note - it is possible that a current undersea cable outage, which is affecting the main link between South-east Asia and Australia is also affecting you.  So if your ping to OCE is different from normal it is possible that is why.\n\nThe best way to explore this is by [running a trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2), which can help you see what countries/regions are being passed through to get to Riot's servers.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
