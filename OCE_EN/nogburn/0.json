I won a match about 20 minutes ago or longer and clicked the continue on the victory screen it then came up with retrieving the stats which stayed there for about 10 seconds. I then click skip waiting for stats which did nothing i tried twice more. So I just closed the game then reopened it and it came up with reconnect to the match/game cant remember exactly what it says but i thought it must be a glitch so i closed it and reopened it came up again. I asked my duo partner if he had the same problem after that match and he said yes but his worked once he reopened it. I then tried 3 times to connect to the &#039;match&#039; which was non-existent with the same box saying i failed to connect to servers and giving me the option to retry or be left with a black screen. I now restarted my computer to no avail but i logged on with my other account and it came up with the home screen so i think its a problem on your side and not mine anyway if you could help it would be greatly appreciated because right now i cant aply any games on my account\nRegards, Yomanxj\n\n\nEdit: It says game abandoned, you have left a game in progress. Please reconnect to the game. It also says the match doesnt exist on my match history on this website","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis is called a Ghost Game, these usually occur when there are server issues and the game doesn't correctly report as completed.\n\nThese usually resolve themselves within a few hours, Judging from the time of your post, this should've been resolved by now.\n\nif you're still experiencing this issue now, please let me know.","replies":[]}]}
