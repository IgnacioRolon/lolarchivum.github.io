So Just Asking, if an official Riot Person Can throw me an answer(preferably on this forum/board post) that would be great\r\n\r\nSigning off - Flamezrock\r\nKeep it going summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-24T23:04:16.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Flamezrock,\n\nLeague of Legends will not directly be at the EB Expo this year. Riot has stated that they will not be participating in the event circuit this year due to their focus being directed at developing the eSports of the Oceanic region.\n\n\"We're not doing the \"event circuit\" this year. We're focusing on our first ever standalone esports events in the OPL final that was at Luna Park in Sydney and the upcoming IWCA Allstars in Melbourne.\n\nWas a blast to meet you all at Arma last year, was my first ever visit to New Zealand and it was great, if a little chilly.\" - Sephyre [source](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/FljIO587-2015-armageddon-expo-auckland-is-league-of-legends-coming-im-gunna-be-sad-if-it-isnt))\n\nWith that said I'm sure a large amount of the Oceanic League community will be attending. I know I myself will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-09-24T23:46:57.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What DW Aatrox said.
