Good job.\r\nEdit - Just got an idea, wouldn&#039;t it make sense if we could buy the Essences for IP? Because right now, Its free and all but if you get something good, and dont want to spend a cent on Hextech Crafting, you have to wait another month for another 4 chests where you have a &quot;Chance&quot; of getting a skin shard, but will most likely just get another already gotten champion shard, to elaborate more \r\n1 IP = 1 Essence\r\n10 IP = 10 Essence\r\n100 IP = 100 Essence\r\netc.\r\nAlso, coming from a mostly ADC Bronze (scrub, I know) It is quite hard to get a chest, mainly because an ADC getting many kills, they set the bar pretty high and because of this you rarely get chests for going ADC.\r\nAny plans to do that IP = Essence Trade?

It will encourage more botting for IP farms (which is something Riot are trying to make less appealing).  \n\nAs for your troubles getting chests, I would suggest playing your ADC champs in mid/top in some normal games (since champs played in different roles are treated differently).","replies":[]}]}
