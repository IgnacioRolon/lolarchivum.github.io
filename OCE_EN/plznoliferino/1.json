These are the specs for my Mac and the bug has only started since patch 5.2. Also when I open the patcher through Open package contents/contents/LoL/RADS/projects/lol_patcher/releases/0.0.0.19/deploy/LoLPatcher or LoLPatcherUx or LoLPatcherUxHelper the patcher opens for about 10 seconds and then quits after not showing anything apart from the basic GUI\n\nMac Version: 10.10.2 Macbook Pro (13 inch mid 2009) \nCPU: Intel core 2 duo \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce 9400M \nRam: 8GB (1067 MHz DDR3)\n\nEvery now and again it will open and I believe that the reason I can't open my patcher (which means I then can't open my client) is because for some reason my internet (TPG unlimited) can't connect to the OCE servers even though I live in Brisbane QLD which really should be able to connect to OCE but still just won't. Please help I just want to play after spending about $500 on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-17T05:18:09.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TPG has a terrible reputation with Riot. Just want to establish that before hand before we dive into this, so that you know it could be a problem that's related to your ISP, not your computer or the Riot servers.\n\nThere was a known issue with a particular version of Mac OS, and Riot's solution is for you to update your OS. I think it was Yosemite, though I don't know it off by heart.\n\nIf you can't/don't want to update your OS, you can try [changing your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#mq3). Many people have reported that it worked for them, so if you haven't already, give it a go.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"PlzNoLiferino","date":"2015-02-18T05:56:32.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the most recent OS X and what happens if I change my DNS what will it achieve?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T23:20:53.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Domain Name Server is what retrieves names for the things you access on the internet.
