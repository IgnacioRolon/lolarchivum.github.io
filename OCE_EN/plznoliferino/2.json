This happened after trying various fixes for the 'Unspecified error, check logs for more information' bug. This bug had also followed a large amount of times when I couldn't get in game because of a pop up for 'atmos' that stopped the game from loading and running at all forcing me to force quit just so that I could close that window and try to reconnect only to get the same thing again.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Thank you to anyone who is able to help me\r\n\r\nP.S also for some reason I can't download the mac client from the oce.leagueoflegends.com website","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-01-29T07:37:10.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThere are a couple of stickies in this board that might relate to your issues.\n\nFirst up - [Mac Client Won't Even Open](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/kcQdkTJX-mac-issue-unable-to-open-lolpatcher)\n\nSecond, if you are having trouble downloading, this is actually an issue that has been reported a bit lately.  It sometimes relates to your PC or ISP having out of date DNS information.  Try looking at the instructions in [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/I8XUgB8w-rads-error-or-unable-to-connect-to-supportriotgamescom) for changing your DNS settings.  The first comment by Riot Zaps should have the info you need.\n\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"PlzNoLiferino","date":"2015-01-30T08:43:11.386+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update it worked and let me log in but then the moment I tried to test and play a bots match the client broke down and now I can open it but it just sits on the patcher screen for a few seconds and then stops","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlzNoLiferino","date":"2015-01-30T06:27:34.774+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much the going through package contents and opening the patcher first finally made it so that I can open league next I'm gonna try repair my client and hope that that means I can just keep it open if not then I'm perfectly happy setting up a shortcut to that folder :)","replies":[]}]}]}
