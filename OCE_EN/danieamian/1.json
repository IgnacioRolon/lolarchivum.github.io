The cave they had taken shelter in hadn&rsquo;t shown much use in evading the frigged wrath of the Ionian mountains. She focused on her fingers as their tips began to glaze with a light tint of blue. \n\n&ldquo;Push them under your arms,&rdquo; Yasuo suggested. He gestured as he slid his palm between his cloak. He turned his attention back to the pile of semi-frozen wood. His attempts to start a fire had been futile. \n\nTaliyah stood up and shifted herself towards the pit. She pulled her hands from her underarms and grabbed two stones she had kept in her tunic. She kneeled down and began to smack the stone&rsquo;s together relentlessly. She kept going, and didn&rsquo;t stop until sparks scattered from the rocks.\n\n&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that would actually work,&rdquo; she admitted. The wood began to light up in a flurry of warmth and comfort.\n\nYasuo snickered under his breath and said, &ldquo;thanks, kid.&rdquo; He sighed and laid back as he allowed the heat of the flames be absorbed into his body as Taliyah did the same. Yasuo pulled his flask from his cloak and took a swig of the Ionian ale he adored so much. He held out the canteen to Taliyah and she politely shook her head.\n\n&ldquo;Suit yourself.&rdquo; he said. He closed the flask lid and slid it back into his cloak&rsquo;s pocket. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you miss home?&rdquo; he asked.\n\n&ldquo;Every minute,&rdquo; she replied. \n\nThey both took that as their cue for the night. Taliyah drifted out of consciousness and despite the howling roar of the not so far blizzard, the heat of the fire reminded herself of home...\n\n&hellip; Taliyah woke to the feeling of shuriman sand seeping through her toes. The rugged sediments against her skin again nearly made her cry. She turned her head upwards to meet the shuriman sun upon her face, but was instead met by a fierce storm. The sand around her began to rise in a fury of blades cutting into her flesh. She used her abilities to fend of the sandstorm momentarily as a patch of sky appeared above her. She looked up in awe as a strike of violet lightning slit through the black sky. Taliyah heard an ungodly shriek from the distance and -\n\nYasuo was up in a flash at the entrance of the cave, his sword drawn at nothing.\n\n&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Taliyah gasped. &ldquo;It&hellip;&rdquo; she heaved, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo; She laid there in her own sweat, trying to catch her breath. \n\nYasuo sheathed his blade as he kept his eyes on the opening. &ldquo;You screamed,&rdquo; he said bluntly.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&hellip;&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I had a nightmare.&rdquo; \n\nYasuo relaxed himself as he sat onto the ground again. He sighed and rubbed his thumb against his eye. He was tired due to his sudden awakening. &ldquo;A wise man once told me, that there is no best way to conquer your fears. All you can do is approach them, how they affect you, is entirely up to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;\n\nTaliyah swallowed in hesitation. Her mind drifted back to the desert as she focused on the heat of the flames&hellip;  \n\n&hellip; She had been collecting supplies with her partner at the market of an old sales town. She remembered the sun gleaming through the walls of the ripped market stands. Shuriman artifacts were held in glass displays and shelved along the walls. She remembered the hurry of people rushing through the streets. &ldquo;Mickai&#039;el!&rdquo; she called out in her mind.\n\n&ldquo;Over hear, Taliyah!&rdquo; she heard in the distance. A hand raised above the crowd and was waved from left to right. Taliyah&rsquo;s face began to glow with light as she pushed through the hurrying crowd. The memory of Mickai&#039;el&rsquo;s face made Taliyah feel alive again... \n\n&ldquo;This boy is your lover? Yasuo asked.\n\n&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; she replied bluntly. \n\nTaliyah continued to explain&hellip;  \n\n&hellip; &ldquo;You ready to go?&rdquo; Mickai&rsquo;el asked. He and Taliyah had been preparing for an expedition into the desert. Mickai&rsquo;el had made it his mission to search for the creature that destroyed his home, and Taliyah agreed to help. She&rsquo;d didn&rsquo;t have much of an image of what they were looking for. All Mickai&rsquo;el could describe was it being large and coloured like the violet jewelry that had been worn by the god warriors. \n\nTaliyah grew up with the desert sun, so she hadn&rsquo;t been disorientated from the heat, but Mickai&rsquo;el wasn&rsquo;t raised in Shurima. He grew up on the outskirts of the region where the desert hadn&rsquo;t been too scarce. That&rsquo;s where he had been robbed of his home by the beast. He continued to drain their water supply despite Taliyah&rsquo;s warnings to preserve it, but by the time they noticed, it had been too late. \n\n&ldquo;We have to turn back,&rdquo; she insisted. Although Mickai&rsquo;el refused. Like their water supply, Taliyah hadn&rsquo;t realised the issue until it was too late. She now saw the fury and determination in his eyes. She now knew that nothing would stop him from moving forward. \n\nSuddenly the ground below them began to rupture. A sand dune emerged from the earth as it began to split in two. Then a colossal pillar of&hellip; she wasn&rsquo;t sure what it was&hellip; came spiraling from the earth. Purple lightning began to surge up the pillar and caught onto the blackened clouds in the sky. Never before had Taliyah seen such a sight, the alien structure, entwined in itself like two trees being planted too close together. \n\nThey both looked up in awe and horror at the pillar. Their attention was then immediately drawn by the shriek coming from below where the pillar had emerged. And suddenly, something in the sand had began to shoot towards Taliyah and Mickai&rsquo;el. Taliyah found herself rooted in place, in shock of the inevitable end she saw coming. She searched for it in herself to run, run as fast as she could. But she was rock solid.\n\nThe figured emerged from the sand and leaped at them. It&rsquo;s scale-like skin covered it&rsquo;s flesh in blue and purple armour. The shriek was emitting from the creatures arachnid-like jaws. It leaped onto Mickai&rsquo;el and began to tear him apart.\n\nTaliyah only heard the screams of her partner for a few seconds before they had been silenced. Somehow, this unspeakable horror had broken her spell as she began to run, run for her life. She didn&rsquo;t have time to notice the sand beneath her feet, shifting her forward. \n\nShe assumed now that that was her adrenaline manifesting her abilities&hellip; \n\nYasuo stared in silence. Only trying to comprehend the story.\n\nTaliyah crawled next to yasuo. She lifted his canteen from his cloak and drank from it.\n\n&ldquo;Woah, easy kid,&rdquo; he scoffed.\n\nTaliyah coughed and spat some of the liquid. &ldquo;How can you drink that?&rdquo; she asked.\n\n&ldquo;With practice,&rdquo; he answered. Yasuo took the bottle away from Taliyah and returned it to his pocket.\n\n&ldquo;Yasuo&hellip;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think a storm&rsquo;s coming. And this time&hellip; we can&rsquo;t hide&rdquo;\n{{champion:163}}","replies":[]}
