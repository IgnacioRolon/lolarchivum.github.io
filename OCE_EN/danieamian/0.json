But after playing her the other day and losing 4 times in a row I got a little annoyed. \r\n\r\nAn issue riot claim to be having is the fact that kalista has been too strong in higher elo but bad in lower elo. So me. And I realise that an issue that I keep having with kalista is not properly timing my jumps correctly. Very often, I find myself clicking at the wrong time while I&#039;m being chased down by an Udyr and instead of kiting, I end up stop attacking and just walking - then I die. \r\n\r\nAgain, I aware this is probably just me being bad, but I&#039;m assuming that there are a lot of people in lower elo&#039;s that have this issue. AND I realised that something that may assist in getting less experienced players to pick up kalista sometimes would be some training wheels.\r\n\r\nI looked up the passive indicator on the Kalista wiki and it&#039;s _there_... But it&#039;s gone from live and I can&#039;t find ANYWHERE as to why and when it was removed. This displayed when and how far Kalista could jump while she winds up each basic attack. I think this&#039;ll help people get use to the timing of Kalista&#039;s passive which is a huge issue I&#039;ve been having. Even as a Kalista main (or I just suck).\r\n[http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kalista](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Kalista)\r\n[Picture](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/6/6b/Kalista-Martial-Poise-Indicator.png/revision/latest?cb=20141119201243)\r\n\r\nSo - I&#039;m hoping to grab the attention of anyone on the development team to at least ask why this feature was removed from and to see if I can get some love for her after all of her brutal nerfs this season. \r\n\r\n{{champion:429}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T01:43:19.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Champs like Annie are designed to be quick to pick up and easy to master, so their peak effectiveness is achieved at a much lower skill cap. The drawback is there's only so far you can take them and only so much variation of play because of their simple kit.\n\nChamps like Kalista are designed to be moderately difficult to pick up and play, and hard to master. They are designed with dedication in mind. A complex kit means you have to play a lot more of the champ to learn all the ins and outs.\n\nPlaying Annie you would probably understand her pretty much in all her depth by Mastery 3. Playing Kalista you could be M7 and still refining your gameplay.\n\nEasy champs or crutches to learn on have their place, but that's not what Kalista was intended for. If you're really struggling with her passive, take it into practice mode, customs or co-op vs AI, where you can focus on that one thing rather than everything else that goes on in a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-06-14T20:15:16.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Danieamian","date":"2018-06-14T23:52:33.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cortez,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=zAv9OZrN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-06-14T20:15:16.243+0000)\n>\n\n\nI was just saying - it might be easier for people who would be new to kalista to have this function.","replies":[]}]}]}
