Making new account and trying to win games is extremely difficult when players lose their lane within 5 mins of the game, and not only lose the lane but either start intent feeding or rage quit. Then they queue up again to play another game and repeat the same crap again to add to their 1000 games already played. Riot should implement a system to pass a test to be qualified to play ranked so we don't have so many people with insanity and learning disabilities plaguing ranked. Anyone with 1000 games of ranked in a season that still plays poorly should be taken to a mental institution for insanity.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-03T07:09:10.068+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Tbh, it seems that you are just as ignorant as the people you are describing. **\n\n* Maybe the person sucks at league and is playing ranked in an attempt to get better without people in norms trolling and claiming 'it's just a norm'.\n* Maybe the person is newish to the roll they are playing and doesn't know match ups and stuff\n* Maybe their go-to champion was banned and they had to come up with a different plan. \n* Maybe they have had players like you in earlier games who rage at them all game and also in all chat and have developed the psychological phenomenon known as learned helplessness. \n\nThere are many reasons why people play badly in ranked and will have a really high game rate despite being in lower elos so don't be such a ------- about it. \n\n**Seriously though, you shouldn't call them insane or mentally disabled (or anything along the lines of autist/downy/schizo) because these words should not be used as insults when they can define another persons life**","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-03T10:22:12.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy gets the love. Not nice having my life used as an insult.\nTo the OP, instead of screaming at people for doing badly offer them advice. They won't be so bad if people help them to improve. Also, don't be a jerk, or else people will be a jerk to you too!","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-03T22:55:41.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao'd. Not even joking atleast 80% of the players that would be considering bad are the types of players who instantly mute anyone that hints slightly at criticizing them or offering advice... These days I call bad players bad and they either mute me and continue being bad or ask for advice and learn something.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-12-03T07:59:23.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"after looking at your stats i wonder how you feel you are in a position to talk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-03T07:10:39.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just made a smurf on LAN, it starts with 1500 ranked games played. so as to look at bad as the other LAN players.","replies":[]}]}
