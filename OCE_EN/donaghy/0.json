Most fun, and a good break from normals/rank. Hardly any toxicity etc. Its been over 2 years since I xferred. Would love this game mode implemented, even it its one or two days a week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RamboSprinkles","date":"2016-01-28T00:45:06.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I generally agree with you (I would love to see the map available to queue), It is not like you can't play it at all. Get your friends together and play it in custom. That said... I would like to see it available if possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-01-27T21:00:39.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When dom first came out i was in love with the mode. It was a nice break from the SR model of play.\n\nKind of annoying that we OCE don't get to play it though. I understand we don't have a huge amount of players on OCE and they don't want to spend extra on more servers but at least let us que up to American servers for Dominion at least!","replies":[]}]}
