Seeing as you won&#039;t encounter a truly lost case more than every 10 games anyway, you won&#039;t need it more than that. Also, people will wanna save their dodge for when something really horrible comes along. As long as you&#039;re not a troll, you shouldn&#039;t have to worry about people dodging on you too often.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is it allows people to dodge if someone clearly intends to troll in champion select, or they can use it in those circumstances where your teammates all picked assassins when you&#039;re adc and you just have no confidence you will win. Either way, people in higher elo dodge all the time anyway.\r\n\r\nIf 10 games is too much or little, then it can of course be adjusted. However, I think free dodges will help the community having better games, while also keeping in mind that they can use it for those incredibly bad circumstances where you&#039;re 99% certain you will lose. \r\n\r\nNow, the reason I want it to be as high as every 10 games or once a week (if you didn&#039;t play 10 games within a week, that is), is because people will not want to just dodge for the fun of it. Just like rerolls in ARAM, you want to save it for when you are picked a really horrible champion (in this case, if someone decides to troll or pick no tank or something like that). People will want to grind up those dodge tokens, so that when the time comes when they feel as if they have zero chance of winning, they can use them for free.\r\n\r\nNow, here&#039;s the kicker: I think that this will actually lead to less dodging overall. WHAAAT?\r\n\r\nYou see, to dodge with the new system, you will use up your dodge for free tokens before you get penalized. What does that mean? Well, it means if someone feels like a team comp is slightly inferior, but still think you can win, they won&#039;t wanna jeopardize their valuable tokens anyway, so they&#039;ll go with it. It will feel like you&#039;re losing more if you lose a token than if you just lose 3LP and 6 minutes of your time. After all, MMR is unaffected. Therefore, people will want to stick in games that are winnable more, and completely screwed up games where you can decide who wins before game even starts, can happen less and less in the community.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNow, lets discuss the glaring issues I can see the replies being right from the bat:\r\n\r\n&quot;But Spearlon, what about the fact that people will decide to troll pick just so they can get other people to use their tickets?&quot;\r\n\r\nWell, not that it doesn&#039;t happen already to get people to dodge, but with the tickets, tokens, whatever, being so valuable, I think in fact it will increase yes. Also, guilt shaming probably (you have a ticket, I don&#039;t have one, so you dodge). However, if you&#039;re paying attention in developer blogs, you&#039;ll know that those circumstances where people actually troll pick to get their way, are being worked on by Riot right now. Soon there will be a system in place that will protect us in Champion Select, and it will probably be released way, WAY ahead of this idea anyway.\r\n\r\nSometimes, you&#039;ll feel like taking a chance on a horrible game, so that maybe when another horrible game comes along, you can dodge that one instead. However, remember that you&#039;ll get one every 10 games. Now, how often does it happen that people actually troll pick like that? It will definitely happen a lot less after Riot&#039;s new champ select system is put in place. So dodge your horrible games now, and remember that if you have no tickets and encounter one of these games, it&#039;s just 3LP and 6 minutes for the first dodge anyway, and no MMR lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Korean Fizz","date":"2018-01-29T17:53:56.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean when I used to play, alot of the times I was in my promo's I would get people saying stuff like jungle or feed, they didn't get there role and locked in teemo or something troll and say something like 'ok enjoy loss.'

This pass would of course not make you lose your promo, hence why it would be much more valuable than 3LP and 6 minutes of your time, or even 10LP and 30 minutes. You could essentially go into a champ select during your promos and scope out your team comp and the enemy's for free basically. This would make people think about whether they want to dodge just any time, and it would result in less dodging overall.","replies":[]}]}]}
