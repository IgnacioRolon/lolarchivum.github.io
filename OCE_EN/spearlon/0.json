I thought it up with a friend one night when we were playing, and thought about how the chat was a tool that could be used for a lot of good, and a lot of bad. We also thought that maybe the chat was equally important to learning properly in solo queue as the gameplay itself.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to have Riot gather data from games based on two factors: What was said, and if the game was won or not. From this, they could compile a live feed that showed us random chat logs from both sides of the spectrum. One column would show us chat posts that came from a winning team, and the other would show us chat posts from a losing team. Now, these columns could be sorted into recent (chat logs from the most recent games gathered), most popular (basically how many times people repeat bad and good posts), and new (words never spoken before that may or may not have contributed to a loss or win).\r\n\r\nNow, I understand that this may seem a little daunting. In fact, even if they could make such a system, why would they spend their time and effort doing so? It seems like a fun side project at most, right?\r\n\r\nWell, in fact, I think it will, along with many other efforts, be more than worth their time. It will of course help those seeking out sentences that win games, and it will help enlighten what kind of slurs ruin games. It doesn&#039;t necessarily need to be a live feed either. They can create just a list of most popular chat posts every month that help win and lose games, and then update it. Like 20 posts from each side, blurring out clearly bad words in the process. Maybe would be a little less taxing work for their system.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t expect it to be made, and I don&#039;t expect support for this idea. However, just imagine, putting all the work it would take aside, how great it would be to actually see how chat impacted our decisions and our actual win rates in game, and how we could chat more like a winner, and less like a loser.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just my ramblings with a friend on a saturday evening. Have a good weekend.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-04T08:58:56.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd find that the \"popular\" things would be said on boths sides regardless, and without a lot of manipulation to not show true information (because let's face it, there is the possibility of this), you'd find that both are very similar.\n\nSomeone getting mad at someone in laning phase, doesn't actually change the likelihood of that game being won or loss, and can be said in both (a random mistake in laning phase doesn't mean the game is loss).\n\nThis actually applies for a lot of the generic things that get said (for every baron call that is said in chat, i bet there is a baron throw and a baron win).\n\nOnly very certain things would differ between teams, people saying things like \"afk\" and \"ff\" are more likely to be said by the losing team (though are also said on winning teams at times) nearly all the good spirit things are said on both the win and loss side (positive players don't tend to turn negative just because they are on the losing side, while negative players are generally negative on both sides).\n\nAnd the whole \"being negative losses you more games\" while technically true, is more tied to people who be negative AND directly try to lose the game more then the normal negativity actually losing you the game (trolls really do have reign over this game, because they aren't picked up for 100's/1000's of games).\n\nAnd you'll find that you are more likely to be negative in a game that is already lost (inb4 yes you can technically win any game, but that wouldn't change due to negativity, as it's based on enemy mistakes not on your teams morale.) which also inflate the rate of \"being more negative losses you more games\"\n\nIn theory, this is a good idea, but when you really get down to the fundamental issues, you'd find that toxicity isn't tied to wins and losses, and this would just show it unless it's deliberately manipulated.","replies":[{"poster":"Spearlon","date":"2018-02-04T12:30:54.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=4aT6TPB2,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-02-04T08:58:56.469+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;d find that the &quot;popular&quot; things would be said on boths sides regardless, and without a lot of manipulation to not show true information (because let&#x27;s face it, there is the possibility of this), you&#x27;d find that both are very similar.\n> \n> Someone getting mad at someone in laning phase, doesn&#x27;t actually change the likelihood of that game being won or loss, and can be said in both (a random mistake in laning phase doesn&#x27;t mean the game is loss).\n> \n> This actually applies for a lot of the generic things that get said (for every baron call that is said in chat, i bet there is a baron throw and a baron win).\n> \n> Only very certain things would differ between teams, people saying things like &quot;afk&quot; and &quot;ff&quot; are more likely to be said by the losing team (though are also said on winning teams at times) nearly all the good spirit things are said on both the win and loss side (positive players don&#x27;t tend to turn negative just because they are on the losing side, while negative players are generally negative on both sides).\n> \n> And the whole &quot;being negative losses you more games&quot; while technically true, is more tied to people who be negative AND directly try to lose the game more then the normal negativity actually losing you the game (trolls really do have reign over this game, because they aren&#x27;t picked up for 100&#x27;s/1000&#x27;s of games).\n> \n> And you&#x27;ll find that you are more likely to be negative in a game that is already lost (inb4 yes you can technically win any game, but that wouldn&#x27;t change due to negativity, as it&#x27;s based on enemy mistakes not on your teams morale.) which also inflate the rate of &quot;being more negative losses you more games&quot;\n> \n> In theory, this is a good idea, but when you really get down to the fundamental issues, you&#x27;d find that toxicity isn&#x27;t tied to wins and losses, and this would just show it unless it&#x27;s deliberately manipulated.\n\nUhm, I'm maybe 95% sure you are absolutely wrong, but hey, you're allowed to have your opinion. In my experience, toxicity has a clear corrolation with losing sprees. Toxicity comes from tilt, and ask anyone who knows anything about this game, and they'll tell you that tilt loses you games. It's on the height of warding, but in a negative way. If you played completely without wards, that's about the same experience as playing with a completely tilted team (twice as bad if their tilt leads to them not warding).\n\nI don't think I have to understate the importance of teamwork as a success factor in this game. You think teamwork just magically works despite a team being tilted out of their minds, throwing racial slurs and wishing cancer on moms etc.? Nah, that doesn't work. I have no idea where you get the idea that toxicity has nothing to do with win rates.\n\nHowever, some phrases are said on both winning and losing teams for sure. However, negative things are definitely said more on losing teams than winning ones, that's for sure. Just speaking from personal thousands of games of experience all the way since beta, and what others tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-04T12:50:53.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">toxicity has a clear corrolation with losing sprees.\n\nCorrelation =/= Causation.\n\nUnfortunately that's the main thing, just because they are related, doesn't mean that the Toxicity causes losses.\n\n>However, negative things are definitely said more on losing teams than winning ones\n\nWell yes, but that doesn't mean that their not said on winning teams a significant amount, more on Losing teams is simply because losing teams generally speaking spend more time losing then winning teams.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that winning teams can't have issues early game between members.","replies":[{"poster":"Spearlon","date":"2018-02-05T00:44:24.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=4aT6TPB2,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-02-04T12:50:53.301+0000)\n>\n> Correlation =/= Causation.\n> \n> Unfortunately that&#x27;s the main thing, just because they are related, doesn&#x27;t mean that the Toxicity causes losses.\n> \n> Well yes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that their not said on winning teams a significant amount, more on Losing teams is simply because losing teams generally speaking spend more time losing then winning teams.\n> \n> But that doesn&#x27;t mean that winning teams can&#x27;t have issues early game between members.\n\nI knew you would say that.
