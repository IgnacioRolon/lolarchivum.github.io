no it isn't, because you're just using normal abilities.\n\na wombo combo by definition as a 'combo' should be more effective as a collaborative effort, but MF's isn't, its just as powerful as it normally is.\n\nMalphite's ult makes yasuo's better because it allows him to hit all 5 people with it and keep them airborne for longer.\n\nMalphite's ult makes Ori's ult better because it doubles the airborne time as well as ensures she can hit all 5 people with it AND her W\n\nJarvan's Ult makes Fiddlesticks' more powerful because he cant chase all 5 people unless they are trapped inside J4's ult with him, and its not worth him ulting (and risking his own life) unless he can hit all 5 people (or at least a decent number) \n\n\nBut none of that teamwork applies to MF, sure if they are knocked up during it they might be inside it for 3 seconds instead of 2.5 seconds, but overall that doesn't change the damage an awful lot. you're still doing 3500+ damage to them at no risk of your own.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-05T19:57:13.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GTlhlkYP,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-05T05:08:08.656+0000)\n>\n> Stuff.\n\nI love how serious you take everything?
