I usually rotate through my abilities like so:\r\nQ - AA - AA - Q - AA - AA - W - AA - AA - W - AA - AA - E - AA - AA - E - AA - AA (and repeat)\r\nI&#039;m sure there is a much faster way to clear all camps (because by the time I do my E, my Q is back up or something like that). Can anyone type in the ability combo, with auto-attacks included? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-10-10T05:41:49.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x7 PLZ I FAN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-10-01T13:17:42.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-30T06:56:53.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play lee sin much and I'm unsure of the CD on his abilties but usually when im engaging in a camp I go Q - E - AA - AA - W - AA - AA - Q - AA - AA etc keep in mind I'm only bronze so don't expect expert tips or any strategies","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-30T03:38:17.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x5 PLZ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-26T06:55:50.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-25T11:37:37.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x3 No Lee Sin players out there?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-24T01:05:05.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump. x2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-23T09:18:53.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaconator","date":"2015-09-23T07:14:58.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try looking up a youtuber like foxdrop or  watching a stream/high elo game with a lee in it :)","replies":[]}]}
