I am very familiar with and love his kit. I wouldn&#039;t want it to change. Also, since Shaco is an off-meta pick (like Mordekaiser and Yorick), I wouldn&#039;t be one of the only few Shaco mains/players out there, since more people would play the champion if it was stronger.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else feel this way?\r\n\r\nDang this post sounded so much better in my head and then I tried to type and I think I failed a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-12T11:26:09.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a jungle main, i want shaco removed plz :D\nBut i know what u mean if my buddy {{champion:154}} was ever reworked i would be pretty sad.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-01-12T11:26:58.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qRx2EpOF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-12T11:26:09.632+0000)\n>\n> As a jungle main, i want shaco removed plz :D\n\nWhy?","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-12T12:58:14.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cos all he does is invade my jungle and i dont like it. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
