HELP!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am in high school and consistently achieve top grades and am at the top of ALL my classes (not intending to boast). I always complete all of my homework and am on a scholarship but am barely ever allowed to play LOL (rarely on weekends - only on holidays). My parents are convinced that &quot;video games will be my downfall&quot; and that I will fail school if I play. (My parents even tried disconnecting the internet and hiding my computer.) I love LOL and it is my favourite game, but I can&#039;t play it often and I would really like to. Do you have any advice on convincing my parents to let me play LOL? Any help would be appreciated.\r\nYes, I know I posted this on the NA forums (without realising) but I want more opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-08-11T04:32:19.101+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be brutally honest? Put your foot down and tell your parents exactly what you're going to do from now on, then do it. If you're excelling at everything, and they're being this unreasonable, there's no reason for you to put up with it. They take your Internet or computer, flat out pack a bag and go stay with a sympathetic friend for a week or so to prove the point that they don't control your life. Acting in your best interests is what a parent should do, that's not what they're doing as far as you describe.\nThere's a difference between being a good parent and \"When I want your opinion, I'll tell you what it is.\"","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-11T06:35:09.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-08-12T02:22:01.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except he HASN'T done nothing.

If you're restricted from playing the game then you shouldn't try to play it even more than you already do and risk getting (even more) addicted to it.

Trust me, speaking from experience. When I started getting into League, like REALLY getting into it (keeping up with LCS, keeping up with patch notes/meta, playing it all the time and watching videos/reading about it whenever I wasn't playing) I started to get really slack with my Uni studies and with my out of school Music activities. I used to write a song a month and play bars and pubs once a week, at LEAST for both activities, but League really fucked all that up for me, I went to writing, I don't know, a song a year? And I've been too lazy to even LOOK for gigs again, I got SO addicted to League. I've learned to ease down on now though, it's also helped that I've taken on a much busier schedule in life because that means I don't HAVE a choice, I HAVE to tone down on how much I play it. So it's not as bad any more.\n\nYour parents have a point, but, I don't think it's fair for them to take it away from you completely. Work something out with them, if they really intend on putting a pin on it, try and maybe work out a League schedule? A couple of hours a day? Or maybe you're only allowed to play on certain days? And bring up the fact that you'll continue to smash school and make sure to update them on all your achievements at school. Awards/Grades/Test results. Anything that constantly reminds them that you aren't neglecting your studies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-10T00:31:15.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, if your parents have told you what's right and what's wrong, listen to them!\nAlso if you have a good education, you'll get a good job and have all the time in the world to play this game, or any other game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-08-09T13:55:26.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My parents did this too.

When I was in school my stepdad hated me playing games at all.. Absolutely despised me and games.. But I ended up playing a lot of xbox with friends while my grades were terrible (I was a smart kid but cbf school) that my mother decided to take it from me and only give it to me on weekends.. My grades increased dramatically and my mother then became more lenient. In your situation I'd say bargain/compromise with them and see where the healthy median is. Say you will be disciplined with it and put school first. You will only play it for 2-3 hrs per day for example. To gamers that isn't alot. But to parents who don't understand: it seems like a very long time. Keep your cool and don't get angry or upset. Ultimately they are your parents. I feel you bro. Eventually at 17 I moved out and now I'm free to live how I want.\n\nThe people saying it will be your downfall are correct. But it is also correct that junkfood is bad for you, but we still eat it. To stay in optimal shape we should exercise everyday and eat absolutely the best foods in the pyramid etc etc. Everything is good in moderation. We need to drink water to survive. Too much water and we will drown.","replies":[]}]}
