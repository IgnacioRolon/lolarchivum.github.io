I don&#039;t know if this has already been discovered, and I&#039;m not 100% sure how to re-do it. If it&#039;s any help, the second time it crashed I rooted an enemy Kai&#039;sa. Not sure what is going on. I&#039;ll update with any details.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-09T11:27:51.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like it might be a bad patch or file interaction specific to your client.
