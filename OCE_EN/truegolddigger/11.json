I swear this happens every 3rd lobby.\r\nI call my role and some stupid inconsiderate person instalocks my role without even calling it. So I don&#039;t get to play the role that I call and am placed in some role that I suck at. This is absolutely silly because I have to dodge and I have to wait like 5 or 15 minutes when the troll can just continue trolling.\r\nI don&#039;t even know how to solve this problem.

I obviously sympathise, but in normals,  it's just considered courtesy.
