This player locked in Akali jungle, knowing I had called jungle. I wish there was some kind of report system in champion select so finally the problem of champion select trolls would be no more. Sorry if it sounds like I&#039;m whining, but I&#039;m just really sick of this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-27T10:51:13.408+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draft norms would be the go i reckon","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-01T08:13:26.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh hey there babe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-01T03:24:36.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be good if you could report them from within the champ select, as I think this definitely falls under unsportsmanlike. Not selecting a champ when this happens and letting the queue dodge is usually how I go about it. A 5 minute wait and high likelyhood of not having to queue with that player is much better than having to endure 20+ minutes of someone who acts like this.\n\nOne of my worst experiences with this was someone being incredibly facetious, saying that they had gotten top because the person who had originally called it said \".to\" so that didn't count.
