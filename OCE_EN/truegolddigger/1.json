Your MMR is based on your TOTAL winrate for the season, so even if you win 5 games in a row, if you've lost 10 before that, you will not be making good gains.\n\nThe goal of the system is the try and get you to a 50% winrate, your goal is to keep your winrate above that so you can climb ratings.\nYou have a 48% winrate this season, so you won't be getting much LP until you get above the 50% mark again.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=truegolddigger","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maldark","date":"2016-06-09T07:04:14.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can gain anywhere from about 8-32ish at a time. It doesn't matter how well you did individually it's only the win or the loss that matters. If you win more games in a row, or just have a consistently higher than 50% winrate the amount of LP you gain every match steadily goes up until you reach your correct MMR (Match Making Ranking).\n\nIf you're in the exact league you're supposed to be in for your skill level you'll gain and lose roughly 18LP at a time, if you're lower than you should be you'll gain more and lose less at a time and vice versa.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-06-09T06:10:38.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is only one factor that affects the amount of LP you get: the perceived difficulty of the match, which is based on the MMR difference between the two teams.
