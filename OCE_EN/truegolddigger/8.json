To have any luck climbing you basically need a winrate of >55%. Assuming Shaco is your best champion and even assuming you got him every game, with a 40% winrate you'd be going backwards for the simple reason you are losing more games than you are winning. If you look at the people who are still gaining mmr in the upper tiers they all for the most part have ranked winrates of at least 60%. Those who are doing well have ranked winrates of upwards of 65%, and those who are still a ways off their theoretically acccurate mmr will often have winrates of about 70%.\n\ntl;dr 40% winrate will take you down ranks not up.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-22T12:35:07.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in my defense.
