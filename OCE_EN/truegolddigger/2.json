I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n> \n> I'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n> \n> **Attitude**\n> When you are playing Ranked focus on your own gameplay, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n> \n> Always stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n> \n> **Gameplay**\n> You've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n> \n> Check out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n> \n> It will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n> \n> Hope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!\n\nNow on to some specific tips for you! It looks like you love to play Shaco, I'm no Shaco expert or challenger player but here are some things I would say about Shaco.\n\n1) He is an early game champion! Shaco has a 56% winrate in games that end by 25 minutes.\n2) Shaco is made for snowballing\n3) Shaco is a ADC, He is primarily an AD damage dealer (there are ways to play him AP top I believe but I'm no expert at that and it is extremely uncommon)\n\nSo one explanation for you feeling like you have to do extremely well to win is because, on Shaco you do. Not only do you have to snowball early on Shaco you have to understand how to leverage that early lead to take objectives and create picks to secure the win.\n\nOnce again not a Shaco expert but looking at pro builds it does look like they go for hyper aggressive summoners and build full AD to take advantage of their early snowballs. It looks like they get {{item:1400}}  or {{item:1412}} into {{item:3074}} , {{item:3142}} , {{item:3031}}  [http://probuilds.net/champions/details/Shaco]\n\nLooking at your history it looks like you favour {{item:3932}} , {{item:3146}} , {{item:3124}} and {{item:3153}}. While this on hit attack speed build is definitely viable and powerful for shaco specifically I feel it takes a tad too long to scale up.\n\nMy tips for you would be try out building Shaco full AD like the pros Warriors enchant and Hydra provide power earlier than Devourer and guinsoos. Not to mention AD especially Hydra gives you split push potential, which is something Shacos need.\n\nSo my main tip for you would be to try out the AD build and maybe find some pro VOD's of them playing Shaco and see how they move around the map.\n\nP.S.

A nice cheese to do is to take one buff and immediately run to the opposite buff and start boxing it. This only really works with red buff - if you get there before them, it's almost a guaranteed first blood. After that, you can run to their other buff and box that. If they die twice without getting any buffs, they'll tilt and probably lose.\n* The responsibility is on you to make the most of your gold. Shaco's early-mid game is very weak. Once he finishes Hydra he starts ramping up, but if you don't snowball that early gold ASAP, you'll be forced to farm. Don't fight while you're in your power trench, just focus on being useful as soon as possible.\n* You have to play Shaco as if he was Rengar - you're meant to kill people extremely fast and get away. You have some chasing power but more often than not, if you get ganged up on when chasing too far, you'll die.\n* You can use Hallucinate to dodge certain abilities if you time it right! It's really OP in 1v1s, so get used to using it as a 'block button'.\n\nA more general tip for assassin play is that at lower levels of play, people tend to tunnel really hard when they see a horde of creeps. I call it red dot syndrome, and it's one of the easiest ways to get free kills. Did you know that you can actually manipulate waves to let them push automatically? Just kill the ranged creeps when the waves clash, and more often than not your lane will push towards theirs slowly. When there are enough of your crees pushing towards their tower, I guarantee you a squishy AD carry or mid laner will come for the farm. That's when you jump them!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-30T13:37:42.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ap shaco top. its called pink ward shaco, it consists of morello, lich, zhonya, a magic pen item, gunblade and boots.\n\nShaco works best with blue smite, warrior, he should only build infinity edge for crit, and should always have rav hydra, the rest is just full ad items.

Once you get a lot better, you will climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-12-30T06:20:20.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XSirCution,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=cZXHPfrw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-30T06:16:46.702+0000)\n> u need to be a lot better then the elo you are in, to get out of whatever ur at. \nThat's a lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-12-30T06:40:40.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Truegolddigger,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=cZXHPfrw,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-30T06:20:20.866+0000)\n>\n> That's a lie.\n\nNah, seems legit to me. If you are a silver player you won't carry out of bronze right away, it will take a while. But if you are a lot better then you'll carry faster.\n\n1st game: Everyone was feeding. Maybe something to do with chasing? And nobody bought blue trinket, Support was a noob.\n\n2nd game: Looks like Lee Sin carried the game. Both supports are part of the 95% of OCE that can't support (no sweeper).\n\n3rd game: Guess who carried, guess who bought a blue trinket.\n\n4th game: Your team played better and you carried. Your team had more cc, usually wins in bronze games.\n\n5th game: You and Tryndamere carried. Madlife wannabe fed (probably was not so helpful to his lane partner, looking at the cs levels).\n\nLux is a great mid laner for this level, also Akali. If you can play Lee Sin well, stick to him in the jungle. Or just take Volibear :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2015-12-30T06:32:11.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah same. Ranked is just not fun.

ANYWAY, we can be pro players in disguise. Those who do have high ranks sometimes just want attention.","replies":[]}]}
