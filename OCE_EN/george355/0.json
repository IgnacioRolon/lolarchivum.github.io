Using IP just meant that there were too many different currencies to do basically the same thing, so it makes sense to \"combine\" them and just have the one currency to do all this stuff. Where Riot failed on the BE was the execution/implementation. Even with the BE from FWotD, BE gains are just too inconsistent game-to-game to actually provide any kind of significant feel of progression, and even on levelling many players still feel they're getting a raw deal. What Riot needs to do is bring back a \"BE per game\" scheme, perhaps make it so people get 1-2 BE for every minute they spend playing, that way there's a better feel for progression and the \"grinding\" of BE isn't as inconsistent as it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-03-26T01:54:45.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a player who had started to level up, it is going to be difficult for them to get new Rune Pages (unless if they use RP to get it).
