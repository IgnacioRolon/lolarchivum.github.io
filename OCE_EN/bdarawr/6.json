Do you do the same to them?\n\nI think there would defo be a way to do something about this if some thought went into it, and I defo agree with you, but it seems that this is not a high priority at the moment, sadly...","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-31T06:27:04.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people have been trying  to think of  way to do this kind of thing for ages. The problem is (and always will be) with any kind of loss prevented/ minimised LP loss is that it is way too easy to abuse. If you are losing game really hard, why not just flame and get a member of your team to quit? why not duo and take turns waiting out penalties? It also prevents the winning team from gaining full LP or recognition for the game that they played. \n\nRiot is working on this, as can clearly be seen by the amount of qq threads regarding the new leaver buster penalties.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-01T03:41:00.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"afking a game has no penalties to wait out. unless you mean the inevitable leaverbuster low priority queue and/or ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-01T03:40:35.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"oi anyone on 0 points go afk so we dont all lose points\"\n\ni expect that to happen every bad game....plz no.","replies":[]}]}
