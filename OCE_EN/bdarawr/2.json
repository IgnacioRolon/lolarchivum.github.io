This is anecdotal evidence, although I suppose yours is too. However, they have done things about this.\nLike low-priority queue.\nAll I have seen of you is you complaining about Riot being crap though, then swearing at someone. In addition, people are more likely to be toxic or leave if other people are being toxic. I haven't played with you, of course, but if you are encountering this thing a lot it may be a reflection on you as well.\nAnyway though, if you lose the occasional game because of an AFKer, that isn't going to have a large impact on your ranking anyway. You would have gotten demoted because a greater number of your games are losses.  Sucks if some of those losses are due to AFKers, but you can't just blame your fall on the ranks on the fact that some people AFK.\nI win 4v5s a lot though.\nDon't give up on them, and don't give me any lip like \"Can't carry a team as support doe\", because I have carried 4v5s as support Leona... and support Karma... although that second one makes more sense. It isn't a case of taking kills and trying to snowball, but doing your best to work with your team to get picks, close gold gaps, create a gold gap in your favour and other things. A 4v5 doesn't matter if your four people have the tactics and the gold to eliminate the enemies from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2014-12-31T04:51:21.679+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody needed you to show off about the fact you can \"carry\" as support because nobody cares. AFK and even DC's are very annoying and they can be the downfall of a rank. It might not be there fault if they DC but it is extremely frustrating and I can't emphasize how frustrating they are. Not to mention the AFK's who can't suck up that they are gonna have the allocated teammates that they will play with for 40-45 minutes or less and probably never play with them again. Also please explain how it is fair for people who have a major disadvantage of the loss of one player, to come to defeat and lose lp. I had someone afk because I didn't want him to gank me. Riot can also do things about afks and dc's not punishment wise cause that's been covered but LP wise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-23T16:34:04.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the term *carrying* relies heavily on some level of competence from the rest of your team.\nIn many cases, a lot of people *%%%%* around in ranked, throw the game - no matter how far ahead you may be, it's not something skill alone can accomplish when you consider the inconsistencies in the assumption made. I'll give you an example : You might be able to carry as a support leona, but that relies heavily on the assumption that your ADC knows how stick to enemies. What I'm trying to say is, there are a fair number of people who play ADC but don't stick to enemies (walk away) when they are literally in 0 danger. As a result, they let the team down and something goes wrong as a result.The same can be said for mid-laners or any of the other participants in your team - they need to be consistent in order for you to win the game. Having said that, I can understand OP's frustration, but I don't think it's reasonable to trash talk riot for not doing anything about it.\n\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2014-12-24T04:50:32.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I reckon Nobody should lose or win LP if there is an afk in a game.

I rarely play ranked, mainly due to people like you who always complain. I have had games where 2 of  my teammates have proceeded to afk because i was 'ksing' them even though we were winning hard (i can even name and shame them but no point) I had to apply some major DST to get them playing again by setting up kills and leaving them to get the kills. So dont tell me im someone who ruins ranked.\n\n2. i have never intentionally left a game without coming back that wasnt due to blackout or connection errors.\n\n3. Back to school, cause you are acting like a little kid. \n\n4. I bet you dont even know the difference between an AFK and someone whos not connected/disconnected due to connection issues. So before you start whinging like a baby about afk'ers ruining games, first understand that a majority of them that dont connect at the beginning of the game are having game issues not issues with babies like you who make them leave.\n\n5. obligatory gitgud","replies":[{"poster":"bdarawr","date":"2015-01-03T06:10:48.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no mate no.\n\nthe system should be design so that people if a report on an afk is made they shouldn't be able to rank\n\nWAIT OCE DOESNT HAVE A TRIBUNAL\n\nLOL is a great  MOBA but %%%% OCE really needs to get there %%%% together its 2014 right now kicking into 2015\n\nthe technological advancement isnt hard. its just people in australia %%%%ing lazy.\n\nthats why our tech etc etc etc. progression against other countries are like years behind.\n\nSO TO EVERYONE OUT THERE THAT IS RIOT IN OCE GET YOUR %%%%ING %%%% TOGETHER ITS NOT HARD ADDRESSING A MAJOR FLAW IN OCE SERVER\n\npeople DCing etc. doesnt count its the multiple times and reoccuring %%%% that causes many good games and gamers a loss for no reason that needs to be address.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-03T06:29:13.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=bdarawr,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jXKfyAEA,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2015-01-03T06:10:48.605+0000)\n>\n\n> \n> LOL is a great  MOBA but %%%% OCE really needs to get there %%%% together its 2014 right now kicking into 2015\n>\n\n>needs to get there %%%% \n\n>get there %%%% \n\n>there\n\nYeah im done here.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Generic Loli","date":"2014-12-24T10:54:37.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=bdarawr,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jXKfyAEA,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-23T06:40:18.358+0000)\n> people are losing alot cause you guys dont do %%%% about it especially the OCE server.\n\nDon't do %%%% about it?
