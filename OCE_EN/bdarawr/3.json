So they put you with retards and you usually fail and start to go downhill. \n\nMy suggestion to you is to play 5's ranked with mates or apply for team, it's much easier to get out of bronze, silver and gold and you won't be playing with retards.\n\nIf you prefer solo queue try doing these easy steps in a game\n1. Upgrade your trinket\n2. Ward (Buy pinks/have a pink on the map most of the game)\n3. Learn more champions\n4. Don't just play a champion because your good at her/him also play a champion to suit your team comp (in solo queue that might be a little hard)\n5. Communicate a lot","replies":[{"poster":"bdarawr","date":"2015-07-15T13:34:52.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good stuff iono i just think RIOT should really deal with either banning people or removing people of of rank cause its the quality of the game.\n\nplayin with good plays or having a FUN game is at a lower percentile than it would be with retards 80% retards 20% good \n\nit should be 50/50 so at least most times u can make it out of series","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-07-14T05:54:39.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like this\n6 play support if you end up with it you little bitch\n7 dont play just assassins. just fucking dont. especially if you want to fucking win, you will not playing just assassins, because all the other little 12 year old yolos playing garen adc and fizz riven duo top are just like you, why dont you carry your team by playing to the strengths of a better possible team comp as this guy mentioned","replies":[{"poster":"bdarawr","date":"2015-07-15T13:33:26.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play leona FYI :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
