You have provided no evidence that this Akali trolled. In fact, by their score it looks like they tried to win but was beaten that game, which happens. Are you saying that everyone who loses lane once in a while should be banned from the game? Okay then. I'm sure you need to be banned too, because even LCS players lose lane.","replies":[{"poster":"bdarawr","date":"2015-01-16T03:20:34.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"mate a 0/15 LOL are u mentally challenged and not 1 assist okay mate stfu and go learn how to play\n\nim assuming your %%%% %%%% kda is the reason why you cant see the logic. noobz","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-16T04:21:19.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=bdarawr,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AqbNFBYh,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-16T03:20:34.538+0000)\n>\n> mate a 0/15 LOL are u mentally challenged and not 1 assist okay mate stfu and go learn how to play\n> \n> im assuming your %%%% %%%% kda is the reason why you cant see the logic. noobz\n\nYou're so rude. I hope I am never matched with you. What 0/15/0? We are talking about an Akali with 11 deaths, some assists and some kills and okay farm.\nEven if I were mentally challenged, at least I understand what the conversation is about.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Archanjewl","date":"2015-01-07T06:21:25.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't do anything about that.","replies":[]}]}
