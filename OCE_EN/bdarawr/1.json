The automatic systems only trigger if you literally run it down mid non stop or if you go mobis with 5 zeals.\n\nIf people want to int and not get banned they can just pretend to be very bad at the game and die a lot of times but still buy the right items and kill minions etc. No system could tell the difference between this and a legitimately bad player. Even if we got tribunal I doubt Riot would want the people reviewing the cases to take action unless they were 100% sure it was inting.\n\nSo basically you can easily int in lol so long as you buy the right items kill minions/go for objectives and don't flame in chat.
