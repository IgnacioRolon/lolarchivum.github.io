Funny thing was, everybody was saying it yet im the only one who got the 14 day suspension lmao.\n\nHow unfair? \nLove how Riot says the URF is the reason why people stop playing League when it is  actually their autoban \"kys\" shit with SPECIFIC PLAYERS\nEveryone is so butthurt yet they do the same shit with others. \nIt wouldve been better if Riot bans both people who were toxic and not just one person","replies":[{"poster":"Cheddar6","date":"2018-11-09T01:16:28.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its actually a joke aye\nThe ban system is busted and needs some serious rework","replies":[{"poster":"Siøpao","date":"2018-11-09T23:33:54.650+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It actually is. I remembered playing ranked and i had a midlaner who was butthurt because i didnt give him support (to be fair, i dont play mid).\nThen i got judge for my small champion pool, telling me how much of a girl i am and how egirls are shit, basically, the %%%% was sexist asf.\nIt went for the whole fkn 40 mins, i have reported that person, not sure if other people reported him/her too but  since i dont really type \"oh report this person for blahblahblah\" in all chat, of course no one will know besides my team.\n\nThat person was never penalised for being an asshole, for harassing me all fucking game, making it a living hell.\nMute button? yeah cool! i know there is a mute button but lemme ask, why is there a report button when people dont get penalise for their shit?\nDoes Riot really need x9 reports just to penalise a player? Do they really need more than 1 or 2 people to report that toxic player? Just to fucking look at how toxic they are? What is that one person is in a trio or 4-man team? And you're there by yourself? Obviously theyre not gonna report their own friend. So what? you're stuck?\n\nYes, i am butthurt. I am butthurt because i get penalise for the littlest shit while people who make my games a living hell dont.\nAnd Riot, DO NOT ASK FOR FEEDBACK IF YOU DON'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MCAS MIR","date":"2018-11-08T18:34:49.316+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good god this community is a bunch of pussies, they need a “safe place” to play a game lol don’t join the military we don’t want you all, matter of fact don’t leave your house the entire world doesn’t want you period.
