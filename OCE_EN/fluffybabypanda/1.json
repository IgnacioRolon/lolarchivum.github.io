Not really sure if this is canon but it&#039;s just something I&#039;ve noticed, even if I myself get S Ranks I&#039;m not getting key fragments, not even after I&#039;ve gotten my four weekly chests. I think that if this really is the case it should be altered so that once you&#039;ve gotten your set amount of boxes per week, you start winning keys fragments in their stead. Only reason I&#039;m proposing this is so that you&#039;re not relying on your team doing well for you to be able to use they boxes you earned, (coz cmon, it sucks relying on others, and you&#039;re forced to do it) and so you don&#039;t have to buy the keys with RP,  just a thought,  and I&#039;m not even sure what I stated in the beginning is correct or not, just an observation.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-03-27T08:40:28.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">When asked about specifics on key fragment drop rates, **Wingfield** explained they key drop rates are not linear and the rates reset each month:\n\"Hey all, \nJust want to help clarify some things about key drop rates: \nKey drop rates are NOT linear and only wins have a chance of dropping a key. So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. \nThe goal is to create a nice ebb and flow. \nGrade does NOT impact key drop chance. \nPremades DO increase drop chance. \nHope that helps clarify \"\n\n[(source)](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/red-post-collection-hextech-crafting-on.html#6)","replies":[]}]}
