I think that this idea would be absolutely amazing as a skin concept. Having Draven dressed as a clown, throwing computer monitors as weapons is just too good an opportunity to pass up, especially considering that the person it would be based off is the man himself Tyler1, notoriously known as a a toxic player but more so known as THE Draven player, it&#039;s an amazing way to induct a new skin to the game, hilariously.
