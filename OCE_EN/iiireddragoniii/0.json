THIS is the reason they feel like I need to be PERMANENTLY REMOVED from their game and NEVER play again with this account. This is unacceptable. They say I'm in the 0.006% of players TOXIC ENOUGH to get this. (Not to mention that every 6th player has been permanently banned at least once) Now tell me honestly, is this toxic enough to get permanently banned? Do I deserve it? Generally speaking they have no reason for it. I got tilted because my bot lane was LITERALLY TROLLING me and making me tilted by spamming pings on me, letting me die and laughing at me in the end about it and CONTINUOUSLY calling me out for being a bad player. I'm not gonna stand that bs, I'm sick of your community, I am a human being and I have feelings and if I feel that those two players are not right in their claims or position, I'm going to stand up and fight against that and share my thoughts on it. And since people keep telling us that we have the right to speak since birth, we all believe that. BUT SUDDENLY RIOT comes in and tells me that I need to be removed from their game because I share my opinion. This is a serious problem with your game. Think about what reasons you remove good players from your community for but u leave bad ones in the end because 2 report 1 and he gets banned because he was reported MORE in the end. I understand that you are trying to remove as many toxic players from ur game as possible, but this is not the way. You need to change this because about 70% of the times you have NO ACTUAL REASON to permanently ban someone, meaning the suspicious player doesn't deserve it. I'm writing this with serious passion and I am dying to see Riot change this whole thing.\r\nPLEASE RIOT THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING\r\n\r\n#RiotsNeedToChangeThis","replies":[{"poster":"Steaming Ice","date":"2019-10-14T15:28:11.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's riot for you lol.

Also, this could of been the straw that broke the camels back. We can't say how or why the system chose you so it's hard to know all the factors that determined the decision. How-ever, I have noticed a few posts about very questionable decisions lately (as there always has been and probably always will be) but the point is, if there is an issue here, Riot would be hurting itself to ignore it. If enough light gets shed on the issue to make them think about it then maybe something will happen.\n\nWhat I will say though is I can see from you're post you didn't use the mute option in you're game. I can see you asked them to stop pinging you and tried to convince them to play smarter but I'm just saying in my opinion you could be more clearer. Riot may or may not have that in the system I'm not sure, but, if you could be more specific and mute or ask them to stop flaming,trolling ect might help. Might sound silly but in today's society you have to cover yourself very carefully with what you do and don't say. Trying to reason with them and being polite and or muting them could of helped. In the real world if you fight back like that you could land yourself in prison if the evidence stacks up against you the same way as it has here (which I am assuming is the case).","replies":[]},{"poster":"zkO","date":"2019-10-14T09:18:37.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> IIIRedDragonIII: shut up jesus\n> IIIRedDragonIII: JESUS CHRIST\n\n_**Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.**_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-14T07:22:16.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because thats consistent. *sarcasm intensifies*\n\nHad a convo with rito lately who said that \"venting frustration is normal\" so how all flaming is okay, but this isn't is beyond me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-14T10:00:08.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because there is a difference between \"that was so f$$$ing stupid that shouldn't have hit me/I shouldn't have died there/I can't believe that killed me\" and \"you're so f$$$ing stupid you should uninstall/we're going to lose and it's all [insert player]'s fault/get a brain\".\n\n(A general example in case that wasn't clear).\n\n\"Venting frustration\" (expressing a strong emotion of frustration) is not the same as flaming (To engage in an online argument usually involving unfounded personal attacks by one or more parties).\n\nVenting can be flaming, and flaming can be venting, but they aren't mutually inclusive.

But the real fact is you probably are toxic and have been for many games before this one, unfortunately this was the last drop in the bucket that tipped you over the edge.\n\nIf riot banned you for being toxic then it is justified and a well deserved ban!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-14T10:10:18.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you were perma-banned for this log, then it's likely you have already followed the natural escalation path. In which case the reason this is a permanent suspension isn't because this chat log alone is worth a permanent ban, but because you have been warned at least once (but usually 3 times) that such behaviour is not acceptable and chose to ignore that warning.\n\nYou will always receive at least one 14-day ban before receiving a permanent suspension, and the 14-day reform card explicitly states that *any* further violations (i.e even if they aren't as severe as what nets you the 14-day) will result in permanent suspension.\n\nI can also say that the system very much follows a \"two wrongs don't make a right\" policy. In other words, it doesn't matter who started it if you also exhibit rule-breaking behaviour. By no means does it excuse the negative behaviour of others, and you should always still report in post-game, but the mute feature exists to protect you.\n\nNobody is expected to be a saint, but there are also limits to how much leeway anyone can get, especially in an M (13+) rated game.\n\nAs for any specifics of your log, there are quite a few things in there that could trigger a punishment, and there's also a lot of context that we as other players just don't have access to. [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) can provide you more context if you so desire it, and if you truly feel this was unjustified you can appeal the punishment through them as well. \n\nThe system (and thus what it punishes on and doesn't) does also differ somewhat from region to region (to account for cultural differences), so something that triggers the system in NA or EU, may not for OCE (etc), so you may get some better context from the players and volunteers over on the EUNE boards.","replies":[]}]}
