I sent in a support ticket on the exact same day I got banned, however, after 7 days I have gotten a response from a rioter who stated they would transfer my account to a Player Behaviour team. I have yet to receive a response from them after about 5 days of waiting, therefore I am making a post on the boards in order to hopefully receive quicker feedback regarding my ban in League.\r\n\r\n(My Support Ticket that I sent in, describes my ban as well as my reasoning for as to why I believe it's unfair):\r\n\r\nDear Riot,\r\n\r\nI'm extremely sorry for writing this report as it is probably wasting your time, but please hear me out on this. So I recently just recovered from a temporary 14-day ban after being toxic in a ranked game to another fellow summoner. I made sure to change my ways since then, and I have improved my behaviour considerably, only talking in game when necessary. But aside from that, I recently got perma-banned over silly banter by me and my friends. I was in a normals game with 4 other friends and myself. We were all in a discord call and were having a bit of a banter, and I decided to mute myself and listen to some music. Now, since I am talking to people I know in real life, my friends, I was just being stupid and started spouting slurs/other things in chat to refer to them, I never took it outside our team chat. And while I was doing this, one of my friends suggested it would be pretty funny if they were to report me and I got banned after that game, and I laughed at this as well, just plain banter. After the game everyone just left the game and they said to one another jokingly \"Oh no I forgot to report Sairo ahahah, you do it Aero\". And he said in a fun banter manner \"AHahah yeah yeah sure I'll do it right now - Ok, ok, hate speech, inting, and afk\". And he actually reported me. Now, I thought he was joking and so did everyone else so we were all laughing about it, until I actually got the message that prompted me to log out of my account. Now, I'm not angry at my friend I'm sure he was just joking around, but took it a bit too far by actually doing it. I took an image just before I got banned because while I thought for the most part he was joking around I had a feeling in the back of my head saying \"What if he actually did report me?\", so I took a picture of the game ending screen as well as the discord call we were all in. The name of my friend who reported me was Aero.\r\n\r\nI know you guys aren't too willing to lift bans or punishments, but I feel as though this was genuinely a mishap, an unexpected conclusion that no one wanted, my friend reported me in good heart, I don't think he fully knew what he was doing. I really am begging to God that you can overrwrite this punishment, as I have devoted so much time and energy into this game - (current play time on my OCE account Sairozenkai is about 4500 hours), into my account. And I really did make an effort to change my ways as well, and to see it going over a banter with my friends is so unfair.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading, and I hope that I am not too much of an inconvenience.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Essentially, my account was permanently banned over a 5-man custom normals game. A game with me and 4 other friends of mine. I talked only in our team chat, I said two things in all chat which were: \"Hey do i like coconuts\" and \"you tell him draven\". My friend reported me as a joke - (he didn't know what he was doing and feels terrible for getting me banned now), and the system automatically detected some ethnic slurs I used and immediately banned me as a result..\r\n\r\nI do apologize sincerely for the toxic way I communicated to my friends in that game - but it's just how we talk. The argument still remains, that my \"toxicity\" did not harm anyone, nor did I offend anyone or insult them in any way. I was simply talking to my friends in our team chat, I didn't say virtually anything toxic to the people on the enemy team - people I didn't know.\r\n\r\nMy friends all feel really bad for me, especially Aero, the one who reported me, and says that they can vouch/provide any more evidence needed in hopes of lifting this ban.\r\n\r\nHopefully I'm not too much of an inconvenience for anyone, thank you so much for reading and please get back to me when you can.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nSairozenkai :(\r\n\r\nEDIT:: I've uploaded chat logs and images as evidence that I was indeed on a discord call with all my friends who were playing the league game with me, as well as an image of my friend apologising for reporting me.\r\n\r\n[Image 1:](https://p19.zdusercontent.com/attachment/43400/X5xpU5bdE4oUSck5sOSDxvH0f?token=eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiLCJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDLUhTMjU2In0..iM9PECoUrWdYRmPlN3iJRA.H3YOZCXkY_aIasA7K8d-mdqHR9kJOvG8cQs6zIL6h7lWY7nR3U7BUpxUC0UFLw7pz6jmfvKJ0ersNGNFRauEy1d9oB5YhkMYLoKygt1mPRYmJF09_urxOuDxstH2EVF0JnlrzYPTW8Uk_u5HuXQP6-VD83450hkKrvDtP4XmFHKNxZTW7h4tH5DcGHwQJRtPQXZouj_CQL52kDQGWEbc5gIFxZTGvMeGWPJy_YYMNWBGBGwvp-v6_-CwIhLEGHI48l-xbE8oeSTwatxVm9NSUHHTM0lN7m2RCVq6rSQSWjk.ODoxSfZ2C-5LT5vHVgKvGQ) The Discord call as well as post-game, you can confirm its authenticity as it was taken on June 14th and was the last game I played before my account got banned. I apologise for my mouse highlighting two of my friend's summoner names, the photo itself was rushed.\r\n\r\n[Image 2:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591216332515835914/591518443275288577/unknown.png) The people who were in the discord call as well as their summoner names, to prove that I was playing with my friends. My friend sent me an image of the game after I got banned, as I could no longer access my match history.\r\n\r\nSairo is me, Hazardous is pyke, Aero is Aer√∏, Poltergoose is Poltergoose and C H R I S is BIess. The other people in the call were just more friends, they weren't playing the game but we were just talking to them.\r\n\r\n[Image 3:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/591216332515835914/591519954424299541/unknown.png) My friend who reported me apologising sincerely. He did not mean to get me banned, and he was not offended by anything I typed in that game, he was just playing around but then the joke got out of hand.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-21T07:48:17.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few reasons the ticket could be taking this long.\n\n1. A high volume of tickets, though I've never heard of volume delaying responses more than a day or two.\n2. They are investigating your case/waiting on more info from someone. Since your ticket got escalated, it's possible it's been added to a queue of tickets needing more investigation. These naturally take more time than regular tickets.\n3. You are bumping (replying to the ticket). Doing so knocks you back to the bottom of the queue, so you should only do this if you really have to.\n4. Some combination of all the above.\n\nGiven it's been a week, if you haven't bumped the ticket I would do so *once*. Just reply with a \"hey, any updates?\" or something. If your ticket was marked for more investigation and escalated it's possible it's slipped through the cracks.\n\nIf you did bump the ticket, just be patient they'll get back to you.","replies":[]}]}
