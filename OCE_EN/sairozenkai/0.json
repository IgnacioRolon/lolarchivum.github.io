I&#039;m not aware if this is a bug or a pre-season thing, or whatever.  I&#039;ve had all 4 chests available for the past 2 weeks, and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve gotten an S/S- at least once throughout these past 2 weeks. I have no chests but I have 11 key shards, which I used to make 3 keys and 2 shards were left.. I find it quite silly that I have that many key shards but no actual chest. Just beforehand I got an S- on Zed Mid and I still got no hextech chest. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s a mastery thing because I do have mastery level 6 on him, so I am an experienced zed player. \r\n\r\nIs it true that after you get a hextech chest on a champion you can no longer get it on them? \r\n\r\nThanks for reading and replies of any kind are always acknowledged ! :)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-16T00:30:01.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nOnce you've earnt a chest from a champion you will no longer be able to earn a chest from that same champ until the end of the season.\n\nCheck out this quote from the [Hextech FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).\n\n>Once you earn a chest from achieving S rank on a champion, you won’t be able to earn another with that champion until the end of the season. You can see which champions you’ve earned chests with in your profile’s Champions tab. This chest cap resets each season.","replies":[{"poster":"Sairozenkai","date":"2016-10-16T01:50:51.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh I see! \n\nThanks for replying, that really explains everything.","replies":[]}]}]}
