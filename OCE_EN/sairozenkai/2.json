But recently I&#039;ve gotten aware of the radiation emitted by computers, personally I&#039;m using a laptop, and lets get straight to the point; resting your hands on your keyboard during a game of league, (specifically on  laptop, as you need to press QWER), could possibly expose you to higher amounts of radiation that&#039;s underneath the keyboard? I&#039;m talking about laptops by the way, for desktops I&#039;m not too sure. But with laptops the electromagnetic fields are directly underneath, therefore is it a bad idea to basically rest my hands on the keyboard for the length of a LoL game? Which is usually around 20-60 minutes - ( a pretty long amount of time). As a somewhat daily player of League, I&#039;m worried that the game is continually exposing me to low amounts of radiation, plus the heat from underneath the keyboard, which in-turn might affect me in some sort of way? Or am I getting too paranoid about this? If someone else responds I&#039;ll give sources to where my, erm, &quot;paranoia&quot; - (more like curiosity I suppose), blooms. \r\n\r\nTL;DR; Will resting my hands on my **laptop** for a prolonged amount of time affect me in any way?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-26T04:06:27.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a good concern, and it always pays to think about these things \n\nBut basically:\n\nNo one truly knows. \nPersonal computers and mobile devices haven't been around long enough for a proper scientific survey, our generation is the first generation that has been exposed to computers/internet/mobile phones from a young age, so we are the test subjects. and no one will be able to prove anything (good or bad) until our generation has ended (either by natural causes, or because we all became sterile and died riddled with cancers at age 40.)\n\nBut, as of yet, no one has found any convincing evidence that mobiles/computers are dangerous. (And when reading things like you have, you have to use some common sense), if it was a well established scientific fact that laptops gave you children with 6 arms, then there would probably be more of a media-kerfuffle about it, and it would probably be front page news in every paper in the country. But because its not, and its on some website next to an advert that says \"This housewife looks 30 years younger because of one simple trick.\" You have to take it with a grain of salt.\n\n_______\n\nThe internet is a great tool, but unfortunately it gives EVERYONE a voice, (Even the wanna-be-know-it-alls like me, who really shouldn't have a voice!) So it gives the scientists a voice, but it also gives the other 7.4 billion people a voice too. and on the internet, its near-impossible to find out what information is well-researched, and what is the angry ramblings of some cancer patent who happened to use a laptop. \n\nIn reality, all the chemicals in lollies and sweet drinks probably have a far bigger chance of giving you cancer than your laptop (but even that hasn't been proven, because yet again we are the test generation.) \n\nThis is the crux of it all:\nNo one has any conclusive evidence to say that it doesn't give you cancer, BUT no one has any evidence that it does either. And frankly you will likely never know because you are the test generation. (If we all die, they will know its bad, if we all live, they still wont know.)\n\nSo the way I see it is: You can either:\n\n1. Spend the rest of your life trying to avoid all electronic devises, stop playing fun games like league, throw away your cellphone and your Apple watch etc. \n2. Just live your life, accept that the unknown is unknowable and that there is no point worrying about things you cannot change.\n\nAnd in this day and age, its near impossible to avoid technology, just walking up/down the main street in your city will put you in the path of literally thousands and thousands of text/call/bluetooth/wifi signals going thorough your body at all times. If you spend your whole life worrying obsessively about that, your life will be miserable. \n\n_________\n\nBut if you want comfort, take this experiment:\n\nIf you put your phone in a waterproof bag and drop it in a bucket of water, then ring it, it WILL ring. The signal penetrates through the water. But add 1 spoon of salt to the water, and ring it again, the phone will NOT ring. The signal no longer penetrates the water.\n\nThe human body contains a far higher percentage of salt and other minerals than that bucket of water. \n\n_________\n\nI'm sorry I cant give you a Yes or No answer, and thats because the answer to your question doesn't yet exist. (I really want to know the answer as well.)\n\nBut even if it did, and the answer was \"Yes it gives you cancer\". Would anything change?\nOur society is so heavily based upon computers and mobile technology, the world as we know it would literally fall apart if we got rid of it all. \n\nWe found out 100% that smoking gives you cancer. Did that stop people smoking? \nNope.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2016-12-27T11:26:51.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was just about to say you need a TLDR but I decided to read.

Ionising radiation is what is harmful because of the way it alters DNA. At worst it straight up destroys cells and at best it causes cancer.\n\nLaptops emit non-ionising radiation and only in tiny amounts so there is no danger. Microwaves are the most notable examples of non-ionising radiation, and emit vastly larger quantities of radiation than a laptop, but still pose no health risk (at least in terms of radiation, sticking your hand in a microwave would still cook it).\n\nThe only danger laptops pose is heat. Some laptops can obviously get hot enough to burn you, and if you're pregnant the heat they emit can be a problem, but I have significant doubts that you are a. pregnant or b. silly enough to keep a laptop on your lap while it's burning you.\n\ntl;dr No.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-26T10:44:29.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hg6ZV7J0,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-12-26T06:55:39.078+0000)\n> **The only danger laptops pose is heat.** Some laptops can obviously get hot enough to burn you, and if you&#x27;re pregnant the heat they emit can be a problem, but I have significant doubts that you are a. pregnant or b. silly enough to keep a laptop on your lap while it&#x27;s burning you.\n\nThis pretty much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-26T10:23:06.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're vastly more likely to die from cancers born from sun radiation than from the radiation of your computer. And if you're keeping a good job from getting skin cancers, there are also the other usual suspects such as bowl cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and rectal cancer and bladder cancer etc all born from either genetic or other chemical/substance causes rather than radiation from electronic devices.\n\nLet's also not mention the other diseases and sickness that could potentially be fatal, again the usuals, such as heart disease, stroke, HIV, diabetes, allergy trigger, asthma trigger, serious tumours (such as in the brain), organ failures of whatever causes, dehydration etc. We could also widen the scope and mention the psychological sickness that could lead to fatal scenarios such as depression and eating-disorders. Again, all of these have very little if not just none to do with radiation.\n\nLet's also talk about the other common cases of dying besides sickness and cancers. Traffic deaths probably accounts for the highest injury and death cause with everything and all factors considered if I'm not wrong, then there's accident death, and domestic-level murder and manslaughter cases and all that.\n\nAll of these instances and countless ones that I don't even get to, have VASTLY higher chances of doing you in than eventually getting cancer from being exposed electronic devices which might not even happen even if you've lived 1000 years. I am not sure if you're thinking too much along the lines of nuclear fallout and the mutation it causes to nearby species when it doesn't just kill them outright, and other causes of sickness could be born from being in association with them such as consuming fallout-radiated food and getting cancers from it; but get this, the radiation your computer emits is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in comparison to such settings.\n\n**Chill bro. Nothing wrong with trying to keep yourself healthy and safe as a general idea, but computers really shouldn't be one of the things you should be watching out for.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-26T10:01:22.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's electro-magnetic radiation, and over exposure will do something, but its not super dangerous\n\nYou have a higher chance of getting arthritis than you do radiation poisoning if thats what you're worried about lol\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-26T07:34:01.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your definitely getting paranoid over nothing, listen to what your saying, having your hands on the keys of a computer exposes you to radiation?
