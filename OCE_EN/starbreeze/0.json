The people who win should get their wins but i can&#039;t guarantee it and the people who lose will get loss prevented.... probably. Ghost games are usually caused with server problems and with ranked being taken down in the past 2 hours, there have been troubles. Only solution is to wait it out i guess unless a miracle happens. Also try to like stop playing because you&#039;ll probs have problems in the champion select screen. Good day to you all.","replies":[]}
