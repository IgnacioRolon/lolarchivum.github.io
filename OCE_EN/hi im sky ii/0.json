In short, it is banned, regularly and with great predjudice.\n\nBoosting is also banned. First offence is a 2-week ban and loss of all current and previous ranked rewards, second is perma.\n\nSmurfing is not against any rules. It can be harmful yes, but matchmaking is designed to mitigate that as much as possible. To be clear, smurfing is not the same as someone deliberately dropping their rank to stomp new or weaker players. Smurfing is simply playing on a second account.\n\nSmurfs of a significantly higher rank almost immediately (within 3 games) have their MMR boosted up way high to match their apparent skill. It won't be a perfect match for a few more games, but a Diamond smurf is *not* going to be consistently vsing legitimately low ranked players.\n\nThere are two key things here. First, someone who is deliberately reducing their rank to stomp noobs is not a smurf, they are an asshole and should be reported for griefing.\n\nSecond, the lower the rank the more polarising the games, so a player doing well in a particular game, will generally do very well, and the reverse is also true.\n\n Just because you were beaten badly, does not mean that player was a smurf. Just because they say they are a smurf, does not mean they are a smurf. Even if they are a smurf, that doesn't mean they are a high-ranked one.\n\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/246430954/201524503?tab=overview\n\nYou did very well in this game, compared to your team-mates relatively mediocre score, were you smurfing?","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-07-01T10:52:26.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=MGYb0THk,comment-id=000100000000000000030000,timestamp=2019-06-30T10:45:56.669+0000)\n>\nSmurfing is simply playing on a second account.\n> \n\nthat's not quite true. that would be an alt account. smurf is literally a term used for intentionally playing in lower ranks on another account. although admittedly the term is being used too liberally now that the 2 get confused.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-01T11:23:59.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After actually looking it up, you are in fact correct.

But at what point does it become too much to bear? Perhaps in cases where a reward of value is involve, the act of smurfing can be seen as an exploitation.\n\nI don't know the context behind your outrage, but if you are referencing solo Q. The incentive for them to do so, is driven by emotional enthusiasm, short and not long term. The chances of you encountering enough of these players to 'gate keep' you from reaching silver is REALLY, REALLY LOW.\n\nYou see, the different between a booster and a smurf is separated by a thin line. The big factor lie in the fact the booster aim is to reach a certain rank. While the smurf is merely playing a few games to get his dopamine kick going.\n\nBanning or even attempting to ban these players on the charge of corrupting the ranking is tricky business. How often are they playing?, are they breaking any rules? such as boosting, and importantly how can the system know for sure this player is a smurf?, someone level a new account to play rank, is that a bannable offense? \n\nThings are not so simple as it is for you to say, ban, and that is that. Lots of proof checking are needed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi Im Sky II","date":"2019-07-01T04:00:10.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=CatLikeADougie\nis he smurfing?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-01T10:36:40.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You yourself have a 60% win-rate over your last 20 games.\n\nLess than 20 games of data is not much at all, and there is nothing there to confirm they are a smurf.
