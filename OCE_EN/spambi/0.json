The only things I can think of that *might* make sense is if the perma-ban is a result of 3rd party software (which is generally done in waves, rather than as soon as possible like everything else), or a security ban resulting from the account being compromised.\n\nEither way, your best bet at finding out more about the ban is to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option). You *might* be able to find out more by referring to the reform card (in-client pop-up), or the email that should have been sent to the registered email address regarding the ban. Support should be able to tell you why the account received the perma-ban, and if it shouldn't have happened then they should be able to revert it. Once you know why you received the ban, you will be able to appeal (you could just continue responding to the same ticket in that case) or, in the case of compromise, you will need to go through the account recovery process (submit a *new* ticket under the category \"Recover my account\", you will need to be logged out).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-05T03:17:51.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the punishments were for two different offences (e.g 14 day for hate speech, but during that time a cheating ban wave went out) then both punishments will stand because they are both valid.\n\nHowever it is also possible (though doesn't happen very often since it's not easy to do) to be double punished. Basically this happens when a game resulting in a punishment is played, but before the punishment is issued the player has made it into another game, which also results in a punishment. The system then sees that (in this case) a 14 day has been issued, so it issues a permanent.\n\nWhile technically in these cases both punishments are valid, Riot don't usually let this occur if you appeal it (though they can in very extreme circumstances like death threats), since you've missed out on a warning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"spambi","date":"2019-01-04T21:44:23.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the help","replies":[]}]}]}
