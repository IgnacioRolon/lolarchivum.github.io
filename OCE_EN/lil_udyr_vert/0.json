I have been through this situation before and it has to be a grind festival to get your win ratio up again to gain those points. Thought in season 5 I have not gotten a lost of 30 LP yet but I have heard from my friends that they gain 30 LP which is crazy and I would like that too.\n\nFor gaining less LP however, I only know from experience that I have been elo clamped before and that's the thought of the game saying \"you beling into this elo and you are going to maintain yourself in there or not\" this was when I was in gold division 1 and points were a bit low for me.\n\nYou can do it though, you just started playing ranked during March so its fine friend ^_^.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-04-07T18:34:32.268+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well it's unfair for D5 players since the addition of Master Tier somehow makes everyone receive +10/-30 regardless of their MMR 8)","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-04-08T04:23:36.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"False.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-07T05:37:22.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your MMR is bad, so you lose more LP when you lose then you gain when you win, the MMR system and LP system are fine, you just need to start winning more then you lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-07T06:35:35.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that just means your mmr is way, way, _way_ below your rank.
