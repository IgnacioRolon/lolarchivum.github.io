If the icon still doesn't show up after that, I'd suggest you send in a support ticket.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2015-07-10T14:56:39.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!\nBut its ok now :) Turns out it happens every time the client patches.
