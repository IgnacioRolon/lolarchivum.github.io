It's not hard to build MR so that their turrets deal less damage.

He is actually pretty easy to counter IF and that's a big if, your team is also playing an AP champ. Morgana is even better cause of the spell shield. The reason is this nifty little item that everyone forgets about called Banner of Command which makes the empowered minion immune to magic damage in addition to some extra resistances (plus some tasty AP/MR/CDR/Health/Health Regen, it's actually a really underrated item even in norms against AP heavy teams). So you dump it on a cannon in each lane then drop the other two somewhere in those waves (probs where you aren't) and the poor little Heimers (who are never gonna go AD) have to sit there basic attacking an almost super minion to death.\n\nOf course that only works if you're an AP team, so if you know you're gonna be AP you can leave him open, otherwise guess it's gonna cost you a ban.\n\nBut I agree they should at the very least give 5 bans for featured gamemodes.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-22T13:40:13.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20 if use ult turrets","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-22T09:38:13.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main reason karthus is permabanned is becasue every 200/180/160 seconds someone gets a pentakill.","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-10-22T10:42:41.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VhZXIAET,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-10-22T09:38:13.877+0000)\n>\n> I think the main reason karthus is permabanned is becasue every 200/180/160 seconds someone gets a pentakill.\n\nZhonya and Banshee prevents that from happening","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-10-22T10:46:52.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spacing them out enough causes it to still happen.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-22T09:54:00.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the ults would do so much damage that if they all ulted the last 2 would be wasted and only 3 will be dealing damage (if they all were smart with their builds and had roughly 1000 AP) my record for AP on Karthus would have to be 1300 (with both Mejai's and Rabadon)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-22T10:37:51.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimerdinger is a great lane holder but he can't push and once he reaches like lvl 18 he is not as strong as other champions.
