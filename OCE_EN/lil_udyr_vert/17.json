For example,my friend went 17/3 as shaco but lost the other day and he told me that he only got like 103 points (hes a lvl 4 shaco atm). I experienced this aswell, getting dramatically less points if you lose. Dont you think this a bit unfair? How are mastery points generated? Is it also based on CS, largest multi kills,damage dealt etc?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-17T08:26:16.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off the main way it's generated is win or lose.\n\nPeople who win will get around 1k+, people who lose will get 150-250.\n\nIt is then made from the collective of your teams score for mastery (all of which scale off of individual stats.)\n\nWhen you hover over to see your grade you can also see your personal contribution to said score.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legal Lemon","date":"2015-11-17T06:43:18.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes","replies":[]}]}
