Pay particular attention to updating your graphics drivers and directx.\n\nIf you continue to have problems after going through the steps there, the next best thing would be to lodge a support ticket, and they will be able to help you dig into the root cause of the issue.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
