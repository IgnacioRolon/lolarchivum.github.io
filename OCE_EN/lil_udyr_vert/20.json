I think low priority queue should be placed somewhere else in the client, and it gives me the option to talk to friends that want to play but ill say no because ill explain that i was dumb enough to rage quit games. I should be able to shop,stalk peoples match histories,spectate etc...I think it should also immediatley put you on &quot;Away&quot; when youre in the queue so people dont text me and i cant text back,that is really annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T07:38:29.216+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's a punishment, end of story.\n\nIn no way should it be convenient for those being punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-30T08:15:34.750+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"But is the purpose of punishment not to encourage reform? I'm hardly saying take the punishment away, but making players in that queue MORE frustrated with the game is going to help you how exactly? The threat of punishment exists for a reason, but negative reinforcement prompts rebellion more often than reform. \n\nIts a 20 minute queue..that's not exactly convenient, that's the point. But by locking out the client and not putting you on away or In Queue it just adds frustration for no discernible gain. What are they gaining by locking out the client? You can't talk to your friends? Is talking to friends not one of the best ways to relieve frustration and encourage good behaviour??? Why would you lock them out of systems that would encourage positive behaviour? Especially when doing so encourage negative emotion.\n\nThe punishment for afking is having to wait. Why should it be anything more? Just because they afk doesn't mean they are toxic. I hate afkers just as much as the next person, but I'd take an afk over a toxic any day, and if they're trying to reform, why are we inhibiting them? \n\nOr is your argument that anyone that has ever been put in low priority queue is the scum of the earth and we shouldn't associate with them?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2015-12-01T06:58:11.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what youre saying is....\"You CAN NOT talk to your friends!

Or at the very least should mark you as In Queue. Or how about it doesn't put you straight into queue after the 20 minutes, so if you do afk you don't have to wait all over again cause you missed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2015-11-30T06:18:56.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"**\"Or how about it doesn't put you straight into queue after the 20 minutes, so if you do afk you don't have to wait all over again cause you missed it.\"**\nyesssss i forgot to mention that","replies":[]}]}]}
