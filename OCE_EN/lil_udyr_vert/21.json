Riot's plan (as per the \"[End-of-Season Information](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010365913)\" support page) is to have them all out by the 12th of December, so you may just be among the last players to actually receive them. I'd say you probably just want to keep an eye on it for the time being, and if you haven't received your rewards by the 12-13th of December, you can submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"2018 Season Ranked and Honor rewards\" option) and address the issue with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-25T08:45:36.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to tack on, this is assuming you were Honour 2 at season end.
