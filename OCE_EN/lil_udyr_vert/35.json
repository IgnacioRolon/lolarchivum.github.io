What are the max pages we&#039;re allowed to have and how come we cant delete the presets so that we can freely edit the pages in our loadouts etc...this is really frustrating atm because I can only add on 2 extra ones atm and i dont know what to do","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-11-14T04:54:01.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's similar to the old rune pages. You get 2 rune pages for free, but if you want more you have to unlock them with RP or Blue Essence.","replies":[]}]}
