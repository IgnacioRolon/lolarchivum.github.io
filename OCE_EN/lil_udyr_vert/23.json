Of course I enjoy the team aspect and I'll always respect the fact that there are players who are serious and want you to perform well so they can win. However, there are the other type, who enjoy playing a finely made game as a form of relaxation and joy. A loss can be fun, breaking the Meta and inadvertently feeding can be fun and no matter how hard some practice, there should never be big expectations for MLG plays to be made daily.\n\nJust remember, if people get mad at you when you are trying your best, it is them who are failing. Perhaps not at the technicalities of the game, but at being a good spirited teammate. We all know that flames are part of a fire. So flinging sh*t or blaming someone elses ability is in fact much more of a detriment to the League experience as a whole. If this culture was lifted, the Oce community would flourish. In turn, more and more \"bad\" players would be encouraged and taught, rather than shunned and abused.\n\n\n\nAnd.......      *Competitive","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-10T06:30:43.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"No it isn't, this is how all competitive games work, people who play for their rank want to win games and it gets frustrating when a player simply doesn't give a fuck and ruins your game, if you don't give a fuck then stay away from competitive games, nothing wrong with someone getting mad at another person as long as you don't rage and start being abusive and whatnot it is completely fine to be mad at someone and start criticizing, for example if i fucked up and someone calls me out on it and says \"you really fucked us up there\" i'm not gonna turn around and rage at the person, i'm going to accept i fucked up cause i know it was my fault, if you wanna be a baby and cry at every little thing someone says then you need to get off the internet.\n\nNo they aren't, what if i want to play just to troll people? Think about that for a minute, you want to relax? Play a game mode where no one cares if you lose or not, that's called normals, ranked is for those that want to win not for those that don't give a shit, a loss in ranked is not fun, period, what the hell are you smoking? If the person is having fun feeding then he should and will be reported for intentionally feeding, you think feeding is fun but your four team mates don't, that's the stupidest thing to say, you obviously care about yourself and not others, there should always be expectations for someone to play good depending on your ranking.\n\nIf people get mad at you then you mute them, they aren't failing at all they are frustrated that you're ruining the game for them but them raging at you is a different story, they can be mad all they want as long as they don't show it in game its fine, no it isn't a detriment to the league experience at all, if you for instance keep pushing and not warding then dying over and over again it is your fault and your team has every right to blame you, you know what you can do when someone tells you you're fucking up by not warding and pushing? You listen to them, you acknowledge that you have fucked up and you listen to them, you stop pushing and you start buying wards, don't be a cry baby whenever someone tells you you're doing something wrong, if you're fucking up you will be corrected and if you refuse to listen and continue to fuck up then it is your fault, theres a difference between \"shunned and abused\" and criticized, if you cant take criticism then quite frankly you need to grow up.\n\nLike i care about spelling.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-11T03:24:34.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're clearly a rather wound up lad who likes to say F**k a lot.\n\n\"if you cant take criticism then quite frankly you need to grow up.\"\n-If you check the OP, it's not criticism that was his problem.

Mute the fucker.\n\nNo we won't because your mentality is only going to get you suspended/banned, you would rather cry about things than take it like a grown up, your mentality of not being able to take criticism is also going to keep you in bronze V for life.\n\nEnjoy being a little kid.","replies":[{"poster":"HurricaneX31","date":"2017-10-27T17:17:52.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realise people skilldhaming constantly gives them a shit mentality.
