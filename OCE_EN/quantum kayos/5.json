For once its also not freezing my computer! the old client took forever and froze my computer, now I can patch it in the background and do other things :) thank you Riot :D \nActually even just downloading and patching and all that is working heaps better than the old client for me. 0 problems for once. <3 \n\n[Some Stuff regarding Post Game Screen and Chat] \nI haven&#039;t noticed anything substantially wrong with the client but theres a few things here and there. Basically whenever I finish a game, the Client stays open and when the game finishes the client wont load the end screen it&#039;ll just be the same and says im still in game, i have to wait a few minutes for it to load. Not sure if this is just my computer or other people are experiencing it as well. \n\n I find it weird that new messages dont go to the top of your inbox, I end up thinking a message someone sent me was old or an old one was new. \n\nThat&#039;s all I have to report I guess. \n[Back to Alpha Client I go!] {{summoner:6}}","replies":[]}
