Riot please ban it, its ruining so many of your players rank games, im pretty sure countless of people should have reported it by now and its still going into matches. look into it, ban it and pay attention to any mass reports during rank if there are any other bots like this.\n {{summoner:11}}  smite down on that bot please.

If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n\nEven with bots, there's nothing that can be done about them here, so best to report them in post game and/or a support ticket. The name you linked was pretty cut and dry, but they can be way more ambiguous, which is why the rule is what it is. Player side we just don't have all the info.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nBot bans can take a little longer because they are done in waves rather than individually, but obviously a bot making it into ranked is no bueno, however it happens to get there.
