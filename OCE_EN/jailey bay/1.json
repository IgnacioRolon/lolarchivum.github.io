Looking at all the items and minions, they are all very cool unique ideas that I would love to play with. \r\n\r\nPersonally I would love for this mode to come back, and riot wouldn&#039;t need to do that much updating, as the icons are on par with the modern icons. The only thing I think they could/would need to update would be to make summoner&#039;s rift look more pirate-y, similar to Butcher&#039;s Bridge (which I would also like them to bring back in a Bligewater event, but that is for another post :P )\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to hear other people&#039;s thoughts on the matter :)\r\n\r\nYarhar Fiddle DeeDee!!{{champion:41}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2017-12-06T23:37:50.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is only fun if you have friends :*(","replies":[{"poster":"Jailey Bay","date":"2017-12-07T00:57:52.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But!
