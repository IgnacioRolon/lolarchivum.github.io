As long as you have a damage dealer backing you up, you can stay alive infinitely in a team fight. With 12% missing HP healing, what&#039;s not to love? \r\n\r\nWell, considering this rune is intended to give squishies a bit more survivability in fights, it doesn&#039;t really make sense to have %missingHP as the scaling in my opinion.\r\n\r\nHow to fix this you ask? Simple, give it a small flat amount that increases per level (at a guess, about 25-40 would be balanced at level 1) plus scaling based on AP/AD, and make it so this is halved for assists. Makes sense right? Carries and mages get great benefit from it late game because it has scaling for their primary stat, and rewards getting the kill, but it stops tanks from being able to take it and be unkillable just by being in the fight. \r\n\r\nSeen as the average ADC has about 1900ish base HP at level 18, to make triumph proportionate to the 12% missing HP (my math is going to be terrible here, but just rough calculations) you could have 150 base healing at level 18 (seen as 12% of 1900 is 228) and give it about 25-35% AD scalling, seen as a late game carry has about 350-400 AD (assuming they have attack speed items of some sort, and they aren&#039;t{{champion:202}} ) thus giving them an extra 87.5HP (if 25%) or 122.5HP (if 35%). This would give them 237.5-272.5 HP return on a kill, or half that on an assist. Gives them more late game than currently, but less early. \r\n\r\nAs with mages, well, approximate mage AP varies greatly, depending on whether or not they have a Rabadon&#039;s, it could be anywhere from 500 ish to over \r\n1000{{champion:45}} . However, if a mage only has about 500 AP late game, they more than likely have a decent amount of HP from items like Liandry&#039;s or Rylai&#039;s, thus meaning they have more survivability in fights anyway. Because of this, I&#039;m going to try balance it off the higher end of the scale, going with 850AP for the calculations. Base @18 (150) plus 10% scaling (85) = 235Hp (pretty close to the adc amount, what a fluke!) or Base @18 (150) plus 15% (127.5) = 277.5HP\r\n\r\nApprox healing late game:\r\nADC: 237.5 to 272.5HP on kill (half for assist)\r\nMAGE: 235 to 277.5HP on kill (half for assist)\r\nTANKS: Barely anything :)\r\n\r\nThis is just my idea, would love feedback, also, don&#039;t forget to upvote if you agree so RIOT see this :)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, have a good day \r\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jailey Bay","date":"2018-01-26T22:41:44.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: Realised I didn't take into account base AD for scaling, so might need to lower the base healing amounts at early levels :)","replies":[]}]}
