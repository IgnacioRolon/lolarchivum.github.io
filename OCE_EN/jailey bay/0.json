He has infinite gap closers, making it literally impossible to get away from him.  He has permanent dodge, making it impossible to kill him as an AA based champion. He permanently has his ult up giving him bonus resistances all the time, so he can just build full AP and one shot everyone. \n\nEvery single game I have seen of URF with Jax in he has hard carried, gone something like 30/4 and is impossible to deal with. {{champion:24}} {{item:3146}} ","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-12-21T08:24:53.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Syndra beats him, her E cooldown is shorter than his jump, so overall she can get away other than that shen can just block his autos forever, he doesn't need to be banned since he has counters, you just need to rely on the RNG gods to get what you need","replies":[{"poster":"Jailey Bay","date":"2017-12-21T08:40:33.100+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is two champs however, when he hard counters about 50% of the champs","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gelatic","date":"2017-12-22T10:44:01.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what the chances of getting syndra compared to jax {{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akali Is Broken","date":"2017-12-22T01:03:05.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree played vs 5 just today in the span of 2 hours all had 30+ kills and that was minimum one even reached the score 52/3  4 items in 23 minutes unbeatable literally made me wanna kill myself","replies":[]}]}
