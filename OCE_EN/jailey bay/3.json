For some reason we are always matched with someone that has just hit level 30 on our team and their highest is mastery 2 on someone, and then the enemy have a gold, and the rest are silver. Why is this happening, can you please fix the bloody matchmaking riot! Because the randoms on our team are always new, they just keep inting and don&#039;t listen to the advice we tell them to try help them not die as much. \r\nJUST WHY RIOT!? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-05T16:23:07.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend,\n                  As you state above, you are bronze 2. \nYou can blame this on being \"too lazy\" to play ranked but that's a poor excuse to be lowly ranked. A good player will get placed above bronze, high silver-gold. \n\nYou, yourself are bronze 2 - why are you trying to give advice to someone? You clearly haven't learnt the fundamentals of the game if you're below the skill level of the average player. \n\nI suggest you focus on yourself, if you're vsing gold players, GOOD watch what they do, learn from them. Become better yourself, forget about what ranks you're vsing and what ranks you have on your team.\nI suggest you stop looking up games you're in to see peoples ranks etc. It isn't helpful at your elo. If anything it's disadvantageous - it psychs you out to play extremely safe vs good players even if the lane matchup is strongly in your favour. Focus on becoming better yourself & learning the game.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-05T16:23:32.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and I almost forgot\n\n\nYou're welcome :)\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jailey Bay","date":"2017-09-12T08:27:23.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason I am B2 is that I was placed bronze last season when I hadn't played a lot of league and then riot made it so you are 100% going to be placed lower than your previous ranking so ya know...\n\nAlso, it isn't the golds I have an issue with, I usually beat them personally, it is the low level accounts on my team that annoy me because they just feed the enemy and I can't exactly carry as a support main.\n\nFinally, just so you know mate, the average league play is bronze. Over 40% of the league player base is bronze, so learn your facts before you spit nonsense ","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-12T14:12:01.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you'll find you're wrong lol majority of players are actually silver 5 alone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
