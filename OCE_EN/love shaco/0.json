I don't think riot will be anymore philanthropic than that and I can't blame them; also 500 games over a season wouldn't be very difficult and 500 games over a week would be close to impossible.\n\nYour idea sounds cool as a user but from a gamemakers perspective it's not viable as unlike the hextech system which encourages you to play new champions and try to master them to achieve S's, this system would kinda just be passively granting players rp and eventually people wouldn't pay it much mind as they'd just passively get rp, a bit like first win of the day to anyone who's already bought most of the champions. Also hextech is already pretty awesome and easy to farm so I don't mind that rp is kinda hard to obtain.","replies":[]}]}
