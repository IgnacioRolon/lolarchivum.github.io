However as the chat is taking place the assortment of bubbles is fairly unpredictable. They will often occur above where you are chatting.\r\n\r\nCan confirm that switching windows, closing the app or entering menus (such as settings) will not force the update. Have only found the correct chronology after re-logging in to the app.","replies":[]}
