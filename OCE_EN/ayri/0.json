In time, lore, numbers and the rest will be added.\n\n**Passive: Strengthened Ties**\nWystia's abilities *tie* her enemies to her through wispy threads that allow her to make the most out of her abilities. Enemies who are threaded to Wystia have their magical resistance reduced, scaling depending on the amount of threads linked to her target.\nThreaded enemies can sever the ties with Wystia by killing her or moving out of range, \n\n**Q: Heart String Pull **\nWystia throws out a narrow thread skillshot, marking the first target hit and connecting them to Wystia \nOn the second cast, Wystia may move the enemy she is connected to, a short distance in the direction she chooses, slightly knocking away and damaging all enemies that collide with the threaded target. Enemies who are flung into terrain are also stunned for 1 second. \n\nWystia may also cast this ability directly upon terrain, creating a tether that upon second cast she is able to fly towards. \n\n**W: Weaver's Wheel **\nAfter a delay, Wystia creates a field of threads at a target location. All enemies inside the radius are damaged and are attached to Wystia through a thread.\n\n**E: Tainted Hands**\nPassive: Wystia gains increased cooldown reduction\nActive: Wystia empowers her next basic attack, dealing magic damage and attaching a thread to her target. If the target has 3 or more threads attached to Wystia, she gains a brief burst of speed. \n\n**R: Severed Soul**\nAfter a brief delay, Wystia tightens all the  threads attached to her enemies, damaging and stunning them for a duration depending on the amount of threads marked on each target. This ability also severs all threads attached to Wystia's enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2014-11-28T01:19:18.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like a kit that would be anti fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Ayri","date":"2014-11-28T22:41:20.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which aspect do you find anti-fun? Looking back, I agree that the invisibility of the threads would lack counter play, maybe if made visible it would be better. As players who know they have been attached to Wystia by too many threads, will be able to understand this and make decisions in order to break them (moving away).\n\nEdit: Just made changes, thanks for the feedback!","replies":[]}]}]}
