Minimum rank requirement will be GOLD, no exceptions&hellip;  All team members must have discord and a working mike.  My plan is to allow team members to play their best champions and we will assess our win conditions based on the team we create (i.e. no forcing you to play cheese champs/comps, however we will do our best to create comps with clear win conditions).\r\n\r\nA little about me.  I picked up LOL at the end of season 4.  I am a jungle main with a large champion pool, I am currently ranked G3 (highest rank this season was G1).  Prior to LOL I was into WOW PvP achieving gladiator in 2 seasons of Arena&rsquo;s and I was active in ranked BG&rsquo;s.  I have always loved MOBA&rsquo;s and I am looking to improve my LOL experience with some co-ordinated and competitive 5v5.  I attempted to find a 5v5 to join but had little interest so I have decided that I will organise and run a team myself.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you would be interested in please add me in game and message me with your preferred roll/rolls and your 3 best champions for said roll (if you are a 1 trick, that&#039;s fine just tell me your main champ and that you are a 1 trick).\r\n\r\nP.S I am 34 and I would prefer mature team members.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nOoba.\r\n\r\nMy current champion pool:\r\n{{champion:28}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:141}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:107}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:5}}","replies":[{"poster":"Thendoren","date":"2018-02-21T13:24:52.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey can you message me on discord to talk about this?
