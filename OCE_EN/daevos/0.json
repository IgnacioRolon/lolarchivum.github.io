Especially when certain tilting behaviour occurs ingame. I would like to share this story with y&#039;all.\nI play Annie mid, Graves plays jungle. He pings he will gank, when Xin (enemy jungler) is coming mid. Obviously I help him, he takes both kills. All good so far. But after taking both kills, he also shoves in lane by taking about 10-15 CS. As he has strong waveclear, I couldn&#039;t even get 1 CS out of it. I pinged him and also told him not to do it again (obviously?! it still makes me mad when I think of it). He then farms the other part of his jungle, then shoves in my lane (10 CS) again. It drove me crazy. I was then already so far behind in CS on enemy Fizz, it wasn&#039;t even fun anymore. As I was mad in chat, the team starting being mad with me (saying I&#039;m toxic etc). And because graves took like 20-30 CS, and over time even more like 60-70 CS in my lane, he got very strong. I ended up being 2 levels down on Fizz, Graves was 4 levels ahead of Xin. He could carry easily, but the game wasn&#039;t fun at all for me. I don&#039;t just play to win, I also want a fun game. When jungler puts me behind like that, and I become really mad, I don&#039;t see how that is my fault really. I helped him early on with double kill on Xin and Fizz. There was no need for him to keep farming my lane. In the end my team reported me for being 'toxic' (mad with graves) while being useless (dealing lowest damage). Which was both result of Graves behaviour.\n\nLet me know your thoughts please. I posted this in support, because I need support & advice on how to deal with such games.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Slim","date":"2018-05-11T01:14:38.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't do well with keeping a lid on my frustration so I can't really offer advice but I totally understand when you're coming from. I would only be happy with jungle taking lane farm if either A: he was behind (which in your case he wasn't) B: laning phase is over or C: he's saving a wave crashing on your tower if you've recalled. Sounds like none of those instances were the case so I don't blame you for being annoyed. Sadly the world has become very soft and pc so if you speak out in frustration you run the risk of getting banned. I got banned for saying kys %%%got after someone  literally spelt out go kill yourself. So be careful. Hope you do end up getting some good advice!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-11T10:27:33.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you think that literally encouraging someone to commit suicide and calling them a homophobic slur is ok? That's some pretty hardcore shit, especially in a _13+ rated_ game.\n\nIf they said shit like that too, they'll be punished as well it's that simple.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Slim","date":"2018-05-12T22:29:53.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I don't think it's ok, it was just a heat of the moment reply to being told to kill myself.

H and S is more for technical type problems that have a set solution, where Player Behaviour is discussion based. Mostly though, H and S doesn't appear on the front page so not many people will see posts made there.\n\nAt any rate, noone expects you to be perfect, or to be positive 100% of the time. As you say, that isn't gonna happen. Everyone gets frustrated, and everyone has bad games. Ultimately it comes down to how you deal with it. \n\nA toxic game once in a blue moon, isn't going to see you any punishment unless it involves severe behaviours like racism or suicide encouragement (I'm sure the reason is obvious). This is precisely because Riot (just like everyone else) knows that nobody is perfect. It sounds like you weren't punished, just berated in chat for being toxic, so I'll leave it at that for punishments.\n\nI can only speculate on your chat since you didn't include any examples, but throwing insults around helps noone. If the Graves had a reason for doing what he did, then attacking him for it is only going to make him spiteful, hurting both his and your gameplay with distraction and frustration. A better approach would be to tell him why you don't like it, ask him not to take your CS like that (politely), and then get on with the game. \n\nIf he ignores you or is taking the CS just because, then throwing negativity at him is just going to fuel the fire and make him more inclined to come and take your CS, hurting only your gameplay and experience. I guarantee at that point he doesn't care if he loses he just wants a reaction and/or to make his score look better at the expense of others.\n\nThat's not to say you won't get frustrated, but find a different outlet. If possible, yell at your screen instead of typing. It distracts you less, does a lot more to relieve the frustration, and doesn't affect the rest of your teammates (and you) as negatively. You could aggressively mash the mute button to make yourself feel better, or just step back, take a breath, and focus on what you *can* do, rather than a player you can't change.\n\nThere will always be assholes, and I thoroughly encourage you to report them with detailed comments where they affect you in game, but ultimately on the internet they only affect you as much as you let them. If you know you're going to lose a game because someone is being a complete boosted bonobo or taking your shit, yelling at them isn't going to change that, in fact it erases any hope you might have had of carrying them. Better to simply ignore them and focus on what *you* can do. \n\nIf you can stop yourself from caring about a random strangers actions/opinions, you'll be much better off for it. Don't let the occasional bad experience stick with you too much, focus instead on the good ones. In the end, what that one Graves in that one game did is meaningless. Even if you lost LP for it, in the grand scheme of things it's a non factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Daevos","date":"2018-05-11T23:56:03.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your comment. Yeah usually I am supportive on my team. The things that do make me mad are when other players are intentionally making my game worse (afk, intentional feeding, troll champion, steal CS). I get your point that being toxic in chat won't help anything. I assume I just start doing that because I feel so helpless and powerless to do anything against it. There is no button to report players for taking a troll champion or stealing CS. Even though this really makes games worse. I'll just keep trying to stay cool. However, I feel like Riot won't punish players for stealing CS. I can understand from the POV of another player or moderator, stealing CS may seem minor. But it has big impact on laning.","replies":[]}]}]}
