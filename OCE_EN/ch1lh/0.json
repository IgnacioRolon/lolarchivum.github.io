I came from csgo where you dont get banned for what you say, so this is kind or weird that i can get a perma ban for the slightest of talking back. The only time i rly talk is to ask for a ward in the pixel bush, strats  and i yes like others flame. However i dont cross the line of being racist or anything like that, i do swear alot, talk back and argue. However if someone starts blaming me the jg for losing \"their\" lane because they fed 3 times and i die when i come to gank them after they rudely spam, Im supposed to just ignore that? i have reported ppl for being racist, homophobic etc and nothing gets done about those players. But because i respond to trolls and feeders i get banned?\r\n\r\nYes there are things i have said i regret, most of these things the other person has said and i just repeat them back. unfortunately the account in question i have alot of skins and would like it unbanned if possible. I feel that this perma ban is unjust as i was responding to trolls, people flaming me and int-ers.\r\nlost the first game and carried the second game.\r\n\r\nI dont understand why a perma ban is appropriate nothing i said was extreme other then joking i was going to inting (which i never have done actively at all in any form), telling people to \"get cancer\" and hang yourself which is common place on the internet. The retard and vegetable crap, Im literally retarded myself? i have a severe audio processing disorder, visually dyslexic and physically handicapped. \r\n\r\nTldr: unjust ban because the people i flamed were inting, flaming, trolling, stealing buffs and giving up on the games. Am i able to have my case reviewed, could i have my account unbanned? and what happens to the people who were inting on purpose and soft throwing because they \"lost their lane\". \r\n\r\nhere are the logs \r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nCh1lH: or u could hav e stunned him\r\nCh1lH: walking in a straight line\r\nCh1lH: ahahaha\r\nCh1lH: i lost you your lane???\r\nCh1lH: you just suck ass\r\nCh1lH: see what\r\nCh1lH: riven was fed\r\nCh1lH: lmao\r\nCh1lH: you %%%%s are bad and blame me for your shit skill\r\nCh1lH: fukcing had to auto her\r\nCh1lH: lmao\r\nCh1lH: stfu\r\nCh1lH: you %%%%s are trash\r\nCh1lH: im behind as fuck because of gan king mid and top and i need to farm\r\nCh1lH: enjoy the loss\r\nCh1lH: im not trying anymore\r\nCh1lH: fucking sit mid and let the jayce get drag lmao\r\nCh1lH: rofl\r\nCh1lH: you are so clueless\r\nCh1lH: and you call me bad\r\nCh1lH: no you werent\r\nCh1lH: you sat mid and got minnions\r\nCh1lH: and let the jayce get drag for free\r\nCh1lH: wdym\r\nCh1lH: lmao\r\nCh1lH: its more over the fact top and mid are shit and i tried to hlpe them\r\nCh1lH: lmao\r\nCh1lH: shhh\r\nCh1lH: child\r\nCh1lH: goto bed\r\nCh1lH: omfg\r\nCh1lH: morg\r\nCh1lH: shut up\r\nCh1lH: you cant hit a stun for shit so be quiet\r\nCh1lH: you literally do nothing\r\nCh1lH: 1 in the whole game\r\nCh1lH: you must be so happy\r\nCh1lH: %%%%\r\nCh1lH: ill int now\r\nCh1lH: you crap\r\nCh1lH: yeah cause she cant hit her skill shots for shit\r\nCh1lH: sftu morg your useless\r\nCh1lH: 2/3 dont sqeak\r\nCh1lH: dEaD mAn dOnT sPeAk\r\nCh1lH: stfu you little kid\r\nCh1lH: you're about as smart as the shit that spews from your mouth\r\nCh1lH: she is fucking dumb\r\nCh1lH: probs does know what peeling is\r\nCh1lH: ahha\r\nCh1lH: doesnt know how to\r\nCh1lH: %%%% did you know\r\nCh1lH: that your are my favourite vegetable\r\nPost-Game\r\nCh1lH: report morg\r\nCh1lH: was a troll\r\nCh1lH: and about 2 y/o\r\nCh1lH: ahahahahaha\r\nCh1lH: ahahahahahahahaha\r\nCh1lH: ahahahahaha\r\nCh1lH: 13 y/o\r\nCh1lH: literally snap his neck\r\nCh1lH: so are you?\r\nCh1lH: think your better\r\nCh1lH: thats why his hard stuck\r\nCh1lH: ^\r\nCh1lH: ^\r\nCh1lH: ^\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nCh1lH: please ward pixel bush\\\r\nCh1lH: next time bot please stop shaco\r\nCh1lH: bl\r\nCh1lH: didnt even attack you\r\nCh1lH: and the tower shot me\r\nCh1lH: fukcing dumb\r\nCh1lH: shaco doing hisblue\r\nCh1lH: fast as fuck boiiii\r\nCh1lH: herald top for gold\r\nCh1lH: bait her in\r\nCh1lH: ok\r\nCh1lH: i blame poppy\r\nCh1lH: because im 7/1 .....\r\nCh1lH: and you should have tanked\r\nCh1lH: ?????\r\nCh1lH: but why are you all there\r\nCh1lH: oh sona is trolling thats why lol\r\nCh1lH: sona stop inting the annie\r\nCh1lH: fuck this cc\r\nCh1lH: afkter BotrK\r\nCh1lH: dontfight\r\nCh1lH: this fucking sona lacks a brasin\r\nCh1lH: the only reason you're still in this game is cause sona inted 6 times\r\nCh1lH: no rly\r\nCh1lH: retarded bitch\r\nCh1lH: hang youself\r\nCh1lH: mother fucking dip siht\r\nCh1lH: im just goingto int\r\nCh1lH: ffs\r\nPost-Game\r\nCh1lH: vayne i hope you contract terminal cancer stage 4\r\nCh1lH: dont have kids\r\nCh1lH: they wont survive\r\nCh1lH: its a wonder how you get out of bed wihtout a caretaker\r\n and","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-17T05:53:52.881+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could dive into this pretty deep, but I'll keep it simple. There are 3 main points here.\n\n1. To receive a permanent suspension for chat, you have to have received at least one 14-day ban (and often 1-2 chat restrictions as well). In the reform card for that 14-day ban, it explicitly states that any further violations will result in permanent suspension of the account.\n\n2. Yes, what you said really was that bad. The last 10 lines of your log exemplify that, however, to be clear the whole log was bad. Regardless of whether you personally class literally telling someone to kill themselves as that bad, your previous punishments would have made clear that chat like this is not acceptable in *this* community. In order to play this game, you agree to abide by those rules. Failure to do so unsurprisingly results in removal from the community.\n\n3. All other subjective matters aside, suicide encouragement (along with hate speech and some other things) are classed as no tolerance language. Using such language will result in escalation to 14-day ban (skipping chat restrictions), and if the account in question has already received a 14-day ban, permanent suspension.\n\nI don't know what things are like in CS:GO, because I only played it briefly, but in what world is literally telling someone to kill themselves, telling another to get stage 4 cancer and that they shouldn't have kids because they won't survive \"not that bad\"?\n\nThis is not trash talk, this is not \"responding to someone feeding\" or defending yourself from flame. This is straight up beyond abuse and 1000% not allowed here.","replies":[]}]}
