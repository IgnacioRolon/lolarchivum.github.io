This season i got placed into b2, and it's just looking terrible. Like it's going to be near impossible to carry myself out again. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for anyone who's keen to get out of bronze. As long as you are really trying and aiming to get better. Preferably someone who actually knows how high elo/lcs players play, and are aiming to replicate that. \r\n\r\nI come from a competitive gaming background, and this game definitely has the most troll kids, making it difficult to climb from bronze. \r\n\r\nSo if you're sick of feeders, trolls, and just really noob team mates who think they're challenger in this bronze hell, then add me, and we'll duo out of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2015-03-05T13:36:13.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude omg and i thought only i am struggling i came unto b2 from B5 2 times and back to b5 it is so annoying so i quit playing rank games for so long but i am back to rank games i have added u, lets go when ever ur free","replies":[]},{"poster":"SleazzyJefff","date":"2015-03-04T11:58:09.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro, you two are too legit!
