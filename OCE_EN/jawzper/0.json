I loved the new Soraka when it was released. It was a bit different but still had massive healing potential. I quickly discovered that building health was extremely inefficient, as it simply causes your heal to cost more, while your health recovery from starfall remains unchanged. Warmog&#039;s, perhaps might make up for the additional health loss with % max health regen, but it&#039;s an extremely expensive item for a support and doesn&#039;t provide anything for your allies. The way to do it, I figured, was to stack one metric shit ton of health regen items, along with some other defensive and support stats and a bit of AP. \r\n\r\nThis worked perfectly fine, and for a while Soraka was fairly balanced, albeit a bit difficult to play due to having to carefully manage your health pool.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I stopped playing for a while due to some uni work piling up, and came back after regen items had been overhauled to scale of base health regen. Okay, I thought. That could work. But it turns out that Soraka literally has the lowest base health regen in the game, alongside Gnar. \r\n\r\nTalisman of Ascension was previously my first item to pump out; I needed the regen stats as quickly as possible to have a real impact in lane without having to rely entirely on my Q (which is extremely risky). If I remember right, Talisman used to provide +15 Health regen and mana regen/5. As it is now, it doesn&#039;t give Soraka that much mana regen until level 16, and the health regen doesn&#039;t even come close, maxing out at +11 hp/5 at level 18. This is woefully inadequate. \r\n\r\nMy only options now are to sacrifice other stats from runes in favor of more HP/5/level (by the way - does this count as &quot;base regen&quot;? I don&#039;t think it does), sacrifice more gold and items for more HP/5, or simply not play Soraka. Unfortunately, the latter option seems to be the most practical, which is extremely unfortunate. After Soraka was in such a good place and finally worth playing again, this has happened, and now she&#039;s worthless again.\r\n\r\nSo: does Riot have any plans to make adjustments to alleviate the damage the regen changes have done to Soraka, after all the hard work they did to make her useful again?","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-01T01:57:32.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy spirit visage = problem solved","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-03-31T21:04:04.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play her better","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-31T07:02:05.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could just hit more Q's.","replies":[{"poster":"Jawzper","date":"2015-03-31T10:16:36.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah yeah...
