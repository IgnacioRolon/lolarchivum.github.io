The LP loss is to prevent people from thinking it's ok to afk for a little while as long as you win the game, because it still ruins the experience for the others. It sucks when it happens for reasons beyond your control, but if you were hit with a LB as well then this isn't the first time it's happened.\n\nIf you're having consistent issues, maybe it would be best to avoid ranked until you can get them sorted out to save your LP, and if it's not consistent then you'll make that LP back lickety split.","replies":[]}]}
