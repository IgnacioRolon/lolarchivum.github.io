Whenever an enemy is hit by a slow from Faeria&#039;s Q or E, they are marked by mystic shackles, whenever they reach 85% slow, they are stunned for 1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds. Whenever a target is affected by Mystic Shackles, they can be affected by stacking slows. Also, whenever an enemy champion is affected by a slow from one of Faeria&#039;s abilties, her cooldowns are reduced by 1 second.\n\nFaeria&#039;s Q is &quot;Mystic Beam&quot;. Faeria fires out a beam of energy that damages and slows the first 2 targets hit. The slow increases with level and at level 16 hits 45%, which is enough for Faeria to proc the stun of her passive alone (if she hits the outer edge of her E).\n\nFaeria&#039;s W is &quot;Flash Space Shield&quot;. Faeria places a beacon over an ally that is clearly visible to both enemies and allies. While under the effect of this beacon the target becomes immune to slows and can use their flash for free within the next 5 seconds. If the target&#039;s flash was off cooldown or was able to be used within 10 seconds, flash goes on a 10 second cooldown if used by the target.\nCooldown - 45/40/35/30/25\n\nFaeria&#039;s E is &quot;Spaceshift Field&quot;. Faeria teleports to a target location after a short delay. During that delay an indicator shows up where she is teleporting to. After the delay she teleports to that spot and damages and slows everyone by 20% in the field upon arival. People hit by the outer edge are slowed 20% more. \nCooldown - 15/13/11/9/7\n\nFaeria&#039;s Ult is &quot;Space-Tear Portal&quot;. Faeria can open a portal similar to Bard, that is 2 way and can be used to reach the opposite side of the map to the same place you placed it on your side symmetrically. Forr example if you open a portal through the wall of your Blue Buff, it will open in the same place at the enemies Blue Buff. Everyone can hear and see the portal being made and will have a ping on their map appear when it does. It has a very lengthy cooldown however will be lowered by half a second everytime someone is affected by Mystic Shackles.\n\nThis ability is fantastic for map control or coming back from a bad game. It can be used to gank top lane from bottom lane by simply using it into a wall.\nThis abilty can not be used to warp into an area not already controlled by your team. Meaning unless you have the towers (or used to control) the towers next to an area you&#039;re teleporting to, you cannot use it.\n\nFaeria is a support that is incredibly reliant on her team, but when used with her team can carry a game with her utility. She has no shields, heals or explicit buffs, but can use her utility to change the tide of a fight in the right hands.\n\nLore &amp; Personality: Faeria was once a dizty and care free woman living in an Ionian village until it was raided by Noxus troops. Fleeing the disaster she ran off into the local forrest that she had always been told to never enter, as the wild magic was dangerous for humans. She ran and ran through the forrest, the leaves around her slowly glistening more and the trees becoming more crooked and warped. As she ran she stopped looking where she was going, simply because the nature around her was too facinating and beautiful to ignore. She ran untill she reach some sort of shrine, with an entrance carved of ancient stone. She wandered in, twirling as she walked just to take in all the beauty. Reaching a set of stairs she began to climb and looked over the edge to see a black abyss beneath her. She reached the top and saw a raised platform with a swirling golden pool in it, wanting to take a better look she bent over to see better... and tripped. Her screams echoed in the chamber as the golden pooled drew her in. She saw things her mind couldn&#039;t even comprehend, paths between the spaces in the world. Holes, the river of time, the velvet of space... And suddenly she was drawn back to herself and the basin of the golden pool, the swirling liquid now completely gone. \nShe understood the world better now, and how to manipulate space for her own goals. She ran straight at the wall at the far end of the shrine hoping to open a portal to her village. Which she did... a few metres to the left of where she was aiming. Dusting herself off and shaking her still throbbing head, she walked through the portal to a village in ruins... Houses burning, people lying dead and defiled on the floor, and blood splattering her once beautiful village. She took time to bury the dead and say her goodbyes before setting out, revenge in her heart and ditermination in her soul.\nFaeria has the same sort of powers as Ezreal but with a greater focus on teleportation. Sometimes Faeria will trip in her walk animation or do something ditzy and will teleport in place to keep from falling over. (Simply animation, no affect on player.)","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-12T23:07:35.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her w is broken.

Allowing a free flash and slow immunity is literally all she does tho. Like thresh can give someone a dash from much further away than a flash with his W. So can Ivern. It's not like this is something that hasn't been done before, it's just being done in a different way. There aren't any abilities from what I can remember that interacts with a targets summoner spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-14T02:50:42.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would require slows to function differently for a single champion. Its a cool idea but unlikely to happen. \n\nThresh's lantern can be blocked, flash is a powerful summon and allowing people to use it for free is unbelievably strong. This champion essentially changes the cool down on flash from 500 seconds to 40","replies":[{"poster":"Aristotally","date":"2017-10-17T22:29:56.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornn has a similar concept with his W extending CC, allowing him to interact with CC in a different way. It wouldn't be difficult to code, just difficult to balance. Also fair point, that may make her W really op but that's only on 1 champion at a time. Yes thresh lantern can be blocked as counter play (though I'm pretty sure there is a toggle key that can make your right clicks not attack targets on click so the counter play there is beating people who don't hotkey their shit properly). Maybe if the flash was shorter ranged or perhaps couldn't go over walls it'd be fairer?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-17T23:12:36.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's different. Orrn doesn't change the way stuns function he can just extend them. For this you would be changing the entire way slows function now. Don't get me wrong it would be cool and would have worked great in the old slow system. But with the way the game currently works *shrugs*\n\nYou could do something similar to Ivern if she had a jump that a champion could follow. But altering flash in anyway is to powerful. She'd end up in that spot where she was either useless or broken. And no on between","replies":[{"poster":"Aristotally","date":"2017-10-18T00:02:35.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really wouldn't be hard to code, I don't even code much and I could do it lol. While under the affect of the mark all slows on the target are accumulative instead of cherry picking the highest slow available. Also possibly, though I think with a little tweaking it could get to a balanced state but yes you make a valid point. Giving other players dashes should come at a cost I agree, however her kit is balanced around needing teammates to be effective, that's her trade off.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-18T02:46:54.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it would. Coding all slows to stack would be easy. That's what you just suggested. Coding a specific ability to stack slows is much harder. The interaction between it another other abilities would be asking for bugs. The easiest way to do it would probably to make it a seperate status. But even then it would probably cause problems. \n\nYeah but so are champions like Janna and Lulu. Giving another champion a reduced cooldoajnon flash is a super powerful ability regardless of what the rest of her kit does. To try and balance it you should place restrictions on the situations it can be used in. But in that case it wouldn't be a flash it would be a dash and should be towards the champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Aristotally","date":"2017-11-11T18:14:10.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ornn's Brittle is a separate status and works fine (and it doesn't even stack slows it extends ANY CC). I'll be playing the shit out of Zoe lol, her W is everything I wanted out of Faeria's.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
