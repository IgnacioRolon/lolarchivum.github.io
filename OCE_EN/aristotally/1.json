For example if you go to the itemsets in your profile, the black market brawler items {{item:3624}} {{item:3840}} {{item:1335}}  are still there 2 (almost 3) patches later. Champions still have ability videos from 2013 or even earlier and some of them aren&#039;t even accurate anymore (such as kennen&#039;s ult). The tips on a lot of champion&#039;s are bloody useless although I am glad you managed to fix kog&#039;maw&#039;s tips so that it no longer tells you to build madred&#039;s bloodrazor... How can you expect to bring in new players if your game is not only difficult to learn but the information you provide to help people learn is outdated and unhelpful. Also it can&#039;t be hard to, in the ability screen, have the mana costs and damages of each spell readily available so I don&#039;t have to go to lolwiki or somewhere when I want to theorycraft on a champion. Damn it hire me for like $75 a patch and I&#039;ll redo all the videos for champion abilities, add in a section for in depth explanation of the ability and update it every patch. You run a successful esport with pro players as well... It can&#039;t be that hard to ask one of them to fix up your tips section ***cough and give them the chance to practice with urf mode in a custom game cough*. **","replies":[]}
