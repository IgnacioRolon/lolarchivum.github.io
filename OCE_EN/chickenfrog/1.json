I have put below the game I played this afternoon and the massive loss of -27 LP because of it,  this was at least 2 wins of LP completely lost from 1 game. Why is this happening? Will it be fixed? and when will it be fixed?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-25T06:43:00.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"General rule of thumb, the higher division you are, the harder it will be to earn LP. It's a challenge, and would welcome it if I ever get into such a high league.\n\nThe amount of LP you gain or lose is dependent on the opponents you verse. The better they are, the more LP you get if you win; the worse they are, the less LP you get for winning, and vice-versa if you lose against them. This apparently skill level is *not* based off of that match. It could just be you lost matches against opponents who were underdogs and won matches in which you were predicted to win.","replies":[]}]}
