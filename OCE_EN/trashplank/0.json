We recently just got 24 ranked queues and even that was a trial period. Slow down, how long has OCE been up? We simply don't have the playerbase for it yet, and as mentioned it's not even that popular on NA. Before OCE, I rarely played Dominion and when I did, the queues took a solid 5-10 minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-23T04:04:04.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt they will, Dominion isn't even popular in NA.
