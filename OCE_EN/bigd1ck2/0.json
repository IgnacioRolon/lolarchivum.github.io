This was due to utilisation of 3rd party software, scripting in particular, during a game. However, I **HAVE NOT** used any such software or scripts during any of my games, and I am certain my account was compromised (i.e. someone hacked and accessed into my account). Please see the above link for my submitted ticket and relevant info. I'll summarise below the key points. And yes, I don't account share with friends. \n\nOn Sunday around 6-7pm, I tried logging into my account - the client tried to reconnect me to an ARURF game where I was supposedly playing Nautilus. I relogged multiple times and it still did that, so I searched on Google about LoL client reconnecting players to non-existent games. Turns out there were similar cases (such as https://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-en/jtM3EurU-league-trying-to-connect-me-to-a-non-existent-game) so I didn't think much about it. After around 15 minutes, I try to log on again and it works successfully. I assume the game ended and proceeded to play my own ARURF game. Turns out all my ingame settings are changed, and that furthers my suspicion that the LoL server or something accessed my account and resetted all my settings - to me this seemed like a valid reason. \n\nA day later and Riot tells me my account has been permabanned. I've tried talking to their support team about this, but to no avail they strongly believe I am the culprit. I asked whether an IP address check could be performed since the login would have been from an unusual location - they don't answer my query about that. \n\nI've read on many other forums or threads that the typical process is that Riot can check the IP address, or go through the Account Recovery option where they ask questions to prove your real ownership of the account. It seems that I'm not getting any of these options at all, and to me, is a bit unfair. There's really nothing else that I can do to prove that someone had indeed accessed my account. I've never been suspended or punished harshly on LoL before; most I've gotten is queue timers and that was quite a while ago.\n\nI've spent a fair bit of money on this game too, so there's not much incentive for me to lose my account forever. I would appreciate any advice or assistance with this matter - doesn't seem like I can get through to Riot about this.\n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-24T07:22:03.118+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first step is to change your password and the password of the associated email address (also any other accounts that share either of those passwords).\n\nThen. submit specifically an account recovery ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAs you have guessed, chances are your account was compromised and used for cheats. In most cases, player support can reverse any punitive actions taken as a result of compromise once ownership of the account has been verified, and the account itself has been secured.\n\nThere are exceptions to this, but sometimes the compromise is also just a little deeper and not as obvious to support. If you feel something has been missed, you can ask them for a second opinion, but follow through the account recovery first if you haven't already to secure the account.","replies":[{"poster":"bigd1ck2","date":"2020-01-25T03:13:09.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Ninox, \n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n\nI've followed your suggestions and reset password + submitted an account recovery ticket.\n\nIn the meantime, do you advise whether I should keep communicating with Jinxed Support (from the original ticket I submitted) about pursuing this investigation, or should I leave it and see how the account recovery ticket goes?

Mostly compromise cases are pretty clear cut, but sometimes it's hidden a bit deeper which can cause delays in these sort of circumstances.\n\nLike I said though, there are exceptions/certain situations that would result in you being unable to recover the account. While rare, they do happen, so I can't make any guarantees.","replies":[{"poster":"bigd1ck2","date":"2020-02-03T09:34:30.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They got back to me but just simply stated that my issue was being dealt with in the original ticket I submitted - I replied back about requesting to go through the account recovery procedure, but is there anything else I can do to help with my case? \n\nJust sounds like they're reluctant to investigate it at all, and it's getting annoying tbh.\n\nEDIT: link to account recovery ticket https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/44977750?page=1 ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-03T10:42:18.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That link is specific to you, no-one else can view your tickets unless you post them publicly.\n\nIn that case, wait for a reply to the original ticket.

While I understand that you would like to recover your account, as you were previously told, we checked your account and we couldn't find any sign of compromise on it around the time the suspension was issued. Trust me that we have no intention to not investigate thoroughly and to keep players apart from their account.\n\nNow, as much as I would love to help you get your account back, unfortunately we don't remove suspensions as a whole for anyone. If there was even the smallest possibility for players to appeal their permanent suspensions, trust me that everyone would have this chance.\n\nWell then, if you'll have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us anytime and we'll gladly help you out.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nblueivy90,\nPlayer Support\"\n\n\nLooks like I'm out of hope? I honestly don't know how else this can be directed - I'm hoping they did an IP address check already, but if they did, surely something would seem out of place? Are there any last resorts I can look into?\n\nI feel like this is a really unfortunate situation - because I searched online about the LoL client connecting people to non-existent games, I thought the issue was due to a server bug. But apparently not, and now it's got me banned and likely been unconvincing to the support team.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-04T09:20:15.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the only thing you can do from here is request a second opinion. It'll probably bump you back down the queue but you can ask for another agent to review your account.\n\nIt is worth noting that if the account was compromised by a friend or family, or other such people with physical access to your account, it's entirely possible they won't be able to verify the compromise.

Sometimes it's more straightforward than others, and you also have to consider that a lot of things many would consider proof of a compromise (like IP changes, summ spell swaps and the like) can all very easily be spoofed, so they need a combination of factors to determine anything with a reasonable degree of certainty. \n\nThis is also largely why their investigation process is kept very obscure, to prevent people from trying to skirt the detection.\n\nJust request a second opinion and we'll go from there.","replies":[{"poster":"bigd1ck2","date":"2020-02-05T07:31:51.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've closed the original ticket I submitted, meaning I can't make a response to them anymore. \n\nDo I have to make the request on the account recovery ticket now? \n\nI asked about whether they checked the suspicious game specifically and the support agent seems to be unwilling to answer/help furthermore, and stated any further inquiries will go unanswered.
