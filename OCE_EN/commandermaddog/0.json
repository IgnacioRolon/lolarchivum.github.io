His job is closer to that of a secondary jungler.\n\nYes, early game is a struggle for him, but Sol's early game ends at lvl 6 _(lvl 3 if youre cocky)_, because once both your ult and E are up _(or even just E)_, there is almost no reason for you to be in lane!\n\nSol's early game strength comes from his INSANE map pressure, not from dueling. \nIn a 1 on 1 fight, he is _always_ at a disadvantage. But if he can roam, his power soars through the roof. This will feel weird to most mid laners who are used to duking it out in poke fights. \n\nStaying in lane is counter-productive for him, it's better to accept the loss of mid lane turret, but ensure that bot lane gets first blood turret and dominates their lane. \n\nFarm mid, roam bot, farm mid till E is off cooldown, roam bot, farm mid, roam bot etc etc. _(you can roam top, but champs up there have more escapes, and you only get 1 potential kill instead of 2 in bot, so it's generally not worth.)_\n\nBy using your stars to CS _(extend them if you have to)_, you can easily not die before lvl 6, and after lvl 6, you wont be seeing much of your lane opponent, so it doesn't matter if they beat you in fights. \n\nHe has crazy hard counters _(Yasuo/Fizz/Kassadin etc.)_, but as long as you just don't feed them _(don't think about poking, just farm)_, and roam when you can, it isn't an issue. \n\nYou want him to be buffed, but if you buff his dueling potential, you have to remove some of his map pressure, and then he becomes just another boring mid laner, If you like 1v1's and want to smash your lane, pick a different champ, there are 140 champs for a reason! They all do different jobs. His job is not a 1v1 fighter, so he shouldn't be balanced as one.\n\n________\n\nIf you want to be strong with Sol, its just practice.\n**Positioning** and **map awareness** are key, not button-pushing.\nHe isn't Syndra or Cassiopeia, button mashing skills don't help you at all. \nKnowing when to enter and exit fights are fundamental to playing the dragon. \nHe is all about prediction, predict what they are going to do, and put a star where they are going to do it! Will they turn on you? Will they run? What abilities do they have left? these questions are more important to him then any other champion. \n\nIf you get into a fight in lane, just run back to your tower, _(he is tanky enough to take a few hits)_, and as soon as they abandon the chase, turn on them and go ham! All their dashes and CC will be down from the chase, so once you stun them and get 2 stars off for thunderlords, they are low and vulnerable, and you can chase a hell of a lot better than most champs, your Q gives you movement speed, your E builds up move speed as you chase. You'll land 4-5 stars before they get into the safety of their tower, which is enough to either kill, or ensure they do NOT go anywhere near you for a while. \n\nIf they chase you into tower range, duck behind them and ult them into the tower, you can cast Q as soon as you ult to stun them under tower aggro, and they will be too busy running away from the tower than paying attention to your stars. \n\nAlways have an escape plan! If your flash and R are down, don't take risks to get kills. If your R isnt up, do'nt pick a fight with Master Yi, choose to go for Teemo instead. Also, Comet of legend is a perfect tool to escape a gank. If you see Hecarim running down towards you, Comet of Legend the other way, its a great roam tool, but that's not it's only function. \n\nSo no, I don't think he needs to be buffed, he just has very clear spots of vulnerability, but his sustained damage and map pressure more than make up for it!\n\n{{champion:136}}","replies":[]}]}
