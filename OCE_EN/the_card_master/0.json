Just wondering if one is better for the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Trymoreharder","date":"2015-09-28T22:14:43.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say fizz because he can get a away easily and he is really OP","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-26T07:44:10.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are two VERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY different champions. \n\nFizz is an Assassin who has no poke but tonnes of all in potential. He has 7 gazillion ways to outplay his opponents (massive exaggeration), has lots of mobility, lots of one shot potential, good backline diving and turret diving potential. His laning phase is, on paper, not great but due to the fear he strikes in his opponents by simply being Fizz, you're normally fine since you can go in for trades, do tonnes of damage and take very little in return on your way out. You have immense kill pressure at 6.\n\nAzir on the other hand, is a teamfighting control mage with an abundance of sustained damage, but not as much burst as someone like Fizz. He doesn't have the same one shot assassination potential, but he has lots of AOE, CC, peel and like I said, sustained damage. Sustained damage, is important for killing tanks. He has the the ability to keep himself and his fellows carries safe in teamfights and can skirmish quite well. He has surprisingly good kill potential at 6 if you master the \"Shurima Shuffle\". His laning phase is godlike and is among one of the best in the entire game, which is similar to his late game, one of the best in the entire game. He is the definition of a true carry.\n\nPersonally, for solo queue, if you want to climb, I would suggest Fizz. You don't have to rely on anyone to get you fed as you can very easily get yourself fed and get yourself out of danger. Just remember to kite around on the outskirts of a fight, and jump on the carries when you can, and you will be a-ok.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-26T06:29:43.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK\n\nIt may depend on your Aims in the game\n\nwant to always have fun?-buy fizz and get good at him.

Azir on the other hand, is hard yes, but so rewarding and fun to play. His recent nerfs did down his early game output a bit, but Azir is a late game mid champ, and just wrecks anyone who stands in his way..\n\nWho would you rather?\nA slimy fish from under the sea holding a big fork?\nOr a fricken Sand emperor with 10000 soldiers by your side :) \n\nSHURIMA!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-09-25T00:28:09.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Azir got nerfed hard but he is still fun to play however it is kind of hard to master him now because of the recent nerf rito did.Fizz is still a good mid laner if played right.In my opinion go for fizz if you want someone easier to master but go for azir if you want someone fun and challenging to use.\n\n\nRito's balancing team is so goooood\n\nNerfs azir and buffs garen and darius","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-25T01:27:50.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only Azir's Q is nerfed, the rest is the same","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-09-25T02:05:32.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His E doesn't give knockup anymore sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"AliGantz","date":"2015-09-25T07:48:25.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And no more bonus attack speed for cdr or whatever it was","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-25T01:29:47.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is a safe (ish) champion to play, in my opinion (sorry any Fizz mains?)
