It&#039;s about as ridiculous as if Azir&#039;s wall was destroyed when its cast because its a moving object. I&#039;m not going to say its unbalanced (because i hate Yasuo and am inherently biased against him), but just in terms of logic it doesn&#039;t make any god damn sense.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-26T09:01:02.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the size is irrelevant _(it is a world of magic after all)_, and if size was something to be that heavily considered, Aurelion Sol would win games just by existing.\n\nI believe the problem lies in the clarity of the wording they use to describe the Wind Wall.\n\n> Yasuo creates a gust of wind that travels in the target direction over 0.25 seconds to form a wall in front of him. The wall slowly drifts forward 50 units over 3.75 seconds, blocking all enemy **projectiles** except turret attacks.\n\n\nUnder the definition of 'Projectile' _(the word used to describe objects that Yasuo's wall is supposed to stop)_, anything moving under its own propulsion, **should not** be blocked by the wind wall.\n\nAzir's Q, Azir's R _(it is not not destroyed, but **is** halted)_, Taliyah's R, Ornn's R etc. etc. all are self-proppeled, and therefore not 'projectiles'.\nSo the wall is breaking it's now rules by blocking such abilities.\n\nOther abilities such as Maokai's saplings being blocked are also suspect, as the wall can not block 'units'. If Kench's W spit is not blocked, I fail to see the difference between that and Maokai's saplings.\n\nNot to mention that Thresh's pull is blocked. but his auto attacks are not, despite them being almost the same action _(in the realms of physics at least)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-26T09:45:37.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to mention thresh's autos are ranged auto attacks, the same as an adc, his autos are technically projectiles, and yet I think they pass through or at least the bonus damage part does.","replies":[]}]}]}
