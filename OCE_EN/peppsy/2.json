Now i know it sounds insane, but i simply can&#039;t see the connection between these 4 parts\r\n1. Q and Ult\r\n2. Dash and passive shield\r\n3. Wall\r\n4. Double crit passive\r\n\r\nI mean how does a static wall help him be incredible mobile? How does a passive shield make his ult better? What in god&#039;s name does doubling his crit chance have to do with anything else?\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;ve come to the conclusion that Yasuo was originally 3* or 4 different below par champions, until Riot decided to take the best parts of each of them into, what is in my opinion, a horrendously overloaded kit.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-08-29T03:14:57.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is basically the \"new\" Teemo that everyone likes to complain about. But aside from that, unless the person actually knows how to play him, he's a very normal champion (if Rito continues to release more over the top champs). Sure he has a lot of versatility, but there are a lot of champions (gap closers definitely) that can easily outplay him.\n\nI think there are champions who definitely need some more scrutiny and balancing, such as darius (hes a juggernaut with a bleed AND a stupidly high returning heal) Fizz (essentially has a kayle ult every 3-5 seconds) and draven (can do up to 2k of dmg with 1 spinning axe xD )\n\nok so the draven one is a personal vendetta, but you get the point?","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-29T10:06:23.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure the shortest fizz E cd gets is 5 seconds - 45%cdr. & thats a big maybe.

Sure fizz can move a small distance with his E but it doesnt offer nearly as much utility as a kayle ult.  \n\nIf anything is wrong with fizz its the 90% slow when the ultimate hits, and the inevitable 200-1000 damage that follows.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
