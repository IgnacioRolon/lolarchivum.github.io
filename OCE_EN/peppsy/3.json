But for some reason when my internet cut out yesterday, it resulted in a 5 match 20min queue.\r\nSurely after enough good behaviour an accounts punishment should be reduced upon the next offence?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-11T10:41:50.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeaverBuster punishment severities are reduced after a combination of both time since the last leave as well as the amount of games since the last leave. It's an automated system that only applies on accounts who have left a good amount of matches in recent history. If you believe there might be a bug with the LeaverBuster system, you can [**submit a ticket**](http://rito.pl/z/ticket) and Riot can further investigate your situation. However, the system is tuned relatively liberally, as things do come up/happen.
