All animations stop, the movements of players are relatively accurate, I can see health going down, but cant see why, and when something dies. it doesn&#039;t act dead, it stands their on zero health.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if its league side or my side, but I&#039;ve run the ping test in cmd for an entire day while this has been happening and not lost a single packet, ping never exceeding 350.\r\n\r\nI also play other games, (mainly overwatch, csgo, and GTA online) and haven&#039;t experienced any lag spikes or anything in any of those games, and I&#039;ve been talking to friends on discord and have maintained communication throughout (I&#039;ve actually been using them to find out what happen when it happens).\r\n\r\nAnyone know why or how I could fix it?","replies":[]}
