I cannot think of any other way to put it. It&#039;s believable that the main influence behind the changes have never even played a ranked game before. For example how can someone have multiple AFK&#039;s in a game and get permanently banned for getting angry? When this joke of a punishment system does absolutely nothing to the actual problem but punish the player trying to actually play the game, on multiple occasions at that. People say the League community is bad but the parties in control of the entire game are an even bigger joke with the amount of time and money people invest into this game one would think the level of incompetence wouldn&#039;t be so high from those in charge of changes. This doesn&#039;t even involve the joke of match making but I cbf trying to comment when nothing ever gets done.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-08T09:08:42.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  For example how can someone have multiple AFK's in a game and get permanently banned for getting angry?\n\nGetting abusive to your teammates has never helped anyone. It almost always makes it worse; not only by making the troll redouble his efforts and aim it at *you*, but it exacerbates or creates a hostile environment for the rest of the players that had nothing to do with it. You aren't just a problem for the troll, and even if you were, he has the same rights as you do!\n\n> It's believable that the main influence behind the changes have never even played a ranked game before.\n\nAre you talking about balance changes? Balance is focused around Plat+ level play. No balance changes are made to benefit unranked players at detriment to Plat+ level play.\n\nWhat exactly is your problem with matchmaking? Matches are created using your MMR to create as even a game as possible within a reasonable amount of time. Everyone you get paired with is roughly at the same spot as you are, or rather, you're just as low as them for a reason. Every player on the enemy team had a chance at being on yours and vice versa; it's just random chance that puts any one individual on a team within their MMR range, and nobody is treated differently.\n\nInstead of blaming Riot and other players, you should focus on improving your own play. You can't improve until you accept that you can.","replies":[]}]}
