I&#039;ve been permanently banned on my account that has had years of work and money poured into it for the most pathetic chat log I have ever seen. The funnier part is the other players involved received not even a &#039;slap on the wrist&#039;. It&#039;s not even the first time this has happened either, has happened to multiple friends and it&#039;s become quite obvious that the supposed &#039;tribunal&#039; is a spin machine with a random ban function. \r\n\r\nAll in all so much more is needed to be said but this thread will be probably be deleted because its not possible to get logical answers out of the company.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-26T09:10:34.870+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahaha bye","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-26T10:12:31.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He may be right,I see players actually stating \"I don't care, you can report me, the ban system does not work\", thus showing that they are always assholes and never get banned, otherwise if the ban system worked properly, they would not be assholes.\n\nMeanwhile players who here and there are a little aggro get a ban because most of the time those assholes are premade, they can multi report you and get no reports themselves. It is a fucking joke, probably on par with the rank system.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-26T10:22:23.464+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont feel bad for him he deserved this perma ban 100%. It takes 35 chat restrictions and a 2 week ban before you get perma banned. Also the ranking system works fine. People think they deserve higher elo when they really dont. If you deserve higher you would be higher, its simple.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-26T12:28:57.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, the rank system is retarded. Game I just got out of I had an AFK and an asshole jungler shit talking me for the whole game stating it was my fault. Enemy team even backed me up saying our jungler was shit.\n\nOur jungler even had the audacity to say the enemy supports score of 1/2/7 was bad, taking into account our ADC was the one AFK. I helped get the only 2 towers our team took in that game, one of them solo in a 4v5 game, got the best score on my team, and for what? The same lose as an AFK and an asshole.\n\nI will have a bad game here and there, but the amount of bad players at lower level is beyond belief. It is not a matter of who is better that is going to win, it is a matter of who is worse that is going to lose. I got an A- scorecard earlier, and a lose, that is just not something that should happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-26T13:25:42.347+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact is that you have a lower chance of getting a troll or a bad player. You have 4 players matched with you, the enemy has 5 randoms. Dont tell him he is bad, if hes being a dick just mute him. You should focus on improving yourself, alot of your games you have over 10 deaths. If you like u can add me and i can help u out.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-01-26T14:35:56.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So if you are where you are supposed to be, shouldn't every game go for 60+ mins due to players being of equal level?\n\nNot 20-30 mins every game with players having vastly different scores?\n\nThe thing is the enemy also has a higher chance of getting a smurf, so if you are where you are supposed to be the enemy team has an advantage if they are a smurf, so you should lose your games in that situation. Keep in mind a smurf is more potent than an afk or troll because the power level will exponentially increase and their skill level will multiply it further. So if you are where you are supposed to be you should be losing games which means you are not where you are supposed to be, so that very sentence contradicts itself. You do not affect 100% of the game, therefore you are not 100% at the rank you are meant to be. \n\nYou are 1/10 players in the game, just have a think about that.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-26T15:10:27.631+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it shouldnt be going 60+ mins, in bronze games are fast because they make so many mistakes. The more mistakes the more gold the enemy will have. There isnt that many smurfs tbh. Yes you are 1/10 players in the game and 1/5 on a team. Do your job and do it well, you will be fine. If you do your role well every game you will climb, that is a fact. Some games you cant win and thats ok. But if you are not doing your role well dont expect higher ranks. If you do deserve where you are in the ranking system you will win about 50% of your games.","replies":[{"poster":"Im an orange","date":"2016-01-27T11:17:15.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do agree with you on this one","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SkinnyBetas","date":"2016-01-27T10:12:25.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Blatantly wrong, you clearly have absolutely no knowledge of this if you think you're correct.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-27T11:12:39.828+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"clearly i know more thats why your bronze and im plat...","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-27T22:11:18.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dj161K5M,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2016-01-27T11:12:39.828+0000)\n>\n> clearly i know more thats why your bronze and im plat...\n\nBut trolls keep him from challenged tier when he should be!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
