And he is my go-to mid laner. He can roam like a boss with his ulti and stun card. He never have mana problems in lane and he have an very very strong burst. What do you guys think of him? And also he, in my opinion has the best lane clear because of red card.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-14T02:58:50.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just fix his W so it actually applies to next auto, not having to wait a whole sec until it will apply","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-10T06:17:37.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tf has always been a strong pick if you can play him mechanically well.\n\notherwise most people just feed hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-10T05:47:24.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twisted Fate is the king of solo q.

An average tf gets minces by most easier to play mids. Luc syndra and ziggs are especially good vs him. Closer in champs like ahri lb and yas struggle vs his yellow card.","replies":[]}]}
