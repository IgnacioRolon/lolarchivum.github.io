I have decided to build myself a computer as to save money and also im intrested and want to learn the skill of making a computer. I have done HOURS of research basically building my knowledge to the ground up, and i now understand the parts and the brands and how it all works to a reasonable extent and i also have contacts who help me build it. The main problem has been selecting the parts, after another few days of countless hours scolling comparing and reading reviews i have mostly settled on the parts i want. (they are all from PBTech)\r\n\r\nProcessor:\r\n-Intel Skylake i5 6600K\r\n\r\nMotherBoard:\r\n-Gigabyte Z170-D3H (1151)\r\n-ASUS Z170-AR (1151) \r\n\r\nCooling:\r\n-Phanteks PH-TC14s Dual Tower \r\n\r\nRam:\r\n-Ripjaw V series (8x2) \r\n\r\nPSU:\r\n-EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2\r\n\r\nCase:\r\n-Zalman Z1 NEO Luxurious Mid Tower Case (3 fans)\r\n\r\nSSD: about $100-150 samsung \r\n\r\ni have listed 2 mother boards because they were the exact same price from PBtech, when i went in i septn like 2 hours talking to the dude there and the mother board that we put on the quote was the gigabyte, however after doing more searching i found the ASUS for the same price, not really sure which is better or if it matters at all. I do think however the ASUS is meant to be better with  some specific GPU&#039;s that are in my price range.\r\n\r\nBut thats the big problem. Im still very much undecided as to which GPU i should get, there seems to be endless models, and when i think i understand a brand or a series there seems to be more that i stumble across making it harder to choose.  So my questions are the parts i have chosen out fine, are the compatable and will they be ok? The big question however is WHAT GPU DO I GET?! Recommendations and explanations would be very helpful along with the prices and where they are listed. Ill also list a few of the ones which i thought would be ok. Also my price range is around the 400 dollar mark, if i can get a great cpu for less FANTASTIC, but priority is a reliable and great value GPU. I dont need something thats overkill, but i would to be able to play games in 1080p with no fps problems if possible, if that takes me out of price range ill have to compromise somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-11T06:49:07.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What Talon12 is trying to say is that Nvidia released a new tecnology breakthrough GPU called the Geforce GTX 1070. Once the market settles down, the cost it will be is around about five to six hundred if your willing to pay that much. \n\nIt is better than their last released products (excluding 1080) and costs less so imo just save up a bit more and go for the 1070.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-06-10T16:46:30.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in the process of building my first PC too! Just a helpful tip; I would wait until the RX 480 GPU hits the market (around June 28th). It's stated to release for around $200 USD (about $300 for us Aussies after you consider tax and shit). This GPU uses a new architecture and is a lot better than any other GPU you could get for the same price. If you could wait for 3 weeks, I'd certainly do so. If you don't want this for whatever reason, I'd still wait because the older GPUs would (hopefully) drop in price at that point.\n\nEDIT: If you use the website PC Part Picker, you can manually choose each component of the computer, and the website will find the cheapest seller of that part as well as it will check for basic compatibility between each part (just make sure your RAM fits in the case with the motherboard i.e. is not too tall lol). Make sure you also select Australia at the top so you don't get American prices XD","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-10T23:29:19.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol... or get a $400 gpu which is better than a titan X released yesterday XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-10T23:28:45.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yolo it get a 1080\n\ni could give you a beast computers components for $3k its like x5 stronger than alienware for gaming, graphics everything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finding Tèèmo","date":"2016-06-09T19:50:19.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GPU's :\n\nASUS GTX950-OC-2GD5 GTX950 2GB OC : this is one that i have looked at the most being just under $300 (pbtech) and was one of the reasons i was also consdering the ASUS motherboard","replies":[]}]}
