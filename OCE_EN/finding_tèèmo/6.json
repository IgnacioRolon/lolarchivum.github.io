Pretty much every single champ select it disconnects and the timer gets stuck on 0 and i cant select or ban stuff so i get kicked. Sometimes it will reconnect in time for me to lock in, but just have been kicked from 3 champ selects in a row. This has happened a lot and i have estimated a loss of about 70 lp. The chat in champ select will still work, and i can usually chat to people while stuck on 0. I also have never had problems in-game with lag or disconnecting. Im really confused as to whats causing the problem whether its on my ends or riots. I have sent bug reports to riot 4 times but of course they havnt responded... I have run through things like hex tech repair, reset modem and all that good stuff. Yeh so basically I have no idea how to fix this and its really weird help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[]}
