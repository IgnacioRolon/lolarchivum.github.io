month ive had two chat restrictions and this is my second 2 week this month, ill probably get permaed next month and roll my 11th account, i dont even care at this point.\n\nI wont change, infact as ive acrued more and more bans ive just gotten more and more volatile, because i give less and less of a shit about my accounts.\n\nIf you genuinely want to improve the game, from someone who actually is toxic, my advice to you, is redesign the systems which inturn leads to this behavior.\n\nEven within this chatlog, you can see that i have extreme animosity directed at a single player (the pyke in this instance) but when someone else asked a genuine question (pykes ult is a 25% execute right?) i calmly answered as if i wasnt even slightly angry.\n\nHow can i be simultaniously calm and angry at the same time?\n\nSimple, because im not angry im calm, i just hate one of the players with a passion, and so will respond to them with increasingly aggressive responses as they themselves ramp up their own aggression.\n\nWhy do i hate this player? because the current systems promote teamplay over solo carrying games, so i no longer merely put up with their existence and tolerate it, their existence directly affects my enjoyment of the game, i cant ignore them anymore, and the further the game trends towards the whole \"you have to work together no matter how bad you are as a collective\" the more toxic the game is going to get.\n\nBecause news flash, solo q, is not professional play, you arent throwing 10 lcs level players together, youre throwing 10 players who have never met each other and have absolutely zero synergy with each other together, then forcing them to work together like some sick game of barbie.\n\nofc there will be arguments when you do that, it is inevitable.\n\nyou have to pick one, a teamplay focused game, or a toxicity free game, you genuinely cannot have both.\n\nAnd this is not new information either, historically any form of teamwork based scenario is where you will find the most toxic environments period.\n\nwork, bands, sports, video games, the only common factor is humans being forced to work together and being judged as a group rather than on the individual level, and that they all breed toxicity.\n\non the flipside when the individual worth is recognised and valued over the worth of the whole, toxicity is greatly reduced in these environments.\n\nBecause when johnny the slacker at work doesnt pull his own weight, you dont think \"fuck you johnny youre going to make me look bad\" you think \"well johnny is gonna get fired if he keeps this up\" infact it breeds helpfulness, because even though the environment is competitive because you all want that promotion, you like johnny, he tells good jokes around the office, so you give him a heads up that hr is keeping an eye on him, which in turn surprise surprise creates a net positive in the office.\n\nBecause when each individual member is striving to do their best to in turn show their best, and are also helping prop each other up you end up with a more efficient result, the same thing happens in video games, when individual players are rewarded for their individual performance, it results in every player striving to do better in their respective position so as to show their own individual potential.\n\nAnd they still help each other.\n\nWhereas when you take a \"the individual is worthless the collective is important\" approach aka \"teamplay over individual play\" you breed toxic behaviour because you end up with finger pointing and blame shifting because no one wants to be the guy that brought down the other 4 players on your team, this also breeds a mentality of \"its not me its my team\" which in turn results in no one striving to improve, which in turn results in a greater number of players that infuriate the people genuinely trying to push the ladder.\n\nWhich inturn creates toxicity in all levels of the spectrum, the bad players blame shifting, and the good players getting dragged down, and the toxicity of both sides fuels each other to increasingly violent levels of aggression.\n\nThis is not rocket science.\n\nSo closing point:\n\nBan me all you want, i wont go anywhere, because i can just roll a new account, and whether you like it or not, im not a toxic person, this is a toxic game.\n\nLike you can be in as much disbelief as you want, but i am not toxic anywhere else, but no other game i play has a system that seems almost tailor made to breed toxic behaviour.\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nMr TeaThyme: doesnt

strategy towards gaining the result is not very likely to succeed. Very few examples can be made where the minority has had a enough of an impact to change any system or major aspect of League of legends. Also, you're not enjoying (I hope) the games you're playing because you play in a system that you don't agree with and that ruins it for others. It breeds more toxicity and makes the game less fun for everyone. Further-more, riot is where it is today for a reason. They are professionals in their field and mostly (again, I hope) have good intentions towards the game. Those aspects together should be enough to put together a system that works efficiently, covers all legal boundaries and does what it's designed to do. Keep in mind like any other company or business Riot needs to make it's money to continue to provide the service to which we currently enjoy. If the system doesn't make that money then that's probably a defining factor why it's not in use.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr TeaThyme","date":"2019-10-05T13:18:21.390+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're way too optimistic.\n\nRiot cares about money they couldn't give any less of a shit about us.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-06T06:14:24.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mr TeaThyme,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=75ia72ZF,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-10-05T13:18:21.390+0000)\n>\n> You're way too optimistic.\n> \n> Riot cares about money they couldn't give any less of a shit about us.\n\nYes, I know.

And if you think taking a commanding tone will have a positive effect, then you are too used dealing with weak personality. Someone with a fight respond personality will just escalate things. If that is what you are after then go for it, but drop that holier than thou attitude. By no mean you are any better at the game then them, you are of the same rank. \n\nTry that in real life vs people of disagreeable nature **when you are on equal footing** and see how that goes. You wont step down and neither will them. What is left when negotiation has failed? FIGHT? \n\n> Because that's my personal fucking trigger, people who genuinely believe that they are better than they actually are, to the point where you outright show them how shit they are and they fight it.\n\nBecause they are not looking for advice, they want to feel good. You are not curious of why they acted that way either, you just want to feel good when you flame them as well. Peas in a pot.\n\n> I don't encounter it much at work thankfully, but I've had to sit a few people down and look them dead in the face and remind them \"you hired me because you know you don't know shit about this implementation, stop giving me advice on something that you know I'm the expert in\" in nicer words ofc I have a job on the line.\n\nThey might not be giving you advice, they could be reminding you of things they thought you have over looked. You're not exactly a people person are you. \n\n> But as it currently stands I've seen people in gold who belong in iron but have an ego because their profile says gold.\n\nThat is your bias perspective, you have not take in the consideration of boosted accounts, make too many mistakes, bad match up, got camped, not experience enough on the champ, ETC...\n\n> And people in iron who belong in gold but keep listening to the instructions of other iron players because they think they are iron.\n\nThe potential to get somewhere is not the same as having the attitude to get there. This is applicable in all aspect of life. Some of the iron players could be in gold, but their level of enthusiasm is not high enough to pour the effort in. \n\n> The alternative would be individual mmr dictating your lp gains and losses rather than team average mmr dictating, and have your individual mmr gains and losses determined by individual performance level.\n\nDo you know how the world cup in soccer work? \n\nBasically they throw together a random team comprise of players of the same nationality, taken from clubs over all the soccer world to represent the nation. Some have a few high profile players. While other might have only 1. Still they gotta work together to win. Same concept. \n\nIndividual mmr only work in game like chess, or single opponent style match. Because the goal is to win, not to preserve yourself and play for scores.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr TeaThyme","date":"2019-10-12T03:42:28.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-10-12T04:46:09.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [REMOVED]\n\nDon't even try to evade with such a weak reasoning.

The amount of practice goes into each match is borderline rushed and limited.

I can say this with certainty. You've play this game for a long time and frequently. [snip]\n\nThis does not sound like a person getting angry at a game, this is a person that is angry because the game is his life.\n\n>Whereas when you take a \"the individual is worthless the collective is important\" approach aka \"teamplay over individual play\" you breed toxic behaviour because you end up with finger pointing and blame shifting because no one wants to be the guy that brought down the other 4 players on your team, this also breeds a mentality of \"its not me its my team\" which in turn results in no one striving to improve, which in turn results in a greater number of players that infuriate the people genuinely trying to push the ladder.\n\nWhen a person feel that their contributions don't matter, you can also expect their ability is nothing special. If individual play is not a thing, then people wouldn't complain about why the other lane is fed. Because according to your logic, their solo performance is not enough tip the scale.\n\nPeople who generally gave up and start blaming their team mate after one mistake are generally those who see the error as FF 15 cant win any more. Generally these type of people think very highly of the enemy and badly of their own. \n\nAnd of course there are those that only start the finger pointing when all is lost to let off pent up steam. \n\nAm sure there are more types, but these 2 I've mentioned seem very common.\n\nBut if we delve deeper on the question of, what happen when a game is seen as lost? Things get complicated, this is where personality play a big part on the reactive respond. It generally come down to, given up, or taking their anger out on the lowest hanging fruit. \n\nSo what to do about it? Aside from putting rules and handing out punishment, you cant change a person's personality, you can only give them enough obstacles to deter from taking it too far. In the end, if they really don't give a shit, rules are nothing.\n\n\n> Ban me all you want, i wont go anywhere, because i can just roll a new account, and whether you like it or not, im not a toxic person, this is a toxic game.\nLike you can be in as much disbelief as you want, but i am not toxic anywhere else, but no other game i play has a system that seems almost tailor made to breed toxic behaviour.\n\nYou need to stop playing games and start socialising.
