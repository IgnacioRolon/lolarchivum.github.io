You can also opt to send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), although they cannot tell you what punishment was handed out to the players, if any, due to privacy issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-05T09:54:33.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you saying the system can pick up swearing from variety of language.

While Riot definitely has a long way to go to improving these systems, players like that do actually end up with punishments (even if it does take a while). \n\nWe see this through cases like that smite nunu support a while back, and the proxy singed support. People like this get reported A LOT and in most of their games, and even though the system can't find anything wrong, obviously they are rubbing people the wrong way and something needs to be done. Often it ends with a manual review, and punishments are administered. It even sometimes happens in chat cases where nothing obviously  jerk-like is being said, but the person still is wracking up reports ([HERE](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/7AvNjzRj-2-week-ban?) is probably the most infamous case of this on the boards). When reporting a player for their behaviours, leaving a lil comment in the box provided is very helpful in these cases, and is something I would encourage doing for every report you lodge. \n\nIf people continue diligently using the correct methods of player reporting (through the end game screen and perhaps a support ticket for behavioral stuff _in addition to_ the end game screen report), we can only hope that the systems continue to improve and that Riot finds a way to better monitor and pick up on negative in game behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-06T05:45:21.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many case are being manually reviewed? What are the percentages on the overall scale? Do you think this is a possible downside of Riot system? Does Riot seek external professional on their judgement? How can a normal player have impact on Riot decision?\nI shall share some insight. My friend, who is a League of Legends veteran. He has been playing League since season 2. He had spent over $4000 on this game. Most of his asset comes from his skins collection, with over 600 skins. He also possess all summoner icons from season 2 (except ranks). Everytime Riot release a new skins, he buys it, and he has been consistently doing so for the past 4 years. In a sense, he is a large stakeholders.\nHowever, recently, he had been banned for negative behaviour. He has been trying to get the case manually reviewed, but the result is copy and paste respond. He described the experience as \"like i was talking to a robot\". \nSince then, he has stopped spending money on League, and he noticed that Riot can take away anytime they want, and he could never have a saying in the matter. \nMy question is: How is Riot treating its players? How can a player review their cases? Especially long-time player? \nHow effective is the system, if it's making players leaving the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-06T06:04:41.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have mentioned that you were banned, but the best way to get community feedback is to post your reform card (the popup in client that tells you what you were banned for). We can't give you any insight onto why you were banned and why support is denying you if we don't know the reason for it and the same goes for you friend. We don't know why he was banned so we can't give you anything beyond vague information that may or not apply to his circumstances.\n\nHow much money you have spent has absolutely no bearing on behavioural bans. When it comes to behaviour everyone is treated the same, whether they've spent $5000 or $0.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-06T06:22:54.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reform card only shows what the system pick up. So if i say 'bad word about another race', that's included. But it will never show what my teammates said to me? Fair enough? What's more, no one have access to that chat log, which make it even harder to build a strong case. And now you are telling me, to post what I was banned for, without posting the whole chat log. Yea nice try. The system shows only one side of the story. What the system had pick up is my losing side. And if so, when an account get banned they lose. There is no review. End.\nAnd you are wrong about the amount of money a player spend. They should be treat the same when its come to behaviour. However, their investment into their accounts shows the support they giving Riot as a investors, users of Riot service. That should have a saying. What you just said right there about \"whether they've spent $5000 or $0\", just come to show how Riot as a company do not care about its users. \nI can spam few dozens accounts and ruins everyone's day in ranks. If my teammates piss an got wrongfully banned, I win. It doesn't matter if they've spent few thousand on this game. They were behaving negatively. They were being racist. They can't post the log chat up here, cause the system have no records of how i refused to group, and always get caught.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-06T06:36:57.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're judged on your behaviour, and yours alone. It doesn't matter who started it, if you abuse back you become just as bad as them, and there are still 3 other players in your game that now have to sit through or mute (at which point the damage is done) two people being toxic.\n\nSo yes, I'm asking you to post *your* chat log, because it's *your* log that you have been judged on and punished for. The other players' chat is irrelevant,\n\nWhy should the amount of money you have to spend on this game affect how your behaviour is viewed? Are you saying it's ok to be racist in all your games as long as you've spent over $1000 dollars on the game???\n\nOther people's behaviour does not justify abuse of your own.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-06T06:48:40.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first point is clearly false. It does matter who started it. I shall make this clear. Anyone can be toxic, and anyone can be up set. You can't have negative behaviour from only one side. You can't understand a conflict if you look from one side. \n\nSecond point is extremely irresponsible. You look at one side of the story, and judge. The moment, anyone posted their chat log (ONLY THEIR), they shall immediately be deemed guilty without any appeal, or what other said to them. \n\nAnd I have never said it's ok to be racist just because someone spent thousand dollars. I agreed with you on that point. However, this is crucial. A player who has been with the game for a long long time. And had spent thousands of dollars on the game. Should have a cases where he can justify himself. The amount of money he spent, illustrates the passion he has for your game.Therefore, his records, his profile should be WORTH IT for Riot to take a look in to his case, manually.\n\nI shall ask this again, how many cases are being manually reviewed?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-05T05:35:46.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The link is a copy version of the original post","replies":[]}]}
