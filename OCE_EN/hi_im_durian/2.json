What is the solutions here?\r\n\r\nThere is no proof Riot Punishing System is banning anything beside toxic behaviour. There is evidence, however, that the system is almost automatic which indicates most of the bans are done by bots, not human. Therefore, a player who mention &#039;ching-chong&#039; racial words shall be more likely to ban.

It can also be used to buy champions. However, most accounts have access to champions already. This is due to 7 seasons of IP currency. But, the point of having IP is to buy runes which is something unique to each player's preferences. Therefore, it has a value of its own. On the other hand, blue essence has limited uses. It is only for loot system, has no value beside that. Therefore, if you have multiple champion shard (no one care), if you have tons of blue essence (no one want it). Value goes down","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-05T20:40:41.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well runes are all free so we all got access to all of them .... I think you are missing out on what riot did and are gonna open up again in the future.. the blue essence shop where you could buy chromas, icons, ward skins, and even that rare URF ww skin .... this boosts its value till about even because in old system you could only buy champs and runes and once you had standard runes there was no use purchasing many more.","replies":[{"poster":"Hi im Durian","date":"2018-02-06T04:56:05.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because they make it free, it means your IP has less uses. The blue essence shop offers some little actual benefit. You can buy champions: which is very expensive, if you consider the supply of blue essence. For example: a new account that play from lv1-30 would earn around 20k blue essence. Therefore, to own more than 15 champs (rank requirement), you would either have to spend real money, or get lucky with some crates. But the crates are based on chances; so a normal player that wants no part in spending real value for champions would have to grind LV. Imagine how efficient that is. With the old system you can access IP boost farming, and daily wins. You can argue that the new XP grind works the same in this instance, however, it would be way less efficient. Moving on, buying chromas does not add value to your account, especially when it's accessible by everyone. For instance: If Bliztcrank Chromas would to be opened, everyone would buy it, making it a common item. And the promise of rare skin, ward skins, icons is very occasional, you will never know when it will occur. Might be next year, what state would the game be in then? Remember the gaming industry is very competitive. Last point, the old runes system offer much more variety. Players can have a mix of their own unique combination set of runes, which make its special to each players. As a consequences, each player value their own preferences. History has shown: season 3: favourite runes for adc  attack speeds with 2% life steal; or full attack damage, Midlane prefers: full ap, or ap with movement speeds, some Zed players: take 5% attack speed, Dopa Toyz TwistateFate with 4.5% movement speed. That's just to show how unique each player play style is different from another. And this is all coming from runes and IP. The more IP you have, the more runes you will have access to. With the removal of IP comes to centralisation in gameplay","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-06T22:25:20.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hi im Durian,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=hAKrxaFe,comment-id=000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2018-02-06T04:56:05.243+0000)\n>\n> Because they make it free, it means your IP has less uses.
