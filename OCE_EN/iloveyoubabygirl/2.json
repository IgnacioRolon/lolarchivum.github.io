Sharing a couple of my Pantheon pages, any feedback, thoughts, suggestions?\n\nPage 1 DOMINATION\nELECTROCUTE\nSUDDEN IMPACT\nEYEBALL COLLECTION\nRELENTLESS HUNTER\nPRECISION\nCOUP DE GRACE\nLEGEND: ALACRITY\n\nThe idea here is burst, stalkers blade, tiamat, static shiv, duskblade, then I normally stuff it with 1-3stopwatches for second rotations. Normally your sudden impact dmg+coup de grace dmg outputs should be equal or closeish to your electrocute dmg. Unless you are doing a lot of heavy opening (dieing) then electrocute will be much more as youre not getting the KO coup dmg or sustained sudden impact penetration extra bonus dmg coming through (build stopwatches). Eyeball collection takes the sting out of no more scaling AD runes (best in game on panth minus movespeed and no sword of the occult). As I mentioned, movespeed from relentless hunter. Mobility is King in MOBA. The extra attack speed from Precision & alacrity give you, when combined with the movespeed (plus pantheons naturally high movespeed to begin with), the ability to kite-aa-spear-move & dodge 4death, as well as keep aegis STACKED and clear with shredding aoe tiamat damage and more shiv procs (again with the pantheon move speed factor being real). No more to it then that really, personal notes: main jungle, take all the gold, hope team play as well as you do. Last whisper to KO tanks and/or healers like nasus/katarina with gunblade.\n\nPage 2 INSPIRATION\nUNSEALED SPELLBOOK\nHEXTECH FAPTRATION\nFUTURE'S MARKET\nCOSMIC INSIGHT\nSORCERY\nTRANCENDENCE\nGATHERING STORM\n\nHere the idea is map control through inspiration line combined with scaling from sorcery. Cosmic insight bridges the link nicely. Giving you 5% on your item cd, your cdr, and your summoner cdr (allowing for more map control and mastery of swapping/rotating summoners). Smite can be rotated early if you need more laning presence into (what I normally do) swapping between teleports and ignites, depending on the situation and timings of cd remaining. Combined with constant flashing all game for opening/jungle pathing with hextech. A typical game will see you hitting 30-60+ extra dmg from trancendence (extra dmg for transcending cdr cap @ 45 with cosmic insight) giving 12 AD dmg each 10% cd, which is gold effeciency dream off basic items like fully upgraded relic shield, black cleavers, warhammers, combined with a critical strike item (for pantheon IE or static shiv, sometimes pd but more situational) with the extra CDR from essence reaver, also cd boots. Plus storm. You need constant blues.\n\nNb. page 2, it would be more ideal with poachers knife still in game (to ward without smite), mana pots (45% cdr on pantheon will drain his balls faster then a hot fascoli on sunday) and sword of the occult (only good item in the game for panth). Page 1&#039;s standard/flagship/typical for current meta. Just my views.\n\nA note on static shiv, it will give you mana sustain because of the following functions: burst, mobility, wave clear, aegis stack(life sustain) and also opens/contributes to other lines of CDR (from essence reaver) or burst (stack an aa between each move ideally especially when you come down from the chaos and havok of your ult). Machete-tiamat-static are my 3 most built items on panthe, then maybe stopwatch and boots.\n\nI also have a third page which is essentially a combination of these 2 pages, domination as listed but with predator and inspiration as secondary with hexflash and futures market. It's very cheesey (rush -ghostporo is also very useful for rush games as you queue it while you hexflash from a bush- ie ganking lvl 1-9, boots and blade, you gank all game, win game at 5-25, then lose at 45) though and if ur team dont play to consolidate your lead it loses a lot of its sting after about 13-23 minutes. Lots of pink wards, even starting items (machete is better then dragon 4/5 times/situ's and then start either rejuvi bead to go into relic shield line or tiamats, or 3 potions if ur first back will be very delayed and ull be doing heavy work, or refillable if you know your timings, or 2 pink wards if u want map control/domination early, usually ward trinket but again sweepers is great for more map control), and boots first back no matter what then go into blade and tier 2 (boots). Always look for invades and first blood to get boots online asap for the predator bonus. If (when) it(game) falls to shit, stack stopwatches and a bc + w/e situ.\na typical game with this setup will go machete-ward-pot, but you can also start machete pure if ur good and have experience and know what you are doing, and save money for the first buy (ideally boots of mobility for predator ganking)\nthe extra gold u dont spend is ok because it combines with futures market for first buy being\nboots/ of mobility and aegis gives u the sustain ur missing, plus health from smites, the pots just for diving/invade\nthen stalkers blade\nmore pots and wards after and on top of this\nthen you can go tiamat if you want to burst and farm then into whatever line you need\nor if the game is close then finish ur stalkers with more blades\nthen ga/bc\nif the games not over by here u lose, make a zonya or something and tank open then pop it when they think u fucked cuase u got no tenacity kek\nalso at this point (as you open into 5, dump a spear stun if ur lucky and pop a stopwatch) start praying to the all father ur teams within 3 screens and following ur open (often not the case) else at least ur putting the fear of god into them into dumping long cd spells and items on u, which if u play right, fiercely, they will be scared, and respect u like that. making the map dark of vision with lots of wards and sweepers can also help to this affect, think nocturne ult but ur controlling the entire map/game.\nif you get behind at the start ur fucked and farm back into it and play a more consolidated supportier type of pantheon jungle opener role\nu gank lvl 1-9 like i said and give all the gold over to ur team, ull be under leveled and underfarmed and flamed by noobs but its pro level play and dunning kruger is a mental illness in this game\n\n I find it doesn't work as well because OcE and LoL in general are low tier skill play, even at master+ scrims, albeit pub~. Hence the first 2 setups are better for shitter teams and stat padding. Page 1 the most - shittest teams/most pub. Then page 2 being an intermediary average team. Then other end of spectrum (shit stats but greatest skill and reward) being the third - proteams. The higher you go in this 1-2-3 tier setup also note there are much harsher/heavier penalties for fucking up, especially early. Bleeding gold in setup 3 will end you because of the relativitiy to what you make yourself, but doesn't matter for shit in tier 1. 2 again inbetween. 3 really depends on your team having their shit together and fingers on the keyboard and not in their arse, where as 1 you can play 1v13 as the runes pad your game massively but in page 3 here there is little to no room for error, especially if enemy jungler is getting gold (typical) by farming while u poor heart and soul into ignorant and non appreciate lane snowballs at your own expense, especially bot and top lane.  Your total ad dmg should be around the 10 per minute mark, if it falls under 2/3rds of this you will be be hitting with broken hands, you can also snowball to about 150% (10/min).\n\nEnjoy.\n\nAll 3 are as a Pantheon Jungle main position. Just a note in HoN I was regions top 10 and have a grandmaster ELO in games with a much.. MUCH greater skill requirement and grading. I play LoL casually but like I mentioned play in Master+ circles.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-25T06:26:33.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing beats the summon aery meta.

Not items. Please don't brickwall me with irrelevant information. The whole point of playing pantheon is to harass your opponent in lane and potential kill and snowball. If you can't get a kill early as panth with summon aery ignite then you've lost the game for your team. But if you do get a kill you can start roaming and gaining advantages for your team so you can hopefully end the game during the mid game. If it goes to late game you might as well build tank. Taking anything other than aery will hinder your ability to poke and snowball.\n\nEdit: Obviously this only goes for lane panth which you never made clear if you were talking about jungle or top.

The last 2 in particular because they are 100% the most aggressive/scaling/damage orientation items in the game. Biscuits and bullshit don't cut it. That's why I mentioned it, a mere tribute or ode to what was and should be.
