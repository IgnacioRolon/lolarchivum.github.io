Kiting only works when you're ahead, if you are behind against another adc with equal or superior range you'll just die. If you go ninja tabi, you can run away with minimal damage while doran shield and refillable heal you up. Cull will help you sustain too so you can't be kill combo'd. Depending on what adc you're playing you will still have some damage anyway. But you can't do damage if you're dead.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-01T06:29:25.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you word this so that low IQ people like me can understand what you are trying to say cause the wording is too hard for me to understand","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-04-01T06:30:52.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if its THAT level of adc, just shove/farm/take their cs when you visit their lane to get something equivical to the gold and xp you'd get if they were actually good enough to of got a kill (this applies to any of the other 4/5 of team) with you and keep going, build a static shiv with the extra gold ur self and to help offset/compensate some of the missing aa dps that the team needs - classical strategy","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-01T21:16:41.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if the adc we play doesn’t build shiv :)","replies":[{"poster":"100mPantheonXP","date":"2018-04-02T05:37:06.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-02T06:08:39.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I’m bad Mr level 11","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-04-01T08:14:08.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When you struggle as adc, get diff supp player.
