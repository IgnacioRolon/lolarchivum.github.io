Remember that this game is only rated M (13+ in the US), and given that's only an advisory rating there's going to be players a lot younger than that. \n\nShould we be encouraging them to use racist slurs at every opportunity because they're 'just words'? Should we be teaching them that it's perfectly ok to abuse other people, because the burden is for some reason on the other person to be the mature one? \n\nDon't get me wrong, if you're the kinda person that sits there typing back abuse instead of just muting the ass and moving on, you're just as bad, and muting is an important tool/feature but it shouldn't be a get out of jail free card for people who want to be dickheads. If they really can't contain themselves they can take it somewhere that allows it like a friend's discord or something.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-03-08T02:24:12.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">If you have to mute someone then generally speaking the damage is already done.

I had one game play offense and i mentioned my role got stolen. who instigated it? doesn't matter right? now all your arguments are going to collapse on them self. I didn't give a fuck that I got banned I didn't ask to be unbanned for inting. it was fair but unfortunate. I've seen plenty other players force a loss way worse than I have in competitive matches. But everyone knows nothing's going to happen to them if you report on game play offenses. It worked on me because I used the in-game chat and been reported and stupidly punished on same  dog shit report system that got this guy banned. \n\nNo one should give a fuck about chat.  game play offenses is where it causes real problems and griefing, no one can control what you do in-game but you can control what you see i.e mute pings and chat. If you fucking don't like what people are saying you have a option to shut them the fuck up. styx and stones.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-03-07T01:45:26.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"agreed 100%.\n\ndoes the OCE actually care about gameplay or what people say. like honestly grow people say bad shit when they're stressed and trying to achieve something on this. \n\nyou can mute someone that is actually offending you but you can get anything out of reporting someone for literally inting and you get the worst players after reporting that shit as well","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-05T11:26:42.336+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"calling someone garbage and bad aint worth a ban lol.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2018-03-06T00:48:07.393+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"It is when its escalated through chat restrictions and somehow still don't understand why punishments keep coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr TeaTime","date":"2018-03-07T00:04:48.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"that assumes its worth a chat restriction in the first place, just sayin.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
