I was just wondering this because of his outdated visual look and that made me wonder, why hasn&#039;t he had a rework. First off, if you wiff his Q that&#039;s it, you can&#039;t recover that gank or engage without wasting flash. His W is completely useless early game without a build made around his W or with blue buff. His E has such a small radius and can only be utilized if his Q lands. Lastly, Amumu&#039;s ult/R is great for helping land your Q or helping slow the enemy team to help your team arrive and win the fight, but it doesn&#039;t really help in a 1v1, it seems to be more of an expensive Q that instantly traps anyone in a 360 radius and allows time for Amumu to walk over and E or Q over to the enemy. In saying this Amumu is still a good champ, I just believe that he isn&#039;t very helpful to his team if he misses his Q because he doesn&#039;t receive any bonuses or cool down reduction for missing a Q or any thing to help him recover from a bad engage/gank.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-24T01:25:45.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Amu is not designed to 1v1, he is a tank and a team fighter, if you're 1v1ing with him you lack intelligence (Unless you go full ap ofc)\n\n2. If you miss Q, so be it, same as with lee miss Q go back to farming repeat, you should't even be missing Q, since its hitbox is way larger than it looks\n\n3. E isn't for fighting, its for farming jg, since it reduces incoming damage and loses cooldown the more you get hit\n\n4. his W is not supposed to do damage, its there to reset his curse passive\n\n5. He was visually upgraded not to long ago (last season i think) so he won't be getting another one for a while\n\n6. he doesn't need a rework his kit is fine for his duty, he is there to tank and CC thats it, he's not there for damage, he's not there to carry, he's there to be a literally mummy  meat shield","replies":[{"poster":"LimeKing","date":"2018-08-25T02:16:52.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks DarkShade918 that is legit the most helpful thing anyone has ever told. I'm gonna start playing Amumu like a depressed meat shield with no damage. But I still think he needs at least a visual rework, only because he doesn't even look like much of a tank.\n\nThanks bro.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-25T07:04:08.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LimeKing,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2Rzrj1ZI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-08-25T02:16:52.132+0000)\n>\n>But I still think he needs at least a visual rework, only because he doesn&#x27;t even look like much of a tank.\n> \n\n\nClearly you didn't read the 5th point\n\nHE ALREADY GOT ONE HE WON'T BE GETTING A NEW ONE FOR A WHILE","replies":[]}]}]}]}
