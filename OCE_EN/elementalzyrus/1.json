The arrow does not go through multiple targets.\r\nW (Pierce) = Yaji dashes to his target and impales them with his arrow. If the target is killed the next target behind it takes damage (50/75/100/125/150), stacking up to three enemies. Takedowns refund 50% of the mana cost and refund the cooldown. Scales with 50% AP.\r\nE (Rushi&rsquo;s Blessing) = Passively, Yaji recovers (10/20/30/40/50) health per AA scaling with 25% of his missing HP. When active, Yaji gains (15%/30%/45%/60%/90%) extra Attack Speed.\r\nR (Ionian Honour) = Yaji challenges his opponent to an honourable one-on-one Duel in which only the two can take part in. If Yaji kills the target, he gains extra max mana and health, and vice versa if the target kills him. The challenge will only end when either Yaji or his target dies.\r\nPassive (Demacian Blood) = Upon entering combat, Yaji gain 15 Armour and Magic Resist.\r\nHidden Passive = If there is another Ionian in the game (enemy or ally), gain more health and mana from Ionian Honour.\r\n\r\n**Lore**\r\nBorn as a Demacian Prince, Yaji was the youngest son of an Ionian mother and Demacian father just a few decades after the events of the Rune Wars. His father wanted him to rule as a king and Commander. His mother, however, felt his life would be better off lived in Ionia, away from politics and war, so in the dead of night, they left for Ionia, leaving his father and brother.\r\n\r\nUpon arriving in Ionia, Yaji was sealed in a hidden temple where time stood still by his mother, who was fearful of the wrath of his father.\r\n\r\nIt was hundreds of years before Yaji was discovered by a pair of explorers called Eneli and Jyrd. When they opened the temple, Yaji was still as much a baby as he was when he was born. The pair had their own child but had no knowledge of raising one, so gave him to the Ionian Elders, who had him raised by Master Lito and trained in the art of Hiten alongside Irelia.\r\n\r\nOne day when Yaji was still young, a convoy from Demacia arrived and Yaji overheard a conversation with two Demacian soldiers about the story of a Demacian Prince who had been taken by Ionian&rsquo;s when he was just a baby but was never confirmed as fact or fiction. Yaji brushed it off as just a story.\r\n\r\nYaji now fights alongside Irelia{{champion:39}}  as a champion of Ionia, but in his heart, he knows something is missing and he strives to find out what.\r\n\r\n**Related**\r\nIrelia, Karma, Ezreal\r\n\r\n**Release Skin**\r\nNightblade Yaji\r\n\r\nI had to come up with a few of my own details, such as Eneli and Jyrd, who are Ezreal parents, because as far as I know, his parents aren&#039;t currently named and the lore isn&#039;t as fleshed out as I&#039;d like it to be.\r\n\r\nI have also put this on the /r/leagueoflegends Subreddit","replies":[]}
