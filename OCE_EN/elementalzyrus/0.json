After I get Ahri {{champion:103}} I&#039;m stuck between getting Malzahar {{champion:90}} or Diana {{champion:131}}. Seeing as neither are free to play right now, I was hoping some of you would help give me insight.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-09-13T06:34:56.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya ElementalZyrus !\n\nRanked for the first time hmm how are you feeling?\n\nI remember being so scared, but I'm sure you're gonna do awesome!\n\nHonestly, if you wanna tilt someone pick malzahar :)\n\nHe;s pretty easy to pick up and has an annoying spell shield as HIS PASSIVE!\n\nAll you do is spam those space creatures and buy rylais and liandries BOOM get that Penta kill :D","replies":[{"poster":"ElementalZyrus","date":"2017-09-13T06:42:51.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty nervous, but as I stated, I'm still a little while of starting my ranked experience.

Diana is a mobile burst assassin where as Malz is a control Mage that pushes well and has a good ult for locking down a member of the enemy team. \n\nAs for ranked. Make sure you have champs in the other roles as you may get autofilled. So have at least two champs in each role and have a general idea to play them. Maybe more for your off role.
