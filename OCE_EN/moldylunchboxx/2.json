I'm doing fine, it's all going well, significantly less tilt this time round, etc etc. \n\nGameplay is fine, all is well, and I'm happy.\n\nI finally get to Gold 1 Promos, awarded one free win (So I'm Gold 2 100LP, 1/3 wins, 0/3 losses) and I suddenly run into this very, VERY common bug.\n\nThis bug, as seen in the image attached, causes your game to keep the ready check up, for whatever reason. I've never been able to consistently repeat this bug, and it doesn't seem to have anything to do with accepting it too quickly, either. It just tries to load into the game, but fails to unload the ready check. \n\nIn the background, you can see the lobby loads in, I get connected to the lobby, but nothing else loads. I can't click on anything through the ready check and there isn't anything to click anyway, aside from the chat bar and the ultility functions up the top. I can't access those with this bug.\n\nObviously, it FORCES me to dodge, because unless someone else dodges for me (Which I can't politely ask them to do because of this bug), I am forced to dodge because I will fail to select a champion, because I can't select a champion. \n\nOnce this happens, I'm thrust back into the \"Play\" screen, roles selected, and the bug still remains, covering my screen, unable to press anything, and forcing me to close the client as well, just to reload, be forced to wait 5 minutes thanks to this bug, and losing a game in my promos because that's how dodges work, apparently. \n\n\nThis is frustrating. This bug has been in the game for a LONG time, at least a year. I've had it happen several times to me, on several accounts, and on all regions that I've played on (OCE, NA, EUW, JP). I've also seen several streamers suffer from the issue, and although I rarely frequent reddit, I'm almost certain there are numerous posts about it on there, too.\n\nObviously Riot is either unwilling to fix this bug, incapable of fixing this bug due to lack of information or ability, or just more focussed on other things to fix it. Hence, I have a temporary solution to this issue.\n\nClearly, this issue FORCES a dodge. You cannot NOT dodge when you have this bug, it can occur in ranked, and it gives you a leaver buster. From my understanding, if you dodge once, you get -3lp, and if you dodge after numerous times, you get -10lp. I'm not sure how it works, since I rarely dodge. I am, however, aware that if you dodge during promos, you LOSE a game in promos. \n\nSince this happened in promos, I'm forced to just take a loss. Riot gave me a free win, then gave me a free loss, it seems. 1/1, one more game to go. My solution, then, is to STOP DODGES FROM LOSING A GAME IN PROMOS. \n\nI firmly believe that -3lp isn't a huge deal, that -10lp isn't a huge deal if you do it often enough for that to happen, and that losing an entire game (16 LP is the standard gain from my understanding, and so 3 is SIGNIFANCTLY less than an entire game) is unfair from a dodge. This solution, which can be temporary, would limit the frustration caused by this common, recurring issue that Riot's League of Legends client suffers from, until they can find a more permanent fix.\n\nJust a little extra information: This issue happened to me at around 2PM, 18th of September, 2019, while queuing for ranked with a Gold 2 account. The previous game was a victory at 91LP, gave me a free win in promos, and I was honoured once while playing Tryndamere with \"an S level gameplay\". The queue timer was approximately one minute, I was solo queuing with no other players in my party, and I queued up almost immediately after returning to my lobby, which was almost immediately after pressing \"OK\" to a \"You have entered promos\" prompt, then pressing the \"Play again\" button.\n\nUPDATE: For those who were wondering, I won my next game and ranked up! Also removed the second image I had posted as it was a duplicate.","replies":[]}
