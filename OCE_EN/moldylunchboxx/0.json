Am I viable for ban?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all, \r\n\r\nI recently played a game of League in Normals, draft pick, where I went against a 4-stack of players who were very good at the game, played clash together, and camped top HARD. \r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that their jungler clearly had scripts, and pretending that no cheating went on, the fact remains that I was hard camped by literally four players and was absolutely stomped on - and there is LITERALLY nothing I could have done. This was constant tower dives from level 1.\r\n\r\nObviously there's nothing wrong with this, other than it being an asshole move and absolutely ruining my game but, here's what I'm worried about -\r\n\r\nMy final score was 0/13/2.\r\n\r\n\r\nI've had accounts banned for inting, without inting, just for having scores like this entirely out of my control. That being said, I've never seen a normal inter get banned. \r\n\r\nMy question is: I've done nothing wrong, can I still be unfairly banned for inting? I don't want to have to go through the manual review system to have my account unbanned if any unfair ban comes up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-16T08:52:21.320+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't intentionally feed, you have nothing to worry about. False positives aren't non-existent, but they are rare, especially for gameplay punishments. When they do happen, the punishment will always be reversed.\n\nIf you have accounts you feel were wrongly banned then you should absolutely appeal those punishments through support.","replies":[]}]}
