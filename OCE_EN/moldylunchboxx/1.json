I constantly do the right thing, and play well in most of my games. However, I NEVER get rewarded for this behaviour. \n\nThis makes me quite mad, but it's whatever. No other game in history has ever rewarded players for being good or sportsmanlike, so I can look past that.\n\nWhat I CAN'T look past is being banned for telling my team to \"Stop feeding\" when they do feed, or telling my team I'm \"Not the greatest adc\", only to receive a 14-day account suspension. \n\nThis has happened CONTINUOUSLY, over my entire league life-cycle and there's literally no rhyme or reason to my bans. They're ALL unfair, none of them seem to have any justification, and I never get rewarded when I do do the right thing 99% of the time. Why is it that when I tell my team to play better, that I get punished? What about that is \"unsportsmanlike\"? Why am I banned for this when cheaters, boosters and other incredibly toxic players aren't? What about toxic players like IWD, who never get banned? \n\nI enjoy watching players like IWD because they're realistic, insightful and give out flame to teammates who deserve it, but it's constructive flame like \"Don't feed\" or passive aggressive smilies. Why is he allowed to do this and not get touched, but when I do it ONCE I get a 14-day account suspension? \n\nI just think the double-standards are dumb. I don't get rewarded for the good I do, and others don't get punished for the bad they do. Can the automated system please be fixed? I highly doubt any of these bans are actually being looked at by real people.\n\nEDIT: I'm not looking for my account to be unbanned, just that the system be looked into and fixed. There's clearly something wrong with it and I want other players to have a fair go. I'm uninstalling and quitting league for good, three unfair bans in a row is too much for me to consider this game in a good enough state to play.

Getting banned for what I'm saying just sounds more like censorship than an actual penalty, and is really genuinely unnecessary almost all of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-13T10:05:19.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's assume you have a child in primary school, and he is being bullied. The bully has never touched your child, but day in and day out is firing away with insults and harassment. This bully tells your child that they are worthless, that they are bad at everything they do and that no-one likes them or wants them in school.\n\nIs putting a stop to that behaviour censorship, or just basic human decency? \n\nWould you be telling your child to just suck it up because \"it's just words\", or would you be appalled that such behaviour is being accepted and allowed?","replies":[{"poster":"MoldyLunchBoxx","date":"2019-09-18T05:13:19.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes I would. Because that's what I was told as a kid, and that's what the vast majority of people I know were told as a kid, and we were all better for it because we grew up with thick skins and tough spines, not getting hurt at words that literally don't mean anything.\n\nRemember, words only have meaning that YOU give them. Offense is not given, it is taken, so it is not my fault that someone is hurt by the words I said, but it is in fact their fault. Further, the mute function already exists so bans make no sense when a mute from their end has literally the same effect.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-18T13:10:06.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if a bully punches you, but you can take a hit, it's fine for him to do that because you weren't seriously hurt by it? If someone tries to run you over with their car but does a shit job of it and you aren't hurt does that mean it's okay? \n\n\"It's just words\" is an exceedingly naive and short-sighted excuse, and \"This particular thing doesn't hurt *me*, therefore it's okay\" is straight-up deflection of a very real problem and a *very* slippery slope.\n\nKnowing how to defend yourself from hurt, does not suddenly entitle others to hurl whatever they hell they like at you. Neutrality is not the *accomplishment*, it is the *expectation*.\n\nMuting does not stop toxicity in the same way that plastering over your walls doesn't stop rot festering behind it. Sure you don't have to look at it for a while, but the problem is getting a whole lot worse in the background and *it will spread*. \n\nIf you have to mute someone, the damage is already done, and heaven forbid we take responsibility for our actions like the supposedly self-aware species that we are.\n\nUltimately though, whether you agree with the rules themselves or not, you agreed to follow them in order to play this *online, multiplayer, M rated* game. Fail to do so, and you lose the right to play the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
