Sadly, We&#039;re not there, but if you stopped playing serious games and switched to casual games, your team could laugh like us. Look down, back up, where are you? You&rsquo;re on the rift with the team your team could laugh like. Who&#039;s on your list, back at me. I know who, it&rsquo;s a team to queue with for those games you love.

I&rsquo;m on a {{champion:120}} .\" _**- Amari Spice**\n\n**Who is this &quot;we&quot; you speak of?**\nCurrently we are a few groups of friends who play normal / aram with people of varying skill level all of whom are extremely friendly! We play for funsies and aren&#039;t too serious with our games, occasionally we might try and throw a serious strat / game in but mostly we just want people to play what they want and try new things.\n\n**So what am I after you might say?**\nI am looking for a mature fun gaming community that is open to casual players who enjoy being social, without the high commitment levels that I see in a lot of groups. It would be great to be able to have a place (Preferably teamspeak, because we are such a chatty bunch ;D) that already has an established community of league players to introduce some people to.\n\n**But Amari, what if there are no such groups?!**\nWell in that case good sir / madam I am here to ask if there are many players that would be interested in such a group! Most posts I see in the &quot;Team Recruitment&quot; section appear to be for people wanting to play seriously or for elite clans and guilds, so I&#039;m not entirely sure how many people would want a casual group. But we could possibly set something up.\n\nIf there is enough interest who knows what might happen!\n\n**TLDR**\nLooking for a group that is:\n    &bull; Fun\n    &bull; Mature\n    &bull; Casual\n    &bull; Mics and chats","replies":[{"poster":"Amari","date":"2015-11-27T04:21:43.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so looking at responses so far I haven't seen any pre existing groups (Yet anyway I know it's only been a short while so still looking out for one!).\nI'll be having a look at making a team speak server for casual league of legends groups to come on and chat / play!\n\nWe also play a variety of other games, buuuut league of legends has always been our go to.\nI'll get teamspeak details on here once I have set up a teamspeak server though!

I watch streams of it all the time, I watch every tourney, I know each team and their members in LCS/LCK etc \n\nBut I'm almost afraid to play it. It sounds strange for me to say it because I play a lot of games with high difficulty level content in a multiplayer environment all the time.\n\nI've tried so many times but people are just really mean. The way this game has grown around the LCS etc means everyone seems to think they are the next big thing and take what should be a \"Normal\" unranked game as if it's Worlds. None of my gamer friends play it so I'm always solo.\n\nThe last time I tried giving it a go was on this account, which I have kept to try new champs so I understand them better when watching games. I was meant to stick to playing but just ended up getting to 30 playing ARAMs and then the typical worry sets in.\n\nSomething like this could make it possible for me to play a game I really love, so you should do it if enough people like it, I know it would be appreciated :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2015-11-27T02:55:46.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\nThis is exactly what I am hoping for. A pool of mature people who play casually and consistently in ranked or normals. I myself play a game or 2 each time most days but not dedicated. I have grown tried of playing in yolo solo's of which many games are a waste of time. This form of community is what I am hoping to find. Wish more people would sign up.","replies":[]}]}
