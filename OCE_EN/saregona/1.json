Obviously there was no way forwards or backwards so I had to close my game to restart. When I got back in, BAM, dodge penalty. How is that fair at all!? Worse, it was a promo game and now I&#039;ve been knocked out of promos. How did I dodge when I didn&#039;t even get to the lobby? Also your ranked queue is being very unresponsive; makes me think there is something wrong with the servers. It&#039;s not my internet, I&#039;ve done a speed test and everything is normal.\r\n\r\nFix whatever is going on with your ranked queue servers, because this is atrocious and I am really annoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2016-04-08T08:33:34.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes something is wrong with the server\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/n9F6RgnQ-client-issues-8th-apr-2016","replies":[{"poster":"Saregona","date":"2016-04-08T08:34:01.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would have been nice to know that BEFORE I queued for ranked.... :(","replies":[{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2016-04-08T08:39:17.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there's a blue '!' in the client :p","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jhineric","date":"2016-04-08T08:35:04.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening to me too but luckily I exited the queue since I experienced bugs before...","replies":[]}]}
