For a while (a few patches since I first noticed) my Headhunter Nidalee skin has been really glossy (like a full body specular map) all over, and it looks just awful. Like she's been dipped in lacquer, haha. I've been waiting for Riot to fix it, but no bueno, so I was wondering if it was just me that's having the problem; because it sure didn't look that way when I bought the skin.\n\nNotably, it's only her human form that looks this way. Her alien cougar form still looks all nice and matte. But in human form, hair, clothes, skin, everything is all shiny. She looks like plastic, and I hate it :(\n\nI will post a comparison picture when I get home, because my in game skin definitely doesn't look like what I get when I google her Headhunter skin.\n\nWas hoping in the meantime if someone could tell me if this change to the skin was intentional/documented? Because it's super ugly and needs to be fixed up!\n\nCheers,\nSaregona\n\nEDIT: I added some screens from my game (Imgur link) and a turnaround from surrender@20 from when she was first released, which is how the skin should look. Big difference!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/1Xav3IG,2JNTvsn,QP61iTT,9inZqb0#0","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-13T20:36:26.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god, I see what you mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Saregona","date":"2015-02-16T12:29:53.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhmm.

When you E someone/something the burn goes all spastic every single time and it is actually annoying because it is an easier visual for the enemy to see what is in flames/burning. I love this skin.
