Even as a janna or malphite or heimerdinger onetrick. Play Kha'zix. He stomps bronze.\n\nAlternatively, Darius works well in toplane. Azir works well in midlane. Rammus jungle works well if you need a tank and especially if the enemy team was dumb enough to pick full ad (bronze is the only elo where a 1v5 rammus pentakill becomes possible), Tristana works well in bot, and Zyra/Zilean works well in support.\n\nYou don't need to be good at these champions. You just need to be better than your opponents, and you'll be able to carry games. Most of the Intermediate Bots have a decent chance of winning lane against low bronze players, don't panic, stay calm and you'll float out of bronze in no time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-03-04T23:35:27.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo hell doesn't exist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oxygen220","date":"2018-03-04T13:02:53.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stuck in same situation :/ 6/10 placements with people going afk, admittedly another 2 games i got destroyed so bronze 4 for me, i work my way up a little but as soon as i start making progress, trolls, feeders and more afk's. \n\nits almost impossible to even improve when 50% of your games there are trolls, and the other 50% everyones flaming.","replies":[]}]}
