And when the old league client was in place, i would have the client minimised but when one of my friends messaged me, the little icon on the dock would pop up and down. I really like this so i could actually know when my friends messaged me. Recently, one of my friends messaged me on the new client and i missed it. So im just asking if you rioters can please add this feature to the new client.\r\nTHANK YOU","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-11-21T14:30:14.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, it's a notification system that Mac doesn't pick up on so they can't control it, second of all I know how to fix this.
