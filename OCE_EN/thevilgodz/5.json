Could also tie in with champion mastery quite well to make it more interactive. Champion Mastery at the moment in my opinion is not very interactive and I have rarely seen someone with a lvl 5 mastery and thought 'wow this person knows how to play this champion'. I think if you added some objectives such as 'Take a turret before 5 minutes' or 'Have less then 10 deaths on your team' for each champion would encourage individuals to actually learn the strengths of each champion and how to play them bfore earning a high level mastery rather than just playing over 30 games on them and achieving level 5 without necessarily any learning cuve involved.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-26T07:02:20.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"No ... just no.","replies":[]}]}
