His Q windup is still cancer, and kills any chance of bullying any competent player. Contrary to the hotfix, it is NOT &quot;rewarding to land.&quot; Playing {{champion:122}}  in general is no longer rewarding. If I could refund all my skins that I wasted on him, only to have him turn into this shitfest, I would. \r\n\r\nRiot, if you want to make {{champion:122}} not sub-wood division, and actually viable, just revert his changes. No one besides salty players who got killed by Darius players like what has happened to him. Keep his bloodrage passive, that&#039;s fine. But his Q,E, and W are absolutely awful. You&#039;ve taken a champion who had one of the higher win rates in the game, and made him close to, if not lower than bard. \r\n\r\nPlease. Fix. Him.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-26T10:50:59.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Darius might be a little weak right now, but you'll see in a couple of patches he's probably gonna be one of those must bans. \n\nThe key change is that he has late game scaling now, it will not be as easy to dominate early game as it used to be. You need to stop playing him like before. You farm to win now, so stop trying to land so many Q's. You're not going to win early anyway against most match-ups, so it's pointless. You'd be much better off beating the enemy in farm then getting an easy penta late game with your absurd passive.\n\nDon't like his new late game scaling? Play someone else, Fiora is looking OP right now.\n\nTL;DR\nThey'll fix him in a couple of patches, just wait for that. Just remember he's late game scaling now though, no champion (except Riven) double dips.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-01T11:49:59.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is top lane really going to turn into one of FB's farmvilles someday","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-26T14:33:37.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um bud I hate champs like {{champion:122}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:11}} ect that can just burst you at lv 3 there's no counter play to them the {{champion:75}}  is just gona split push all game and if you let him you loss the game if he is good he will have about 200 to 300 on his q by 15 min a {{champion:83}}  just gona e and w and look at that he won lane a {{champion:122}} could just q and look he won lane a {{champion:92}} is just op needs to be nerfed to the wall {{champion:82}} q is bs atm dose 1200 damage with just 200 ad champs like this are bad for the game as there bs to handle and like I sed there's no counter play with most of the champs up top they will start to dive you after lv 6 ezy and get the kill even if you have not died","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-01T11:48:03.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kite GG\n\nPretty much every top that isn't one of those five are Quinn or ADCs\n\nLet's not forget Garen and Irelia tho.
