Rengar and Fiora can both be nightmarish to deal with when they get ahead.\n\nMuch like you, they share your struggles as they play every day. It's not always as simple as these two champions are creating negative experiences and need to be fixed!\n\nIn the meantime, Rengar has the benefit of being countered via pink wards, with less focus being placed on regular wards due to their removal, generally a free item slot will now be available for a pink instead! This is the best way to counter Rengar, if you're playing a mage i'd suggest an earlier Zhonya's Hourglass\n\nFor Fiora there are many ways to play around her kit, she can't always insta kill you if you dodge the first Lunge that she makes towards you! Also her ultimate can be removed (and largely a lot of her damage) via a Quicksilver Sash!\n\nHope these two points can help with the champions you're struggling to play against.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-27T08:47:45.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol, try learning to play the game then.\n\nrengar is one of the easiest champs to kill atm\n\ni do agree fiora is hard to kill, but if you can get solid cc on her she drops like a fly\n\n\nIrelia and illaoi are the \"rito nerf plez\" champs atm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-12-29T14:33:37.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LadyLuxanna,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=c6JPgKHe,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-12-27T08:20:32.755+0000)\n> they do infinite damage \n\nExhaust/Zhonyas/GA\n\n>and have infinite healing\n\nIgnite/Morello/the AD Grevious Wounds one\n\n> its impossible to kill them and there is no way to counter\n\nSee above\n\n> you just have to sit there watching them wipe your whole team with 1 item\n\nor, instead of watching your team die, you could stop them? they are both single target champs.
