However while playing through the tutorial and doing some practice rounds against bots, I found myself screaming at the screen when my commands take 1-10 seconds to respond. I would find myself stuck being shot by a turret and spamming right click to get out of there but to no avail. Please help me with this issue ASAP becuase i really want to get back into this game but with a response time lag of a maximum 10 seconds, the game is virtually unplayable.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-03T09:08:28.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your ping?","replies":[]}]}
