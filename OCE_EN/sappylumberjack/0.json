At 3 minutes there was prompt to remake the game. A few of us tried to do /ff or /remake but nothing worked. Of  course the game was a stomp loss and I lost my lp for it. I was low so I only lost 8 but I&#039;d rather not be at risk of demotion near the end of this season. Is it possible to somehow link the game and get a refund of my 8 lp? Should this also be reported as a bug, despite not being in NA?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-05T11:00:39.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no way for LP to be added or refunded, this is primarily because of the way LP is calculated, with any manual changes resulting in far worse results for you going forward than the one time loss. Put simply it messes with the back end and would cause you more harm than good.\n\nYou should however report it as a bug through the little report a bug icon in the client. The more data Riot has on cases where remake is failing, the better chance they have of nailing down the issues and resolving them.","replies":[]}]}
