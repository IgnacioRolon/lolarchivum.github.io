NA WAS getting much more toxic but it seemed to slow down since the tribunal system. \n\nBut OCE is RIPE with toxic players it seems. I Can't go a game without a real toxic player or team when i blind pick. Ranked is a LITTLE better but still you get the occasional person who gives up then blames everyone, or the hard core Toxic player who just cusses out your team or if not your team they talk sh*t to the enemy team and still end up tilting them self or their own team...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-21T17:33:26.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait are you really going by just the people on the boards? thats ignorant and stupid.....but you happen to be right, we are the worst. we're a very liberal country so kids can run around doing whatever they want, especially on league where their parents cant see their edgy shit. we've also got the highest rate of bronze if you need a numbers statistic to back this up","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-25T06:24:14.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edge lords everywhere.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-22T00:44:27.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oce is toxic af but so are other servers.

Trolls and malcontents, being what they are, are naturally more likely to use the boards then others, so there will always be a disproportionate amount of them participating on the boards compared to how many are playing in the region.\n\nTL;DR - You might not get the same general reaction on the boards as you'd expect from in-game experience.","replies":[]}]}
