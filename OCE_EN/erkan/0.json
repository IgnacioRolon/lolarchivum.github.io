My last account was banned by riot since end of 2016. \nIn order to change i played on my new account by complimenting team members and being sportsmanlike all around.\nI reached lvl 4 honor last season and now i&#039;m getting key fragments frequently for being sportsmanlike. \nWhen i started playing ranked, i barely use all chat and most of the time communicate by pings. \nIn my latest game, when i was playing veigar i missed out on opportunities that could have ended with triple kills for me because i was caught out. Botlane ganks me and Diana mid is behind me, i&#039;m playing veigar and i have to stun 3. Two on my right and 1 on my left. My jungler Kha is next to my turret and im next to the drag bushes. Karma comes in behind and i decide to 2v1 botlane so i e and w. I&#039;m close to getting kills when i see that Karma has left me and didn&#039;t even slow them or affect them in anyway. She goes next to Kha and uses her abilities. End result 1 death and no kills for my team. Kha really helped me out, despite him getting the kills and me stunning. \n\nTo get to the point frustrated that twice Karma could have at least slowed them or done anything i call her bad in chat and she apologises. I make a joke about how i would never accept the apology of a &quot;bad&quot; player and move on.  Me and Kha as well as top laner Nasus control the right side of the map and dominate catching out mid, top and jglers one by one. They surrendre by 19 minutes and MF labels me as toxic and reports me.\nAfter game i try getting an explanation so i message the MF to which she replies &quot;i reported so riot can filter negative language out of the game&quot;\n\nSo my question to you is, are we supposed to have the club penguin chat filter on so not a single bit of reality and negativity can be in the game? Are we not allowed to judge someone from their performance without insulting and offensive behavior. Or does calling someone bad really hurt their reputation?  How else are we supposed to demonstrate the frustration we feel and the importance to discuss it so our team members can so that we get affected by the choices they make in game. \n\nBecause in reality, labeling someone as &quot;a toxic person&quot; based on one or two words we said can really damage the person too. In fact i believe judging peoples personal attributes and behavior is more damaging than talking STRICTLY about League of Legends and Performance related issues. I don&#039;t like others in game  calling others names.\n\nSorry for the amount of errors this forum has. I was in a rush.

If i went into the game and said \"we gonna win this neegahs\" and then someone decides to report, that's a false report. its a discriminating word with no context. It's not aimed at anyone and it's obviously not meant to be abusive and it's in a positive manner. Does riots report bot pick up on that? No. All it will highlight is the word %%%%%s and be like \"BAN HAMMER OF JUSTICE\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-01T00:12:23.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"A lot of people in the community don't appreciate slurs, and the fact it is now an instant escalated punishment just backs this up.

In cases like that, you get escalated through the 3 punishment tiers before the perma, giving the person plenty of warning to stop being a lowkey dick. \n\nPlayers like that get a lot of reports over a lot of games, indicating that the community doesn't want them.

In fact I think most people would definitely label that as toxic, if mundanely so. You're straight up abusing another player.\n\nOn the other hand, you were only reported, not punished. If that was all you said, it's not going to get you punished, though it may contribute as negative history  in the future.\n\n>I don't like others in game calling others names.\n\nAnd yet, you called someone bad, simply because they probably panicked and didn't play how you wanted them to. Is that fair to them?\n\nYou were dead, you had time to type. You could have said \"Karma if you'd stayed we could have killed them\" or \"I'm stronger than you think stick with me\". Instead you just said \"you're bad\". It's not productive, and instead of them thinking \"I could have done this better\", they're far more likely to think \"well this guys toxic\" and just ignore you and be frustrated themselves.\n\nEveryone gets frustrated sometimes, but 'joking' about how bad your team is isn't a healthy way to alleviate that frustration. It makes you play worse, it makes them play worse and it probably doesn't actually make you any less frustrated, so what then is the point?","replies":[]}]}
