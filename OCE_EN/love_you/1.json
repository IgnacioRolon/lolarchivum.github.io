This elo is so much different from few months ago. There are a group of people that have terrible game sense with sick &#039;mechanics&#039;, like clicking the mouse and changing face direction 10 times in 1 second. They usually pick high damage champions like vayne, viktor and such. They do not care about positioning and just always stay at front mostly, but dodge most of the skillshots and then die to something like master yi who just walk up....\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else have similar experience to this topic? Perhaps just me being unlucky zzz.....","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-10-04T11:20:02.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot hasn't given a single fk about anything since launch, as long as nerds and kids are buying skins then they will continue to give 0 fks about the problems of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-10-04T01:53:12.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's scripters in challenger you think Riot gives a shit?

Because of assholes like those idiots in the comments, you will never see anything done about scripters ever because not only does Riot not care but because of the shitty community that downvotes everything that brings up the subject.
