This means it may take a few days for the gift to show on your account. We’re asking for a bit of patience through next week as we pick up all the stragglers—if you don’t have it by 24/09, let Player Support know. Additionally, players using the alpha League client may receive the gift but not a notice—double-check your account before opening a ticket. \n\nRito Santa's got a lotta houses to deliver to but he'll get to yours eventually ; )","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Lady Loki","date":"2016-09-15T13:41:55.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same thing happened to me.
