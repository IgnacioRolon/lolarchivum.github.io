Then join the Starx Gaming Community catered specifically for people playing in AUS/NZ. I have just opened a Discord and the community is completely new. This server is a fun, friendly but competitive environment for players of all games however mainly League of Legends, CSGO and Overwatch. Whether you live in the depths of Bronze in League or Silver 1 in CSGO all the way up to the uppermost echelons of Challenger or Global Elite, there is a home for everyone here. Don&#039;t be afraid to ask for any advice from anyone, we are currently planning on having in house coaches and analysts. The dream right now is to grow this community and eventually host a competitive roster for any game. Currently there are plans to have in house games on the weekends and tourneys during the weekdays and possibly weekends. Follow the rules and feel free to stay. Together we prosper. Follow the discord link to join. Some of the first people to join may gain moderator status and be tasked in aiding a smooth start to the community.","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2016-12-28T23:53:57.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with the league community?
