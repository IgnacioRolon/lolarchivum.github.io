It&#039;s difficult to practice for rank if you can&#039;t get your two preferred positions half the time, not to mention the arguments and anger that the calling positions in chat system can cause. I think it would really help the quality of life of the game if OCE was able to choose between blind pick or draft pick. A lot of other countries do, so why not OCE? Thankyou for reading.\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone? \r\n\r\nRito pls &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-07-15T13:43:30.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We probably can't sustain teh queue.  Out of peak hours its hard enough to get a game of flex.\n\nFlex queue currently seems to serve that need for most people...I suggest you try it out if you dont already use it for something more serious, like playing with a team.\n\nWouldn't mind seeing it replace blind pick though.
