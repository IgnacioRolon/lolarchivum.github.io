I logged into my new account - very excited to see the new runes and make some pages and test them out. I then queued up and waited for a game, and got into champ select with no issues whatsoever. Picked and banned champions and the game was about to commence. \r\n\r\nAfter the pick phase however, when you are meant to see the loading screen, I only saw a black screen and a message that popped up repeatedly:\r\n\r\nError: Failed to connect\r\n&quot;Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.&quot;\r\n\r\nI would just like to know why this is happening... My internet is fine normally. Is it because the PBE servers are in North America, and because I am in Australia? If this is the reason, does that mean I will never be able to play on PBE?\r\n\r\n~Thanks and sorry if this is on the wrong board... (didn&#039;t know where to put it)\r\n\r\n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}}  For the kill every time...","replies":[{"poster":"I fuk sluzzas","date":"2017-10-23T06:49:30.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm always getting 250 ping from australia on PBE honeslty they need to fix that issue otherwise why is there any point in playing on PBE in Australia with no oce server for it.\nI can't move, constant disonnect constant drop outs always my internet is good because I get 18 MS on the normal OCE server so its PBE and not my internet. if anyone knows a fix please let me know! {{champion:429}}\n\nThis was in a normal game aswell guys not the practice tool or bots!","replies":[{"poster":"elicz1","date":"2017-10-26T05:06:29.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't want to make a PBE server outside of the one they already have... \n\nThe 250 ping is a result of you being in Australia, and the server being hosted in America (mind you though, Australia's poor internet standards are partly to blame for this).\n\nYou get 18 ping on the OCE servers because they are hosted in Brisbane (I think). I get about 38 ping normally on OCE servers and I get about 300 ping when I'm playing on PBE.\n\nIt is sad, but Rito have not announced plans to put a second PBE server up anywhere... Also I doubt the first region they would choose to put a second PBE server would be in OCE if they happened to decide to make a new PBE server.\n\nCri, we can only hope.\n\nOn the bright side though... PBE works at least and you can try out the new runes and see the changes earlier :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"elicz1","date":"2017-10-22T23:18:43.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: It is working now...
