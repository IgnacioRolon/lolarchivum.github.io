It is frustrating for everyone.\n\nDon&#039;t get me wrong, I do not accept it when people leave just because &quot;Bad JG never gank&quot;, or they die to their enemy laner and get tilted because of it.\nHowever when people &quot;go&quot; AFK (I&#039;ll explain that now) - by this I mean their internet just turns off suddenly, or their power goes out (something along those lines), and they get punished for it? That I think most people would find to be unfair.\n\nAs someone who has personally experienced this, I find it really frustrating when my internet is playing up, and as a result of trying to reconnect for 10 - 15 minutes, then coming back to my team still holding out - then we win the game, to receive a D - and on top of that to lose LP in a ranked game? \n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}} \n\nMy friends are often having to deal with this too. For example, recently one of them has received 20 minutes low priority queue bans because his internet cut out unexpectedly after spiking to over 3000 ms. I think there could be a way to solve this issue.\n\nMy idea would be to have some sort of detection system put in place that would track a players ping or internet connection via the league client, in order to detect if a disconnect was intentional or out of the players control. I have no idea whatsoever if this is even doable or viable (I have no coding or computing experience), but I know for sure if something like this was implemented it would save a lot of people a lot of time (particularly in OCE where our internet is notoriously complete and utter trash). \n\nAnother detection system that I think could be implemented to combat unfair punishment would be a score tracker. By this I mean, if I was 5/0/2 as Ekko mid lane at 10 minutes, I would have no reason to disconnect from the game. On the other hand if I was Riven top and 0/4/1 at 10 minutes into the game and disconnected... yeah I think you get the point. My other idea was for a score detection to be implemented to correlate bad scores to people leaving due to tilt and anger, while people having a good score to a possibility of a network outage.\n\nMy own thoughts on the second idea are that:\n- I think it would be a lot harder to balance\n- I could go AFK even 5/0/2 as Ekko mid for many other reasons, not just because my net cut (maybe someone on my team was flaming me and I was sick of it, I don&#039;t really know xD)\n- It seems in theory to be far less reliable that doing it by ping\n\nAnyway this is pretty lengthy, but I hope that others can see where I am coming from - and maybe this could actually help some people. I have no idea if it has been attempted or thought of before.\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} \n\nAlways {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}} for the kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-12-23T14:07:03.518+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't tell you how many times the first concept has been suggested (the number is ridiculously high, no doubt). Thing is, it falls apart because of one very simple reason: players can fake a faulty connection. They could simply interrupt their internet connection (for example, downloading a bunch of stuff at the same time, or simply turning of their modem/router/whatever). There's simply no way for Riot to accurately track intentional vs non-intentional DCs.\n\nAs for the second concept (and you said it yourself), there are a lot of reason players might intentionally leave outside of having a bad score. It seems a wholly terrible (and abuse-able) idea.\n\nI'm going with a very firm \"no\" on both concepts.","replies":[{"poster":"elicz1","date":"2017-12-24T05:06:16.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I see what you mean, I didn't really think about the fact that people could fake it.\n\nI just find it really unfair when people get punished for something that they didn't do and couldn't control.\n\nI guess it's just nice in theory, but people always abuse systems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T22:06:00.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather they loosen the punishment triggers to be honest - the system right now smashes people irrespective of context and ties up riot's resources trying to resolve. why not just have a lower expectation and free up resources for actual work.","replies":[]}]}
