I&#039;ve been stuck in bronze 5 for months now and i cant get out. I carry my team to promos. Then when i get to promos everyone feeds but me. I&#039;m not the only one stuck in this situation and its very frustrating. I know you give the players a free win but its still not enough. In Bronze five i&#039;m lucky to get a win because of idiots i have to play with.

Free rank up is a crap idea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-04-05T03:22:24.620+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate you probably joined ranked to early if you got put in bronze 4 as i did.

I like shyvana because her mid game is really scary. If you get sated devourer + titanic + swifties by 20 minutes its pretty much gg. The problem with shyvana is you hardly gank pre-6 and even at 6 you only want to gank if it seems like a 90% kill rate and a 1% chance of you dying. If you try to gank and fail too much you wont be able to get titanic and you wont be sated, then when the enemy is seiging you wont be able to farm as much or you end up losing inhibs...\n\nCourse if you manage to get kills AND farm the jungle lots, the game becomes a curb stomp.\n\n\nI also main akali mid, i like her she just sticks to people like super glue (especially once you get gunblade + rylais) and the way i built her she has just as much sustain as vladimir early game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-04-05T03:58:03.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't tell if trolling or actually serious.\nIn case you're serious though, if you're able to consistently do better than your teammates, you will eventually climb. Being as good as your enemy or teammates isn't good enough if you wanna climb, you have to prove yourself to be good enough that you can carry them despite them doing badly etc.\nOne of the most common issues with pele in lower elo is that they think they're playing well and aren't making mistakes themselves, letting them only see other players' mistakes. If you're think you deserve to be placed higher, you need to win not only your lane consistently but also carry other lanes, at least most of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-05T02:43:57.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you want to get out of bronze, play carry champ, not support","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-04T23:06:11.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Introduce wood division?","replies":[{"poster":"Manly1","date":"2016-04-04T23:48:21.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wood division?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-05T02:29:12.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Manly1,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ZXxlpJAx,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-04-04T23:48:21.146+0000)\n>\n> wood division?\n\nWorse than bronze level.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-04-05T02:27:04.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you truly think you're playing at a higher standard than your rank, you could always attempt to find several other players you synergise well with and rank with them.\nThe only real advice for team incompetence is to remove them from the equation.\n\nThe beauty of Dynamic queue isn't people getting boosted, it's people getting out of ELO hell because they can finally coordinate with a team and play to their full mechanical skill level, ~~without the monkey wrench wildcard's you get in SoloQ who are in Bronze V for a reason~~.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-04-05T02:19:19.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you truly shouldn't be in Bronze 5, you would've been placed higher after your ten games at the start of the season.\nOtherwise, main Jungle and make sure your mid and bot are fed, not feeding.","replies":[]}]}
