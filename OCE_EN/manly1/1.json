The new Improved client is so slow i cant even ban/pick a champion in champ select due to the client having so many bugs. Im losing IP every time i get kicked from champselect and its utter bullshit&#039;along with being forced to wait 30 mins for the next que. Fix your fucking client riot u gay mother fuckers. Bring the legacy client back for fuck sake, that client was good af, dont force this gutter shit into your players. You made a great game just stop tying to over complicate everything. Just fix the quality of the client Ive redownloaded it and it hasnt changed anything just please fix it u stupid mother fuckers. And while ur at it fire the %%%% who decided to make a champion gain +100 ad at level 1 after 5 FUCKING AUTO ATTACKS.

So if I can run League fine on a computer older than the game itself then, no offense, but your computer must be REALLY bad. \n\nOkay, now this is the part of the comment where I stop being sarcastic and become somewhat useful. Somewhere In your clients settings (which you can access by the little cog in the top right corner of the screen) you can choose to run the client on a low specs mode. I'm not quite sure where it is, but there is probably a yt video on it. Once you have turned on this low specs mode the client **should** run smoother and hopefully you will run into less of these bugs losing you LP.\n\nJust wondering, which champion are you talking about? I have literally no idea, because I don't know any champions who can do that.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-20T04:55:59.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miicka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=uO3MEHYe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-04-20T01:07:21.902+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;m pretty sure the required minimum specs for your PC to play this game are:\n> - It not be a potato\n\nMy comp is bad but it's still good enough to muscle constant 60fps from League in-game when on low-spec mode and running low-end graphics settings.\n\nThere is a trouble though, it constantly drops to 20 or so in teamfights.\n\nThis one clearly is an optimisation problem, probably due to the fact this client is new.\n\nWhile not in OP's words, \"terrible\", but if anything, Riot should address this one I just mentioned imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-20T05:25:46.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DO you have your client set to close while in game?

Mine was not ticked (it's on by default after going low spec mode, I cancelled it thinking it doesn't make any difference, well I was wrong), so I eventually got it back on. But unfortunately while it helps, it doesn't do it by much.\n\nI'd played around and realised that I now have to disable shadow entirely and set all graphics to low, which seems to have significantly reduced the fps drop problem, it's now 60fps normally and in intense fights it may drop to about mid 40s in the lowest which is acceptable I suppose.\n\nI guess that's the graphics options I'll be playing on in the foreseeable future. Gotta be patient with me low spec.\n\nBut hey, at least on the plus side, they seem to have improved the speed in which the splash client reopens after match marginally (for people whose \"close client during game\" is ticked). It used to take like a minute to load post-game chat if your client closes during game, which was beyond frustrating, now it only takes about 10-15 seconds. I am not sure what's actually happened there, but that's really nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-20T12:47:28.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm yeah.
