I can play mid or AD, can also play jungle but prefer the other two roles. I just got back from holidays and will be playing a hell of a lot of solo (maybe duo) queue to improve myself as a player all round. I'm not going to sit here and say I'm better than my rank, because I'm not, but I'm going to try my best to be. \n\nIf you're interested in trialing me, add me in game and we can talk. I have skype and teamspeak and can download any other VOIP required. Thanks!\n\nIGN: lKakao (Yes, that's an L.)","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2014-12-06T04:20:23.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ign: proxinzhaoplayer\nAge:16\nRoles pefer anything but jungle\nRank: silver 4 \nMessage me through here\n On this forum\nThank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-04T04:09:37.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ME!","replies":[]}]}
