(I understand that picking one different champion may change the gameplay completely but hear me out)\r\n\r\ne.g. Middle Lane match up - Syndra, Vladmir, Aurelion Sol, Ryze\r\nTop Lane - Jayce, Kennen, Rumble\r\nJungle - Nidalee, Elise, Olaf\r\nAD - Caitlyn, Lucian, Jhin\r\nSupport - Karma, Zyra, Alistar\r\n\r\nI have listed 16 champs (may have missed a few other popular ones this worlds) but using a handful of champions because they are the most &quot;winnable&quot; during this patch or in meta is just completely lame and boring. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know about you guys, I am just sick of the team using the same champs over and over (depending on the flavor of the month). After watching a few games, I just simply loose interest. When was the last time you saw some weird and funky champs being picked? Every time during champ select you would hear people roar in excitement from purely hovering over a Teemo.\r\n\r\nLeague of legends is full of amazing champs why restrict the world championships to just a handful of champs depending on the patch notes?\r\n\r\nOne suggestion is to &quot;global ban&quot; out the week to week or match to match the top 1/2 champs picked and banned in each role. This would force the format to be more diverse and more entertaining - Who wouldn&#039;t want their favorite champion to be played to perfection on the world stage?\r\n\r\nBy all things, this is just a suggestion working towards a world championship where more champions are played. \r\n\r\nI am just a mere spectator, but I would like to be entertained.","replies":[{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-10-18T02:30:41.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see each player only allowed to use each champion once, with the exception of games 3,4 and 5 of the grand final. When do you use your strong champs? What if you have to play Quinn adc? These are questions I want to have answers for.","replies":[]}]}
