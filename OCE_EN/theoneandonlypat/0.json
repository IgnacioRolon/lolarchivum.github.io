Recently, however, I restored my settings (in-game) to default without realizing what it would do before it was too late. Now, I have tried to change it back, but it just will not work in game, even though I am sure i have put the coding (right word?) in correctly. I have even deleted my input.ini folder and let the game make a new one, but that has not worked either.\r\nI need some help fixing it, as it is making it harder to kite and play ranged champion effectively.\r\nThanks you.","replies":[{"poster":"Unforgiiven","date":"2015-10-19T08:12:35.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly don't know what the problem with this is... if it helps here is my configured left mouse button attack move **input.ini** file:\n\n[Quickbinds]\nevtUseItem4smart=1\nevtCastAvatarSpell2smart=1\nevtCastAvatarSpell1smart=1\nevtCastSpell1smart=1\nevtCastSpell4smart=1\nevtCastSpell3smart=1\nevtUseItem5smart=1\nevtUseVisionItemsmart=0\nevtCastSpell2smart=1\nevtUseItem6smart=1\nevtUseItem1smart=1\nevtUseItem3smart=1\nevtUseItem2smart=1\n\n[GameEvents]\nevtOpenShop=[h]\nevtPlayerHoldPosition=[<Unbound>]\nevtNormalCastSpell1=[a]\nevtCameraLockToggle=[Space]\nevtCameraSnap=[<Unbound>]\nevntPlayerPingCursor=[t]\nevtPlayerAttackMove=[<Unbound>]  \nevtPlayerAttackMoveClick=[Button 1]  \nevtPlayerSelectClick = [Button 3]   \nevtOnUIMouse4Pan=[<Unbound>]  \n\n[MouseSettings]  \nRollerButtonSpeed = 0  \n\n[HUDEvents]   \nevtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 1], [Button 3]   \nevtOnUIMouse2 = [Button 2]   \nevntHudMoveableSelect = [Button 3]  \n\n\nI honestly have no problems with this setup and kiting is like a dream.
