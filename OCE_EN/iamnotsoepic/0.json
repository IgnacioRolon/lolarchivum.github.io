However, I find it increasingly frustrating as I wait out a complete 20 minutes before a game, only for a player to decline ready check. When another player declines ready check, it freezes my client on the &quot;Waiting for Players&quot;, rendering me incapable of accepting the next ready check (which i cannot see).\r\n\r\nI suggest that Riot implement a system (if possible), where you only have to wait the extended queue 5 times, and it does not matter if you decline, or miss the ready check. There have been too many times where I (and many others i know) have been forced to wait in an endless loop due to the client&#039;s inability to close the disbanded ready check pop-up fast enough. Please, could Riot implement a system where they acknowledge how many times you have actually waited in the extended queue.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like to say that I dont want to be pardoned for my AFK behaviour, I want Riot to fix either the speed at which the ready check pop up goes down after someone declines or make it so you only have to wait the queue 5 times even if you dont accept or decline ready check. I would like to say that nobody &quot;Doesnt press the accept ready check&quot; in order to dodge.\r\n\r\nDodging in Champ Select is a different story\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-12-22T01:23:03.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trouble is, riot's attitude towards punishments is that they shouldn't be simple to deal with. It seems like they try to make punishments as unbearable as possible in order for the player to understand that what they did was wrong, and that they need to reform from their negative behaviour. Unfortunately for people like you, this means that the punishments are unnecessarily harsh. Leaving because the pizza delivery guy showed up 15 minutes into your game is inexcusable, unless you return, whereas leaving to rush your wife to hospital because she's just gone into labor is perfectly reasonable. A more suitable approach may be the ability for players to provide their reason of leaving. If it can be backed up by another member of your team from the game you left, and is a valid reason for leaving without return, then the lpq should be revoked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-17T09:39:55.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I partially agree with this suggestion.\n\nIf it's another player who declines or ignores the ready check, definitely count the queue as one of the waits (or better yet just put the player straight back into queue, which doesn't currently happen if I'm not mistaken). If it's the player themselves that declines the ready check, I'd say that's more debatable but I'm willing to accept that as a count on the queues, since they've acknowledged and responded to the ready check.\n\n*However*, if the player was to ignore the ready check then they shouldn't have that queue taken off their count. If someone's going to ignore the client while they're queued, they're creating a more negative experience for other players through their own negligence, which (in my opinion) is simply unacceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-17T16:44:40.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the best of my knowledge, so long as the player with the LPQ nor anyone in their premade does not miss/decline the queue they will get dropped straight back into queue as anyone else does. Only actions that require an actual requeue (missing/declining the afk check or a remake) will require the player to wait another x minutes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-17T16:32:34.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If it's another player who declines or ignores the ready check, definitely count the queue as one of the waits  (or better yet just put the player straight back into queue, which doesn't currently happen if I'm not mistaken)\n\nspot on, dropping them back into queue would be the better solution. Only time it should count towards their games for lpq is if its a /remake, or someone dodges in champ select as opposed to just doesnt accept the game request.  \n\n> I personally have a 20 minute queue before every game, and that is understandable because i have left a couple of games (i miscalculated the time i have available).\n\nI didnt address this on the other reply i made, but the fact is youre leaving your team 4 vs 5, and i get that youre not wanting to be excused for afking (very understanding of you), but im pretty sure the official stance will just be something like \"Dont afk, dont get 20 min timers at all. #winning\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-17T08:32:02.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, Your apology was totally not necessary, Your post wasnt actually that negative :) So take it easy. Secondly, im all for your idea, That as long as it was noone in your party that didnt accept the ready check, that people not accepting still count towards lpq games, i think thats a pretty solid idea. Ive had the same issue as you, so i feel where you're coming from. Thirdly, a question of my own, if someone not in your group dodges in chamkp select, does THAT count? because i feel that should as well. Anyway, solid idea. However, realistically i doubt Riot are going to care enough to actually do anything about it. Their response towards many legitimate ideas is one of \"We would rather spent our resources towards improving the game for a majority of the playerbase instead of a minority. So in all honesty, I wouldnt fret too much about it, your suggestion is pretty good, but working out viability from a \"is this worthwhile\" perspective means its probably never going to go anywhere. :) Keep up the good work with ideas though, keep em rolling","replies":[]}]}
