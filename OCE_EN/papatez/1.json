Then they go and not only nerf the gold {{item:3303}} can get by making it only hit every 1.25 secs/proc (only person it does not affect is {{champion:63}} as his dot lasts 4 seconds (do they want {{champion:17}}  sups back, because this is how you do it)), they wanted bot lane to be more dynamic and earn more gold all they did for casters bot was made us **OOM and POORER** than before and make us collect coins (its not mario kart)\r\n\r\nI used to be highly active with my {{item:3303}} making sure it was never on 3 stacks, now i cant seem to get it off 3 stacks. there is no bonus for dropping a spell to hit both your enemies. I think why they did it because they could not work out how to make the bonus speed proc only once (didn&#039;t want people running around at +100% ms or 150%ms (so make it the MS can only proc once)) so made this band aid mess (which is pathetic as they did the opposite of what they said they were trying to do)\r\n\r\nWith {{item:3303}} i could keep on par with a average to high cs adc, now im 2-3k less\r\n\r\nHere is an idea, make {{item:3098}} tribute come in at 850g or something of the like, but please rethink your 1.25sec proc (you not only NERFED almost every single caster sup when you where trying to buff them :/ but you also made us oom ( we either conserve our mana which in turn makes us poor or we use it and are useless when an engagement happens)","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-05-09T05:40:05.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was wondering why I wasn't proccing it instantly with Morg's W.
