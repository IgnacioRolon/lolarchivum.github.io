Actually too be fair his Mana isn&#039;t too bad if you grab blue off the bat which most usually would and it helps for the come back. BUT his health loss is way too risky early game. If you have someone gank you jungle by the time you hit red buff you are basically one shot. That is even after pumping two pots back.\n\nI know before he had a high ban rate and his capability to steal low elo early game was too good. But right now his early game is way too nerfed. You basically have to back too. If you don&#039;t back and try to gank with such low life you are basically one ability or a couple basic hits from death. Its super risky.\n\n(Any thought from anyone and not just troll comments from people who just don't like him and are glad this happened also I am low elo so I wouldn't have a clue as someone truly experienced would. Maybe a suggestion on item change?)","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-17T17:19:29.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to LOL where balance team is bronze/Silver and can't play against Ivern so they nerf him, just like other early champs like{{champion:35}} i am still waiting for RIOT to nerm him 20 times more in this year lol","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-17T22:39:16.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern wasn't a problem at all in bronze/silver, many players can easily punish him with popular picks like Lee and Kha.\nIt seemed to be in higher elo games where he was out of control, _(note how the pros in MSI were pick/banning him frequently.)_ \n\nSo if anything, the balance team were disadvantaging bronze/silver Ivern players, in favour for balance at higher elo.\n\n______\n\nIn any case, you sound like you think it would be better not to nerf him! \nSo I ask you, what is your solution to his near 60% win rate. WITHOUT nerfing him?\n\nas a lvl 7 Ivern player, I'm curious.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-18T05:09:23.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't mind nerfing him, but his play style is unique i love vs ivern jg tbh, if they really wanted to nerf him they should focus his E Shield and he should not be able to give shield to Daisy or slow effect after e got burst out. Also i do not agree with your part Ivern wasn't a problem at all in bronze/silver\n\n\nI play on my smurf and its very easy to TILT enemy jg and made him rage quit most of the games. I do agree in Pros they ban him bcoz their scale is totally different and their play style, i don't want to comment on  their style as  idk much about ivern, but they know how to abuse that champ and as you are lvl7 Ivern i am pretty sure how you can abuse him much more compare to me or others who are new with this champ, i just said it in general as i played quiet few games and i notice, enemy team says report my jg afk bcoz he is crying as i am taking his buff and ganking more than him and he can't level up, my jg don't gank \"that's how it goes in bronze\"\n\nNow if his early game is that weak, his pressure as a jg is less\n\nJg like graves Hec Zac Noct and kha can be good as hell  in early game even they got nerf , but this nerf of Ivern making a champ hard. I  Mainy play shaco i know what they did to this champ and i feel bad and its hard in every game to build him. So i just dont want them to ruin other champ as they might get forgotten or people stop playing such champion. I hope you are understanding what i am trying to say here","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"batdan 1","date":"2017-05-17T16:49:14.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should I maybe switch to start Machete instead of talisman?","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-17T17:19:56.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nop, it doesn't help him","replies":[]}]}]}
