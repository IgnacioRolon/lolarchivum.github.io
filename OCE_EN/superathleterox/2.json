I myself posted a thread on this, but I found a solution and there was no longer a problem. \nI've already posted the solution on this page, and it should honestly work because he uses a Mac 10.10 \n\nThere was someone on my thread who had the same laptop and problem as me, I sent him the solution, and after five days of being unable to play LoL he said it was open and patching (he was just too lazy to try it before).
