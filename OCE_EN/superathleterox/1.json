And, therefore, the leaver buster kicked in. I understand that, I am willing to put up with the punishment, having to wait for 10 minutes is fine. \r\nSo, I've been meaning to play for a while, and I have queued with friends over and over. We wait 10 minutes, but every time the timer reaches 0, despite no one leaving queue or anything, the timer begins yet again. It occurs over and over. Not only this, but our timers do not match up. While my friends are on 5 minutes left, I have 8 minutes left!\r\nIt is so frustrating, please help me :(\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance\r\nSuperAthleteRox (OCE)\r\n{{champion:429}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-28T02:12:20.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The leavebuster system currently has known bugs in it which match exactly what you've described.
