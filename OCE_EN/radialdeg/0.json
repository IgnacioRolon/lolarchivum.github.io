To answer your question, there is no way to check when your account was created, short of some quality detective work or a search of your emails for the registration email. With regard to the date of birth associated to your account, there's no way to retrieve this information either. The reason why you won't get any of this information from any Riot services is because this information is part of the account recovery process. By making this information easier to obtain on Riot's end, it makes it harder to distinguish account creators from hackers, etc. Hopefully that answers your question!","replies":[]}]}
