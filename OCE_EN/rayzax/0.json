You tend to have to sink to around Division 4 (very rarely low division 3) of the tier below before you even have a chance of being demoted. I think the threshold depends on the tier you're at (since it's dependent more on hidden MMR than it is divisions in general, as you noted in your post) but this should serve as a rough guide.\n\nEither way, don't worry about demotions. If you get demoted, it's a \"good\" thing. Rather than be stuck at 0 LP you can experience progression as you climb again. You end up wherever you belong.","replies":[{"poster":"Rayzax","date":"2015-06-17T16:51:40.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been sitting at platinum 5 0 LP and out of my last 15 matches i've won maybe 4, I'd expect to be soon if it keeps up, I'll answer my own question when it happens though :P","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-06-18T04:09:06.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't worry too much. Think of it this way, those 4 wins cancel out 4 of the losses, so you're actually only 7 losses down. You'll probably have to be down by twice as much before you get demoted (and keep in mind that the lower you sink the easier the games will get). Just focus on improvement and you probably won't get demoted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-16T17:39:05.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Usually 4-5 games after 0 LP.
