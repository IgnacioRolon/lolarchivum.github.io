But it has one very major problem. I know there are some people out there who don't even care about this, but even if you are one of them please think about everyone else and vote for this to become a feature. Some people hate it when they get raged at. There are all kinds of people who ruin the game for you, like \"You suck\" or \"I'm the best and you guys are way worse than me\" and all the constant abuse you can get from your teammates which can really ruin the game. Because lol is a skill based game you get the \"You suck\" message in various and more insulting ways. To fix this I think it would be a good idea to, like many other mmos, add canned chat. If you don't like the idea read the last section first\n\n**Canned chat**\nIn other words, when you go to the chat you can toggle it between canned and normal. This means that if you're on canned chat then you can only select from a pre-made list of sentences with a little change - For example, you select \"Go mid\" and then you also have a list of your teammates and you add the jungler to the \"Go mid\" sentence so that it becomes \"Go mid warwick\". The people who were using canned chat mode can't see what people not using it are saying unless they type in canned chat and the people who are using normal chat CAN see what the canned chat people are saying. In my opinion this would fix all the abuse problems in the game, becuase if they want to, you can just go onto canned chat where you can't abuse or be abused and still communicate with your teammates\n\n**Some other reasons why I think we need this**\nI know that the mute button is a feature, and if you don't want to get raged at then you can mute all the ragers but this isn't nice because you still want to communicate with them. For example - \"You are the worst support OCE\" will probably make the support feel a little sad. But the support might not want to mute them because he still needs to hear the \"Heal me\" or \"Push to tower\" messages. The other main reason why we need this is because even if you mute them they've still had the chance to say at least one mean and hurtful thing to you and that still hurts knowing that they hate you or think you suck. You can mute them, yes, but you have still been raged at and insulted once and that can ruin the rest of the game. Some people may think though, that canned chat will cause a problem because people will spam it. As Breawein said, \"People can spam pings to a point but do we remove them? No\" I think there should be a cap on canned chat just like pings. For example: If you starting sending messages to fast then it will temporarily block you just like pings. This wouldn't be a problem if you weren't spamming because you're not going to need to send that many messages that quickly.\n\n**If you don't think we need canned chat**\nEven if you don't think we need canned chat then please vote for canned chat to become an option. You could still use the normal chat, because I am suggesting the option to use normal or canned chat and then have another option to turn off hearing normal chat. This means that some people won't hear you rage at them but will hear you communicate with them if you use canned chat. You could still talk with them and still talk with other people using the normal chat. So please vote for this for all the other people who hate getting abused and would love this feature\n\n**Message to riot**\nIf a riot person reads this then please consider this and maybe try it out on PBE first to see if it works but please don't just dismiss it off hand because I think this would be a change for the better for the players the don't like being raged at (most players) and would barely effect the players who don't mind, they could just use normal chat","replies":[{"poster":"Raxxxis","date":"2015-01-18T17:10:30.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

I think it would be helpful to those who don't have map awareness enough to pay attention to pings and can't handle the occasional toxicity of team chat.\n Myself, however would probably continue my pattern of getting into a game, muting everyone and just using pings for communication.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zogoras","date":"2015-01-21T10:32:33.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually dislike this idea, as people who use canned chat cannot see normally typed messages then someone who prefers to type instructions will have their directions ignored which may lead to confusion and undoubtedly miscommunication. Yes the person could use canned chat but if they are unfamiliar with it it'll take longer than typing a message upon which the time of their engage or whatever it is may be too late.\n\nAnother part is the messages themselves will likely be incredibly simple and so it'll be quite difficult to convey certain ideas like after ganking a lane looping around to regank. Although I suppose they can just ping the path to take to regank so it mightn't prove as much of a problem in conjunction of pings.\n\nTo make this work I think the canned chat has to be a different colour so people will realise it is canned chat and that they cannot see their messages or turn a players name colour different so its immediately obvious however I think this is quite a large undertaking and unless you can choose certain ones out of a list the entire list of things to say can stretch indefinitely.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T11:12:50.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about, normal players can see everything in canned chat, and players just have the option to turn off normal chat?\n\nBut then again, people might get mad at when their team-mates aren't responding at all to their typed out messages.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T11:11:35.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a great idea, though I'd like to have the option of just disabling chat altogether. :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirKotton","date":"2015-01-17T17:54:08.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think this thread is a good idea please upvote it so that we can get riot attention","replies":[]}]}
