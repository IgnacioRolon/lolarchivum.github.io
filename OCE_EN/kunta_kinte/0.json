Which when they changed first win of the day to not give as much xp and give 50 blue essence, not a bad idea but 50 blue essence in comparison to an extra 100 xp or so is so much. You need to change the system to give out more, because the only real way to gain blue essence is to level up and the first win doesnt  help as much as it used to, i'd rather the xp then the blue essence or atleast add more blue essence to make it worth while. Does anyone else agree?","replies":[{"poster":"Davedavison","date":"2017-12-29T16:21:13.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have all champions unlocked, i am trying to unlock skins as I go ( mostly from skin shards) I also have all available ward skins, so other than rune pages ( no longer really needed) and mystery icons what is blue essence good or useable for/on. I would really like the option to exchange BE for orange essence or xp, and or be able to purchase mystery champion and skin shards with blue essence, so I have something to unlock as I play regardless of level, ect.\n\nP.S.\nI also mostly/only play aram love it because no one fussed over what role and lane and focus on game improving and trying different Champs but dont get same level or champion xp as summoner rift and would like a extra bonus as can longer make it up with skin boost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-12-03T04:49:28.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the fact that Riot does not give us enough Blue Essence at the moment, not all capsules contain extra Blue Essence.\nAt the moment there is a project mission going on, but it only grants 20 Blue Essence per token, it is not very much.\nHopefully Riot will give us other missions that will give us straight up Blue Essence if we complete them, maybe let some missions that gives us tokens if we complete them, and we can use the token to redeem for Blue Essence, and 50-100 Blue Essence per token would be good.\n\nThe Missions icon is more important than it was before.\nIf Riot can give us Blue Essence in First Win of the Day, there's no reason that they shouldn't be providing us with other missions to earn Blue Essence.","replies":[]}]}
