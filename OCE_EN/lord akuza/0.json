As has been mentioned it could be worth it to have seperate pages for ADCs and AD Casters.\n- **AP** Used for any Ability Power biased damage champions, \"APCs\" (Usually Mages and Assassins).\n- **Hybrid Damage** Used for any damage champion which has some balance between AD and AP (Ezreal and Corki are good examples, though I don't play them).\n- **AD Bruiser** Used for any tanky damage dealer biased to Attack Damage (Usually Fighters).\n- **AP Bruiser** Used for any tanky damage dealer biased to Ability Power (Usually Tanks such as Maokai or Mages such as Ryze).\n- **Hybrid Bruiser** Used for tanky damage dealers which have some balance between AD and AP. For somewhat obvious reasons I rarely use this.\n- **Tank** Used for champions that are best as tanks (Champs like Sion or Garen).\n- **Jungle** Bit obvious, used for jungling. Really this one goes un-used since I tend to avoid jungling when I play on SR and, as a result, I only have one for AD.\n- **Utility** Generally used for supports or support champs. I actually have two versions, one for mana users and one for champs without mana.\n\nHope this will help.

Varus is also played there as well, who regularly goes an AD caster style builder and pokes with his long range Q. \n\nThat said, if the rest of your team is comfortable with it, there's no problem changing up what is generally played in the meta. \nOne of my favourite botlanes that I've seen lately is Cho'Gath/Blitzcrank - it's a pretty amazing lockdown and burst at level 6, as long as you have some good lategame scaling in your other lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Akuza","date":"2015-03-05T04:48:17.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers :)\n\nToo anyone else, can you think of any other champion types I'm missing in my mysteries?\n(some pages have no points, those are just titles to help me the noob find them faster)\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/3821761#masteries\n\nThanks","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dwaboutit","date":"2015-03-06T02:39:18.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a separate one for every champ I own","replies":[]}]}
