Can you explain me the opposite if my theory isnt true ? I know about mystery champion but it&#039;s also with be.Also i know about honor capsules after level up but i also need be for unlock them for perma.I thought i&#039;ll be able to unlock champs faster but it&#039;s way too much slower and tbh it&#039;s almost impossible for free to play players like me.I liked lol because riot was a good company that doing their best for their players but now i have doubts about riot wants to turn into game a pay to win game.I dont know any other way to get blue essences or champs except those things i said.It&#039;s really too hard to unlock champs or mastery for champs and i feel like none of riot staff will answer this topic.And please say if you think riot made the game pay to win and riot is forcing us to buy champs with rp if you agree with me.Thank you ","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-12T03:34:46.570+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot kept defending themselves with the fake \"maths\" where they made the assumption that players play only a couple of games per day.\nTake this example: yesterday I won a 15min aram game, yielding me 100xp.  It takes around 25 aram wins for me to level up at my current level.  The average BE you get per level up is 910 BE, according to a Riot post I read before.  With the old system, I get around 60IP for a typical aram win, and after 25 games that is 1500 IP.  Even at the milestone when you get some extra 1000 BE that still wouldn't compensate the 600 less BE/IP per level.Simple maths.  \nThe \"players play only a couple of games per day\" assumption is punishing players who play a tonne of games a day which do not benefit much from the stronger first win boost.  These players do exist and is a part of the player base, yet it seems like Riot wouldn't accept this fact.\nThe other assumption Riot made was that \"players are all trying to get all champs available\", which is again very not true.  Under this assumption, the discount from champ shards are also taken into consideration when calculating the speed you earn BE/IP with the new system, making their fake \"maths\" seem legit.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackMan KFC","date":"2017-11-13T00:46:08.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"average BE is 600? wtf is that true? is that what riot has said? i got less than 100 BE when i leveled up, twice in a row and nothing else came with it.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-13T07:34:50.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlackMan KFC,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AsvUP9oQ,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-11-13T00:46:08.525+0000)\n>\n> average BE is 600? wtf is that true? is that what riot has said? i got less than 100 BE when i leveled up, twice in a row and nothing else came with it.\n\nAverage BE per level beyond lv30 is 910 according to a Riot reply I read before(https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/KsZvsY4T-revert-be-to-ip?show=flat&comment=000a00000001 the third out of five replies) more or less fits what I got for lv31-34.  Interesting enough, even in that comment Riot cannot make the maths support their claim that you earn more currency than before: in his statistics you would earn 1456 BE comparing with 1537 IP.  My example above shows even larger punishment of dedicated players because I'm using aram examples, which got disastrously affected by the reduced XP/min efficiency for short games.  \nWhat I want to say is by this simple real life example I get 600 less currency per 25 aram wins without considering first win and without considering the larger gaps between higher levels.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-12T05:05:49.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yep if your not a casual, you can open up your wallet and give rito the money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rito POS Client","date":"2017-11-13T02:56:14.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue isn't merging IP and BE (Works out to be better anyway, pre-merge BE was almost useless). The issue is the relationship between BE gains, shards and Champions.\n\nIf re-rolling was still a thing there would be 90% less threads about the BE changes. If they changed it back to IP but left the current system in place you would see these threads continue. The main issue is that there is no instant gains to get BE, BE gains are semi RNG and shards are either that specific champ or are BE.\n\nThe 1700 shard was abused as people were getting 6300/7200 champs for 5100 or less. For people who already had all the champs they just saved shards from chests and then rolled them into a free 7200 champ on release. Think I saved about 25-30K on this alone to get the remaining 6300 champs i was missing this season. Betting this was the drive behind the change. With runes now free, BE is used for champions and the occasional ward/emote/something that Riot puts in the store once in a blue moon. In terms of what BE is worth it cuts it down since people no longer have to decide between a new champ or those extra runes (That were fucking expensive)\n\nThey already said that the minimum BE from capsules has increased to 810 from 720 and they will probably change the system from the overall feedback. In my opinion they should bring back the re-roll system but increase the amount of shards required to re-roll, or scale the amount based off the tier of the shard.","replies":[{"poster":"Kys Gurl","date":"2017-11-13T09:46:46.718+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem I have with this system, is getting Mastery on champions. I have all the tokens I need for mastery 7 Leona, but since I only gain BE from leveling, I will need 4-5 level ups to get the BE I need to get mastery 7 on Leona. That is BE that I can't spend on champions now, and if I wanted to get mastery 7 on a new champion, I would need to save up to buy them, which would be around 10 levels, and then the BE on top of that for the mastery upgrades. I've been averaging about 1 level a day, with the amount I play, and I really only have time to play on weekends, or a game every now and then during the week. It's going to be a long ass time before I can get anything with this new system. I really just want some BE after each match.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-11-12T00:49:09.310+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"This new change makes Riot more money, and because money is more important to them than a happy playbase, they aren't going to revert it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2017-11-12T00:59:12.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Little Witch Eve,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AsvUP9oQ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-12T00:49:09.310+0000)\n>\n> This new change makes Riot more money, and because money is more important to them than a happy playbase, they aren&#x27;t going to revert it.\n\nTrue..
