I have taken so many steps to try and fix this issue but still no luck, added exceptions to my firewall, changed the inbound rules also, changed the SSL to TLS settings, deleted Logitech dlls from the league folders, run the repair, reinstalled league and even just turning off my firewall when trying to connect to a game.\r\n\r\nits not a huge issue when starting up a game, one or two retries seem to get me into the match but if i for whatever reason disconnect during a match reconnecting takes me far too long and i receive an afk/abandonment notice. it didnt bother me before but now that i have a 20min wait time for my queues its getting ridiculous.\r\n\r\nPlease if anyone can help find a solution for me!\r\n\r\n\r\ni also attached my network diagnostic results if that helps at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my first time posting, sorry for any grammatical errors.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-01T07:47:50.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No problem.\n\nIf you have any anti-virus, you should probably disable/uninstall that until you've found a fix as well.\n\nHave you tried [flushing your IP/DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq10)?
