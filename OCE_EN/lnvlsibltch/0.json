One of our laners got first blooded while our mid laner never joined the game, and as a result of the FB, remake was disabled.\nIt is in my opinion this should only be the case in a 5man premade (no longer solo/duo queue) situation.\nThe system is in place to prevent players faking afk to remake (giving themselves a loss) to save the team who got FB'd\nIn my experience, no one in solo/duo queue is going to willingly take a loss for 3-4 random people, let alone after it was the others who died.\nI see no reason why this system should be in place in solo/duo queue, while I agree it becomes much more abusable in a 5-man premade, I can see(and have experienced) it causing far more harm than good in a solo/duo queue situation.\n\nI have made this post to see how many people agree/disagree with me, and if it can potentially get riots attention in this matter","replies":[{"poster":"UNSTOPPABLE BTW","date":"2019-02-25T13:05:51.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tho i voted yes, are you sure thats what happened? im almost certain fb doesnt cancel remakes. \ncorrect me and send link if im wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-26T04:44:08.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though I'm not sure of the exact timeline in this particular case:\n\n>/Remake becomes available at 3:00 if a player is disconnected or flagged as inactive for 90 seconds. **First blood against a player's team before they leave/dc will prevent a /remake vote.\n**\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ","replies":[]}]}]}
