One must be capable of anything. There is no time for friends. No one to rely on. The only person that can get you through this. Is you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRyze&#039;s words stuck to me. He always knew what to say at the right time. Guiding people along the path of which they have chosen. Be that of a mercenary like Graves. Or a Protector like my friend Leona. I knew it would be hard to understand his riddle. Though it seemed to have the same key concept. I don&#039;t need anyone else. I had pushed away my friends. Locked myself away from the outside world. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Can you please come out? I have worried about you for so long. My friend you need not lock yourself away like this.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He said. No one.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;He said the only person that can get you through this is you. That doesn&#039;t mean you have to go alone. I am here to help you. Like every other time before.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I won&#039;t ask you again Leona. Leave. This is not your battle.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The weight of a city, If not the world rests on your shoulders. How can you be expected to do this alone. What if he meant you had to make the final decision but needed the guidance of others?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHer words ran true. Striking through the mental barriers of which I had built. Forcing myself away from the world. She had a point. That&#039;s what scared me.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI walked slowly to the door. Contemplating whether I was about to make a grave mistake. I opened the door chuckling to myself. I do love a good pun.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh my dear you look like you haven&#039;t bathed in weeks.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&#039;m fine. I have what I need. If you are so intent on helping me. I&#039;d recommend you not question it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&#039;ll help you on one condition.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You never told me your name.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have known each other for... Years now. How could you not know my name.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You are secretive. Telling people only what they need to hear. Only what you let them know. If I am going to need to fight with you. I would like to know what to put on your grave stone should you fall.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You will not need to worry about that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI looked at Leona&#039;s worried face. She had a heart of pure gold and would always look out for her friends. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m deciding whether to leave you in their now.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe pointed back inside. Looking past me. Vials and glasses littered the tables and floor. Dark liquids in a good majority of them.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What have you been doing in their?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Finding something.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What could you possibly need to find in a single room.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;A way home. I can think of no more embarrassment then leaving her on the battle field. Standing there waiting for someone who would not show. Preparing herself for a battle that would not occur. She would go mad in rage. Attacking all that stand before her. To prove that she is not a woman of justice. But a woman filled with cowardice. Someone who would not hesitate to get what she wants.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;How can one person hurt you so badly. How can she have betrayed you with such power that you have come to have nothing but hatred for another person.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you not fight for righteousness? Do you not fight to protect those who can not protect themselves? Do you not fight in order to bring unity to your people?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What I am doing holds no interest of yours. This I understand. We fight for different reasons.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA loud drum was heard. This would always occur whenever a battle was to be held. Five champions were chosen at Random in order to fight. Only this time the drum could be heard once. It would persist every second until all five champions have entered the field. This did not happen. I looked over behind me to find my crystal lighting up. It floated off of the table and shimmered as it started to spin. I turned around to face Leona. Knowing this may be our last chance to speak. But saw her holding her own. Gaining speed in it&#039;s rotations as she held it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This Is the final battle. The final League.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI saw the almost scared look on her face as she spoke. I walked over towards my desk. Taking one last look at the room I had locked myself away in for so many days. I held my crystal in my hand as I walked back to Leona. She looked up at me and smiled.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Are you ready Leona?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&#039;m not sure if I am. This is the last time we will be called. If we fall. There is no waking back up. This is the last time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI could sense her getting nervous. It was real this time. The consequences were permanent. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Morgana.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My name. It&#039;s Morgana.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Morgana.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe said my name a few times. As if to commit the name to memory. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well then. Morgana would you like to fight alongside me one last time?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Leona it would be an honour.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"thisissofake","date":"2016-06-25T08:18:37.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"is there something in the lore about these champs knowing each other? or did u just write this because u wanted to xD","replies":[{"poster":"titsmcgee794","date":"2016-06-29T16:39:44.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana and Kayle are sisters. I just played withe the idea of the random Champion spawning in the game. So that each champion. Regardless of loyalties. Know who each other are and I would assume they would have built friendships. Even having to fight as allies. So I played a little bit LOOSELY on Morgana's lore and back story. Yet had Leona as a friend as I feel they would have been friends. The two champs don't know each other lore wise. So I tried to fuse the lore and game together loosely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T10:26:17.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does that mean Kayle and Diana are friends?
