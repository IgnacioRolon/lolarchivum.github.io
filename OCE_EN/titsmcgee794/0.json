I don't even have the game installed on my computer.\r\n2. The files I do have on my computer are residual files I had when I deleted the game over a year ago. \r\n3. My account activity says I'd been playing practically only ranked draft mode and I don't even know what that means as I only ever played ARAM because I was absolutely not having a bar of ranked. \r\n4. I typed in league of legends to the pc search bar and it has come up with plenty of files from 2018 and one from 2019 from the 3rd of October, That I know I didn't download as I had been thinking about it for the past couple of weeks but never ended up doing so.\r\n5. Even the characters I don't use. As I personally (On the extremely rare chance years ago that I did play regular games, Would only choose champions like Anivia, Kog'maw or Viegar (VIVI :D) But as I said I rarely touched any of the others cos I have a bad enough time playing these three. \r\n\r\nIs there a specific way I can send through a ticket to Riot to let them know that someone must have gotten into my account? As I even asked my friends IF I had given them my details and they said no. So I'm a bit confused about how. I mean I'm happy starting a new account cos well, Shit happens but It's a bit of a bummer that I haven't played it in so long nor even had the game downloaded onto my computer but still copped the ban so??\r\n\r\nIf anyone has more experience with the technical side of Riot or can let me know where I'm supposed to go to send a ticket through that will be great. I've already accepted I've lost this account which, As I said isn't a big bother as I hadn't played it in a long time but you guys understand it's still the principal of the matter right?\r\n\r\nOr is there a way to see the location of where the account was played from? Like through some tech mumbo jumbo stuff?\r\n\r\nThank you :) - Mickyj","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-05T15:26:10.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
