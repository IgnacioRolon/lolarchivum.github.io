There's less of them, but they tend to spend more, on average.\n> As the game reaches it's final stage (sometimes called Farm Stage), a very small team is in charge of keeping the game on life support.

Since you're only playing one game per day, you're going to be getting the first win bonus a lot more often (percentage wise) than other players, so you'll level up in less games, which gets you capsules and consequently BE faster. \n\nYou get a *minimum* of 720 BE per level (and they're looking at bumping that up to 810), so let's start by saying you play 4 games to level. In the old system, if you won all 4 games you'd be looking at about 1000 IP (cause first win) but let's be honest you aren't going to win them all. So let's say you win 2 and lose 2, you'd be looking at around 700-750 IP on average, whereas now you get an average of 910 BE for those four games.\n\nAnd that is not accounting for the fact that EXP per game is not as hindered by win/loss, but depends more on the length of the game, so even if you lose all four of those games, you're still probably going to level in the same amount of time as you won if not a fraction more, whereas if you lost all 4 int he old system you really wouldn't get much IP at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-11T01:56:11.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you realise if someone only plays 2 games a day their percentages for getting \"first win of the day\" actually goes way down...even more so if they're only playing 1 game. \n\ntruly boggling my mind that you're arguing that less games = more likely to get first win bonus and therefore will get BE faster.\n\ni try not to be rude but im sorry, that is just totally retarded.\n\nyes this was already the case with the first win Ip bonus. point is the first win thing isnt any better than before like they're desperately trying to make out it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-11T09:47:04.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assuming a 50% winrate someone playing one game a day will get the first win bonus in 50% of their games.

New players like being able to dabble with all champs, to see what they like or what they don't, and they decide if they wanna stay or not. Instead, they only let new players play the rotation champs and that's about it. With this new system, it's even worse. I may be smurfing, but I'm playing against purely smurfs. I haven't seen or met a new person in this game for ages. 2 of my friends left, on top of the other 14 that left for other reasons. The 2 that left recently, ditched the new BE system and hated the concept of Zoe. It just amazes me that they think they can sustain this game with a smash-n-grab patch that doesn't allow room for growth. Take for example Overwatch; a game that allows access to all heroes/champs at level 1, but makes sure you don't get to play ranked till level 25 (he managed to place plat. That same friend was able to get level 25 in as little as 3 days. Here it takes ages without the boost to experience, and you have access to a very limited set of champs. I can see why esports is investing a lot in Overwatch. Not only is it competitive, but the advertising base (a.k.a. the new and non-professional) will be sustainably larger, than LoL's. I've also seen people say that OW won't catch up, but it's still growing, and the rate popularity grows at can be measurably similar to exponential growth (slow at the start, ridiculous as it picks up pace).","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaiZed21","date":"2017-11-11T00:12:08.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please fix this mistake riot.{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Magwar","date":"2017-11-10T04:24:19.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"easy.
