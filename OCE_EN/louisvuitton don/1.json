Fact is, Riot isn't obliged to remove your LPQ at all, it's really not that bad of a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-02T01:27:00.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be clear, you wont get an LPQ from a single instance of DC/AFK. It *should* only occur as the result of significant DC/AFK history, as the system is designed to take into account \"standard\" connection issues (like the occasional DC from faults, be they ISP, server-side or client-side). Bottom line is, you're probably had a history of DC/AFK in order to be hit with this LPQ, and as such it wouldn't be a false positive.\n\nThat said, if you want to appeal the punishment, you need to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (that link will take you directly to \"submit a ticket\", you may need to log out of your boards account once there) and manage the situation with them. It's important to note that you be be a clear and thorough as you can be, as the support staff will generally only address whatever is asked (if you ask a \"yes/no\" question, you'll get a \"yes/no\" response). It's also important to note that they don't typically \"revoke\" low tier punishments like LPQs, I imagine due to some policy Riot has on the matter for some reason, so chances are you'll still have to play out the LPQ even if it's deemed to be a false positive.","replies":[{"poster":"LouisVuitton Don","date":"2018-06-02T10:54:43.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure if you have the ability to check, but my previous afks were all due to this directx error issue, and it feels extremely unfair for me as i tried my best to follow the summoners code and i am now getting punished for something i didnt do","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-02T11:18:48.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't check, I have no \"mod powers\" of any kind and have no access to Riots systems. Even so, I'm not sure that someone who has such access and knows what they are doing would be able to check those instances and determine if they were due to such issues. As far as I know it's practically impossible for someone to determine the reason for a DC without having actually witnessed it, and even then depending on what \"perspective\" (for lack of a better word) they had.\n\nRealistically, the least you could hope for by submitting a ticket is providing *some* data to Riot that may or may not help prevent such issues in the future. You could also use such a ticket to ask for ways to attempt preventing the issue from occurring on your end too, which may be a good idea (at the very least, it might be prudent to do a google search and see what you can find).\n\nIt might seem unfair, but realistically Riot can only allow for so much leeway in these kinds of situations, otherwise instances of DCs/AFKs would become much more of an issue than they are. Sometimes that means someone getting technical issues will get caught in the \"crossfire\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}
