Well I checked the last 20 ranked games you played, and you actually got jungle 12 times. You were playing as jungle 60% of the time, yet it **felt** like you were getting jungle 25% of the time. \n\nAccording to the Negativity Bias theory, this happened because you remember the negative experience of not playing jungle far more clearly than the positive experience of getting to playing jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2016-12-16T11:14:05.982+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa.....
