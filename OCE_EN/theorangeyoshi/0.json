It's not hard to make the connection from the phrase \"Quinn blinded me to things beyond 500 range\" when abbreviated to \"Quinns blind effect\". Simple paraphrase in case you missed the context of her Q being a blind (to a certain area [anything beyond X range]) which can basically be reduced to \"her blind\".\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-12-07T00:53:02.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"does that mean you refer to graves smoke screen a blind aswell?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-06T13:27:11.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the elfen lied gif is real tho","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-06T14:43:03.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=BvAmEZlZ,comment-id=000100000001,timestamp=2015-12-06T13:27:11.797+0000)\n>\n> the elfen lied gif is real tho\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnIlvauML5s\n\nThis is better though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-06T10:43:21.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for making my point.\n\nEDIT: FYI, nice edit.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-06T10:46:29.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=BvAmEZlZ,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-12-06T10:43:21.331+0000)\n>\n> Thank you for making my point.\n> \n> EDIT: FYI, nice edit.\n\nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BARHW2RtxL6lSPyDyz2GLDKXpzUm86VLeV4tY1_kiUMgo8pQCGNczMKi8cM80OSXUG4dIbsQOaInOHKu62CGoMrnQV_MBTpXs1_4DW8GT_t84qJpFuwUSEF-YQ-LhLSgFBCjynRqsN2NZ4HRtxFGMJwNGgnBhXRbmjvk0LmTzsJU3quNk3cydBx9MOSGSFgPVH7OSd3MLebeag29EFFG2lfLqAY5PNiZDBd3bmQsfeIznHLFQAFOwBNc_fIcjt4C3Mv01rp3XtAV_TxlNfN87YavwZ8qhL7banI6RI0ZXBbWOwqDrP5bpUQQL8vm_JiuQ3Se9M72Mmw8SCaQ_0HzWrW9bhV6yRQVjm3uXSkSw8nN2hveyuF9m6HfLsCoG4AR9KnBt-def1J7CplSXViqQqzoVeP9gUJXdqj1wISctizn9FV46DQxWStkwX4v2zV-HTo7vrpaXkhpDuasfOSYwK-drhHNZNG3Y-_jPHvnyBsfQ5EwDtqBV16FJ-bxJjtUgUbAnJzeVxBzpTD6hUq5XTqpj5XFnvAwRGGCUF35O9c=w1029-h643-no\n\nI don't see what you're talking about it. Maybe I'm blind to it. Guess you can be blind but still see. Maybe partial blindness is still a form of blindness and the phrase \"Blind\" is figurative like the phrase \"I have a ton of homework\" basically means a lot (not hundreds upon hundreds of KGs) and \"Blind\" can mean \"I dont see that\" so when someone says \"She blinded me\" It might have been her dazzling good looks not her gouging out your eyes, or maybe Quinn just Q'd and they couldn't see much and exaggerated the phrase or was \"speaking figuratively\" not literally (I couldn't see much, so was vision impaired/blinded) [speaking figuratively] - blind. (with parameters).\n\nwww.learnfigurative.com {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-06T10:56:49.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nya Hop,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=BvAmEZlZ,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-06T10:46:29.531+0000)\n>\n-\n\nI don't understand you Heartvine, why do you just attack people?\n\nYou can see that OP is saying \"new\" as in \"Change to\" or speaking figuratively.
