Switching from ADSL to ADSL2 won't do anything, because the difference they have on speed for gaming is negligible. I mean, I play on a 2G wireless connection with ~50ms ping. League isn't that data intensive at all.\n\nNBN wouldn't make any difference for something as low data intensive as this, either. What I'm thinking is that it might be the ISP itself (iiNet is still relatively new) or it could be a separate reason on your computer itself.

Some companies will advertise ADSL as if it's the ultimate connection speed (which it is, for the most part) and then give you a shoddy connection to it, causing things like this to happen.\n\nOf course, it could be because of something else but I'd like to go through this one at a time.","replies":[]}]}
