She is annoying to lane against, but so are many other champions (especially when vsing a burst champ or in a melee/ranged matchup).\n\n* LeBlanc is weak vs champions that can jump on her face and burst her down just as quickly as she can to them (Fizz, Diana, Talon). \n\n\n* She is also pretty weak vs champions that can out sustain her/ poke her out over time/ have the MR to negate her early burst so she can't get ahead (Morgana, Galio)\n\n\n* It is really important when laning VS a LB to not let your HP get below 70%(ish). She can easily burst you down.\n\n\n* Pay attention to her spells. Her E is a skill shot, so stay behind minions. Be careful of her level 2& 3 engages. Try to figure out if she is maxing Q or W first. If she is maxing Q it will definitely hurt more when she jumps on you, but you can punish her by pushing her under tower (wave clear is very bad). If she is maxing W, be sure to stay out of her distortion range. Become familiar with the CD and engage while it is down (it also costs decent mana).\n\n\n* Learn to tell the difference between her and her clone. Keep a pink in your inventory / upgrade to oracle trinket once you are out of laning phase (you will need green trinket earlier on to ward river bushes in case of ganks).\n\n\n* In terms of itemization vs her, early magic resist is a must. She generally has a pretty hard time farming so if you are able to prevent her from bursting you down for a kill, she falls behind quickly. Items for this include hex drinker for AD and abyssal scepter for AP.\n\n\n* Late game you have extra tankiness and will usually have a zhonya's/ banshees to completely rain on her parade.\n\n\n\nTL;DR She doesn't need to be removed, you just have to learn how to counterplay","replies":[{"poster":"Gypsyondrugs","date":"2016-04-02T22:46:31.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice\nits just that im sick of players thinking that they are gods when they play leblanc because they've got it pretty easy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-04-03T09:04:50.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play {{champion:45}} LMAO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-02T15:08:20.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why you pick master yi.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-02T14:20:06.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nerfed?** NERFED!?
