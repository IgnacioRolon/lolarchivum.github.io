I tried again and the entire game it did not heal as it used to.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t played jungle in a while so I can&#039;t tell for sure if this has been happening long, or it was a once off.\r\n\r\nI couldn&#039;t find any information about the benefits of smiting jungle camps had been removed. I cannot say that the same is true with the blue buff mana restore as I did not smite blue buff.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-06-17T05:32:04.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'm keen to learn more about this and pass it on if possible.
