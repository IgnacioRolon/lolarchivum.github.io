Minor issue, could possibly go in his passive description. What units to nearest champ/tower etc despite the isolation marker being near the champ in game gives you.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-19T06:37:35.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the **in-game **description of {{champion:121}}'s Unseen Threat: \n> When Kha'Zix is not visible to the enemy team, he gains Unseen Threat, causing his next basic attack against an enemy Champion to deal bonus magic damage and slow.\n\nThis is the **LoLWiki** description of {{champion:121}}'s Unseen Threat:\n> Isolation: Kha'Zix marks all nearby enemies who aren't accompanied by any of their allies nearby as Isolated.

Thanks for the reminder.\n\nYou could also try and duplicate this OP to NA board to gain higher visibility to Riot staffs, as that's their HQ.","replies":[]}]}
