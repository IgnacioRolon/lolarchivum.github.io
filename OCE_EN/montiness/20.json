Yet whilst I am in game, my ping is in the high 60&#039;s.\r\n\r\nJust wondering what factors may be influencing the difference between my actual ping and the Tool&#039;s reported ping. I&#039;m the only system/device on the network (lucky me) Have port forwarding set up, etc.\r\n\r\nI did notice some time ago that alot of people with certain ISP&#039;s were having issues with connections, due to the 3rd party game do dad whatevers they use (or whatever they are) and the RIOT team did some &quot;tweaking&quot; as they called it to the way their servers handled those communications. During that time, my actual game ping was in the low 50&#039;s, but on the next patch cycle it shot straight back up into the high 60&#039;s, where it is now.\r\n\r\nThat leads me to believe that the difference in ping is a server side issue, maybe you could &quot;re-tweak&quot; the settings again :D\r\n\r\nAnyway, cheers for listening to the rant.

At the moment at least once per 2 minutes I experience it and it's my side, I'm aware and looking at wiring a network into the house.\n\nThat aside, after step 6 and 7,\n\n6    69 ms    71 ms    71 ms  203-221-3-69.tpgi.com.au [203.221.3.69] \n7    66 ms    66 ms    65 ms  203-219-106-254.tpgi.com.au [203.219.106.254] \n\nthe request times out continuously, making the tracert file unfinishable but I will list here, with altered first 2 IPs to blank.
