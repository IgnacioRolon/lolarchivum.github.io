And with shot calling... well... decisive, well practiced and devastating would be three words much more suited to this.\r\n\r\n i noticed that in applications to be someone who spectates these games for broadcasts need university degrees of anything, but they need that level of education. i find it ironic that people commentating on these games have a terrible knowledge of what the words they use mean.\r\n\r\nplease don&#039;t take this the wrong way, i love the commentators that are here, just when i hear very simple words and concepts used incorrectly, my ears bleed, my eyes almost explode from the pressure of an impending hemorrhage, and my head is constantly attracted to the wall and repeatedly needs to see what it&#039;s made of... through touch.\r\n\r\nanyway, take it as you will, but i&#039;d love to listen to a broadcast in oce and not want to facepalm.\r\n\r\nall the best.","replies":[{"poster":"GobSlob","date":"2015-07-25T17:36:10.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered that 'macro' may have a game specific meaning which you aren't aware of? I've always seen macro to be an encompassing term that refers to shot calling, wave management, and essentially anything not related to basic mechanics. I imagine the term would have begun being used in professional starcraft where it was a bit more relevant before the league scene took off.","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2015-07-26T17:50:39.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so... strategy.... you've taken macro to mean strategy?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T01:42:32.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Macro mechanics man.\n\nThis game can be divided into Micro, and Macro mechanics in which you perform.\n\nMaybe learn to understand before you make a post on boards making a fool of yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2015-07-26T17:42:24.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"macro-mechanics, is correct... macro-shot-calling, is not. the shot calling can have a macro-effect however.","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2015-07-26T17:48:20.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and can be correct afterwards, in a macro-analysis if you will... but not as it happens.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2015-07-26T02:43:50.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Montiness\n\nFirstly thanks for the feedback. Always love hearing what people like and what people want us to improve, because it gives us goal posts to strive for.\n\nTo talk about the overall concern, being the overuse of words, we do try to address these fairly frequently. An example is Rotations (I really dislike this word), instead we try to use map movement, or positioning, or just explain why they are where they are, but you are correct there are some words we use alot. This is generally to the fact they are ingrained in video games / esports.\n\nMacro vs Micro is a great example. In Commentary we use Macro to talk about the BIG picture - forward thinking, the strategy, the game knowledge - Pretty much not what people are doing in the heat of the moment. These are smart players - a great example is Carbon or Spookz, who will invade and use superior smarts to beat there opponents.\n\nOn the other hand Micro is - as Atlus would say - the ability to do your buttons. This is last hitting or nailing key skill shots / combos - ala mechanics. Best example I can give (still using jungler) is Chelby. The man is a micro beast. He will run at you and outplay you.\n\nAnyways I hope this helps out abit. I'll keep an eye hear unless you have any further questions.\n\nThanks,\nSpÃ wn","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2015-07-26T17:37:15.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Large is a synonym for for big, this is true. But macro, is not. Micro can refer to many aspects of gameplay, because it holds the same meaning as it does in micro-management, and is a proper use of the prefix. Macro, on the other hand, is not. It has a very select meaning, and very few words and concepts in comparison it can attach itself to. Even though large does mean big in English, macro does not translate to big the way it is used in terms like \"Big Play\" big in that term is not used to describe a physically large play, which macro would, it refers to the impact on the game, being used as a synonym itself. Although a big play can have a macro effect on the game. \n\nI do appreciate the time taken to reply, and I also appreciate your feeling that some words like rotations is overused. There are very few synonyms for rotation compared to the amount that it happens in game, and you're eventually going to be overusing these terms if you comment on each and every map movement. Transition's one I like personally as well. Another one that might be a bit overused is \"irrespective\"\n\nAgain thank you for the time taken to reply, but although large and big are synonyms for macro, macro is not a synonym for big or large... it seems strange, but that's because they relate to different traits than that of macro.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T04:40:49.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">An example is Rotations (I really dislike this word)\n\nWhy do you dislike using the word rotations?","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2015-07-26T05:10:48.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just very overused and i think we default to it over explaining where teams are moving and how.\n\nan example is blue side rotate to bottom tier 2.\nOR\nBlue side able to take the inside lane through the jungle, due to ward coverage and try and beat the red side to bottom tier 2.\n\nOne has much more information and I feel gives more to the audience.\n\nIt's a personal thing I guess but I try and use it sparingly/","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T05:16:16.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you could just elaborate how they are rotating (hell you could just use the word rotate in the second part of the example), but yeah i guess being a commentator you would use the word a lot if you used it.\n\nExample:\nBlue side are rotating through the inside lane and into the jungle, due to ward coverage, and are trying to out-rotate the Red side to the bottom Tier 2.\n\nI guess as a player it's easier to use the word rotate because it's not likely to be over-used.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
