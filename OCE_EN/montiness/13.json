You know the ones. The trolls who think they&#039;re good.\r\n\r\nAnd they&#039;re always in a group. And after a certain time you always seem to be placed in games with them. People who make the game so unenjoyable you have to queue dodge..... and you&#039;re the one who&#039;s penalized. And because the team is made of you and a bunch of friends reports are never heard. So the toxicity just lingers and grows and grows.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just not fair. Supports who get no vision, junglers who camp only their buddies lane and to hell with anything else (they constantly feed that lane btw) Laners who only plick losing lanes and constantly feed game after game.  I&#039;m just over it. I&#039;m sure other people are as well. Give us some way to get around this, at the very least give us a one game leniency on queue dodges. \r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-08T03:36:27.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tfw everything that ever happens on league of legends is other people's fault, and you totally aren't becoming delusional and making up lies to forcibly justify your own actions/ shortcomings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-07T21:02:16.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah something needs to be done, sure. but not changing the dodge system at all is much better.","replies":[]}]}
