Was looking forward to this, but it is literal garbage. If by 10 minutes your top laner has lost both turrets, you manage to play well enough to drag the game to 30 mins and they have 65 cs for the match..... people demanding lanes just so they can tank them. This is fucked. Your first game win or lose is the only thing that determines your rank, and lose gives you braindead monkeys for the remainder. Fuck you riot. Fix your game.","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-12T14:47:15.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just roam, relentless hunter at least if not mobility boots is core","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-02-06T02:53:24.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BIG OOF","replies":[]}]}
