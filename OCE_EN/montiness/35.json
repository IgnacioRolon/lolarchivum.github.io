It spawns at 1:40, which would be around when jg finishes a botlane leash. I think you'll find it won't be RNG as much as players might need to drop a ward in botside river at around 1:20 to see where it spawns.\nSee scuttler - it's botside\nDon't see scuttle - it's topside\n\nAs a jg player, I can't say I like that they're effectively nerfing jungling. Whether it's good for the overall game, who can say right now, but I can see where they're trying to go - one of the big complaints especially toplaners tend to have is the jg's impact on the lane. They're basically trying to make toplane more playable.","replies":[]}]}
