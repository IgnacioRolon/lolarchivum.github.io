I don&#039;t know what you&#039;ve done, but you need to reverse it before rank and honour resets, as it&#039;s only afew hours away now, you might want to jump straight on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-18T01:21:31.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for being so late to the party, but I'm really not well versed in the tech stuff and I was trying to find some better info for you.\n\nThe fact that you started having issues right after you patched tells me your patch probably didn't go the way it was supposed to. Obviously it's inconvenient to not do anything at all while the game is patching, but there are certain other processes and programs that can interfere with the patching process and cause issues like other installations and such. That said, sometimes it does just happen, usually because of a connection drop out during the patch or some such.\n\nFirst thing I would do is repair your client. Go to settings in the client and press \"Initiate full repair\".\n\nIf that doesn't work I would try the steps found here:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes\n\nIf that doesn't work either I would recommend doing a full reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2018-01-27T15:36:27.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After happening 2 or three times, it seemed to randomly stop.\n\nIt happened afew times when playing with a new champ in the game that I hadn't played with during patch 8.1, then suddenly stopped.\n\nIt happened once again, during a ranked queue but it didn't penalize me for it, so I was happy.
