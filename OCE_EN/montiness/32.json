In the S+ game, you killed 2 Inner Towers and an Inhib. You also dealt over 1k *less* damage to Towers in your A+ game than your S+ game. You destroyed more enemy wards (so more vision denial, and better use of your control wards) in the S+ game than your A+ game.\n\nIt may also be worth looking at heat maps of those games to see how you're roaming or if you happen to spend more time around mid/top (and possibly judged as Top Lux, for example).\n\nThis is basically all I could find. No guarantee that it's correct, but it might be something :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2018-08-09T08:42:45.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can probably notice from my vision scores that I'm constantly on the move, denying and placing vision. As far as I'm aware destroyed wards count towards your vision score, from testing, and when in one game they place a bunch less, the percentages remain about the same. Last hitting objectives like that I'm fairly certain don't, or at least shouldn't come into the equation. The damage itself sure, but not the last hits, 1000 less damage to objectives, especially as a support, really should not be an issue. All it does is persuade people to be more wreckless as a support so they get the last hits... if you have baroned up minions and all you need to do is protect the 3 cannons because their counter siege is better than your siege, you should be rewarded for being smart like that instead of penalized. Just seems stupid to place emphasis on statistics that are largely irrelevant in many games.","replies":[]}]}
