If it only takes 1 report to look at, go through match history and see the trend along with data of the game from the report, and be actionable, I won&#039;t bother...\n\nBut since in AI games you can easily come across 3 bots in a game, if it requires 3 or 4 reports they can easily slip through the system, and I will continue.\n\nfor example:\n\n(names removed)\n\nAs you can see there are constants in their games. The jungle bots are easy to pick, whereas the standard bot we&#039;re all used to has the expected SFA damage to champs, low farm, ridiculous feeding numbers, and strings of games lasting days.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd like to hire me I can go through players match histories find the obvious bots and send forward the evidence, I'd be happy to do it 8-10 hours a day, 6 days a week for $70k per annum, since I guess you don't have anyone doing this atm. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2018-01-16T03:02:42.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might I please ask why those names were removed, am I not allowed at all to link to obvious bots?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-16T03:08:57.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n\n>Please don't name names.

Which meant he was in a sling for roughly a month which meant he couldn’t use the keyboard so he changed all his keybindings to his mouse and started exclusively playing tanky supports with cc as they were the easiest with the control scheme. \n\nNow if you just looked at his match history you would see a change in key bindings, a change in champions played and a change of performance.

You get some bots that stay so far back they're useless, you get some that just farm, you get some that just run down mid, and you get some that won't go near a turret regardless of the situation.\n\nAlthought they are easy to pick, whenever I see heal/ghost or heal/smite (new but haven't seen it in about a week now) I assume they're bots until they either speak or prove me different.\n\nAnd to the others expressing their disapproval of bots, I do hold those same sentiments in cases and having a pure tribunal staff dedicated to every report would be wonderful, it's not like they don't have enough money to employ them. The old system of tribunal was flawed in that it was a player base I believe and it seemed if people found whatever funny, they let it go.\n\nBut, and this is purely a pet hate coming in.... it's their, not there...

So far as I know the more reports against a specific player the more likely it is to be manual reviewed as well if no punishment is issued, so if it's a sneaky bot that is acting enough like a player to get by, a support ticket is probably the best way to go about it since it might be awhile before the automated picks it up.\n\n>Posting the match history\n\nI respect the effort. Compiling a list of bots isn't exactly a fun time, especially since you have to play with them, boards just isn't the place to post it. *However* it is perfect to hand to the support team a long list instead of a whole bunch of individual tickets.\n\n>If the original question could be answered\n\nSorry I missed that when I originally read your post. I focused in on the \"reporting bots\" part and kind of lost the question, that's my bad,\n\n>I will lodge support tickets\n\nOne thing I will mention is that due to privacy practices with accounts, support won't give you any feedback on the report, you'll get a generic \"thanks for the report\" ticket back. This is simply due to the fact that they can't give out info about other people's accounts to you.\n\n>The same with offensive and inappropriate names.\n\nNames are rather notoriously slow unfortunately. If you see a name that isn't being actioned, again I'd recommend submitting a ticket about it, but if you don't want to go through that effort, you're welcome to add me on League and send them through to me, and I'll report them for you since I do it myself anyways.\n\n___\n\nIn game offences are definitely something Riot could do much better at, and bots are tricky because of how easy they are to make, and as they evolve the detection methods have to as well.
