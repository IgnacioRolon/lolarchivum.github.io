Missing that, have to use LoLReplay2 at the moment to watch friends games.","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T10:05:28.297+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if you know what I said....  the client has no functionality to watch the replays you dl after they are older than 20 games. Yes they're saved somewhere on my computer, but the client needs the ability to watch DL'd replays. You don't have to watch a game to dl it. I'm talking about the alpha client, not using lolreplay to dl replays, which I think for some reason you think that's what I meant.","replies":[{"poster":"A is for Atlas","date":"2016-12-12T19:43:32.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're able to get a hold of the older replay file, you should be able to rename it to the name of your newest replay and play it from the client as if it were your newest replay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-19T02:55:09.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still external file manipulation, which if you're like me and having all of your replays, inconvenient.
