We&#039;ve seen some questions about the speed you earn BE in the new system (compared to the earn rate on IP in the old system). We&#039;ve always said that most players would earn champions either as quickly or faster than before. To prove it, let&#039;s look at the numbers.","url":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta","image":"https://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I initially posted this as a response in another thread, but I feel it warrants to be directed to RIOT.\r\n\r\nEvery other region except for OCE seems to get BE in every capsule. Why is this?\r\n\r\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta\r\n\r\nRIOT even respond confirming this and looking to increase (or tweak something in the system) the amount of BE you get on level up, whilst here in OCE the game can&#039;t even be called play for free anymore. 30 level ups at the rate of BE we now get (none except for decons) pretty much means at level 30 you can&#039;t even play ranked, as you don&#039;t have competitive 16 champs.","replies":[]}
