As fallout from this issue it looks like some players are having lingering problems with their connections despite the root cause being fixed.\n\nI'd expect that as your ISPs reconfigure their routing following the fix, this should resolve itself but not all have done so at this point. \n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-03-31T12:43:41.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you Agent Mindstar,\n\nThank you for being so diligent in your duties, now we know the questions to ask when we call our providers tomorrow if they are still to remedy the situation.\n\nAll the best, Have a great weekend!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-03-31T13:09:08.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've made a change on our side of things that might help out - can you possibly check in a custom game and let me know if you can connect?","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-04-02T15:25:15.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure what the change was, but my ping of a constant 92-110 has dropped to range from 85--90.
