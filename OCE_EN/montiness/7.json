Are you high?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"I just read that you&#039;re going to remove Sightstome and make the SS effect a quest reward....\r\n\r\nPlease, Please PLEASE don&#039;t do this.\r\n\r\nAs a support main, I can see that this will only hurt the game.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it is possible to get a sightstone at around 8-10 minutes, which is a good, healthy time for your team to have vision.\r\n\r\nBut, especially with tank supports, this change could extend that time out to as much as 25 minutes. We all knoiw the tank support struggle of getting Relic Shield procs. You have 3 stacks, walk in to proc the cannon and a couple melee minions, and the ADC takes asll of them. So you take a world of free poke, and get flamed. Leaving you with around 450 of 650 stacks at 20 minutes.... which is fine, because you have the hybrid support item giving you vision to keep you and your team safe.\r\n\r\nIf you win your lane hard, and get a nice early tower, you no longer have the vision to be able to rotate, stay in lane, or do anything other than having the safe option of letting the enemy catch up. \r\n\r\nThis change obliterates that idea. It is going to do nothing more than discourage people playing support even more, leading to a rash of supports playing overly aggressive so they can get SS earlier.\r\n\r\nSeriously scrap this idea, it&#039;s absolutely retarded.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2018-01-10T05:13:56.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly I do think it's a pretty strange thing to do. \nPersonally I like dominating lane and then siphoning my gold into an early sightstone so I can provide vision of the enemy jungling path to keep my laners safe and provide a way for my jungler to safely starve out the enemy. \n\nI understand why they are wanting to do this, so that players aren't forced to rush that sightstone (as a support main there have been so many times where I have opted to buy a component of something before I buy SS and my teammates flame me) and they can instead opt to rush a \"higher impact item\". In situations where the enemy jungler is an early pressure champ/playstyle or the enemy mid just wants to camp bot, your sightstone rush would have just as much impact as your redemption rush since you'd have the foresight to get the heck out.  \n\nI still think it's stupid though.

So second back is usually when folks get it.\n\nAs a tank support lane when you pick first, if the enemy support picks after you, they will undoubtably pick a caster to punish you.... I know I do... or even kill the adc early. Remember if the adc isn't around, it doesn't proc at all, and if you're stuck on relic shield for 10 mins, this change punishes your team for a horrible time in lane. I'm one of those people who will head off and help other lanes get ahead if my adc is stupid, and the way that works is being able to have a ss sitting there to ward up for them, because your adc can't leave tower.\n\nStill, having a shithouse time in lane should be no reason you can't get essential items, and that is what this change will do. Considering the other changes going along with it to the \"pure\" support item build, this is just a bad idea full stop. They're trying to make it less cumbersome so supports can feel free to build other ways, but all it is actually doing is slowing down the build time of SS. Hybrid item is 1 item, and has 4 charges... from what I've read this is still going to be one item with 3 charges and a much lengthier delay on when you get it. Even if it has 4, just the amount of time.... ugh. manage to steal the enemy red buff? get a double kill bot on hitting level 2? taken tower? Now what? I can't get vision, can't stay in lane overextended in the dark, can't head top and help smash that down because your adc still has no vision, can't head mid because the amount of time you'll be there will just punish everyone on exp. It's just... ugh.\n\nAnd to Jason Wazza... no, they really can't. And what happens if your lane phase becomes null after you buy a bunch of stuff instead of SS? You end up either having a dark jg thewy're pushing into or pushing into a dark jg. then you need to wait X amount of time which inevitably will become longer because you're always at risk of being ganked from a much larger area, longer lanes to get caught in, or faster rotations for mid laners to get behind you. \n\nYaiamone I hear ya dude, nothing feels better than having the constant push on and being able to ward the enemy buffs to catch em, it feels awesome :) Goodbye to those days now though :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-01-10T05:20:59.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Eve OTP, I can say that Frostfang will still be very viable and Riot's attempt to make it more Support friendly and less friendly towards AP Junglers has gone wrong.\n\nThis essentially gives me Green Smite active while taking Blue Smite. Pair this with Zombie Ward, and this is going to be very strong.\n\nNot to mention it still gives me 10% CDR, 45 on-hit magic damage, and gold generation (which won't be delayed due to me farming monsters, not minions). Only difference is swapping out the *Stormraider's Surge* passive for the Ward passive.\n\nYou also forget that they decreased the Tribute amount by 250g, so it's down to 500g. So you get Sightstone *for free* (saving 800g) AND earning at least 500g on top of that. That's 1,300g towards another critical item.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-10T05:30:21.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So you get Sightstone for free (saving 800g) AND earning at least 500g on top of that.
