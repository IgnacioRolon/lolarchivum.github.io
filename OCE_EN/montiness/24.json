I&#039;m not an ADC main, I don&#039;t know the Ashe skins. I was under the impression that that was giving you the championship ashe skin, the chroma and the ward.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was nothing I saw in the event that said you needed to have the base skin.\r\n\r\nIt can&#039;t be hard to put a notification up when you select it to forge that you must own the base skin to recieve the skin.\r\n\r\nAnd please take this shitty ward back and give me my tokens back. Or gift anyone who&#039;s also fallen for this the base skin as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-23T03:47:50.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Montiness,\n\nYou're not the only one that was confused by this. If you contact support they can reverse the transaction and remove the bundle contents from your account. Keep in mind though that this is the only time that you can get this chroma for Championship Ashe, it won't be coming back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2017-10-17T05:06:16.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an additional note, you may have noticed in the store you cannot get a chroma unless you own the base skin, allowing you to get it implies that it gives you the base skin as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-10-28T08:20:34.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's said even with regular chromas you need the base skin to use them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2017-10-24T01:47:33.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I hadn't seen this earlier, and just bit the bullet and bought championship ashe.\n\nIt also seems that if you get the combo and then later buy the champ ashe skin, it DOES NOT give you the chroma then, either.\n\nSo I'll be adding that to the support ticket, thank you for the reply and the understanding.","replies":[]}]}
