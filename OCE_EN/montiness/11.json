I know you took it out because not alot of us use them, but it&#039;s a ridiculously important tool at least for me. I have major problems searching for items in the shop, mostly because when you select the box and start typing half the time it just deletes what you type for no reason. It results in stupidly long backs, larger chances of being caught shopping when you back because you are trying to get the fastest possible back and need to type, taking your hand off the mouse or focusing so strongly on what you&#039;re looking for you miss those sneaky lee sin nidalee etc cheese kills.\r\n\r\nSecondly, please put the &quot;previously played&quot; back in the social tab. again maybe not alot of people use it, but looking up players you were with or against after a game can help your own analysis of the game. Being able to see if the lane opponent was of a higher elo or lower even can give you a very good idea of where you are with that champion and the matchup.\r\n\r\nAlso with it you can check to see easily how stupid Riot&#039;s mm can be sometimes. Like when you&#039;re having a good run then suddenly get gifted a full B5 team against plats and golds. This is all information we can give back to you so you can do your fine tuning so this grief doesn&#039;t happen anywhere near as often. I thin k that because alot of people have upgraded to the new client and it is now so hard to find this information, having to use third party sites etc that aren&#039;t up to date you might not be getting the severity of these issues.\r\n\r\nFor me at least if I win 3 games and perform well the 4th, 5th and 6th game will do this to me. If I&#039;m an odd one out it might be bad luck me, but it still shows a major issue with the MM service.\r\n\r\nAnyway cheers","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-11T06:36:02.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny, whenever I swap between NA and OCE it makes me dl about 600 meg. guess i just time it poorly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T13:30:02.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just swap back to the legacy client, make the set, go to alpha client again....\n\nThey do realize the size of each download required by the client to switch between them, don't they?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-10T22:05:19.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a one time download for each patch, not a download each time you swap clients.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-10T11:55:12.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Item sets not being available sucks a bit, but they should be back soon :)\n\nRiot has said _\"[Some of the legacy client's features haven't been added yet, but they're coming](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/client-open-beta-update-1)\"_.

It's only backwards in cases where Riot is the only one who can provide a high quality version of the service, like replays or sandbox mode. \n\nBut in cases where a high quality 3rd party programs are possible, there's no reason for Riot to make one. For example, Discord and TeamSpeak both provide excellent voice communication already, if Riot stepped in their system would probably be no better and lack the community aspect.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
