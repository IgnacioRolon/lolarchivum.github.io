Meaning: anyone and their dog can play him well, but it takes a lot of skill to play him fantastically. \n\n**Secondly:** - Maining Yasuo is not the cause of them being stuck. The cause of them being stuck is that they aren't good enough or lucky enough to climb out, this means that they will be stuck there no matter what champion they play. _(Riven mains, Yi mains, Urgot mains, Aurelion Sol mains, are all stuck too, theres just more people in the world that play Yasuo, so you notice him more.)_ Im silver, my main is Aurelion Sol and i have a 70% win rate on him, should i give up playing him just cos i havent got out of silver yet?\n\n**Thirdly:** - The number of Yasuo mains is constant through all Elo's, _(Master, Challenger, Professional, are the only elo's that have a sub 20% pick rate on Yasuo)_ So theres just as many gold players stuck in gold with Yasuo as there are bronze players stuck in bronze, _(funnily enough.. just like every other champion)_\n\n**Fourthly:** - Yasuo's win-rates are actually highest and most consistent in Bronze/Silver. So according to lolking statistics, Yasuo is actually a good champion to main to get out of Bronze/Silver _(please don't though... theres enough cancer out there already)_ and bronze/silver players actually win more % of games than higher elo players.. _(tell me again how hard he is)_\n\n--------\nThere are a lot of Yasuo players, that is the real problem! Not how good/bad they are. There is a lot in every elo, and because a lot of people play him, theres a lot of people that get lvl 7 on him. \n\nStatistically i would think it is more likely that a higher % of Urgot and Aurelion Sol players have lvl 7 than Yasuo players, becasue pretty much ONLY Urgot  and Aurelion Sol mains play those champions, where Yasuo is played by everyone. So you see more lvl 7 Yasuos than lvl 7 Urgots. But you do see an Urgot, it is more likely that he is lvl 7 than when you see a Yasuo.\n\n**In saying all this: Please can we reduce the numbers of Yasuo players, its so fucking boring and annoying having 2 in every game.**","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-16T08:17:46.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the salt you get if you pick cho'gath into yasou in any lane is soooooo funny. Just try it sometime, the yasou will need 40x more skill to winlane against you due to the aoe silence, knockup, melee dps, tankiness and chunking true damage.\n\nTaking cho'gath mid is actually kinda of funny in low elo since there isn't much most people can do about it and you'll almost always win midlane.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-16T08:22:21.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Taking Aurelion Sol into Yasuo is significantly less funny... \n\nI legit dont know a more hellish lane... and it happens multiple times a day for me. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-16T11:04:05.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"taking aurelion sol into any matchup where they can get up close and stick to you is hellish.

Like I can miss a malphite or warwick ult, don't trust me with anything like yasou. I can also be a full built adc and still get outplayed by gromp and exectuted. \n\nAlso yasou isn't actually popular above gold at all, I spectated like 50 of my plat friends ranked games (for research purposes) and I think I saw 3 yasous whereas 50 of my other friends silver ranked games (still research purposes since I'm B5) and I saw like 20 yasous and a high ban rate. So he's very popular in silver, I see him alot in bronze, I've seen him a bit in spectating a gold friend and he's pretty rare in plat. I have a friend in basically every elo from bronze5 (this is me, I consider this a seperate elo from regular bronze), bronze, silver, gold and plat.\n\nI currently main zilean, janna and shaco; and I am bronze 5 or equivalent since I'm not currently ranked on this account.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-16T08:20:39.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo has a **low** skill floor and a **high** skill ceiling, he isn't hard to play.\n\nAnd i would trust the measured statistics over what you have personally seen.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/gMmsU\n\nThis shows him currently with a steady 20% pick rate in plat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpedBunny","date":"2016-09-20T05:21:18.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a s2 yasuo main started this season in b5. Used yasuo to get to s2 and think i can use him to get to g5. I have 250k on him but I could definitely be better. I can outplay most matchups and 1v2 when im being ganked. Just depends on the matchup. Just thought like the champ. not cause of all the montages I just like the aspect of learning a champ that can outplay super hard while still being incredibly hard to master. Evenif i was stuck i'd still main him cause I love him. Not sure why you view people maining champs other than liking them. http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=spedbunny","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-16T03:31:16.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"all low elo players should give up","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-08-16T19:41:12.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know, i honestly would love to see everyone in plat and lower jsut not play for a week, and make riot see that esports isnt as lucrative as they think it is.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-16T08:26:46.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"me: im 1/10 60cs at 20 mins. im gonna carry!\nteam: *throws a bucket of salt in my face*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-16T01:51:58.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Of coarse people are going to react when you insult them","replies":[]}]}
