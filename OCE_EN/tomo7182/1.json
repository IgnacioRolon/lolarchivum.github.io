If its in the single digits then that is believable, but if you have played even half as many games against a team with a Yasuo in it as the rest of us, if your team is guaranteed a win every time you would be in high plat/diamond by now. and you aren't so that set of statistics is obviously incorrect as well.\n\nSure you might play Yasuo more than some people, sure you might be better than a lot of other low elo Yasuo's, but making up statistics just to feel like Yasuo is 'special' for you only, is pathetic.\n\nAccept the facts. there is a fair chunk of Low elo Yasuo's that are very competent, yes they stay in low elo becasue they don't have the gameplay mechanics or awareness of hight elo players, but that doesn't make them a bad Yasuo (it has nothing to do with yasuo, its just their mechanics in general).  I have a 70% win rate on Aurelion Sol, but i am still in low elo, that doesn't make me a bad Aurelion Sol, it just means that i lack the gameplay mechanics and awareness to carry myself out of low elo (regardless of what champ I'm using). \n\nA low elo Yasuo obviously might not be able to beat a high elo Yasuo, but that doesn't make him bad.

I sadly play a ton of Yasuo myself, but I don't dare max out to Level 7 since I know I'm such a horrible trashuo. :P\n\nSometimes, people just LOVE playing the champion. I mean, he's THE samurai character in League of Legends.\n\nAnother problem is that Yasuo has a shit mid game; he's REALLY item dependent as his ratios alone can't scale up to the late game on their own, and you have to know how to play very well from early-to-mid game with him. You can win lane matchups with him and/or farm like a beast, but with no items to make sure you can safely duel with autos and/or do enough damage with ult, then what?\nIf you don't know how to play the early game, you're forced to either throw or know how to at least be a competent/savvy split-pusher so you can farm up as much as possible. Plus, aiming his Steel Tempest (Q) can be a big pain due to the narrow range of its standalone cast, as well as trying to distance yourself from an E-to-Q combo without dashing too far past someone.\n\nThus he's also pretty broken in the sense in that his kit really does need some proper tweaks; he's been either bugged which makes him too difficult to manage, or he's been bugged to the point of being OP (to refer to Exil's video on balancing Yasuo). Yasuo's is far from easy, but he's has way too much appeal and if played right is a very strong pick.\n\nThus, I pretty much want to solely grind him in normals nowadays since bronze 3 is the highest I can go in ranked in my current state. The reason I play Yasuo is once again, he's THE samurai character. Wukong has been my original reason to play League back in Season 3, but Rito's vision of champion designs has not been so kind to the outdated monkey king (hence Wukong and even Yasuo himself have some very difficult lane matchups).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-25T09:49:55.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jWpmgktL,comment-id=000400020000,timestamp=2016-07-23T01:24:08.573+0000)\n>\n> We all can see your thinking on Yasuo.\n> \n> You like Yasuo, and you want him to be exclusive to you (just like i like Aurelion Sol being exclusive to me) the problem is Yasuo isn&#x27;t exclusive, he is THE most played champion in the game.\n> So rather than being exclusive by being one of the only people who plays him (which clearly isn&#x27;t the case), you are trying to find any other way of making sure that you are the only &#x27;true&#x27; Yasuo player and other people who play him don&#x27;t count.

I feel lvl7 yasou's may have really good mechanics (maybe even silver or higher level) but they never ward, they always push hard, they always go for that 5v1, they never take objectives and never join their team in a teamfight.
