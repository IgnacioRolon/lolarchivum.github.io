In lane, it should only ever be able to block one flip then be on cd permanantly until they recall or one of you roams to another lane. If melee tanks (since they're about the only ones who could rush banshees viably) are managing to avoid a single aa or poison tick for 40 seconds without losing a TON of farm in lane, then thats your fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-19T23:12:48.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does w proc it?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-04-20T01:49:24.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope.
