I&#039;m currently sitting on 470k mastery points with over 500 singed games in 3 seasons of league.\r\n\r\nUs singed mains in season 5 knew singed was bad but he was not trash teir, in season 6 he just got worse and now in season 7 hes pretty much unplayable. &quot;if i had a gun at my head and was told to climb in ranked i would pick nasus, even though i am a singed one trick&quot;\r\n\r\nYou may say &quot;but what about the dark seal stacking&quot; mate we only use that to SURVIVE lane phase.\r\n\r\nI have made a petition to have the information to show to riot that singed is in a really bad spot (because whenever we singed mains approach them about singed they tell us singed is op, or singed is in a great spot right now his win rate is solid (the only reason why singeds win rate is average is because only dedicated mains play him, regardless of how bad he is)\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with this, state your elo, your singed mastery points and years playing league before saying anything else.\r\n\r\nSinged Needs A Change. {{champion:27}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-20T09:40:44.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"/singed","replies":[]}]}
