Play simple champions that are very easy to play. this limits the amount of mistakes you can make on. (eg instead of playing stuff like yasuo and riven play annie or vlad) Simple wins elo. If your hard stuck in silver/bronze and mainly play{{champion:157}}{{champion:55}}{{champion:202}}{{champion:92}}{{champion:107}}{{champion:67}}, your not good enough as a player to climb with these champions, else you would not be hard stuck.\r\n2. Watch your replays and find out what you are doing wrong and what you could of done instead.\r\n3. Have a set champion pool that includes atleast 1-2 champions per role. eg: pick {{champion:122}} top lane, if {{champion:122}} is picked or banned play {{champion:83}} top lane\r\n4. Learn to be passive. You don&#039;t have to be the person who gets 20 kills and a penta every game, calm down.\r\n5. Never rage at other players, raging just makes yourself play worse and also your team, having a friendly team wins games. having a toxic team looses games.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-30T10:53:39.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good advice.

Simple kit with basically no real skillshots, high base damage, stupidly hard to kill, amazing utility, AoE stuns for 1.5s on a 4s cooldown, a revive the idiot button (sometimes you will be the idiot), suprising early-midgame burst, great roaming ability with his movespeed, good peel and kiting with slow-stun-slow-stun-infinite combo, easy waveclear, harass and good ranged autos for farming and can easily zone out the enemy when forcing a tower with his large range. Also since his farming is so fast and easy, he often encourages you to look around the map to see what you can do in the meantime whilst your minion wave is collapsing into the enemy tower.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T17:41:57.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take Zilean support against Sona, Zyra, Soraka, Morgana, Leona, Braum, Malz or Brand, I dare you xD","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-31T01:48:29.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"morgana (for her blackshield and ult), zyra (for her low mana costs and higher damage) and brand (for his ult->q->e->w zilean is screwed combo) are difficult matchups but I don't really see how the others are bad matchups. Zilean has excellent range and his stun can nullify alot of engages if you do it right, personally I feel alistair is more difficult to deal with than braum or leona since I can generally safely bully a leona out from range.\n\nSoraka and sona can kinda outshield your poke but again you outrange them and if you get get a stun on them they're both really squishy though you have to be careful not to get stunned by sona yourself once she comes out of stun since you may need to revive your adc if they turn around. Malzahar is annoying but again with your stun and revive so long as you yourself keep healthy (and with your movespeed dodging his damage is a piece of cake since his poke cast time is slow and the range is very broadcast) they won't be able to get to your adc. \n\nI don't play zilean into every matchup, and more often than not I'll adjust my picks for the teamcomp or to counter the enemy teamcomp (i.e. picking alistair or morgana into a blitzcrank) but I don't think zilean is half as bad as people say he is. I mean he feels really powerful and useful and he has among the best support winrates Euw and Kr and does well in most matchups (tends to do really badly against janna, nami, and zyra) although his Na winrates are amongst the lowest and granted his pick/ban rate is pretty much nonexistent. I still feel that zilean is a decent support.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-31T04:34:02.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can only speak from personal experience, and having a Zilean support has been a terrible experience for me in the past.\nI'm a relatively passive laner, more than willing to go in when I see a chance, and My Zilean's just don't seem to give me those chances? His stun isn't long enough, and doesn't do enough damage in the early game to be competitive against someone like Sona or Soraka who are able to get off 2-3Qs while Zil daddy just sort of stands there awkwardly.\n\nThat, and losing Cs to his mines >.<\n\nNo disrespect though, I've probably only played with bottom barrel retarded Zilean's, as I am in a bottom barrel retarded ELO XD","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-31T06:54:46.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also pretty bottom barrel myself, being somewhere between bronze and silver, but I believe that if you claim to be a zilean main, you shouldn't steal more than 4cs per game, excluding picking up waves when nobody else is nearby. I also don't really have any trouble trading or creating good stun setups. I don't see how zilean is bad support but none of my teammates seem to agree and I'll admit I've seen some bad zileans who can't do any of the things zilean is supposed to do.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-31T07:31:38.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually quite enjoyed this exchange with you, I shall look to future Zilean supports with hope and mild concern :P\n\nFrom the sounds of it though, I pray I never have to protect my carry from your Zilean :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2017-01-31T02:33:51.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean is alright if your good at landing double bombs.
