No matter what champion/style you're playing.\n\nNow you know what makes this worse?\nNothing stops it.\nEither by a bug that will never get fixed or intentional design Silver Bolts still applies even if Vayne is blinded like by Teemo's Blinding Dart or if the attack is negated by Jax's Counter Strike or Shen's aura ability that does basically the same thing as Counter Strike.\n\nOverall you don't need to be skill with Vayne's mechanics to make use of Silver Bolts, it's just auto attacking three times in a row.\nYes, there are CLEAR differences between a regular Vayne 99% of Vayne players and someone who is actually good with her the 1%, but being bat shit retarded you can still carry a game with Vayne just by smashing your face into the keyboard.\n\nYes, we all know Vayne is a Tank Shredding ADC.\nBut let's take a look at other Tank Shredders in the game shall we?\n{{champion:69}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:78}}  There are more, but I can't be bothered listing every anti-Tank champ in the game.\nEach of these champs are quite easily counterable.\nThey have clear weaknesses and strengths.\nTheir abilities that let them chew through Tanks/Brawlers are manageable and able to be countered to some extent by changing up your build.\n\nHow do you counter Vayne though?\nYou can't do anything by changing your items. Her damage doesn't care how much health or armour you have.\n{{champion:33}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3110}} {{item:1413}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3083}} \nThis build on Rammus net's you roughly 400+ armour and 300 AD. It destroys, and I mean completely eliminates any AD character, and is amazing against all AD teams.\nKnow what happens against Vayne?\nYou'd think the {{item:3143}} {{item:3110}} combo would work great against Vayne right? Wrong. She doesn't care.\n4-5 auto attacks and the Rammus is dead.\n\nApart from Silver Bolts Vayne is a pretty decent champion. Unfortunately Silver Bolts makes her the most broken champ in the game.\n\nI don't say this from the perspective of a player, from the perspective of someone in Silver.\nI say this as someone who is a scientist in real life, and has had quite a lot of experience in game design, modding and balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-19T23:00:36.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"personally I feel full burst shaco works pretty well at stopping vayne (though not much else lol and not in a teamfight without suiciding). You stealth in and use the q crit whilst firing e and hydra off the moment you hit her, then ult almost immediately since she most likely will use condemn you as soon as you appear. The shaco ult will let you dodge the condemn bolt (I'm not going to say this is mechanics because when in melee range this combo just has great timing to counter the bolt) and then just chase her down with both shaco's if she still lives and try to kill her before she get's another condemn.\nHopefully though, as shaco you camped her in lane, whilst getting fed. This allows you to have enough items to 1-shot her through midgame and try to close before she begins to scale up into the unstoppable monster we all know as lategame vayne. Also her silver bolts are good against tanks but as a full glass cannon the % hp damage is probably less than her aa's.\n\nVayne's exploitable weaknessess are hard cc, aoe damage, 1-shot glass cannon assassins, low lane pressure earlygame, below average earlygame, short aa range (pick caitlynn and watch her kill herself during laning phase), subpar pure teamwide dps in comparison to other adcs, straight out bad against objective seige teamcomps (again have a caitlynn and other long range champions with a hard frontline) and mainly in low elo 'vayne' syndrome where she'll always be out of position and pissing off her support.\n\nVayne's strengths are extreme lategame, chokepoint fights, 2v2s and 3v3s, dueling, selfpeel, strong against and with dive and chaotic based teamcomps, mobility and close range 1v5 outplay potential.\n\nLike with alot of champions, play to the strengths and weaknesses of a champion. I know I'm Bronze but I assure you, most of that is the fact that I have the mechanics of a potato and alot of higher elo players will agree (and be surprised a bronze person like me is saying it).","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-20T12:17:56.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CC is not a specific weakness of a champion and NEVER should be counted as such.\n\nEvery champion falls to CC, not even Olaf is an exception.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T00:50:29.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"new rengar now, passive is like olaf ult, rengar cant fall to cc if he plays passively, then in a few seconds its up again, maybe if it removed cc, but didnt stop incoming cc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-20T16:25:28.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but it's stronger vs some champions than others. I mean ccing a nasus, alistair, olaf, darius, sion, malphite, rammus, taric is soo much less 'dead' than if you cc an adc or someone like zed or a soraka who can be bursted down very quickly.\n\nCC does work against pretty much every champion, but it doesn't affect all champions equally and for some being cc'd is more an inconvenience than a death sentence unless it can be chained with alot of other big abilities. If I land an annie stun on a full tank nasus, it's going to hurt, but unless he's out of position he's probably not going to die or even really be low hp. If I stun a vayne though she's most likely going to die since she relies on dodging abilities with her tumble and using her mobility and tumble to give her survivability.\n\nYou are trying to argue that cc doesn't counter vayne because cc can be used on everyone but last time I checked, if I cc an olaf in a teamfight I'm probably just trying to peel him off since he's got 4k hp and lots of armour and mr and is straight up running through my team. If I cc a vayne however she has 1400hp and almost no resistances. Now without mobility they're just going to have to stand there and take it. Are you saying that the cc isn't more devastating for her than olaf?\n\nIf I see a vayne I'm picking something simple with either lots of burst or something with lots of simple point and click cc. If you think CC doesn't 'counter' vayne feel free to keep feeling that way and have fun getting 1v5'd since nobody can stop her from rolling over your team. And yes I understand mercurial scimitar is an item, but few people buy it and can use it, and even if they do, just have 2 hard simple ccs and voila, vayne can't 1v5 you anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-21T02:00:47.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because it's stronger, doesn't mean it is a targeted counter.\nA counter is something that outright breaks the balance, even in equal skill match ups.\n\nFor example Morgana rose to power in season three thanks to the popularity of Thresh and Leona.\nWhy? Because Morgana outright counters the both of them.\n\nYou also fail to address the glaring issues with Vayne.\nLike for instance Vayne being a Marksman should entirely be countered by champions/abilities that counter Marksmen like Teemo's Blinding Dart or Jax's Counter Strike.\nBut she isn't. \nSilver Bolts still applies through these abilities and more, she doesn't need to land an auto attack to actually apply Silver Bolts, she just needs to perform the animation.\n\nI never said it's impossible to stop Vayne either, I don't know where you got that.\nIt's possible, but more often than not it's not worth doing or attempting.\nIf you're yoloQ there's no chance in fuck you'll have a team coordinated enough to do it.\nIf you're in a premade, then the enemy team will be a premade as well and it will do everything it can to protect the Vayne.\nYou ever play Rengar or Kha'Zix against a 4-5 man premade? after the 10 minute mark you'll never get anyone alone to kill, and if you pick them in Draft Pick or Dynamic you can bet your arse there will be 3 knock ups to protect the Vayne.\n\nOh and look at that, Vayne is getting buffed for next season with the removal of pink wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-21T05:58:39.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha I don't understand the pink thing either. It's not like you see people dropping pinks much even in higher elo and you'll almost never see anyone do it in silver or bronze. \nAlso your definition of counter is alot more case specific than mine and it's not relevant to the argument since realistically riot does't want any 'absolute' counters in the game anyway. Nothing in this game is an absolute counter like you are saying and by that logic any champion can be broken. I'm not saying vayne is or isn't a little overpowered, and honestly she's a pain to deal with, however she isn't exactly broken. The definition of a 'counterpick' is something that has an inherent advantage or can be used to prevent a certain tactic or play from being utilised. This is not an absolute and aside from game breaking bugs or poorly balanced reworks and releases, nothing can absolutely counter something else; however, certain matchups are better than others.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-20T12:31:57.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True damage man, an element that shouldn't exist","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-20T21:26:58.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True damage is fine, it exists in plenty of healthy formats.\n\nMaster Yi, Irelia, red buff.\n\nIt is not fine in Vayne's context.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-21T00:53:18.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not master yi, but how about, turns his auto attacks into magic dmg, so if an enemy champ builds armour to counter you,  u get magic dmg, but maybe a toggled spell with a decent mana cost, turn off if enemy has mr, and keep the E passive","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dengpao","date":"2016-10-21T06:54:15.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i was going to say u must be below platinum with that kind of conclusion.
