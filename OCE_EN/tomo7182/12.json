For.. his wall? That you'll likely land in the slow again? The damage? Hate to say it, but its the old  Rock Paper Sciccors point of view, some champs have it over others, whilst they struggle against other champs and outright get dominate by some also.\n\nSo Trundle shouldn't be killable by Maokai unless Mao has had a great game with farm, kills and is snowballing and trundle has been kept down, but late game even farm, considering the rock paper sciccors thing again. Unless you dedicate every item to dropping Trundle. Don't expect Maokai to stop him solo without help from your team.\n\nIt's like people forget Moba's are a team game, there's not supposed to glory in every moment for every champion. That's what your team is for, to make up for the things you cannot do, as you provide them with things they do not have.","replies":[{"poster":"Illidalian","date":"2016-04-26T22:17:04.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very well said. I seem to find so many people forget this.\n\nEspecially playing norms. When you know you're laning against a counter, and you outright cant do anything but sit under your tower.. then get flamed for making no 'contribution' to the game because you have no kills.\n\nThere seems to be a stigma around where League is a 'Team Deathmatch' and the only thing that matters to win the game is kills, and being solo top (for example) means you're on your own.. You don't need any help.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-27T02:41:37.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some are still padawans thinking they are deserving to be Lord Emperor, you must have wisdom, not just strength young one.\n\nGive it time.

QSS is getting nerfed so things like trundle ult, zed death mark and i think fiora ult, all dont get removed with QSS. see to you, you dont wanna play trundle, since hes now strong, so you complain about trundle. but your opinion is bias, because you say there is a singular problem, the problem is specifically one thing, QSS, and you want THAT to have a better effect on the game, by having a better reason to buy it and keep it for the late game, i.e. more build paths. you're saying this 1 ultimate change is \"needed\" and you'll assume it is the best possible course of action for riot and their game\n\nhow bout you go into about 4000-5000 words explaining how you plan to balance every single other newly arisen unbalanced champion/abilities/combinations/interactions about the impact of the different QSS path/s on the game, just because of 1 champion having QSS being built against him for 1 ability? do you think you can manage this or is spelling maokai correctly, twice, too much to ask of someone anyway?","replies":[]}]}
