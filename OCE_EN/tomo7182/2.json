They are the only 2 ways around it, if you bring back solo queue every solo player can actully play again.\r\nFix dynamic and make it fair on solo&#039;s by only pairing with other solo&#039;s.\r\n(This is coming from a person who has put $250 plus into this game over the years and jesus the games turned to shit because of dynamic queue)\r\n\r\nBefore you ask me &quot;why don&#039;t you get a team and do premade?&quot; think about it, playing with a 5 man premade until your challenger wouldn&#039;t give you a legit rank it&#039;s cheating the system, that may aswell be ranked fives or ranked threes.\r\n\r\nAlso honestly what sounds better?\r\n\r\nI SOLO&#039;D MY WAY TO DIAMOND BY MYSELF.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nI WAS IN A 5 MAN PREMADE AND GOT DIAMOND BECAUSE MY TEAM CARRIED ME EVERY GAME.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-24T15:02:09.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lots of people prefer to play with teammates not because they have something to brag about, but its generally more fun.\n\nAnd your not playing russian roulette when queueing up.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2016-04-25T00:08:40.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats what norms are for, for friends to play with each other or solo players to practice.

You lose. No, that is what League of Legends is for. It's a game to play, whether it's with your friends or not. The fact that you make a post dedicated to hating on people who play ranked with their friends is just ridiculous. You are allowed to have fun playing a game with your friends, and its not earning a \"free rank\". And even if it was, they are allowed to do it.\n\nWho are you to tell people that playing games with their friends is wrong. You go on about getting to Diamond on your own but you were Silver last season and Bronze so far this season. Look, how does having the enemy team be premade effect you? You are complaining that it's bad for them to be getting a \"free\" rank, so doesn't that just mean your going up against more coordinated opponents?
