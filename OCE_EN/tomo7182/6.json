Supports are just put in anywhere and every where. Instead of being placed with teams that are on the same skill level.\nWhy would anyone want to support a B5 game with a ADC that gets 35 cs at ten mins. 55 at 20 and then the game ends at 50 mins and that ADC I was talking about has finally gotten to 100 cs.\n\nSo as support for this game. You are either flamed at for not dying with them or flamed at for watching them die.\nBut what can you do. \nRiot has made support the mostt hate role and they have done nothing to fix it. You either go Damage support like Lux brand morg or even veigar or you spend the game hitting your head against the key board as you try not to be ban.\n\nThey want people to be support.

I used to que as a mid/support. But when i got supp i played leona, naught or sona.. You know real supports.. No matter how hard i played, How well i pinged i was stuck in b5 for 2 seasons of grinding support, 2 days ago i stopped selecting support now in 24 hours or not supporting i have climbed to b3. This inst huge for all you plats and gold out there but seriously after so long in elo hell as a supp knowing not playing supp lets you actaully affect the flow of the game makes me wonder why anyone does it. \n\nnot to mention the complete lack of respect supports get, There is just no incentive to play support.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-06T15:37:30.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play pretty much only Nami in ranked. Last season, got to Gold from Bronze 3 in 3~ weeks. This season got to Gold from S3 in like 40 games.\n\nI'm not saying it's easy, but a good support can do a lot for a game. Even a mediocre ADC can carry a game with a good support on their side.\n\nThat said, I think it depends a lot on level of play as well. By high silver/gold players are usually much more consistent so supporting has a greater impact. My suggestion would be to duo with an ADC, so even if they are sometimes unreliable, you can learn how they play and how best to support them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T03:08:36.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"S5 i almost got to S5, but someone said bronze for lyfe and ruined it for me, i climbed all the way from B5 and that 1 jackass ruined it for me, (and yes, i sion support climbed that whole way, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Worrior697","date":"2016-12-06T10:30:10.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/156845049/550209?tab=overview\n\nMy point.
