You never know how experienced they are, what's going on in their life or about any number of other factors. League, let alone Ranked, is stressful to a lot of people. When it comes to particularly stressful situations people tend to not think clearly and get frustrated. Add anonymity on top of that and you've found yourself a place to vent. Sure it sucks, and I'm not condoning it, but it's probably not worth the effort reading into any instance too deep.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-21T01:59:37.556+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please note that discussions pertaining to religion aren't allowed in this sub-board (please keep discussions related to Player Behaviour). \n\nContinuing to post about religion here may lead to content removal and a warning or punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2016-06-21T02:22:04.913+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Political Correctness Zelotism at its finest!\n\nReligion is behavioural.\nThis person being discussed is a player\n\nPlayer + Behavior = Player behaviour\n\nit fits under this category","replies":[{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2016-06-21T04:38:12.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy still wants to carry on....smh....THIS guy's attitude is why people rage in LoL.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-23T13:39:17.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean I'm no religio but I didn't know it was behavioural!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-21T02:24:34.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Amen. \n\nI mean,_Uwon shayos kaya_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2016-06-20T08:15:51.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"TitanosaurusRekt","date":"2016-06-20T16:54:19.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why did you feel the need to bring your prejudice against religion, (and, considering this is OCE I'm confident in assuming your are referring to the Bible) into a thread about League of Legends' players' behaviours??\n\nObviously you are entitled to your 'opinion' on matters of faith as I am. I choose to be Christian.

A game is typically something that one engages in for amusement.

Hence why some don't like to group when the time calls, rage for 'ksing', or troll/flame when a mistake it made. So i think people DO think in this game, it's just usually about themselves :P","replies":[]}]}
