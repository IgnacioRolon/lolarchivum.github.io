Hyper carry adc&#039;s {{champion:67}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:222}} \r\nWith the current adc meta being hyper carry late game focused either one of these champions are ban worthy, vayne and jinx are common mained champions and are always a good ban.\r\n\r\n#2. High skill capped champions. {{champion:64}} {{champion:157}} \r\nYasuo is one of those champions that always go 0/10 on your team but go 15/2 on their team. did you know by banning yasuo your team is 90% less toxic in champion select?\r\nLee sin is a VERY annoying champion to deal with on your team or on the enemies team, alot of lower ranked lee sin players are always thinking about how they can outplay the enemy by going in 1v5 then flash ult&#039;ing a carry. the thing they don&#039;t put into their mind: the amount of cc, how squishy am i.\r\n\r\n#3. Early game champions. {{champion:119}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:80}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:91}}  {{champion:62}} \r\nIn some games if one of these champions get fed its a very hard time to stop them unless you manage to stall the game out until late game where they  fall off.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-16T03:01:51.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty good summary especially point #2.
