Masteries are at least somewhat understandable, it adds a way to try unique playstyles (other than item builds, different spell orders, position, the one of over one hundred champions you choose). This doesn&#039;t seem to be the philosophy, though, as since I&#039;ve been playing they&#039;ve become really restrictive and very obvious. Probably for the purposes of balancing. Which leads me to another point:\r\n\r\nWhy have all these extraneous variables to balance? The leveling system itself means in order to have an enjoyable experience for new players you would have to balance at every level, which I doubt Riot does. And, I mean, why even have the leveling system?\r\n\r\nAt first I thought &#039;well it&#039;s for matchmaking purposes&#039;, but clearly it&#039;s not since, at risk of repeating myself, PEOPLE GET MATCHED UP AGAINST PLAYERS WITH SUMMONER SPELLS THAT ARE LEVEL RESTRICTED FOR THEM.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell is the point of half this crap? Runes are a very obvious IP sink, which I guess translates to a time sink, which I guess translates to more money for Riot. I suppose it&#039;s the same with leveling outside the game as well. Like, psychologically if people level up they&#039;re going to be more psychologically committed to the game.\r\n\r\nSo, is that it? Are these just cheap tricks for Riot to prioritise profits over gameplay? If so I think I&#039;ll vote with my wallet and buy the God pack for SMITE.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-03-20T00:46:13.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Why do people without access to certain summoner spells get matched with a team full of players who have those summoner spells?\nI can't get flash at my level, which is pretty obviously a powerful spell, yet every enemy I come up against has flash.\n\nOur server is pretty small, and therefore matchmaking is a bit messed up. At level 5, if you were to queue up with the expectation of only being matched with other level 5s (or people with the same summoners availiable), you could be waiting years. All summoner spells unlock at level 10, so you don't have to level that much to access them (especially with the halved exp)\n\n>Why restrict access to certain summoner spells? Are they meant to be a reward for leveling outside the actual game? Why? Isn't that what masteries and runes are for?\n\nFor people who have never played a MOBA, starting league of legends is like being hit by 10 trucks full of information. Riot wanted to make the game more accessible, so they designed it so you unlock things by levelling up. The easier to use spells are unlocked quicker (ones where you don't have to target anything), so new users can start getting used to having so many spells to cast. \n\nOn this note, one big thing that always comes up is the jungling spell {{summoner:11}} . \nThe late introduction of smite is a really good idea. By hastening the introduction of the \"jungle\" role, it allows new summoners to have a firm grasp of laning dynamics and what some of the basic champions you encounter in low level games do. It sets then up for further success when they do start to jungle, as they have been in a lane and know how they work. On top of this, jungling without runes and masteries is ridiculously hard (even if you know what you are doing), and most junglers you will run into pre-25 are smurfs. Most games you don't actually need a jungler.\n\n>What extra purpose do both masteries AND runes serve? Masteries are at least somewhat understandable, it adds a way to try unique playstyles (other than item builds, different spell orders, position, the one of over one hundred champions you choose).\n\nMasteries and runes both provide an extra level of decision making, to make each game experience unique. You can switch up your masteries for different strengths and take a different keystone for that extra power. Masteries tend to help in the early game, as well as allow you to keep your edge in the late game.\n\nMost people take flat runes, for the purpose of covering their weaknesses in the early game or to buff their strengths so they can snowball. People can also take scaling runes so that they don't fall off into late game. Runes and masteries are all about[ creating meaningful choices.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-meaningful-choices). \n\nYou can pick up the two basic rune pages for pretty cheap. (don't by runes until level 20 and have unlocked tier 3)\n\nAD page (cost all up= 8,610 IP)\n**Quints** (big ones) - 3 x attack damage\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9x armour\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x attack damage\n**Glyph** (blue) - 9 x magic resist\n\nAP page (cost all up= 10,455 or 12,300 if you go for AP over MP)\n**Quints** (big ones) - 3 x ability power\n**Seal** (yellow) - 9x armour\n**Mark** (red) - 9 x magic pen\n**Glyph **(blue) - 9 x magic resist or ability power\n\n(Costs are a lot cheaper than shown, as I calculated this of S4 rune prices as well as the fact that you can use the same runes for different pages without having to buy more).\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n* Server too smol for balanced pre-30 match making\n\n\n* Runes and masteries are all about[ creating meaningful choices.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/lol-design-values-depth-meaningful-choices)\n\n\n* Starting league is like being hit by 10 trucks of info, Riot decides to make it easer by spacing these trucks out, unlocking things as you level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-20T00:11:00.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Matchmaking between levels 1 to 29 are horrible and are nothing to judge the game by.\n\nIt used to be that you would play against bots until level 10-15, then against humans until level 30.\nI'm not sure if this is still the fastest way to level considering the EXP requirements were just halved, but it would decrease your problem of matching against people who have every summoner spell already unlocked.\n\nAs for runes and masteries, don't really worry about those until you're level 30.\nYou can make some general mastery pages while levelling however runes are useless until you can get tier 3 runes at level 20.\n\nThe \"correct\" runes and masteries can change one's play style quite a lot.\nI wont go into masteries, but I will give a jungler's perspective on runes.\n\nSo a lot of junglers have different ways they can take an advantage in the early game if they use certain runes.\nOne of my favourite champions Diana {{champion:131}} can take AP/Pen Runes or Attack Speed/Armour runes to help with her early game clear, or even possible that there are other combinations that will help more.\nWhile for another champ I love playing Sion {{champion:14}} you could take armour runes, or Attack Damage runes, personally I love taking %MAX Health runes as they work great with Soul Furnace's passive and Cinderhulk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-03-19T12:25:58.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it all just comes down to leagues pro scene. League is a super competitive game and once you start playing ranked and it actually matters how well you and your team does you will start to understand a lot more about these things. They try and balance the champions for the very high elo players because that is where the money is, and to be honest it doesn't really matter about the pre-level 30s because I bet you a high ranked player could play any champion without any summoners and still beat a level one player 1v5 The game is way more about skill and knowledge than anything else. I get that it is unfair how they restrict summoner spells for low-level players but They want you to learn them as you level up and see what ones suit you the best. For example; When I was only just starting the game I eventually got cleanse unlocked and took that pretty much every game. I got super good at using it and it became my go to summoner for pretty much every champion. I could make just as many out plays and escapes with it than I do now with flash. It all came down to how good are you at using it. Rather than what the spell actually is. Runes can make a huge difference in your champion's power and the diverse range of them allows players to really fine tune the pages to individual play styles and champions. It does take time to get the IP for them but, If you don't want to put the effort into playing the game ... then why even play in the first place?? It really all just boils down to the fact that Riot is a company, they want to make money, they support the high elo players and try to do things for the low elo but not on the same level. Just relax and enjoy playing the game, take some free to play champs into a game and just have fun. Don't worry about all the unfair/ unbalanced things. If you understand the masteries, get a good rune page, practice any champion that you enjoy playing and have a good understanding of the game in general. You are pretty much guarantied to do well. I am not trying to shoot you down here. I just want you to know that This is a free to play game. with a huge community and support. it is not pay to win in any way and is very different to most games you can find nowadays. Just have fun. That is what games are for. and if you're not having fun playing it. Just move on and find something that is fun. Life is too short to get hung up on being annoyed at something that is designed to be fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-03-19T11:50:06.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"because there aren't enough players to match equal level players against equal level players, unless you're willing to wait even longer.\n\nrunes and masteries increase stats and give certain bonuses. masteries, outside of keystones, are minor buffs that make your character a bit stronger. Runes you have to buy, and aren't worth buying until you can get tier 3 runes, which is level 20+. they are large stat boosts to your champs.\n\nriot doesn't balance at every level, because frankly anything below level 30 doesn't really matter. all that matters to riot is ranked, 80% competitive level, so top 0.1%, and the rest of the ranked ladder makes up the other 20% of balance.\n\nand there's a levelling system so that new players can't just jump straight into ranked and ruin games for people because they're shit. its a way of introducing you to the game and a way for you to improve and familiarise yourself with the game and its mechanics.","replies":[]}]}
