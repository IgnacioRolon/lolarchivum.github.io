Been playing since release, but never really got into ranked.\n\n~~Main is Karma {{champion:43}}~~ \n\n_edit:_ **Have benched Karma for the time being and am having a really fun time playing Taric support; and i have reached mastery 7 with him in a short time;** \n\nbut am decent with more obscure, less-played supports like Sion, Viktor, Tahm and Poppy.\ni play these types of champs because of the unpredictability compared to the usual meta.\nMy go-to junglers are usually Skarner and Sion, but looking to expand on this eventually.\nMost supports i play can also do fine jungling (except Karma is not as effective gank-wise)\n\nCurrently in ~~Silver V in season 6~~ **_Bronze 2 for season 7_**, having a lot of win streaks, then loss streaks, so a big reason for this post is to find other people so my games have a bit more team reliability (skillwise).\n\nHit me up and just **_mention this post_** so i know what your message is about. Thanks!\n\nOceania\nName: skinnerz\nrole(s): Supp/top/fill\n\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=skinnerz","replies":[{"poster":"skinnerz","date":"2017-02-20T00:04:53.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bumped","replies":[]},{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-09-25T00:32:02.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im happy to play ranked with you, im a top main i prioritise {{champion:157}}  if he isnt banned but if he is i can play a powerful {{champion:36}}","replies":[]}]}
