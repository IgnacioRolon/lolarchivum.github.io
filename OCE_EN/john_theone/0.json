Also, I like to have my offline friends visible on the list so I know that they are not online by actually seeing that they are not online rather than not finding their names on the &#039;online friends list&#039;. \r\n\r\nThe old client when I selected these options, sorting alphabetically and un-hiding offline friends, would give me first a list of online friends in order of their alphabet from A to Z THEN have the list of offline friends after that from A to Z. However, the new client just lists all the players from A to Z then greys out the offline ones and coloring the online ones. \r\n\r\nThe old way was much more user friendly and easily readable. I wish Riot will consider this and either give us an option to use the old client style or simply roll it back to how it used to be.","replies":[]}
