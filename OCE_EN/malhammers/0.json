They also weakened his passive slightly while raising the ratios that scale from AP as well. \n\nWhile Ekko will still be strong in utility I can see these changes greatly impacting his win rate. Sure he's hard to kill but that's what makes him so strong. His ability to outplay but building magic resist and using CC to stop him right before he ults can win games. \n\nI don't think Riot's goal is to gut ekko's utility because that's what makes ekko so strong, but rather make it less viable to play as a pure tank than build AP like you would normally as an assassin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-04-20T01:15:08.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you must be a salty top laner who doesn't have a large champion pool and plays with bad teammates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antenora","date":"2016-05-04T12:27:50.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank Fizz\nTank Akali\n\nHell even Tank Talon could do with being hit next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-04-21T13:25:12.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is what it is man.

This would make it almost impossible to lane against him since he has a shield that reduces damage and has insane damage that he can deal to you.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-21T13:30:05.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its damage reduction and cc immunity for 3 sec after its procced, including the proccing ability.

Right now, it's just easier to go tank on champs like ekko or akali because of their high base damage. Once the new AP items are released some are expecting that they'll go back to being AP again. I personally think that unless they change their base damage, these champions will always find it more rewarding to go tank. There's just less risk in the tank build and their damage output is good enough. Also these champions aren't currently having issues with the AP items so I don't see why these new items would change this. Maybe the sustain on these items will persuade them a bit better, but only time can tell for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-04-20T09:56:16.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the patch","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-20T04:32:28.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you know the nerfs aren't enough, its literally been a couple hours LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-20T01:23:59.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just curious, why are you ranting in OCE server?","replies":[]}]}
