About 80% of the matches I play with him we lose and I don&#039;t know what to do. One of the main problems is that he can&#039;t get used to any of the champions I suggest to him like Garen, Ashe, Nasus, Lux, etc... The only champion he likes to play is Master yi but he only likes to play him in the adc role and hates going jungle lane. Its very difficult trying to teach him about cs (creep score), last hitting, and map awareness because he forgets about it the next day. I don&#039;t know what to do because if I try to teach him about a champion he starts getting bored of the game. Its not like I hate playig with him, in fact I really enjoy it he&#039;s very funny but I really wish I could move on to ranked with him. Any suggestions as to how I can help him? Is there an adc that would be worth him learning so that I could go support and teach him?","replies":[{"poster":"Asurine","date":"2018-11-23T11:25:35.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get LS to coach him","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-11-21T04:35:44.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he's new he just needs more games. It's newbie stubbornness and why bronze exists, people who think they know what they're doing and head into rank at level 30 then lose every placement game and flame their team. They stay hard stuck bronze for a season until they realise they need to improve and actually learn the game properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-21T04:47:05.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fun fact, when I started playing I was convinced clarity was the best summoner spell to take because more mana means more abilities and that has to be good.\n\nFastest way to learn is to play with/against people better than you imo (though no so much better you can't tell what's happening).","replies":[{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-11-21T07:55:41.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AKWV2HYX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-11-21T04:47:05.218+0000)\n>\n> Fun fact, when I started playing I was convinced clarity was the best summoner spell to take because more mana means more abilities and that has to be good.\n> \n> Fastest way to learn is to play with/against people better than you imo (though no so much better you can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s happening).\n\ni liked ghost because i hadnt unlocked flash yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-11-21T05:25:06.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first started I played with diamond and platinum friends and they'd just flame me and tell me to build tank.
