EVEN THOU YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE A BOT.\nThey move the same place over and over. But yet Riot allows them to continue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-21T16:32:28.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, its still happening (game just happened a few minutes ago). 4 bots vs 2 bots.

I'm not certain what that reason is, maybe understaffed to deal with the issue, or maybe it increases their server population and makes the end of year figures look better.  \nWhatever the reason is, I have to believe its a active choice by riot to ignore this issue.\nI've posted several times over the years with simple suggestions, methods of finding and recognising bots without the need of in game observers or reports, given data on when the bots are most active.  (Seriously, op.gg a bot and check out how many aram games are played at 4am in the morning, its crazy)\n\nOn a side note, the AI on this latest batch of bots is a lot better.  \nWho knows, maybe riot are hoping to hire these bot makers and they are just waiting until they perfect the programming. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-02-17T04:33:59.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play ARAM????","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Aria","date":"2018-02-18T04:23:05.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=kNzsWHc3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-17T04:33:59.822+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t play ARAM????\n\nYes, brilliant solution to the bot problem... thanks...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2018-02-19T02:06:07.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Perfect situation to practice inner peace when ur entire team is feeding because they are bots\n\nPerfect situation to practice compassion when the entire enemy team are bots but one player...","replies":[]}]}
