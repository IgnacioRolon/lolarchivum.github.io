Our service focuses on creating the best connection possible for gaming, and only gaming!  If you care about your connection, and want the best online experience possible, then you NEED to use WTFast!  \n\nSo basically let's break down what this actually means.\n\nYour connection to league of legends generally goes through several different IP's and such to get to where it needs to, WTF basically tries to make this route shorter.\n\nThe problem being, WTF can't actually change what your ISP want's you to go through (which is in most cases the actual problem) and can only produce minor results when it comes to gaming in Australia in general.\n\nI have a suggestion for you.\n\nGo to here https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2 And run the Tracert for the OCE server, it gives you all the information you will need to actually talk with riot to try and find out the problem you are facing (however it could just be distance to the server depending on where you live)\n\nThis will enable you to be able to find out if it's an ISP issue, a riot issue, or any issue inbetween and go towards fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Huskk","date":"2016-07-20T02:55:17.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://pasteboard.co/dAoNAIJCB.png","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-07-19T10:10:21.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WTFast actually doesn't work and it has been proven (based on my readings and stuff) but one thing that worked for me was using the Ethernet cable which was basically connecting your laptop/desktop to the router directly and using LAN, ping went down from 150 to 30","replies":[{"poster":"Huskk","date":"2016-07-20T02:53:58.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am unable to do this, otherwise i would have done it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-19T08:26:19.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like it might be a problem with your ISP, however let's first rule out anything on your end by having you run through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article, if nothing there helps could you please do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
