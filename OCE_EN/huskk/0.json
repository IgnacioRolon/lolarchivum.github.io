(Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes)\n  * 103.240.227.5\n* Once adequate time has passed, stop the traceroute, export your results as text.\n* Run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/).\n* Post back with a link to your WinMTR results (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this) and the url to your ICSI netalyzr results.","replies":[]}]}
