This game has taught me how to control my anger and how I would respond to the constant toxicity via the rage quits, trolls and the people who can&#039;t think of any better insult than &quot;cancer&quot; and &quot;down&#039;s&quot; to describe the one bad game with taric or gangplank I had. I remember once how I had been flamed constantly just because I picked ezreal though I didn&#039;t even perform badly. Another time I remember how the 0/8 lee sin went afk in frustration after making flashy plays even though nobody was around.  But those days are in the past... \r\nNow with university life drawing ever so closer, I have decided to make my decision to abandon this game forever. It was fun riot while it lasted, it was fun indeed.\r\nPS: your game is still full of toxic people who just love to describe everybody as &quot;autistic&quot; though I commend those who have the blessing of good manners and the will to not join the ranks of such people","replies":[]}
