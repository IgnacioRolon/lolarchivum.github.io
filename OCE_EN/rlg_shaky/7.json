It's not just about the Morgana shield which denies you of your stun, but Sion having an aoe gap closer, 3 CCs: 1 slow and 2 knockups. Renekton would have also been a bigger pressure at Top lane due to early game pressure (huge damage and snowball potential) than Sion. Renekton also does better than Sion against Teemo due to the double gap closer, 2 second stun and sustain (very important against a Teemo due to the constant harass).","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T09:00:51.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a normals game.\nThe Sion top wanted to go top. I tried out Renekton jungle before and he was alright, can stun well and has high damage with tankiness so I picked him for jungle. I'm not too flustered about it now, it was clear we were still going to have a lot of difficulties in teamfights anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-06-11T14:52:39.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we had a game where my 'new to the game' mate, fed a ryze till he was 20/2 and he took three ults to kill him due to him having so much spell vamp that we just couldn't take him... it was a hard game and no matter what we did we still lot, he was a monster.. everyone else had counter play and we could at least try a duel or team fight but when he came along then we fled cause he could 3 shot us... played a few lately and he's just broken, FIX PLEASE RIOT :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-11T15:03:01.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agreed with you up until you said rengar and ahri need nerfs. instant way of making them useless. play. a damn. tank. ahri solo queue is literally the least threatening mid laner when snowballed. easy to come back against her with any meta mid laner.","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-11T15:28:08.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qVsbaYV9,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2015-06-11T15:03:01.809+0000)\n>\n> i agreed with you up until you said rengar and ahri need nerfs. instant way of making them useless. play. a damn. tank. ahri solo queue is literally the least threatening mid laner when snowballed. easy to come back against her with any meta mid laner.\n\nI think why I picked Rengar and Ahri is because of the nature of soloque. You lack communication, lack teamwork and most importantly unable to make the correct calls. These two champions are extremely mobile and for that reason alone can make great plays all the way up to plat.\nIf you get Rengar 1 kill it would be enough for him to out damage and play most of his opponents. With that Rengar's roaming potential exponentially multiplies and without pink ward/correct calls can cause havoc in other lanes. I'd actually just say lower his range by a little on his passive. It's simply outrageous the distance he can cover at level 18...\nAhri however was just a biased choice. She just counters too much of my favourite champions.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T08:59:04.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I would make the range increase the last perk on Rengar's Bonetooth Necklace passive. It's really strong for the minimal number of kills you can get with it. Also, Rengar needs to lose half a counter of a stack every-time he dies. If he has 3 stacks and he dies, he loses the 1st bonus but can regain it with a kill turning it into 3.5 stack/kill thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-12T06:59:39.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with Ekko. Seriously I hate that champion so much right now.  He's a hassle in lane and even in teamfights, its like having a 6th player there since he can always ult and regain most of his hp. \nSecondly, I hate Katarina. Even though she's easy to beat in lane, she roams.. and kat will always find that one really sucky player on the game and kill them over and over to get fed and then she's sort of unstoppable... Pisses me off how many games i would've won, but lost because someone fed kat. \n\nBesides these two, I'm quite fine with everyone else :3","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-12T08:56:15.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:92}} has existed way before {{champion:245}} though. And she's literally the AD version of him. You are forced to play defensively/passively, except you can dodge two of Ekko's main damage abilities relatively well.","replies":[]}]}]}
