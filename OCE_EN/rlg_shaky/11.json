It only occurs if she does it to an enemy with more health % than her. That means, ultimately, you're chasing her because you've gotten her onto that lower health, which means there's room for counter-play.\n\nIf she does go in on you when you're low health, expect the stun, and play around it. Like, wait for her to lose her blade-surge on a minion or something, and then go ham with ignite.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-01-30T00:28:38.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IS THIS THE RETURN OF BETTER NERF IRELIA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-29T06:28:32.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pls no nerf my Irelia :(\n\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-29T06:30:03.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she to strong, even playing her i feel disgusting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-01-28T13:54:15.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Troll thread?
