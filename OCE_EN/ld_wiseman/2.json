We both have previous experience in playing in teams and I&#039;ve had small amounts of experience shot calling. \r\n\r\nMy champ pool can be expanded where necessary but generally what I play is Ahri, Azir, Leblanc, TF and Viktor. The jungler&#039;s champ pool is Hecarim, Rek&#039;Sai, Sejuani and Skarner. \r\n\r\nWe are both usually available Friday night&#039;s, all of Saturday, and all of Sunday(not jungler, he is available Sunday night) \r\n\r\nWe can use either Skype or Discord for voice communication if needed. We are also definitely not toxic and will not flame any other members of the team (or opponents). But we will give (and take) constructive criticism so that everyone can improve.\r\n\r\nI am currently a Plat 5 mid laner \r\n-http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=ld+wiseman\r\n\r\nAnd my jungler is Plat 3\r\n-http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=beetletank","replies":[{"poster":"Freakin Out","date":"2016-09-13T11:13:03.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Guys,\n\nI'm a gold III main support who can off jg.\n\nI was in a very active team last season and we had 3 successful teams ranked Gold V,III, I - however my team is no longer playing, hence why I'm here looking for another team of the same rank who is very active.\n\nI'm very active and have a fantastic attitude - please add me in game if you would like to tea something up.\n\nCheers,\nJohnny","replies":[]},{"poster":"italiaN pr1de","date":"2016-09-12T00:08:58.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u need a top laner platinum add me:\ncontractz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Judaking3","date":"2016-09-11T22:46:36.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be keen to start something up.
