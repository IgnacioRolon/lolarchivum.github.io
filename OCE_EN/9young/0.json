The toxicity you see is usually a player that 90% of the time is neutral - positive in their behaviour BUT they have that **one** bad day. Sometimes this is compounded because multiple players have that **one** bad game/day in the same game.\n> \n> Our approach to deal with players like this is to first try and reform them.
