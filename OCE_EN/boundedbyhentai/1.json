They are there for a reason. They aren't going to be playing the way you want them to, and you are going to have to accept this.  You probably aren't playing the way they want you to either. \n\nYou have to get rid of the **\"I must carry my potato team\"** mentality, and switch to a **\"I must work with my potato team to secure objectives and share resources\"**. If you stick to the first mentality, you are less likely to share kills and CS, so if you die your whole team goes down with you. Second mentality makes everyone feel valued and you have are able to hold more easily if a member of your team dies. \n\n[Ideally, you should join/create a premade team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). As you know, bronze V is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots. Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-10T14:21:35.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">As you know, bronze V is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots.

I know that there are two ways to get out of bronze. \n\n1. Look at yourself, look at what you are doing well and what you can improve.\n2. Climb as a premade to reduce the toxins and so you can communicate and have more chance at winning the game.\n\nI also know that the majority of bronze players, especially those in low bronze, are unlikely to take heed of anything I write in regards to point one. Apparently they \"all deserve to be higher\" but are stuck in \"elo hell\" due their \"teams/lag being the reason they aren't reaching their true potential\".\n\nThis leaves point two. Pushing the premade 5, dynamic queue agenda. Due to dynamic queue, it is easier to climb than ever before. They have the option to hand pick a team full of players  they click with that wont troll them/feed/afk. If they play in a premade 5 full and yet are still not climbing, then if forces them revert back to point one. Why aren't they climbing? They no longer have the option to blame trolls/feeders/afk. \nThis is where it becomes interesting. Once again, they have two choices.\n\n[1. Look at yourself, look at what you are doing well and what you can improve.\n2. Blame something else. Blame lag, blame the fact that it is harder to climb as 5man due to enemy team also being 5man. ](https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider/videos/10153195181519071/)\n\nIf they pick option one, I & many others can gladly help them improve. Spectate some games, write up some notes, talk them through the next few steps and repeat the process a couple of times. \n\nIf they pick option two, you know that no matter how much help you give, they aren't going to change and will most likely become one of the players \"stuck\" in bronze for their entire time in league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T18:35:44.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bronze is the new challenger.

If you're playing weak early game junglers and buying an item that takes time to scale up, the reality is that most games will be decided already by the time you actually start doing anything. Add to that the fact you seem to buy devourer on champs its not even good on like eve and diana, and the payoff is definitely not worth it. Theres also a lot of other questionable builds in your match history and your scores certainly aren't anything to write home about so you should probably start taking a look at yourself if you want to get anywhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-04-10T12:12:15.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in your last three ranked games, you've lost them all and gone negative in 2 out of three","replies":[{"poster":"BoundedByHentai","date":"2016-04-10T12:25:26.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the start i go good, then later in game it turns to shit becasue no one helps me.","replies":[]}]}]}
