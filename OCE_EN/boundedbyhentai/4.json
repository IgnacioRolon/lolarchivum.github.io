And they start feeding in the game. \n\nThe best thing to do is either dodge or troll hard like they do. Raging will get you no where, instead take risks on troll games and try something new. Like Tank Teemo, ad carry nami, ap yi etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-09T08:04:49.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A.
