Eg( I choose Vel'Koz mid first and then some one else calls it second and then there is a argue ment over it, I was thinking why not add a thing that detects that you have called mid first and then there's a slot down the Botton of the game that has top, mid, bot, jg and who ever calls the lane first gets there name in the slot of what they wanted, and if I choose mid and then go oh no I wanna actually go top, you can swap some one for it. This is just a suggestion and I hope you agree.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-03T02:17:21.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with some of the other comments, what you've described is basically teambuilder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Problematictroll","date":"2015-02-02T06:52:53.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The difference between this and teambuilder is that teambuilder is bad and noone wants it amirite xD","replies":[{"poster":"BoundedByHentai","date":"2015-02-02T23:58:41.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My point \nI wanted 1 hour to get in..","replies":[{"poster":"Problematictroll","date":"2015-02-03T02:08:59.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DragonBytePC,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uU5BiIBf,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-02-02T23:58:41.304+0000)\n>\n> My point \n> I wanted 1 hour to get in..\n\nI was being sarcastic because kiddies keep begging for blind pick to be teambuilder when they don't use teambuilder.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-03T01:08:13.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda enforces the meta to have options like this though. Inevitably, how people thing the game is meant to be played is going to be changed, but if we do stuff like this then it will force the state of lanes to stay the same FOREVER.
