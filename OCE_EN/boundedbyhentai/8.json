This is well known in the software community. \n\nNow, for the average user, I can agree it's not a big deal. But if you're using your computer for important things (e.g. uni or work) then the last thing you want is for it to break and for you to not have a usable OS when your assignment/project is due tomorrow.\n\ne.g. Windows 10 may run Steam and LoL fine, but what about professional tools like CATIA or Matlab?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-08-14T22:02:55.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DragonBytePC,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=LgE7ErWA,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-08-02T23:17:42.166+0000)\n>\n> If after upgrading to windows 10 you go to play league and you get 1-10 FPS all you do is reinstall your graphics card driver then restart. :)\n\nIve upgraded to win10 gcard drivers.  do I still need to uninstall and reinstall ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-03T03:17:37.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently there's going to be a partnership between tencent and microsoft in order to solve the issues and make LoL run optimally on windows10.\nFrankly i don't see why an operative system needs to partner with other companies in order to just work at a standard level, but then again windows has kind of been failing me since afte XP came out. Yes, this means Vista and successors.\nSad comments aside, it means that even if it could take a bit, they're working pretty hard to smooth things out.","replies":[]}]}
