If a player is caught smurfing, BAN ALL OF THEIR ACCOUNTS.\r\n\r\nIt is highly unfair to new and returning players to get smashed every single game by players who don&#039;t give a single shit about the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-07T04:18:48.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is not Smurfs or the use of Smurfs, it is the players attitude and how they use the account(s) they create. I know more people with just one account that are total D-Bags and should probably be perma-banned than the number of people I know who have multiple accounts that actually follow the rules and treat other players with respect, and that's saying a lot since a lot of the players I know who use smurfs are somewhat toxic themselves. I myself have 5 accounts (one on NA, but I still consider that a Smurf account) and I've never been punished in-game, because I've never done anything punishment worthy.\n\nWhat you're doing is stereotyping a group based on (what is likely) a minority, and that seems to be a very common problem with modern society. If I have one thing to say to you it's \"don't be *that* guy\".\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the system will actually try to identify smurf accounts and match them with other smurf accounts in pre-30 games, which is probably why you ended up with all the other smurfs. If you were new to league and solo-queued you probably would've seen a lot less smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-07T09:28:45.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1sP6qQAa,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-07T04:18:48.889+0000)\n>\n> \n\nHoly shit HeartVine?
