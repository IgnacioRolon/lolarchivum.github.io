Either way, I think your best bet is to have some sort of shielding/sustain as well as some cc or disengage to negate his engage. \n\nSome items that would be good against him can include redemption and  locket (even with no aura, the shield is still quite strong especially late game). Positioning so that he can never get an ult on both you and your botlane partner/ ganking jungler would also be important, as well as learning the range on his abilities so you can stay out of it. \n\nIf you are into playing ADC, I would suggest long range poke champions such as Caitlyn, or someone with the ability to reposition  quickly (e.g tristana), as he can keep you slowed for a long time with that wheel of cheese poke, making it hard to kite or escape as an immobile adc.","replies":[]}]}
