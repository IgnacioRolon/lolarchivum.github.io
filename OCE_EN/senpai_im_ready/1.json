Below is a quote from one of riot&#039;s team, MegaGnarles.\r\n\r\n    &quot;Repair work is currently underway on the PIPE Pacific Cable-1 (PPC-1) system stretching from Sydney (Australia) to Guam, according to the cable&rsquo;s owner, Australia-based TPG Telecom. As previously reported by TeleGeography&rsquo;s Cable Compendium in early February, the submarine cable broke around 4,590km from the cable&rsquo;s landing station in Piti (Guam), roughly 2km below the surface. In the meantime, TPG Telecom said that traffic has been routed via alternate routes, including the Australia-Japan Cable (AJC) and Southern Cross Cable Network (SCCN).&quot;\r\n\r\nWe want an update on the network. The lag is getting worse since last week. It is over 300 ping now.
