Magnificent TF, piltover customs blitz, firefighter trist etc. they lack the main component of a legendary and it is wrong to sell them to us as legendaries.\n\nRiot stated that legendary skin will 'change the feel' of a champ, and this is true for PROJECT: Yi etc etc. But last time i checked The magnificent Twisted Fate, did not change the feel of the champ whatsoever intact, cutpurse TF changes it more, and thats only a 750 skin.\n\nBut RIOT wont change these skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-05T03:48:46.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cuz riot turds, sure magnificent is visually appealing in game, but its nothing more than a red tux and a tophat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-04T21:08:31.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brolaf is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-05T02:50:43.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd think that, but then you compare it to PROJECT: Yi and suddenly it doesn't look so hot.","replies":[]}]}]}
