There was no other word to describe it. It was hardly a position of pride to be a sanitation worker, much less one in Zaun. Even through the heavy filtering of the gas mask it was hard for Leila to bear.\n\n_Never getting used to this job. Grime enough tells me why people keep quitting, let alone those crazy stories ‘bout Screamers, Wilton Twins, Hunch, Twitch. Soon as I save up enough I'm out of this town so I don't have to wade waist-deep in sh-_\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the distinct sound of sludge slipping and splashing into the fetid sewage. Quickly turning around, brandishing a wrench in front of her before realising no threat was to be found. Just some toppled garbage. _It fell from its own weight_, she justified to herself.\n\nSpeaking her thoughts this time, she turned back to her degrading trudge through the sewer. “H.I.V.E. Reports just making me jumpy. Over pompous high-n-mighties probably just blowing things out of proportion like usual. Giant rat?” She lacked the confidence to answer her own questioning. Like an assassin's blade she kept her wrench close in hand, arm tensed to lash out at reflex.\n\nThe tension combated her will in the long minutes that followed, but nothing came to break it over the lingering sounds of her wet shuffling, hasty breaths, and echoes of the sewer. A muffled sigh of relief escaped her as she finally began to hear the faint hiss of leaking gas. Vision constricted by the tight walls and her own gas mask left her tense to inspect the intersection, but upon seeing no movement in an odd glance she quickly rushed into the hazy, gaseous tunnel she was tasked with fixing. She dashed forward – feet slapping the shallowing waste with heavy, rushed steps as she approached the leaking pipe.\n\nHer technical mind took over, temporarily easing her nerves. _A pipe link. Just a loose bolt – thank goodness. If head office heard they'd need to siphon out the gas for a welding crew... well, it wouldn't be my fault, but I can kiss that bonus cheque goodbye_. The wrench creaked, pulled at the bolt, pressuring the pipe back into place. The hiss that covered her hearing eased, leaving the trailing sounds of skittering in their place.\n\n_What…_\n\nLeila's thoughts were frozen by shock. Her arm, too was frozen in place. Fear gripped her. Prolonged therapeutic electrocution. Toxin screen and prosthesis fitting. Were these the fates she'd be subject to after this rodent, this... thing... what done with her? The initial shock passed and she rapidly began cranking her wrench. Forward. Back. Forward. Back. Maybe too tight, strength driven by panic and fear, the bolt's resistance finally outmatched her and she quickly turned to run away from whatever was behind her.\n\nAnd saw nothing. Caution held her as she mirrored her movements from before, clutching the wrench, inching her way forward. The gas leak's haze, too, cleared as she pressed on. Suddenly, she stumbled, almost tripping forward. She caught herself, the rapid steps made in retaining balance echoing through the tunnel. One, two, three steps she took. One, two, three, four sounds echoed back. Her stress kept her from paying the difference further thought.\n\n\nAnd yet, as her view returned to forward, she started to note the odd shanty constructed in front of her. Her narrow vision had left her missing it before – which was no surprise when the thing had a look more like a pile of garbage than some sort of home. She felt she shouldn't, she was paralysed with fear, and yet she walked forward. The novelty was enticing, despite the fearful stories she'd heard.\n\nThe cleared out ground following the one hut was surprisingly clean for a sewer, with far shallower sewage (though not absent) caused apparently by the effect of the shanty as a partial dam. It was messy in other ways, however, with garbage strewn around more akin to a street in the slums than a sewer. She should go. She had to go. She stepped further still, glancing into the doorless openings of shambled construction. A jar of toenails. A mass of chewing gum that was arranged into _something_ – though exactly what she couldn’t tell.\n\nA drenched book lay at the base of one of the few shacks. It may not have caught her attention if not for the brightly coloured crayon brazen over the cover. Again, her curiosity overcame her as she reached down to pick it up. Flipping through the pages, the water miraculously had left the pages intact, if brittle. She gently shifted through noting the cheesy text as that of cheap romance. _No wonder people flushed this garbage_. Further crayon additions were, whilst not an improvement, surprisingly no worse than the original writing.\n\nA chill shot up her spine as a raspy voice broke the near silence from behind her.\n\n“How do you like my work?” The words gnawed at her. Leila dropped the book in her surprise, not willing to turn around.\n\nShe blurted out, hoping the voice would leave, “I-It's an improvement on the original, Brett was d-definitely better off with Jo-”\n\nShe cut off her words from fear as a mass of wet fur popped up in front of her. Despite both eyes being on the side of its head, the two beady black irises were pointed directly at her. With no further response from Leila, Twitch replied instead, if only briefly, “good, good.”\n\nThe two stood there, eyes at one another, both awaiting the other's move. The rat sniffed with a comical scrunch of his nose before speaking once more, “Twitch.”\n\nApparently that was this thing's name. It took a moment to register what was being told to her before she responded. “Leila,” Shock didn't stop her voice from wavering.\n\nTwitch gave what might pass for a smile for a giant rat. “You don't touch my things. Leila. Others that go down here do.”\n\nA feeling of dread and relief came over her at once. On one hand, this 'Twitch' didn't want her dead yet, on the other, if she'd picked the job of unclogging the place...\n\nShe shuddered to think of what might have happened. The fear that gripped her wasn't leaving, but in addition to the absurdity of the situation, there was a degree of awkwardness as well. The tension grew to be too much for her first, and she turned to take a step back towards home. Twitch reached out almost immediately, grabbing her leg before it hit the ground. She almost toppled backwards, barely managing to keep her balance.\n\n“Not there, don't step there!” Twitch was clearly enraged, voice suddenly shifting to seething. Beneath her foot lay an opaque plastic bottle – whether the bottle was coloured that way or if it was the liquid inside was impossible to tell. With her eyes locked on the rat, she hadn't been able to look where she was stepping. “Don't step on my juice.”\n\nIf it were one of her messy neighbours, she'd have chided them for leaving something like this around, but there was no way she was reasoning with this rat. She started to notice the grip around her felt dirty – like the damp sewage was clutching her leg itself despite her protective gear. She shook her leg, breaking the grip, and stumbling forward. Whilst she had stepped over the bottle the first time, she clumsily left her second trailing behind, knocking the bottle aside in the process. She looked back quickly to realise what had happened – the lid spilling open.\n\n_So it was the liquid inside after all._\n\nHer offhand thought didn't last long as a mechanical click triggered her into a full sprint as Twitch screeched, “No touchies!”\n\nA bolt flew past her trailing with toxic green. And another. She heard the distinct _click_ of another bolt being fired, but none passed by her this time. She staggered, but adrenaline kept her running. _Click_. She staggered again, this time limping. _Click_. The shock of impact toppled her forward, and it was face first in the sewage that she started to feel the burning sensation running through her from her back and one of her legs.\n\n“You’re looking a little green,” The voice spat. Between the pain and the muffling of her protective gear, how close the voice was she couldn't tell. From burning to a complete searing, the toxin shot through her body. Even though her view was blocked by the sewage, and she was unable to raise herself from it, her vision darkened further still. As she heard the waning echoes of skittering feet, final thoughts raced in her mind. _Soon as I save up enough_, her breaths quickened and shallowed, brain falling prey to the toxins, slowing her thoughts to a halt, _I'm out of this town so I don't have to wade waist-deep in sh-_\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed my work!

According to lore no survivors are known to have encountered him and gotten away without something interfering - for her to survive and escape without something coming in to stop her kind of weakens Twitch's presence as a deadly threat in my opinion, I was personally torn up about it :P\n\nI'll be sure to give yours a read and pop a comment under when I'm done!","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-07-10T09:29:35.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OOooooo okay!

In Twitch's normal lore, it's a H.I.V.E. report about a Twitch attack. 6 victims, 2 of which lived. No other witnesses. Of the survivors, one had their jaw melted off and was awaiting reconstructive surgery, the other was severely injured and required electroshock therapy before they were even in a mental state to be able to talk anyway (and even then they were babbling and panicked).\n\nThe extended lore details someone who got away from Twitch by running before Twitch was even in sight, and even then only because Twitch set his crossbow to the guy's coworker - came back down to see him with a back full of bolts.\n\nThe new ending I've got here actually ties into Twitch's lore, which states that the team that went to investigate the 6 attacked at a Zaun research facility. They found a shantytown which was where the victims were, as well as older dead bodies from possible previous incidences - implying Leila here is potentially one of those prior victims. I also made some nods to the items they recovered, being the jar of toenails, the chewing gum \"possible art installation\" and the 57 romance novels scrawled on with crayon. Chronology had to get messed with a little bit, as those items were recovered and not left alone, but I'm justifying the issue of her referencing H.I.V.E. Reports before the one in her lore was made by the simple explanation of there must have been previous reports of Twitch, even if less detailed, alongside stories from fellow sewer workers.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
