The fact that most of them are active for a while after you report them is because 3rd part bans aren't instant and come in waves. Riot actually has to confirm with every 3rd party ban that it is in fact scripts and not just noobs. \n\nThe market for level 30 accounts isn't going down any time soon, so for every account that is banned another 2 with more complicated scripts pop up in its place.  The botters always seem to be one step ahead of Riot's anti-cheat detection systems, even though they are constantly being upgraded to try and combat issues like these.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-07T00:36:57.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"there is a distinct difference between a noob, and only buying mobi boots and rushing down mid all the time without using a single ability or AA (which is about 40% of the obvious bots). From playing with my low lvl friend a while back (i think they've quit) and struggling to beat the fed as hell swain bot even as a fairly experienced player; I think riot should least to a check like if they haven't done anything but rush down mid and maybe buy mobi boots for 10 straight games, then ban hammer. I know it's not a complete solution but at least means low level players don't have to suffer the humiliation of getting stomped by a 20-0 swain or pantheon bot at 15min just because they were unfortunate enough to be the only human player in a game with 4 direct feeder bots. At least some bots emulate some level of gameplay and so don't just feed and some bot scripts actually win lane. The feeder bots are what make leveling up as a beginner (or even trying to duo with a lvl12 in coop vs bots) so cancerous.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"my dads a cop","date":"2016-10-22T05:33:30.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found 4 bots while levelling a smurf on the last stretch to level 30.

Since this was reported and posted on 18/10 and OP.GG only displays last 20 games with other players, the previously played may be different. \n\nI added one of the connected players as a friend and they weren't so happy and removed me as a friend right after..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yellow Dragon","date":"2016-10-08T06:48:21.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you do that i thought those people just sucked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-10-06T19:01:42.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They just want to be with their own kind!\n\nIn all seriousness though, that's incredibly frustrating.
