It's just my opinion, if your viewers are weaboos that enjoy that stuff then keep it.\n2. You don't have to find \"generic\" music, no one likes to listen to the same Warsongs that every Youtuber uses in their montage or that same popular Alan Walker song. Just find a good fresh track that you like and will go well with your gameplay. If you need ideas there is a YouTube channel I know that producers free music for everyone to use: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56Qctnsu8wAyvzf4Yx6LIw\nCheck them out if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-07-06T01:52:26.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-06T04:36:48.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Percival9,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=H9rYgLa0,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2017-07-06T01:52:26.597+0000)\n>\n> Cool, thanks :)\n\nWhen in doubt, silver scrapes","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-05T06:46:05.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=H9rYgLa0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-05T01:45:49.737+0000)\n>\n> Gameplay was nice, couldn&#x27;t watch the rest of the video due to my hate towards nightcore crap, good effort though\n\n^this","replies":[]}]}]}
