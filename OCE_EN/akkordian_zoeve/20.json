So when I got support, I had had enough of stupid autofill, insta-locked Eve, and played Jungle with the Master Yi.\n\nI started off cheesing the enemy&#039;s raptors, red, and krugs, as well as snagging a kill in the progress. The Yi farmed his own Jungle and got a few successful ganks too. We just repeated this (I would farm enemy Jungle and Yi his own, or I&#039;d take bot and he&#039;d take top). We duo ganked a lot, got first blood tower, and we duo-carried our team. The enemy got no ganks because their Jungler was *way* too far behind to do anything. We also had better objective control thanks to our double smite.\n\nWhat I was wondering was if this is a legitimate strategy, or it only worked because we were Bronze, or if we just got lucky?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-08-08T04:40:51.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can work but has some significant disadvantages. Like cl mentioned your solo laner will get behind and if you ganks don't come off you'll be in a huge hole. \n\nBut I think the biggest problem would be proper vision. If you watch LCS you see people walking into the enemy jungle get collapsed on all the freaking time. If a team has decent vision spending time by yourself in the enemy jungle would be super dangerous. Not to mention it does create imbalances\n\nFor instance if both jungles on your team try to gank top the other team could have four people collapse on bottom or mid to kill the laner/ take the tower. \n\nIn the end anything in league is technically a legitimate strategy but this one is risky. If the other team know what there doing and collapse quickly, you could find yourself in a hole with few ways to get out. Not to mention if your two junglers are eve and Yi your team fight is gonna suck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-08T03:16:59.227+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah its been around for ages ,duo jungling is a pretty risky strategy as it leaves an oppurtunity for the solo laner to get behind if he/she cant farm or do anything without losing massive amounts of hp and the second jungler to fall behind if he/she cant farm the enemy jungle.\n\nusually shaco or eve are the best to do it with other than it would be pretty shit.\n\nive had it a few times in games and it goes both ways, either incredibly good or horribly bad","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-08T03:35:37.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-08T03:26:52.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyv is great :^)","replies":[]}]}]}
