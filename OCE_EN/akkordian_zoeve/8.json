Aside from the obvious Red (which belong to Riot employees), how did they manage to get the Blue/Purple/Green names?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m *not* saying I deserve this, just interested in seeing what it takes.

That just isn't what Riot are looking for.\n\nPositivity and being a part of the community is a large part of it.\nAnd you can be positive without having to be a yes man.\n\nFor example, I'm probably the last person anyone would accuse of sucking up, a majority of my posts are actually complaints about how the game is balanced or handled. But I do care deeply about the game, and for every complaint I make, I always try to add what I believe to be a solution. Even if it's the wrong solution, it means that I'm not just moaning, I am genuinely trying to point out issues and make the game better _(even if just in my eyes)_.\n\nSo just be yourself, and try to remain positive.\nWe are all a community, so be part of it :)\nIf someone has a question and you know the answer, start talking to them. \nIf something annoys you, tell us about it. _(but in a polite way)_\nIf you see a chance to lighten the mood with a meme or comment, don't hold back!\n\nJust like with champions, different people respond to the ways different volunteers handle things, some people prefer LGC Elam's approach and are more likely to start a discussion with him, while others might be more interested in responding to or questioning my more opinionated posts.\n\nSo just be yourself and be positive and let the community do the rest :P\n\nI wish you the best of luck! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-11T06:21:31.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"You pretty much have to succumb to Riot, accept all the decisions they make, and accept everything they do.

They have to balance their decisions weighted on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-11T12:10:46.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok right mate, how long have you been playing this game? Hey you know the sick arcade event that is happening right now? You know the sick orbs you can purchase which can \"have a chance to contain double gemstones and exclusive hextech loot\" Oh wait you know the whole hextech system in general? If you were smart like Riot you would clearly see the massive money grabbing potential this sneaky company has managed to create. Yeah you can get free skins from chests that's pretty cool, but wait, 50% of the time you get champion shards, but wait, gemstones are so rare you have to spend around $300 to get close to 10 of them, BUT WAIT, \"CHANCE TO GET DOUBLE GEMSTONES AND EXCLUSIVE HEXTECH LOOT IF YOU PURCHASE THESE SICK ORBS\", yeah that's a scam, you're gonna have to spend another $300 before you get any of that. This same type of thing has happened before, remember the chaos/dawn event? They are scam events, Riots chance to get extra money off of players. I bet when they were thinking of the hextech system they were laughing their heads off, \"Oh the players want a chance to get free skins some how? Ok we'll give them that, let's see how we can exploit this, oh I know! GEMSTONES and SPECIAL SKINS.\" Because every stupid idiot League player just has their mouth watering over special exclusive stuff, a sneaky smart attempt to get people waving their wallets in front of them. \n\nClearly, developing skins and releasing them for players to use at a reasonable price is fair. Riot put their hard work and effort into making them and the better the pixels and content of the skin, the more work they have to put into making the skin and therefore more money they should charge. That is all fair. But everything else is clearly a money grabbing scheme to take more money off of players then they already have. Riot's just sitting back while players daily are spending money buying more and more chests opening each one hoping that they will someday get that hextexh annie skin they always wanted. Then they take it even further by simply adding a few hefty words that stand out a lot \"DOUBLE CHANCE\" and BOOM MORE MONEY. Oh Rot you sneaky bastards don't you already have enough?\n\nAs for Blizzard I can't say much because I've only played Oerwatch, but I do remember the first day I purchased the game I filed in a ticket to their support team regarding an issue with regions and their support team responded in 5 minutes, whereas Riot support takes 2 days. Also the loot crate system in Overwatch gives you a free one EVERY single level, so I don't see a lot of people spending money to buy them. So unless you're referring to something in WoW I don't see how Blizzard is worse then Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-15T01:59:54.208+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yet Riot has never put any meaningful content behind a paywall. The only things in this game you can't get for free are purely cosmetic. Riot gives you a choice whether to spend money or not, there is no obligation to. If you don't agree with their model then you don't have to support them.\n\nIt's a genius business model that I wish more companies followed because it's good for both the company (profits) and the consumer (content that has to be desirable enough to spend money on, and no obligation to do so).","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-15T03:33:25.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People aren't forced to spend money on League, yes you can play League for 4 years straight without spending a coin, but that's not what I was getting at. It's their paid transactions which deceive the majority of players who make the decision to spend money on the game. How are people gonna see \"DOUBLE CHANCE TO GET GEMSTONES\" and not know they are being tricked? Sure a few smart people, but the world is full of a lot of idiots, and Riot is taking advantage of them. And quite a lot of other companies do the same thing, primarily mobile app developers (Spending real money to buy special \"golden chests\" that have an increased chance of rewards). Fact is, buying that \"golden chest\" won't give you any higher of a chance of getting special rewards, but by luck, if you do get that special reward, then chances are you are instantly gonna think \"Wow, these golden chests are great! I'm so lucky! MORE CHESTS\" and there you go, more money spent. Such an obvious scheme done by companies that idiots fail to realise.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-15T08:28:44.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatever your awareness of the reality of those chests, if you are spending money on something is random, as opposed to something that is set, it means you have the money to spend on it. It means you aren't in a position to be worrying about every dollar you spend, so what is the problem? \n\nIf the people with money want to spend it then so be it, that's what keeps the economy going, money going round. I get that you don't like it because it's only a chance, but it's not like *certain other games I'm looking at you Blizzard* where random is the only option.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-08-10T16:33:15.678+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly Right, Riot are watching and if you hang around the boards and be well fitted member of the community being helpful and polite, People like Riot Maraudaur are watching and they will take notice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-10T12:28:07.461+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Little Witch Eve.\n\nThe short answer to your question is that the various coloured names you'll notice some Boards members with indicate those who are part of the [Riot Games Volunteer Program](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/testing-board/B5GXnLE0-introduction-to-the-riot-games-volunteer-programs). < That link will take you to Wuks' thread, which talks a bit about what the Volunteer program and Arbiters are about. The categories of volunteers (on OCE, I'm not sure how much it differs in other regions) include the [Emissaries](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Edu7E6Bp-introducing-the-emissaries) (green), the [Instructors](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/RaWrI4Hi-introducing-the-instructors) (blue), the [Wrenchmen](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/nE4lj5EB-introducing-the-wrenchmen) (yellow) and the [Distinguished Members](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/GLk0EEmq-introducing-the-distinguished-members) (purple).
