Imagine if they were Kayn mains.\r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s not the big problem. The big problem is Kayn&#039;s E (the one that let&#039;s him walk through terrain). Sure, you might think it&#039;s like Talon&#039;s E; he goes through a wall and you flash for the kill. Simple, right?\r\n\r\nExcept for the fact he can walk OUT OF SUMMONER&#039;S RIFT (check NB3&#039;s newest Kayn video where he does this to escape a 1v4). Literally off the map for 10-ish seconds. How do you counter that? Even if you could damage him, you can&#039;t reach him since he&#039;s outside the map.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-30T01:52:07.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Except for the fact he can walk OUT OF SUMMONER'S RIFT\n\nIn all likelihood, Riot wont let Kayn go live until that has been fixed. It's certainly an extraordinary issue, and I seriously doubt Riot would allow something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-06-30T07:43:56.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=j48iW9mO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-06-30T01:52:07.591+0000)\n>\n> In all likelihood, Riot wont let Kayn go live until that has been fixed.

The PBE is the testing ground, it's designed to ensure things are ready for the live servers. Something like a champion being able to \"escape the map\" is definitely the kind of thing that the PBE is designed to find.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-30T08:19:32.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play against him the same way you play against Yasuo and Zed:\n\nYou die to their team before they can reach you, so they can't get even more fed.\nThe ultimate counterplay!\n\nJokes aside though, _(or is it a joke? you'll never know...)_.\nChamps have been ridiculously powerful on PBE and in development before, _(Syndra even has a quote referencing how completely broken she was before release)_ and they all _(within reason)_ have become fairly even on live servers.\n\nAll new champions are never perfect though, Camille needed to be nerfed hard, while Gnar needed buffs. \nLike HeatVine says, it's unlikely Riot will give us an unbeatable broken champ on release.","replies":[{"poster":"SteampunkFox999","date":"2017-10-09T23:44:00.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and after they buff my main  Gnar slightly, they turn around and nerf him again. still needs a real buff. he is fun as hell, but im sick of being one shot by fking nasus riven, yas, yi, ww, damn why do i do this to myself i should have stayed as an asol main","replies":[]}]}]}
