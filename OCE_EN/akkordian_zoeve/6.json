One of these was that Eve makes a little sound when detected by an enemy which can be used to detect invisible or hidden enemies (like Shaco&#039;s Q or someone in an unwarded brush). The tip linked to a YT video which shows how to manipulate the game&#039;s sound files so this becomes a very obvious sound (i.e. a siren instead of a nearly inaudible &quot;whoosh&quot;).\r\n\r\nJust wondering if this [changing the sound files] is against Riot rules, and if it could get you banned?\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-04-29T22:23:33.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAs of now I'm fairly sure riot will not impose a punishment on you for modifying sound files, however this is still against the terms of service and riot may change their stance on these sorts of modifications at any point in time.\n\nDo this at your own risk.","replies":[]}]}
