I know the combos and little tricks with them, and can play pre-level 3 pretty well on them (usually get first blood with Ori).\r\n\r\nHowever, I don&#039;t know how to play them later on in the lane phase, and I constantly die. And then I&#039;m useless mid-to-late game. I also have no idea how to snowball any lead I get. I don&#039;t even try to get kills anymore, since I&#039;ve heard from multiple sources that objectives &gt; kills.\r\n\r\nI watch lots of streams and help videos, and record everything and try to implement it into to my games, but I&#039;m still losing most of my games. A lot of guides say &quot;improve cs&quot; (but they never say how, besides &quot;practice&quot;), and whenever I try to cs in games, I die. If I try to cs, they kill me. If I sit back and play safe, they outfarm me and one-shot me under tower. If I try to trade, I also die.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s gotten to the point where I&#039;m so bad that it&#039;s affecting my real-life (grades are low, depression, insomnia, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have no idea what to do now or how to improve (since the all the guides I read/watch don&#039;t seem to be benefiting me). PLEASE HELP ME IMPROVE. ANY GENUINE ADVICE WOULD BE NICE.\r\n\r\n(By the way, please don&#039;t tell me to play different champions. I will only play Ori and Eve, nothing else).","replies":[{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2017-03-06T05:40:30.814+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as ori during laning phase don't be afraid to use your ult just to chunk your opponent and force them out of lane. Ball placement is important the threat of a shockwave can zone the enemy away, and even when laning you can manipulate it to zone opponent away from cs.\n\nPractice is the only real way to improve though, like others have said just play normals for awhile then head back to ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ky6000","date":"2017-03-05T07:58:35.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly league is an overrated game, if it's making you feel bad then take a break. I find that I lose focus after playing consecutive games, which definitely impacts my abilities. \n\nAs for how to farm... kinda hard to explain other then just last hit... which comes from practice :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"NR Smox","date":"2017-03-06T10:34:15.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I HAD E X A C T L Y THE SAME PROBLEM.

You seem to have the right attitude, keep watching those videos/guides, and also keep thinking about why and what people are saying in these videos/guides.\nAs for being more specific, I can't really tell but you are aware of your downfalls in mid-late game. Perhaps there is a part where you aren't playing with your team, either in teamfights or taking objectives (turrets, dragons, baron, inhibitors), and you are dying due to underestimating the enemy's damage somewhat. How is your ability to dodge and recognise enemy skillshots/abilities?\n\nI think what might really help is getting a higher elo player to spectate your games and pointing out the mistakes you are making.\n\nPlaying Ori and Eve is perfectly fine, in fact, playing only very few champions will help you in learning the game quicker, than if you were to try and learn 10+ champions. Personally I'm not sure Eve is in a good place right now, but Ori has been a staple midlaner for many seasons and is viable. Watch high elo videos of people playing those champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-06T02:10:17.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you play like 1 ranked game a week if that.\n\nPlay more and you will improve if you genuinely try and put in effort to learn.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-03-06T05:02:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing about 3 games a day for the past 2 years; it's just that Uni and work have started back up again.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-06T01:05:59.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play more norms until you are ready, and rip not wanting to play others, i rue to see the day you dont get your champ, if you change your mind about wanting to play other champs, you seem to like zoning with mobility, so someone like ekko or ahri or viktor may be your deal, try em for me and see if you like them and ik viktor doesnt have mobility, but who doesnt like deleteing ppl with lich bane XD","replies":[]}]}
