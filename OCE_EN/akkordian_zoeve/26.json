As soon as she hit 6 I typed &quot;Tali 6, will roam&quot;. She went into fog of war and I pinged MIA, spammed careful to the pushed Bot Lane, and typed &quot;Tali going Bot&quot;. Of course, 20-30 seconds later the text &quot;Taliyah has slain ________ for a Double Kill&quot; appears.\r\n\r\nShe comes back to lane, disappears, I warn my team (and top because he was pushed), and BOOM! they die 20s later...\r\n\r\nThe same happens in other games where I mention &quot;[Enemy Jungler] is top, don&#039;t push&quot;. Naturally, they push and die.\r\n\r\nSo what I&#039;m wondering: is it even worth pinging and communicating with your team if they&#039;re not even going to listen anyway?\r\n\r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-20T08:20:42.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the responsibility of everyone to ensure proper communication.
