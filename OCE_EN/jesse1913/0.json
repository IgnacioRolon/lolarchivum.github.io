This season I managed to climb from b5 to b1 in 2 days, and I am about to start my promos. Today I will teach you in simple steps of how i managed to climb very quickly.\n\n1. Get the right attitude to play the game. There is no point on playing league of legends ranked if you are tilted or have the intention to try some troll builds. Again, there will be times especially in lower bronze in which there are smurfs who throw intentionally. Just ignore them and accept the loss. Flaming the won&#039;t get you anywhere.\n\n2. Don&#039;t make excuses. &quot;Oh i can&#039;t climb cause my team is trash&quot; &quot;Oh I can&#039;t climb because there are trolls in my game&quot;. These excuses are total bullshit. League of legends is a game designed so that you will win and lose approximately half of your games respectively. This means that if you get a troll or a bad team one game, chances are the enemy will be like that one game as well. It is a give and take situation. Instead of making up excuses, learn why you are losing games.\n\n3. Pick the right fucking champion. Champions are assigned roles for a reason. I cannot express how many people think that something like soraka top against a jax is a good idea in low bronze. Don&#039;t be one of those people. Pick a champion that actually works in your lane to some extent.\n\n4. Find one or two champions to main. This was something that I realized earlier this season. Playing multiple champs in multiple roles isn&#039;t going to get you far. For example, good luck winning in a lane when you have 2 games on yasuo, and the enemy has 50 games on kassadin. It is probably good to choose very snowball champions, as it allows you to manage the flow of the game. I personally chose Master Yi and Jax as my 2 main champions.\n\n5. Be able to deal with the unexpected. It is the worst feeling when you go into a lobby and both your mains are banned. This was very common for me in bronze as Master Yi was ALWAYS banned for some reason. There are 2 things you can do in this situation. You can remake, or you can choose something that you have confidence in, and look at the entire team comp before deciding if you want to remake or not. If you are playing something like Yi, and you have 4th pick, ask someone ahead of you to grab him for you.\n\n6. Understand your opponent. This comes with experience. But you should know how fast your enemy jungler can clear, what side they usually start on, and  if you can beat them in a duel if you happen to run into them in the jungle. This takes effort to learn. There is no easy way around this, and guides on mobafire won&#039;t help you for shit in this as the enemy jungle will always have a different playstyle. You must learn to adapt during the game.\n\n7. Have vision on objectives. This is a no brainer, but it is so frustrating to see how many players in low bronze refuse to ward or red trinket objectives. That being said, if your team doesn&#039;t ward, chances are your opponent won&#039;t either. This means that in lower bronze you can sneak a dragon or baron fairly easily. There are specific places that should always be warded in the game.\n\n   - Both sides of the river in mid / the small bush in the river\n   - Top lane and bot lane tri bush\n   - Top lane and bot lane strip bush\n   - Dragon\n   - Barron\n\nLeague of legends eventually turns into a fight of vision control, and the team with the most vision is most likely to win the game.\n\n8. Know when to gank a lane. There is no point ganking a lane thats 0/2 unless you yourself are 2/0. Look for key crucial points. Did they ward the area? are they over extended? where is the enemy jungler? you must take all of these into consideration before ganking as a failed gank sets your own team behind even further than they already are.\n\n9. Look for opportunities. If the entire enemy team is top lane, and you happen to be bot push towers, get dragon, etc. Another thing to do is to force the enemy into wasting summoner spells. For example, if I am playing jax, I can cheese gank level 2 immediately with q and e, and force the enemy to use flash. This is a gain for your laner as it gives them the upper hand.\n\n10. Understand the early game. Look at team comp to decide weather or not you will invade, or if you will be invaded. If the enemy has a lot of cc towards mid land and bot lane, or a blitzcrank, you can bet your ass that they will invade you. To prevent this, place wards in the river, or in the bushes near the camp. If this fails and you have to abort the camp, immediately head over to the same camp on the enemy&#039;s side that they stole from you, and start there.\n\n11. Realize the extent of your control over the game. If you are a 15/0 master yi and the enemies all have more deaths than kills, you are the leading force of the game. If you play properly you can win the game easily. However, if you are a 6/6 master yi and the enemies are around the same as you, don&#039;t jump into a 1v5 and expect to win.\n\n\nAnyways, good luck climbing out of bronze, and if you want go check out some of my replays to see how i played against certain junglers.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-09-27T12:03:57.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's some tips, for every lane. For a fast consistent, last minute climb to gold.\n**1. SNOWBALL**\nIn low elo, the snowball is maddening, don't get swept aside by a lucky enemy laner. Aside the lvl3 gank top, there isn't going to be much early jungle pressure, so try to pick comfort picks, especially easier ones, and learn how to play aggressively and learn your damage. Learn your powerspikes, and don't pick lategame champions. You'll start using the 'it's not lategame' excuse. Learn what all the popular champions can do by playing a few games on them, and watching a few gameplays, then pick a early midgame lane bully, take ignite as a top/mid/sup as neccessary, and give your laner a hard time till he starts feeding you, and keep getting fed. Learn how to deny xp and cs, and frustrate the enemy laner by maintaining a freeze on the minions wave, a 3 lvl advantage in a lane is basically unbeatable, and if you're losing, holding a freeze against a laner who doesn't understand how to counter your control of the minion wave will allow you to claw back and then sink your teeth in their neck. Press down the lane till take tower and you are dominant, and then take a new lane, repeat and repeat.\n**2. MINION WAVES**\nLearn the minion wave. Sometimes you'll lose lane earlygame, and you'll feel that it's because the enemy champion is OP, or they're a smurf or whatever. In gold or below, if you're losing early fights, odds are you didn't play the minion wave properly, and so the enemy got a lvl advantage, or pushed you in forcing you to burn potions and/or mana to get cs. In jungle this is a little more complicated, but basically watch for when the enemy laner pushes out, ideally if your laner has a larger minion wave building or approaching from base. Minions hurt more than champions for about the first half of the game. So learn how they push and how their aggro works and how to break aggro using bush.\n**3. CSING**\nLearn the basics of csing and potions. This seems obvious, but it's not, I'm still working on my csing and I forget to use pots midcombat and I've hit gold5 playing every role (and I can promise you it isn't because of mechanics). Try to make sure whenever you buy, you either come back with a completed powerspike first item, or 2 pots and maybe a control ward somewhere in your inventory, if you feel the enemy jungler is particularly fiesty. Use pots midcombat, but try to save them till you're at about half hp or lower, so you don't waste their regen. The 50g investment is worth it, when you can stay in lane a little longer and pickup some more xp and gold.\n**4. VISION**\nControl wards are hidden op in bronze and sometimes just 1+ trinket will protect your lane for the entire game, because nobody clears wards. Learn to look at the map, don't use unlocked camera, it's a big learning curve, but try unlocking the camera to flick to other lanes when you aren't in combat and relocking from time to time or to cs. As a jungler try to learn to be able to kite jungle camps whilst not actually looking at your Champion. Also once mid-lategame hits, get a control ward on baron, keep a control ward on baron. Upgrade your trinket lategame to either blue or red, blue if you choose to splitpush, red if you want to teamfight. Eventually all lanes will push or the enemy team will mess around, and in any other elo this would be a risky baron call, but in bronze, sneaky baron is ez cheese.\n**5. COPY**\nSimplest tip, maybe best tip, use the OP.GG build with obvious alteration for the ap/ad matchup, use standard keystones, don't try to metabreak or nightblue3 or full damage, if the op.gg build is full damage, consider picking up a deadmans, a maw, a steraks, a zhonias, a morrellos, GA, or whatever appropriate defensive item, as a last item, because if you die from a small misplay, your team might very well fall too, no matter how hard you carry. Pick your mains, and watch high elo players with the same champions, especially those that explain what they're thinking or looking at, pay particular attention to where they go, when they back, where they rotate. As a jungler, learn your champion standard rotation, 9/10 it'll put you so far ahead in tempo, to the point where the enemy team will flame their jungler for not doing anything.\n\n\nThis is alot, but this is enough to get you gold, and stay in gold, and probably climb further if you stick to this properly.","replies":[]}]}
