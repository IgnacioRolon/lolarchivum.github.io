That was 2013 we're talking about bud.\n\nFree Transfer was there because OCE server was only made until then, we were originally on different servers, some on KR, some on Garena and most of us were on NA. Some on EU too.\n\nSo the transfer was free and we got to experience what others had since day 1, it was a holy day.\n\nIt's not Riot's fault but yours I am sorry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gabesz1993HD","date":"2014-11-29T14:30:57.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my normal ping: http://kephost.com/images/2014/11/29/Nevtelen23735.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gabesz1993HD","date":"2014-11-29T14:23:30.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol no me only have this problem hehe\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=39744","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-29T14:28:40.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can try submitting a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and hopefully they might do a free transfer for you but I doubt it will be likely.\n\nThere is only one way to solve your high ping issue forever, that is to transfer back sadly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-29T13:35:14.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you playing from?\n\n330 ms ping average/normal? Are you playing from space or something?\n\nIt's most likely either your comp, your Isp or maybe just maybe Riot's server. But I don't think any server issue is going on atm.\n\nThere is too much routing between your comp and the server, you might wanna check out why if you are actually playing in OCE physically.","replies":[{"poster":"Gabesz1993HD","date":"2014-11-29T13:58:52.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I from Eu North.

You prob start with a base of 250+ ms ping.\n\nAnd all the things that happen (from weather to failure/maintenance etc) to everything in between you and the server will directly affect your ping, increaseing it. And the routing between countries isn't always optimal so you get another few extra pings.\n\nSo yeah kinda makes sense you have high base pings and high fluctuation range.\n\nReally, just get the RP and transfer back to your region server. It's only like 20 bucks (maybe 3 hours of work max), and saves you so much trouble.\n\nDon't play on servers that is too far to where you physically live and play from, even if the transfer is free. That was for OCE players when the server was set up for us, before then we were all playing on other servers, mainly on NA. Distance puts a big toll on the latency.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
