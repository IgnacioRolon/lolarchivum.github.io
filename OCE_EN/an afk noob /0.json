My account has been suspended for 3rf party software usage. This is utter bullsh*t. I don&#039;t use curse, I use skype. I don&#039;t use any custom skin software, plays.tv etc. \n\nTo add onto that, 50% of the time ill be playing at a local internet cafe called Gamestorm. I&#039;ve been using this place ever since I first made my LoL account, why now? What can I do to get my account un-suspended? Is there anything I can do? Or is it just..... Gone...\n\nOne of my very good friends just signed up, I was teaching him the game...\n\nEdit: I spent $35 dollars on the game yesterday, proceeded to the internet cafe and played for around 5 hours.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-30T06:11:44.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nBans for use of disallowed third party software are usually pretty solid, however your best bet if you honestly believe you've done nothing wrong and that this was a false ban would be to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support as they're the only ones who can help with account related issues.","replies":[]}]}
