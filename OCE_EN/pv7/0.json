Always seeing the same champions.\nI played dozens and dozens of URF and if there wasn't a Jayce, Garen, Hec, Ahri or Wukong in the queue it was because I wasn't playing URF :P\n\nAwesome mode, but needs to include the ENTIRE pool, OP or not, give everyone a ban choice to ban 10 per game, and make sure no one can roll the same champ for the next 5 games or something.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Harmacist","date":"2018-07-15T10:58:26.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally just talking about this with someone the other day. I love ARURF. It needs to be random to stop the same champs being spammed because they're more OP in URF, but there's some champions I just do NOT want to deal with. I'd be 100% more inclined to play so much more URF if I could ban.","replies":[]}]}
