I think it's a pretty interesting concept to think over.\r\nI'll just give a brief example of what it could look like :\r\n\r\nModBot/AbuseBot:\r\nBasically, it's this in-game interface that would come in as some sort of a chat feature.\r\nIt'll have pre-existing patterns set up that would aim to recognise abusive behaviour in-game. As a result, misbehaviour could result in a temporary mute - potentially solving this whole issue of toxicity via. the root cause.\r\n\r\nLike our LeaverBuster system, it'll automatically punishes those who misbehave - As a result, more liability is put towards those who are toxic in game. Back before we had LeaverBuster, we relied a lot on post-game reports to deal with people who were clearly causing trouble. Now, we have Low Priority Queues that basically deal with those who leave much more effectively than how things were before. As a result, we have people that are less-inclined to leave games now because they personally know that they have a lot more to lose.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't see how this sort of a thing isn't applicable to the problem of toxicity. One of the biggest concerns with League at the moment is how toxic certain people can be in games. Too many people have resorted to toxic behaviour and not enough has been done about changing these attitudes. It's a lot like the issue with AFKing before we had current LeaverBuster, people heavily relied on post-game reports to hand out justice to those who had ruined their games by abandoning their teams.\r\n\r\nWe can't expect people to take the consequences of toxic behaviour seriously unless something effective is done about it.\r\nI personally feel as if something like this could actually work, and it would definitely be interesting to hear on why I might be wrong about my assumption on the efficacy of this whole thing.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I'd really appreciate it if you guys would share your opinions on this suggestion. We should be able to discuss some pro's and con's, see if there are any flaws with the idea, as well as contemplate on some of the challenges that might be involved in making this sort of thing happen. At the very least, this should make for an interesting discussion.\r\nPlease make sure to vote on the poll too.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'll leave it to you guys to decide if any of this is important or not.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-26T10:26:06.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

My problem with this whole thing isn't about my own emotions actually, it has more to do with the fact that a lot of people tend to spend a lot of time in-game sulking/arguing with someone who's clearly trolling the %%%% out of them. This is one of the main reasons why toxicity is an issue in the first place - because there are *A LOT* of people who can't deal with this kind of behaviour, and because of this they allow themselves to go on tilt and the rest of the team basically needs to deal with it.\n\nJudging by how you've written your response- It seems like you're trying to say that it's \"okay\" to act like this, because it's the *internet*.\nNo, it's not okay. You've got to understand that this type of behaviour tends to come from the scummiest sorts of people in society - friendly banter aside, more specifically those who are intentionally trying to abuse others. A lot of us in the community have moved on from this kind of %%%%, and it's distasteful having to *rely* on people who are so full of themselves that it's %%%%ing embarrassing.\n\nI feel as if it's important to make this point:\n\n1. Realize that you are talking to real people\n2. Realize that these people are here to play a game, not deal with your problems.\n3. If you can't do 1. and 2. then then I suggest you realise that you need to grow the %%%% up and deal with whatever underlying problems you have that's making you act like a %%%%-head to randoms over a video game.\n\nIf you can't come to terms with this, then something needs to be done about your %%%%ty behaviour because you are an inconvenience for the rest of us.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-26T17:03:16.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see it is if you play poorly then you'll be treated poorly and that's mostly how it works on OCE.\n\nI literally bash on myself after every mistake because I want to become a better player and if someone else wants to have a go at me then I'll gladly take it even if it's something like \"you're %%%%\" or \"wow that was a dumb as %%%% play\" because at the end of the day, it all helps me know that **I DONE SOMETHING WRONG**.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-27T00:20:38.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is though that abusing someone because of a mistake is not appropriate behaviour and people who abuse others for mistakes should be punished accordingly. Personally I don't mind if someone tells me I've made a mistake and even suggests something to improve (and there are many other people who share that mindset) but if they want to abuse me while doing so they deserve no respect and they should not be allowed to play.

It seems like a lot of work, given the variability in language - But, this kind of approach would remove a lot of the generic toxicity we see in the game.\n\nI do feel like this might have some potential to change how the community behaves in the first place. What I mean to say is, sure we have a mute feature - but how effective is that in changing behaviour exactly? In most cases, a person who is being toxic will either aim their tantrum on another team member or start talking to the enemy team about : oh, how bad this person is, how he should do this or that, how they should uninstall. Also, it's not like everyone mutes abusers - From my experience there are a lot of people who don't really know how to handle these kinds of situations, and as a result you have people who are more fixated in dealing with these people rather than playing the game itself.\n\nbut anyways - on this topic. If you've got any opinions for or against it, i'd actually appreciate hearing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-26T04:43:15.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it's more about just censoring the words/phrases than handing out 'low priority queues' or bans to people who are abusive? I would have no problem with that but there is already the profanity filter which could be used in that manner, Riot would just have to incorporate the 'adjusted' words/phrases that use variations like leet (1337) speak (even having an option for profanity filter and another for this idea so they work separately). I wouldn't have much of a problem if it did automatically mute/ban people for overusing the words/phrases but if that were to happen there would be certain situations that would need to be considered (for example some people, like me and my friends, might use certain 'abusive' words/phrases for friendly banter towards each other on occasion that wouldn't be acceptable towards strangers). Honestly though I think the best idea might be if someone overuses the specified words/phrases it will automatically report the individual to Riot (or send the case to the tribunal when it is reinstated) to have more efficient punishment for those who use such language (automatic punishment from an automatic system seems a bit unreliable to me hence this suggestion).","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-26T04:49:34.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the spot.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-26T03:48:24.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Terrible idea.","replies":[]}]}
