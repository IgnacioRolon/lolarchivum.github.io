First client crash of the day and BAM, thrown into another LPQ.\nThis is like my 4th game today, I don't know what to say. Funny thing is, I expect riot won't do anything about this - what an absolute joke.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-26T21:49:27.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new leaver buster is just a nuisance, all it does is punish those who have occasional tech problems, the actual chronic AFKers dont give a %%%% if they are are in a long Q or if they get a temp ban, if they did give a %%%% then they wouldn't AFK in the first place, so really the system only ends up annoying those who don't AFK on purpose. and those people are the people who stress over being banned because they do care about the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-26T05:05:21.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in other words, you did afk, and your getting this for the reason they give these out.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-26T05:09:41.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, this time my client crashed and I couldn't get on for a bit longer than usual.\ni know it's not my firewall that's causing it, it probably has something to do with the client itself. Planning on reinstalling it when my monthly data gets renewed.\n\nMy problem is that this might happen between 5-9 games.  Usually it's only for a minute or two. The moment it happens, i'm suddenly thrown in. All it takes is one. Take a look at the other thread that I linked to - the screenshot there is a priceless example.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-12-26T05:58:15.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but your still afking, that's the problem, regardless of reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-26T06:04:02.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i've already discussed this in other forum threads.\nAt the end of the day, the system works as it's meant to.\nThe whole purpose of this post and the other is to take the piss out of something that is obviously a little bull%%%% in some regards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
