Originally,  I made this post specifically towards age .. but through discussing I figured the problem had more to do with maturity rather.. which varies throughout age-groups. I personally don't enjoy playing games with people who haven't \" grown up \", it honestly just puts me off the game for a couple of reasons - having to deal with constant nagging, ragers, abusers.. it's a little ridiculous. I feel as if queues need to be made for like-minded people - specifically: independent queues for people who are toxic, and another for people who are well-behaved.\n\nThe reason why such a proposition is so important is because as a community, we really don't get much of an option with what kind of people we get to deal with in solo queue. I feel as if regardless of how much we enforce our leaver buster, how much we enforce our reporting/muting systems - we won't be able to rid ourselves of trolls. This is because we literally only have one platform for ranked solo-queue.\n\nI think that what I was trying to aim for with the whole age reference was that there are obvious issues in having adults playing ranked with young teens, specifically the differences in attitude. I can see age as being a primary factor in determining eligibility if such a queue were to exist, but not necessarily being the only determinant. Ultimately, it would have to be the personals overall behaviour that would determine whether a person would be eligible to join or not.\n\nWhat i'm asking for here is an alternative queue that will promote behavioural changes in the community. More incentive to be positive throughout games. All of our current incentive systems , like border ribbons .. and... is there really anything else? they don't really bring much substance to the community imo. I feel as if this could be somewhat valuable to solving the whole issue of toxicity in our community.\n\nNote:\nFor those who read this post before 100 views, you'll notice that I completely rewrote the opening segment.\nI felt like It was poorly written, and didn't really express the idea as it was intended.\n\nAnyways, thoughts on this  would be much appreciated.\nLet's get a discussion going.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-22T05:52:02.971+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lnar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PsQtVy9I,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-22T05:09:40.912+0000)\n>\n> Then you've also got the immaturity with some of the younger players that us older players are kinda getting a bit sick of.\n\nAnd you get that same immaturity with any age group. Age doesn't determine a persons maturity.\n\n> I think this kind of says a little about the **difference in attitude between the younger players and the more mature players** in the community.\n\nWhat difference? There is no difference.\n\nNot considering the fact that there are just as many immature idiots in this game above 18, what's to stop people from lying about their age? Tell people they can't do something and what's the first thing they do? This suggestion is flawed both because there is no age limit to immaturity and people would just lie about their age to get into 18+ queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-22T10:20:22.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response, I've just come back from work.\nNow, you're making a reasonable assumption in saying that there are just as many immature idiots in this game that are over the age of 18, so, I won't argue against that. To tell me that my suggestion is flawed, well, I see a problem in your assumption.\n\nYou want to tell me that people would be able to lie about their age in order to get into an 18+ queue, well, you're right, they can.\nBut lying doesn't necessarily change a persons attitude, does it?\nI would expect that if such a queue were implemented, it would not be taken for granted. Certain measures would be carried out to keep \"what was promised\", that being : a queue that is intended for a certain level of behaviour.\n\nNow, in saying that, we need to consider what it is that constitutes mature behaviour, we could assume a variety of factors but to keep things short, we'll just go along the lines of \" people who aren't toxic\" . I would expect that if such a queue was administered into the game, a tribunal of sorts would be responsible in keeping order via. in game reports. LeaverBusters or automated punishments systems would be a liability for the community, as there is always a possibility that someone may be falsely reported for something that didn't happen, which is why an independent tribunal would be key in maintaining the peace.\n\n\nNow, considering the possibility that those who are interested in joining the queue but do not belong there for obvious reasons, may try and make an account with false information. Let me remind you that for those who play ranked, accounts need to hit level 30 to be eligible. That grind takes a couple of days, and it is very unlikely that there would be people who would re-create accounts to have a couple of games in said queue simply to troll ( which would be a whole other level of trolling ).\nIf we consider that people are at risk of losing eligibility due to certain flaws in their own behaviour, then, we would have a queue that promotes incentive to be nicer to others.\n\nBack to your point about how age doesn't play a significant role in the behaviour of our players in this community, I would like to say that I agree with you, but, to a certain extent only. It is true that there are some older people in this community that are immature, have bad social-awarenesses, and are overall toxic to the community, but I'm gonna have to say that it is more prominent among the younger players. Having said that, there are plenty of younger players that show a good attitude when playing with others, and they're welcome to partake in said queue. \n\nWhat it comes down to, at the end of the day, is that \"good\" players deserve to play among better communities of people.\nIt is impossible to achieve this when you have everyone playing in one queue.\nEvery community in league deserves to be paired with their own \" age - appropriate, or better said, behaviour appropriate \" players.\nLet us pair toxic players with toxic players, and reasonable players with reasonable players.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-22T10:44:15.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically what you are saying is, their needs to be a queue where 0 toxicity is tolerable? or you get permabanned? \nSounds pretty fair, it would remove a lot of the toxicity in the game. \nExcept idk if riot would do anything about swearing in codes, like \"STFU and SMD\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-22T10:48:22.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah :)\nI'm not too sure about being perma-banned, it's really hard to come up with an entire solution to this whole thing without having spent a significant amount of time contemplating over it.\nI think words like STFU or SMD are pretty harmless, it all depends on context honestly.

You can't compare league to other F2P MMO's. \nLeague is different in the sense that your own progression heavily relies on the others that are in your team.\nIt's not a matter of picking and choosing in soloqueue, you get what you're given.\nSince we're on the topic of mmo's, let's look at WoW.\nThey have different servers for different sorts of people : Some are into RP, some are into Global PVP - These \"allocated\" servers are implemented for a reason : like minded people to be around one another.\nApply this to one of the main issues in LoL, *behavior* , then you'll see a sudden positive shift in the community.\nToxic players can thrive in a toxic environment, and those well-behaved can thrive in a cleaner more positive environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-22T14:15:43.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lnar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PsQtVy9I,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-22T13:56:15.171+0000)\n> \n> You're telling me that it won't be hard for people to get level 30 accounts.

What kind of rationality implies that someone will devote 2-3 days making a new account in order to troll a specific queue? I'm not denying the fact that through initial phases this feature will be abused, but in turn, people will be kicked out. The same can't be said for our current ranked queue, there is only one ranked queue.  The whole idea is that at a certain point in time, most accounts that are currently in use will most likely be appropriated to their own queues. \n\nAgain, it is unreasonable and improbable to assume that anyone would seriously devote 2-3 days to make troll-smurfs. The idea is just so counter-productive and does not serve anyone apart from those who seriously have nothing better to do, ( which is something that is really, really messed up to even consider in the first place ( these people need help) ) .\n\nAlso, refrain from the derogatory.

If you categorize players into different age groups in solo queue, you would be waiting in queue a lot longer than usual, especially if you are very young or much older than the average player. Also, maturity can simply not be measured by age; a whole room full of 12 year olds will not create a better environment for gamers, it will just create even more animosity within the community. \n\nI can see that your overall point from this discussion is that you want a 'rage-free environment' when playing League of Legends, however I don't agree that the way to do that is to limit players into age restricted queues; I think it is simply a problem that Riot has to deal with by banning toxic players.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-23T02:05:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you've got a really important point here - Something I feel like I don't have the exact answer to at the moment, but, I'll try to respond.\nIn saying that, age-division wouldn't necessarily work in a literal sense - but seeing as the eligibility would be determined by behaviour, it wouldn't surprise me if adults were more prevalent in this queue. \n\nWhat it comes down to is : are we splitting the player community too much by doing this? In the sense that queue's might take longer for both groups of people. It's a really tough point to discuss, Because at some point we might find ourselves looking at a worst case scenario, that being : A clear majority of the community could find themselves playing in this new queue, leaving the others having to wait a lot longer to get their matches made.\nThis point brings into question : how would eligibility work exactly? are we talking about temporary bans from this queue for toxicity? what time periods, weeks? months? Could this be abused by people?\n\nThese are some points.. But then you have to consider:\nHow effective will the reporting system be at the time? How would it work? \nOne Idea that I have that may be effective (you can tell me if this has any flaws to it) is having a sort of AbuseBuster system implemented into the game. It could be a chat filter that recognises certain expressions. There are a number of words that aren't exactly necessary in social environments, i'm sure you could think of a few - words that we take for granted in most cases, even if not in an abusive context. Alienating these words from the game can do a lot for our community.\n\nSure it's a limitation on our freedom of expression, if you don't like what someones saying - mute them?\nBut that's another problem of it's own. To mute someone in your team, you are putting yourself at a disadvantage, solely for the reason that this person could have potentially been someone who was valuable to the team. So I don't think muting is a complete solution to combatting abuse in league. Having said that, I don't really see much of an alternative to *dealing with abuse*.\nI think it would be unfair to the community to be told that they cannot speak in a certain way, which is why it would be important to have this alternative queue rather than AbuseBuster being implemented into the only platform for ranked.\n\nThis is because, If league were to alienate abusive behaviour *completely* they might end up losing a fair few numbers on their player base.\nSome people can't change, but for those that can, let's allow them something a little better to strive for.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-22T11:31:33.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah people will just lie about their age anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-12-22T09:42:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We already heard this same thing a week ago.
