I literally get sent the same piece of text that was sent to me the last time I tried talking to them.\nThe last time I talked to them was when I got the LPQ because I stopped moving in a 3v5. Technically, I didn't actually leave the game - stayed there and talked to everyone for the rest of the game, it was pretty chill.\n\nMy problem with this whole thing, is the fact that customer support is too lazy to even consider context.\nI can't tell if it's a part of their job description to be dismissive about these things, or whether they're actually just ignorant. It just makes the whole process of talking to them in the first place kind of distasteful. What's annoying is that even though i've literally given evidence that whatever happened in this case ( me leaving ) didn't ruin the game for anyone in my team -I mean, come on, our mid and I literally carried that game - They still choose to treat my as if i've done something hugely wrong and still need to be punished for it.\n\nFact is : I don't really \"AFK\" unless something stupid happens to our game like, when it's a 3v5 or a 4v5 and the enemy team is just acing us under tower. It's never a, team: \" omg, why are you AFKing? reported. \" - It's always something that's mutually understood by everyone in the game, but in most cases, some want to play it out because they aren't planning on starting a new one afterwards ( time issues, i've actually asked a couple of people about this ). Other times I might AFK is for a couple of minutes when the client crashes, which tends to happen pretty frequently for some stupid reason. Like it has nothing to do with my firewall, it just happens.\n\nI totally get why we've got these LPQueues going, and can understand the need to put people who are intentionally putting their teams at a disadvantage through this kind of a punishment system. But honestly, Riot needs to understand that there is a line - context is so %%%%ing important when you want to discuss this sort of thing, right or wrong, and it just seems to me that a majority of player support representatives do not display this sort of an understanding whatsoever.\n\nAgain, it just brings into question : Are these people just plain stupid or lazy? or is it a part of their job description to not be reasonable with these kinds of things. I've asked these people before, in response they've clearly ignored the question and quoted something com","replies":[]},{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2014-12-25T00:42:14.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thresh is so pro;(","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-25T00:47:42.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, he had to solo lane for a couple of minutes.
