If Lp gains/losses were equivalent, it wouldn't be so bad :/ then again, i don't really understand the reasoning behind this calculation ( if there is one ).","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-15T00:08:55.676+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"your MMR is lower than where you are in the tiers.\n\nsome people like to drop tiers to try to reset their MMR, but the best way is to just win lots...\nstill, 2-1 with a 5 LP gain ISNT bad. its just less than you hoped. back in the days of ELO you would get gains of 5-10 and loses of about that depending on MMR. sometimes i would win 5 and lose 3 and still only get +5 at the end.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-15T02:29:50.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shame you missed out on the amazing days of tier 1 clamping when gaining 5 LP was seen as lucky 8)","replies":[]}]}
