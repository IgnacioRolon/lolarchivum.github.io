Me and Kalista {{champion:429}}  were working with great synergy.\r\n\r\nMy internet connection is very stable and there should never be an issue with lag.\r\n\r\nIn this particular game i noticed the game lagging from the start. I said to myself it would have to be the only game for the day (and it was only my first game of the day too)\r\n\r\ntoward the 18-20 minute mark my game connection had been compromised and i was unable to play.\r\n\r\n1. I could not move around the map using my cursor\r\n2. There was a freeze in time. \r\n3. I wasn&#039;t able to control my champion \r\n\r\nI had to make a quick decision. I decided to restart the LoL client/Application. this process took around two minutes. \r\n\r\nI was happy to be back in game with my team, had noticed Kalista had just gotten a triple kill and also Zed {{champion:238}}  was ready to engage with me. I was able to fit back into my role comfortably and helped secure a penta kill for Kalista assisting 4-5 of the takedowns. \r\n\r\nWe won the match within minutes of my return. \r\n\r\nAfter the match I received a notice from the riot team. explaining I am exhibiting AFK tendencies. I was not going AFK and felt this message could have been more appropriate. \r\n\r\n1. Letting the player have a chance to explain what happened may be good.\r\n2. if the player reconnects to the game it should be taken into consideration as it shows the player/person is eager to play.\r\n\r\nThankyou for this opportunity \r\nI hope in future i do not receive accusations from the riot team.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-13T01:54:05.588+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll preface this by saying you have absolutely nothing to worry about.\n\nIn League AFK Behaviour encompasses any reason that removes you from the game, whether that is intentionally or otherwise. The simple reason being that if the system was more lenient on disconnects than intentional afks, everyone would just spoof a disconnection, which not only defeats the purpose, but also hinders the connection info Riot has coming in which helps them diagnose problematic ISPs/lines/etc.\n\nEveryone knows shit happens, and Riot is no exception. A disconnect or afk here and there isn't going to hurt you (excepting the LP loss if you are playing ranked), because stuff comes up. Your internet dies, or a family emergency happens, whatever.\n\nThe notification you describe comes up *very* early. It is simply a warning to make it clear that consistent afk behaviour will be punished, that it is not something you can just get away with as seems to be the perception of some players going in.\n\nIf you aren't intentionally afking/have very persistent internet issues, you will never run foul of LeaverBuster (the afk punishment system).","replies":[]}]}
