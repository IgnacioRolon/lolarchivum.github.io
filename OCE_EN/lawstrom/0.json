(Sorry if this post is on the wrong board, I wasn&#039;t sure what it categorized as)\r\n\r\nI was wondering what Riot&#039;s reasoning for having blind pick as the only normal game mode for the OCE server? I find it is kind of counter intuitive if I want to practice my role in ranked but cannot due to blind pick &quot;whoever calls first, gets the role&quot;. I feel having draft pick only would be a really nice feature because of the new champion select, people who only play two roles aren&#039;t forced to play other roles like Blind pick. I know it isn&#039;t an option to open a draft pick only queue because of our small server population, but I still think it is viable to replace blind pick completely with draft pick.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m also interested in what the rest of the OCE has to say. I don&#039;t see any downsides to replacing blind pick with draft pick and I think it would be more enjoyable for the player base as a whole, thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Maldark","date":"2016-06-14T11:46:51.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Draft mode requires every player to have at least 16 Champions, newer players wouldn't be able to join the queue\n2) We're a small server, Riot OCE doesn't want to split the player base between Normals/Draft, it would make the wait times on one/both pretty bad\n3) They are working on a Normal pick with the new champ select so you'll get your own role allocation, it's coming Soon(tm) and will replace the current Blind Pick when it's done.\n\nI know how you feel. Ever since I left NA the one thing I've missed more than anything is Draft Normals. It's not even to get my role, or to counterpick it's just to ban those same obnoxious OPs you're bound to see every other game of Normals. I can't stand playing against some of those broken OP champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Lawstrom","date":"2016-06-14T12:59:30.180+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man thanks for the comment. \n\nPoint 1 totally explains why Riot hasn't enabled draft pick, I forgot about it, thanks for letting me know. As for Point 2, I remember back in season 3 or season 4 we used to have draft pick alongside blind but it was incredibly unpopular and the queue times were horrible. As for point 3, had no idea they were sorting out new champ select for current blind pick, that is awesome. \n\nYeah its a real shame, I completely agree with your last paragraph.\n\nOnce again thanks for taking the time to reply and fill me in.\n\nHave a good day,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A No√µb","date":"2016-06-14T19:11:06.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Takes too long for normals to draft.","replies":[]}]}
