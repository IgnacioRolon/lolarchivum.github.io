Could some explain what is LP and how to get into silver?","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T12:19:27.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am unranked, so take this with as much credibility as you please. You asked about how you can get to silver, a friend of mine who recently placed gold gave me some advice on this recently.\n\nHe said the most important part of climbing out of the lower ELOs is wave management. \n\nIf you don't know how to freeze a lane, or how to build up a massive minion wave, you'll have a harder time climbing.\n\nHe went on to say that knowing wether you want to push or be pushed in is a massive part of higher tier play.\n\nThe example he gave me was Fizz. He said as soon as you get into lane, focus on pushing Fizz under his tower and try to delay his level 3 for as long as possible. Before he hits 3, try to bring the push into the centre of the lane and freeze as much as you can. Fizz's level 3 is very strong, and leaving the lane like this allows your Jungler to gank for you, but also allows you to retreat if Fizz's jungler comes for you. Once Fizz has 6, it can be very dangerous to trade with him, or to even be near his tower, from here on you'd want to be farming under your tower. Just make sure to follow him if he roams :)\n\nThat's just one example of wave management, but hopefully it points you in the right direction :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-02-05T11:27:05.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP stands for league points which you get from winning ranked matches or lose if you lose. You get on average 18-20 league points (lp) per win and lose about 15-19 per loss. Once reaching a 100 lp, you go into your promotional matches; best of 3. If you win you get promoted, if you lose, you stay on the same rank. Also, you get demoted if your lp reaches 0 and you lose more matches. \n\nCheers. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-02-05T08:05:30.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP is the points gained in every win of a rank game. Gaining 100points will allow you to either: 1) put you in a promotional series to a next tier or 2) a division. \n\nIf you hadn't notice the amount of points you gain (from a given knowledge of a friend of mine) : will depend on the people you play with/against. E.g - if you are bronze 1 and you play against 1 or 2 silver 4s/3s' you will likely gain maybe 21-24 points or 20,  otherwise playing with low bronze will typically give you 12 or 16 or even less- this also includes the LP loss. Or to put it simply- the MMR of the players ranks you play with.\n\n^Source : http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/209734/how-is-lp-calculated\n\nOnce you gained a rank after your promotional series you typically have about 5 loss before you get demoted.\n\nOnce you climbed a few tiers> you have about 3-5, but thru my own knowledge it is 3 losses once you've hit 0LP and on a loss streak after losing on OLP.\n\nAlso in higher tiers like plat+ their LP deteriorates after a certain period of time if they have not played rank.\n\nI think thats all    I     know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2017-02-05T07:15:55.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LP is points you get for winning a game.
