It seems like for whatever reason the automated system doesn&#039;t pick it up. Is it something that&#039;s only frowned on if it&#039;s accompanied by other toxic behaviour? Should I submit a support ticket? What do other players think, is it / should it be allowed?\n\nTo be clear, it's the homophobic f-slur that at one time meant 'cigarette'.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-16T10:15:53.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends a bit on context, though homophobic slurs are treated seriously.\n\nThe IFS notification is notoriously unreliable and severely limited in when it appears. Not getting the popup doesn't mean noone was punished. There's a whole slew of reasons the popup might not appear for you even if someone has been punished.\n\nThat said, if someone has said something real bad and you want to make sure the report has been seen, feel free to submit a ticket to support. Post game reporting should always be your first option since it's those reports that count for negative history in the case someone isn't punished and it's also far more efficient. \n\nSupport also can't give you any info about someone else's account (privacy and all that) so you'll just get a generic \"thanks for your report\" type response. Doesn't mean they haven't looked at it, just that they can't tell you anything about what happens.","replies":[]}]}
