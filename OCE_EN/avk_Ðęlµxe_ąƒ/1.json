I have all of the champs, 20 rune pages and every rune.\r\n**My IP is basically just growing into a beast...**\r\n\r\nWaiting for the next champion to be released, so I can purchase it outright with my** IP**.\r\nAfter several name changes, I can safely say I&#039;m happy with my current summoner name.\r\n\r\nWhat else can &quot;_those people_&quot; do with their **IP**?\r\nNothing. Nothing at all...\r\n\r\nI feel chromas would be great if purchasable with **IP**.\r\nMaybe for 15600** IP**? That&#039;s the price of two new release champions.\r\nMaybe you could get some Ward Skins or even Summoner Icons into the **IP** price Range. like 15600 **IP** for a Ward Skin and maybe like you did once with Harrowing ward skins, you could make it a &quot;rental&quot; on the ward skin.\r\n7800 **IP** get&#039;s you 2 weeks hire. So you don&#039;t get to keep it, but use it for 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nWith Icons you could do a new set of Icons, that can only be bought with** IP**... ones you have to earn through** IP**.\r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\nWould like to be able to use this mass build up of **IP**.\r\nThanks for reading. \r\nxo","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-07-10T02:13:07.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the times when you could buy an icon (1500 ip) as well as earn one for each featured game mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-07-10T01:34:59.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i 100% agree, maybe they could increase the master rank to 10 or something then once you get the champ to that mastery their chroma pack becomes available for purchase with ip, im sitting on 40k ip and absolutely nothing to do with it, even make it so you can gift champs with ip","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-07-10T21:39:51.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow you must have played longer then me but IP is meant to be earned to make you buy runes and rune pages and champs,  all the fancy skins doubtful will ever be IP.

I mean the main reason RP was made was so that players would actually spend some cash on premium points that can purchase things that you can't get for just playing (_\"Playing League of Legends is FREE\"_  lmao). This applies to all games; they all have some sort of premium credit that require you to use money to help your game be easier. For League it's a bit different in the sense that RP won't actually help win your games (cept for the theory that some skins make your skillshot hitboxes bigger??) but even then RP sales would diminish drastically. From Riot's POV it would be an unnecessary change they would have to make.\nI fully support the idea; I am not bursting with IP but it would be a nice feeling to change some of your eventually worthless IP into RP for cool aesthtics but Rito will never agree unless it's like a HUGE conversion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-10T07:29:36.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would be nice if you could buy some of the wards during events.\n\ni really like this idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-10T06:27:23.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should allow you to buy 40 rune pages..
