Can't say I'm surprised, seeing they're trying so hard to dominate every single popular genre there is, from RTS, to ARPG, to MMORPG, then card games and now FPS and MOBA/ARTS.\n\nI say next Blizz game would be a new Diablo Action RPG game in 3rd person perspective starring a lone warrior in a dying/left-behind world, fighting to hold onto or restart the fallen age.
