Near Raine Square. More Details to come... But I require your input.\n\nWhat would you like to see at this event?\nDo you have a laptop to bring?\nIf you are under 18, Do you want Parental Units to be there, or maybe just some really cool nerdy Auslan adults who will look after you...\nIf you are over 18, Do you want to help? :P\nCan you afford $5?\nWould you rather the profits if any, go towards the lovely guys at Game City or the WA Deaf Society?\n\nand lastly, what kind of Loot would you like me to get from RIOT?\n\n**Keep in touch with us @\nPage: https://www.facebook.com/AuslanDeafSummonersClub/\nGroup: https://www.facebook.com/groups/537333886433998/\nLeague Chat: Deaf Summoners Club**\n\nThanks very much,\n\n\n\nAlvin\n_- Auslan Deaf Summoners Club._\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
