It&#039;s been a couple years now aye.\r\n{{item:3070}} \r\nMaybe getting the Dominion map, and a 3v3 AI vs Co-op would be a good thing to start rolling out to the OCE.\r\nFrom there, maybe... just maybe... I wont have to log into NA just to play Dominion. I mean after a hard days Ranked. ARAMS are a nice way to calm the nerves a bit... but sometimes I just want to 3v3 some AI or Bless those cotton Dominion socks for some circular fun.\r\nI mean, SR is looking great... and will always be the very best. *insert pokemon theme song*\r\n\r\nDominion... well,\r\nI just miss it is all.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} {{summoner:17}} \r\n\r\nNEVER FORGET.","replies":[{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-07-03T02:20:17.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna lie, I wouldn't be as bothered about this if they actually told us what the progress is, but as far as I've seen they're actively ignoring all questions about it.
