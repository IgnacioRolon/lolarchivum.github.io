Each person that talks has to say a couple of sentences, and then that literally locks their voice to automatically transcribe.\nNow, sure, it&#039;s not perfect, but it&#039;s the best option for right now... as hiring someone to short hand transcribe would be very costly.\nOf course, there are many programs to do this, I just know how great Dragon is, and how easy it is to setup.\nHave a think about it.\nBring it up in your meetings and stuff.\nThis is pretty vital to people with hearing issues, who love playing this game, and love watching the Pros, whilst being included with the exciting shout casting, interviews and all the other cool stuff that happens at these events.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n{{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-02-07T00:48:05.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@BaconPoroDeluxe - hey man just want to let you know that we have read your thread and Its a really cool idea. I couldn't provide an estimate of when we would be able to release something like this, but it is definitely something on the list :)\n\nThanks for giving us some ideas for an option of how to do it to :) I definitely second Talwyn's thoughts.

I can't imagine how long it must take to transcribe all of those games by hand. I definitely think Riot should implement some sort of thing for people who are deaf. With my finals finished I have plenty of spare time on my hand. If you ever need help with anything whilst working on this project I would be happy to lend my assistance. Regardless, what an amazing effort and an amazing idea! \nHave a great day!","replies":[]}]}
