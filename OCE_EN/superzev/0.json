I can see why I have received a punishment, as my behaviour was not acceptable, however I dont believe I deserve a perma ban. I have received a two-week ban previously, and then altered the way i behave in league of legends after that. However last night I must have been tired or something and just wrote some stupid sh*t again without thinking. If I knew that after my two week ban the next punishment was going to be a PERMANENT ban I definitely wouldnt have acted this way. I know I shouldnt be acting this way under any circumstances anyway, but I guess I wasnt thinking... I think it is quite unfair that I was not warned that that two week ban was my last chance at reforming. \n\nI have thought about what I did in that game and read the chat logs and wondered what I was thinking at the time to be honest. Most of the trash-talking I did in that game was directed towards my friends that I was duo-qued with at the time as a joke. examples like_ &quot;SuperZev: why tf u feedin dude&quot;_ was when my friend died for the first time when I was already 1/3. A pretty funny joke if you ask me :^). I understand that I may have excessively used the n word in this chat log, and after reading what I had written the next morning I am truly disgusted that I even wrote that. It is very unlike me.\nAnother example:\n_SuperZev: who do u think u r\nSuperZev: gtfo\nSuperZev: u stupid rat\nSuperZev: we got a rat on oour team\nSuperZev: ban rat_\nThis was when my rat teammate, Vayne, went top lane to steal this phat wave of farm from me for some reason even though I asked her nicely to stop. In the end she didnt even steal it from me, so credit to her for this one. Thanks Vayne.\nOne last example:\n_&quot;SuperZev: why must u bring a 2v1 for me\nSuperZev: im literall 1 and 10\nSuperZev: answer me i swear to god c*nt&quot;_\nWas when the enemy team just kept sending 3+ people top lane to kill the 1 and 10 gnar. It was really getting on my nerves, because one person could kill me easily but they jsut send like 5 people up. And they just werent responding to me so I had to enforce my authority and demand that they answer. \nAlso, if this Ban is for INTing, I actually wasnt trying to at all. I stuck under my tower most of the time and I am pretty sure i got first blood on the Irelia but she just got camped after that I believe. I think in the end my score was pretty bad but at one point both my bot laners were 0/6 and 0/5, however I never commented on this by them.\n\nIn the end I would just like to say that I have truly had fun playing League of Legends over these last couple of years and it is really sad to see it go. If Riot thinks this ban is deserved, then so be it, but I would like another chance with my account. I do believe I deserve a punishment of some kind for my behaviour that game, but not a permanent ban, getting rid of hours of hard work (owning every single rune in the game and almost every champ) as well as my hundreds of IRL money that I had put in, totalling up to about $800 over the years. Perhaps a mute or two week ban, but not a permanent ban that I wasn&#039;t warned about receiving.\n\n\nEntire Chat-log for anyone interested: https://pastebin.com/Nz9vTvSa","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-25T09:02:29.242+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"On every 14-day suspension reform card, one of the lines at the top reads:\n> If this behavior continues, your account will be permanently suspended\n\nAdditionally, this information is widely out there, as mentioned in the Instant Feedback System FAQ as well as many other sources:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q2\n\nConsistent and repeated toxicity, especially in the face of prior punishments isn't welcome within the community, and you shouldn't have to be threatened with a permanent suspension to change.
