The color of  the fire again could depend on the stack of the passive.\r\nE: Instead of a coat flames Annie pushes herself in the air with power and hovers (syndra/malzahar), creating a ring of fire below her leaving behind a trail as she walks (something like xerath ult). Tibbers could also be enlarged slightly during the E.\r\nR: As you level up the ulti Tibbers starts off as a realistic flaming bear (with fire on the back, arms and legs), at lvl 11 becomes too powerful for its own body and becomes a spirit of pure fire (in the shape of a bear) and at lvl 16 changes color (or other things).\r\n\r\nI know this sounds like many things pulled together from other champions, but they are merely inspirations, as Annie is already so powerful as a child, I just really want to see a future her where she is (or just looks) super overpowered, if any Rioter sees this and is fond of this concept please make it real :D Ty","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-14T06:01:02.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really another fucking annie skin? theres like 6 and a legendary.... maybe this skin on a dif champ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoklimb","date":"2015-05-14T03:26:20.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol what","replies":[]}]}
