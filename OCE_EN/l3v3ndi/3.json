Because im sick and tired of people saying that its just a game and dont take it seriously , i already know im not good my mmr and elo is shit and its hard enough . \r\nPeople abuse the same champs over and over again , the same bans over and over . (yas , blitz, camille, kat, galio,malp)\r\nAnd then your team gets one of the OP champions , lets just say its riven , now we all know a riven on the enemy team plays like box box , but the riven on your team plays like she&#039;s stuck in a box.\r\nIve checked some of my games On Triumph.gg ... im not good but i know when im having a good game..","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-03T10:21:12.578+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand your pain, having to fight (and ban) the same champions over and over, gets incredibly tedious and frustrating.\n\nBut I don't think you should only be able to play your mastery point champions in ranked.\nIn my opinion that would only compound the problem and limit the champion pool even more, and it could put many players in a tight corner. \n\nI have 24 champions with a mastery between 5 and 7. \n11 of them are mid laners, so even if all 6 bans and 2 of the enemy team (top and mid) were mid lane champs, I would still have a few to choose from.\nHowever, only 2 of my 24 are ADC's. So if Quinn and Kalista were banned, I would be unable to choose another ADC and would have to do something silly like Kindred or TF ADC, (which is the last thing you want to see on your team in ranked).\n\nAnd I have a fairly large champion pool compared to many players my rank. Many people in my experience, only have a dozen or so mastery champs, or are 1 trick ponies and only have 1 or 2. So if I am struggling with 24, then they will be near useless if they are unable to get their preferred champion. \n\nNot to mention you need at least 16 champions to play ranked in the first place.\n\nSo in theory, it would stop people playing champions they cant play, but In reality it would stop a lot of players from playing at all.\n\n_________\n\nAs for the same champions being recycled as pick/bans, when Riot introduce these mythical 10 bans into the game, we will see a far larger champion pool come into play, and games will become more varied and exiting as a result.\n\nChampions like Yasuo and Katarina, will become near 100% banned, at least in lower elos, and those 1 trick players will be forced to learn new champs. Then after a time period of adjustment, Yas/Kat etc will becomes less and less banned as the champion pool increases and people start banning new champions that suddenly become scary due to the extended champ pool, but the Yas/Kat 1 tricks will have since picked up new champions and so will play Yasuo less than they used to, and even when not banned, he wont be seen in as many games. \n\nOr, Riot will be forced to remove them from the perma-ban list by taking them down a few pegs balance wise _(because no matter what people say, if a champion is banned that often, theres something wrong, somewhere, with them.)_\n\nThis of course hinges on them actually releasing the 10 bans, like they said.","replies":[{"poster":"L3V3NDI","date":"2017-04-04T03:15:17.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LORD SESSHOMARU,\n\nI understand what you mean about putting players in a tight corner, and i never thought about it like that.\nBut i feel like when people que for a solo game , they rely on there primary pick alot , the thought of them playing their secondary role slightly tilts them. Not to mention the countless times ive seen mid/top pick into a counter then goes 0-4 within the first 5 minutes and afk. Or when all the champions they play get banned out and they start stealing other players roles.\n\n11 midlane champs noice man !!! so your a midlane main ?\n\ni have 21 champion masteries between 5-7 ( 4 of them level 7) all the champions range from ADC , SUP , MID , JG , these four roles i have a level 7 for each role i play.\n\nAS for the 10 ban system unless you have inside information about when its going to be released , i highly doubt they would implemented it globally , considering that Low Elo isnt competitive enough and like you said it would back alot of players in a corner .\n\nI personally think it would be a good thing backing people in a corner it makes then not come and play ranked after watching vlogs or just wanting to try this champion out in a ranked game or a certain champion getting banned now they feel obligated to go and play the counter/ remove toxic ranked players.\n\nI asked my self why do people play ranked ? \nAnd what i came up with apart from climbing elo ..\nIs that people want to feel a sense of satisfaction, knowing that your playing in a competitive environment / esp against people who dont want to lose LP. \nWouldnt it be awesome seeing everyone in their respected roles Level 7/knowing that they have read their abilities.\n\nI feel Like Dyrus .. I just want to play League of legends","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-04T06:37:29.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nI think a lot of that is down to skill level and mindset, players who aren't very good will be unhappy when they get a role other than their preferred, because it means they can't just spam Riven, and have to play another champ they aren't very good at. _(ironically it's the fact they spam Riven at the cost of learning other roles, that makes them bad in the first place.)_\n\nI would imagine that a lot of that negativity about playing other roles disappears as you move up the chain. (you don't see many diamond players squabbling over champs... Perhaps thats one of the reasons why they are diamond.) While all the players that do squabble over champs, end up losing and fall lower and lower.\n\nYea im a mid lane main, Azir, Aurelion Sol, and Taliyah are my main champs. They aren't exactly the most reliable in my elo, but they are certainly the most fun.\n\nIt's true that people do often pick into counters, sometimes it's not always out of ignorance. For example, Zed counters Azir, but even though I can play Kayle and other champs that do counter Zed, I would still rather pick Azir, because I have hundreds more hours of practice on him than kayle. So even though he is countered, I would still be more likely to beat Zed as Azir, than as Kayle.\n\nAs for the 10 bans, I believe the plan was to test it out in high elo, and then if it works, implement it globally in all elos. _(because riot doesn't want us playing a different game than the pros, its the same reason why the don't patch differently for high and low elo)_\n\nLow elo isn't as competitive as high elo its true, however it is more stagnant. People have fewer champion pools, the same champs (Lee Sin, Yasuo, Zed, Vayne, Blitz etc) are used every single game, (kinda unfair for the people who main champs that are countered by them). and the 10 bans will shatter this. Lower elo will become much more interesting and exciting, and I think it will be easier for good players to move up through the ranks of lower elo, and harder for bad players to. (which is a healthy thing for the game in general.)\n\nI agree that I would be cool seeing everyone playing their best champs at their highest ability. It would be bad in the current setup of the game.\nFor example, the autofill function. If everyone was playing their absolute top champions, and then you get auto-filled. You're actually screwed.\nPretend I dont get mid and are auto-filled to ADC, Both Azir and Kalista are lvl 7 so i can still play a champ I'm good at, but Azir has 200,000 mastery points, and Kalista has 50,000ish. So I would be playing a champion I'm 4 times worse with, against people are playing their mains with 200,000 points.\n\nI think it just wouldn't work in real-life practice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
