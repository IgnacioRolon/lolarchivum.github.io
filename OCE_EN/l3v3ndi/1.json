One of them were bronze 1 and the other had informed us that he hasnt played since season 3. I just want to ask, i know im gonna get flamed because im silver but half of the server is silver.\r\nwhy can they be put in my game and i have struggled to get where i am ? it makes no sense lmao and as i write this ranked ques are disabled  duo to negativity impacting games ..... lol but the damage has already been done, ive never been bronze in any season so why do i have to play with them in my games i can understand if i was silver 5 and get bronzies but when the enemy team consists of golds and high silver why can we get bronzies im nearly a whole tier above them ? {{item:3073}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-02T08:23:50.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you may not bronze 5, but you still have the mmr of a bronze 5 player.
