I sent it through email and answered questions like this:\r\nExample question here.\r\nAnswer1\r\nAnswer2\r\nAnswer3 etc.\r\n\r\nEverything seems great so far but when I read the email that they sent me again they also said that they've updated my request and i can view it here.\r\nWhen i looked at the website it was pretty much a the email conversation i had with the support team but i noticed one thing.\r\nMy answers looked like this:\r\nExample question here.Answer1answer2answer3 etc.\r\nI know riot probably uses bots to review my answers so I am worried the bots think i wrote one giant answer instead of separate answers. I also don't want to bump the bots as i heard ill be at the bottom of the queue.\r\nWhat should I do? I am really worried. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAttack 2400 or Bradley Ho on my main account","replies":[{"poster":"Attack 2400","date":"2015-03-04T05:32:39.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its recovered!

You should fix that right away.\n\nI'm not too sure whether the bots would still be able to recognise that way of answering, but don't fret. Usually, the first time they receive something they'll just ask you for it again if they didn't understand.\n\nYou're right about bumping. Sending in another e-mail will put your request at the bottom of the queue.","replies":[]}]}
