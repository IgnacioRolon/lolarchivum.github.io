I closed my mathematics book &ndash; level three calculus &ndash; and began to put away my things. Pens and pencils, books and binders, and rubbers and rulers. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey Ahri!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nMy eyes flicked up to the doorway, it was Vladimir. I frowned, what was he doing here? &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; I gave him a sceptical look. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Darius is looking for you, I think he means trouble.&rdquo; Vladimir quickly slunk away into the corridor, leaving room for curiosity to bounce around in my mind. What would Darius be looking for me for?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Excellent work today Ahri, always a pleasure to teach you.&rdquo; Professor Ryze smiled at me through his glasses. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thanks professor.&rdquo; I said flatly, not really paying attention. \r\n\r\nThe professor&rsquo;s brow furrowed, &ldquo;Something on your mind?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nI shook my head, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing sir; have a good day.&rdquo; I smiled weakly at him, as I picked my bag up.\r\n\r\nFiddling with my tie, I nervously whipped my phone out. I checked my timetable, and rushed to English. Whatever Darius wanted, it certainly wasn&rsquo;t going to be me. \r\n\r\nRushing through the corridors I picked up my pace, my tails slightly bristled anxiously. My ears pricked up, catching the sound of running footsteps. I tried to slide to a stop, knowing whoever was around the corner was going to smack right into me.\r\n\r\nA boy with a faux haircut nimbly darted straight past me, he placed his hands on my shoulders using his momentum to spin right off of me instead of tackling us both to the ground. \r\n\r\nBewildered, I called out &ldquo;Hey! Watch where you&rsquo;re going!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe boy turned his head and winked as he whizzed around the corner. How brash, I thought spitefully. Although, he does seem vaguely familiar; almost as if he had crashed into me. \r\n\r\nMy eyes narrowed, as Darius had just rounded the corner where the boy had come from. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ahri!&rdquo; he bellowed, his voice echoing off the corridor walls. Students stopped their chattering and stared. \r\n\r\nI yelped. Although no one could hear. &ldquo;Y-Yes?!&rdquo; I stammered.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Where did that weakling scurry off to! No one opposes me!&rdquo; His chiselled jaw tightened with suppressed rage. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s been held back a couple years. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;W-Who?&rdquo; I stammered. Again. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ekko!&rdquo; His eyes widened with frustration. \r\n\r\nPerplexed, I fumbled. &ldquo;W-Who&rsquo;s Ekko?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nDarius face palmed, and began in a sprint in the direction of where that boy &ndash; who I presumed was Ekko &ndash; headed off to. I instinctively ducked, as he attempted to push me into the open locker behind me on his way around the corner. \r\n\r\nI exhaled relief, that braindead Darius was gone. The students who had stopped and stared went back to chattering and soon the hallway filled with white noise. I placed the back of my hand on my forehead and closed my eyes. It was only the beginning of fourth period. \r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nIt was finally nearing the end of the school day. Luckily for me &ndash; and everyone else &ndash; the headmistress (her name was Fiora) was relieving a teacher, and had let us off ten minutes early. I brushed my skirt down and readjusted one of my socks, ready to leave for the day. \r\n\r\nI glanced at the doorway, half praying that Vladimir wouldn&rsquo;t show up and tell me some more bad news. Just to stick it to me. \r\n\r\nAnd true enough, Vladimir popped through the door. &ldquo;Ahri!&rdquo; He exclaimed, out of breath. \r\n\r\nI snapped to attention, alarmed by his panting. &ldquo;Whatisit?!&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;P-Professor Ryze is in trouble!&rdquo; He swallowed a few more breaths of air, &ldquo;And so is Darius.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Darius?&rdquo; I questioned. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;The new boy, Ekko, stole something of Darius&rsquo;.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;re you trying to tell me Vlad.&rdquo; I stood up, pushing my chair in. &ldquo;Professor Ryze is in between Ekko and Darius right now?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nVladimir shook his head up and down, rushing back out towards the hallway. I rapidly vaulted over the few desks in the way and called out to Vladimir, &ldquo;Where! Where are they!&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;The basketball courts!&rdquo; he called out, I watched as his red scarf slowly rounded the corner after him. \r\nHow did he know everything?\r\n\r\nThe headmistress tapped my shoulder, &ldquo;Is there something I should be concerned about, Ahri?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nI looked over my shoulder, a slight fear crawling under my skin. &ldquo;No, definitely not.&rdquo; I said quickly, leaving to go to the basketball courts. \r\n\r\nMy feet carried me as fast as they would go as I rushed around the school trying to get to the courts as quickly as possible. I finally reached the double gym doors leading to the outside courts. Bursting through them, I quickly scanned the immediate area; my fox instincts taking over momentarily. I brushed them away, focusing on what was before me. \r\n\r\nEkko was on one side of the court, holding a cricket baton. And on the other end was Darius, with his baseball axe. Professor Ryze was standing calmly in the centre of the court, his book open. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here!&rdquo; I hastily realised my place, and covered my mouth with my hands. \r\n\r\nAll three of their gazes latched onto me. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This douchebag stole my Timewinder!&rdquo; Ekko angrily swiped at the air with his hand. \r\n\r\nDarius laughed his annoying bully laugh, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not yours weakling, now hand it over!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nProfessor Ryze stressfully rubbed his brow, &ldquo;Now students, I&rsquo;m sure &ndash;&ldquo;\r\n\r\nDarius quickly ran past the professor and went straight for his signature move, &lsquo;Academy Guillotine&rsquo;. \r\n\r\nEkko rapidly rolled out of the way, causing Darius to smash his baseball axe right into the ground. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have to pay for that!&rdquo; Professor Ryze sighed, obviously not concerned about the fight happening right before us. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come on! Show me something new!&rdquo; Ekko taunted. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Darius had a stupid look of half rage and half confusion on his face. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, right.&rdquo; Ekko muttered as he easily dodged Darius&rsquo; next attack. \r\n\r\nDarius was beginning to become angry, &ldquo;Just stay still so I can hit you!&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What, so you can take back my Timewinder? I think not!&rdquo; Ekko rolled again, this time counterattacking Darius by hitting the back of his leg with his cricket baton. &ldquo;Take that!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nDarius angrily swiped at Ekko, to which he easily dodged him again. Why couldn&rsquo;t Darius touch him? My eyes intently peered at Ekko, the way he moved; like he already knew what was going to happen. \r\n\r\nAnd then it happened. Darius&rsquo; baseball axe snagged Ekko&rsquo;s sports bag. A fragile sounding objected smashed in the bag as it hit the marked basketball concrete with a thud. \r\n\r\nEkko adjusted his glasses, concern spread across his face. Darius swung his baseball axe again in triumph &ndash; because he managed to get something at least, in the last attempt &ndash; this time hitting Ekko in the arm with the handle. \r\n\r\nEkko was thrown to the ground by the sheer force. He managed to hit him. Darius grinned, rather evilly. He gripped his baseball axe, and walked up to Ekko, about to strike him while he was on the ground. \r\n\r\nSomething happened inside of me, for some reason, I just went for it. I rapidly spirit rushed to Ekko&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to hit him while he&rsquo;s down?!&rdquo; I shouted angrily, baring my teeth. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Out of the way, loser.&rdquo; Darius swung his axe at me, to which I spirit rushed around him. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Today is the day, you get what&rsquo;s coming to you Darius!&rdquo; a surge of adrenalin rushed through me as I summoned my orb. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Cute.&rdquo; He smirked at me, &ldquo;What&rsquo;re you going to do about it fox-girl.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This!&rdquo; I threw my orb at him with as much strength as I could muster. It breezed right through his chest. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah nice on &ndash;&ldquo; The orb came flying back, hitting him in the back, passing through him again. This time knocking him towards me. \r\n\r\nEkko instantly reacted to the distraction, rolling and blinking to Darius&rsquo; side; hitting him on the back of the neck with his cricket baton. \r\nAn idiotic look plastered Darius as he fell forward, face first onto the ground. Knocked out. \r\n\r\nMy eyes widened. I helped do that. \r\n\r\nEkko turned and looked at me, &ldquo;Thanks for that, that douchebag would have gotten the better of me if you hadn&rsquo;t intervened.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nI smiled nervously, &ldquo;I-It was nothing, really.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nEkko lightly jogged to where his bag was, rummaging through it. He took out a small flat circular looking device, and beckoned me over. &ldquo;This was what he stole.&rdquo; The device opened slightly, &ldquo;If I throw it like this&rdquo; &ndash; he threw the device across the court, making it expand &ndash; &ldquo;it expands, it&rsquo;s just a toy really.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be taking that.&rdquo; Professor Ryze swiped the Timewinder from Ekko&rsquo;s hands. \r\n\r\nI snapped my head to the professor, &ldquo;But sir!&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;No buts, this is dangerous to have in school.&rdquo; The professor shook his head, &ldquo;But good work you two, he deserved it coming. But you better call for a nurse.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nWe both nodded our heads. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So, what class do you have next, Ahri?&rdquo; Ekko grinned. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;How do you know my name?&rdquo; I laughed.","replies":[]}
