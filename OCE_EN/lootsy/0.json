I was NOT patching or anything like that, no programs running that might have interfered with something, I played fine all day, closed the game, came back about an hour later and suddenly i can't get back in the launcher (couldn't even reinstall  the game without getting same message)\r\n\r\nnow where it gets odd is that any other internet source e.g. iPhone hotspot allows me to work the game perfectly on the mac, no issues. This made me think that surely its an issue with my internet router and not the game itself.\r\n\r\nthis is not the case, the router works fine and I and everyone else in the house gets internet on the computers (accessing google/youtube, no issues) it seems to be limited to LoL only, I've called the internet provider and everything is working fine on their end and no system settings are in place to interfere with the game.\r\n\r\nI've tried logging into game/ entering a game with hotspot and then changing to home wifi once past log in.... instant loss of connection, even though safari/youtube all working fine and clearly have a connection on mac status bar\r\n\r\nso in short.\r\n1. worked fine on macbook, no issues - suddenly no access/ no even reinstall\r\n2. internet router still providing internet that works for myself and family on everything except LoL\r\n3. any other source of internet such as hotspot allows me to play LoL on the mac perfectly\r\n\r\nany ideas would be greatly appreciated as I've gone way over my phone data limit and using hotspot permanently is definitely not a solution lol.","replies":[{"poster":"O1ny","date":"2015-01-16T11:31:16.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go to this site http://hotspot-shield.joydownload.com and download the hotspot install it and turn on the protection then open the launcher and begin the download.\nI am installing at the moment so not positive it will get to 100% but it's the 1st time after a million tries that it has passed 32% am currently at 50%.
