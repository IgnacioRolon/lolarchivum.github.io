The march of the armies shook the earth upon which they tread, banners held high, toward what would be their end.\r\n\r\nThe army in the colours of blood and night sprinted through the valley, teeth bared with a hunger only battle could satisfy. At their head was their leader, their God-King. Clad in cold steel, armour heavy to a mortal but not to him. It was crafted from the melted-down thrones of the countless kingdoms he had conquered. An obvious message, one no man could ignore. In his hands he held his axe, nameless and a mystery to even his highest ranking generals. An artefact of an ancient war. Some soldiers thought this to be a sign of sentimentality, but most knew better of their leader. By his side ran a blood-red wolf, ethereal and slightly translucent. As Darius hungered so did the wolf, as he struck down his enemies so did the beast leap for their throats. It was his birthright, his untamed rage and might made manifest. His soldiers admired him, and he them. They relished the chance to prove themselves in his army, to earn their ranks through combat and skill. He yearned for the day that his own warriors, elevated by his teachings, would destroy even him. To Darius, strength was everything. The strongest should always lead, even if that meant his own demise. Together they ran, hearts beating in time with their war-drums, willingly consumed by their thirst for bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe army in the colours of justice and light marched orderly through the valley. Like clockwork they moved towards the army of the Forsaken, armour polished and swords sharpened. They were the bringers of justice, keepers of peace, guardians of the utopian nation of Demacia. At the centre of their army was their God-King. His meticulously crafted armour shone brilliantly in the sunlight. Blue lights danced upon it&#039;s chest and arms, flaring in tune with his fury. It was impressive, but it was truly a status symbol. He was Garen, King of Demacia, Deity to his people, and his word was law. His soldiers knew the penalty for dissent and this kept them loyal. At his side rested Garen&#039;s blade of divine justice, a weapon of immense cosmic power and Demacia&#039;s highest court of law. His citizens gossiped little for fear of punishment, but some whispered that the latent power of creation may dwell within him. At the head of their cohort strode a fierce, regal lion. It&#039;s roar inspired bravery in even the most hopeless of men and fear in those that would dare oppose his justice. It was a gift from his ancestor, his ancient power brought to life. His soldiers marched perfectly in sync. Their individuality was a small price to pay for the peace the God-King brought. To Garen, his law was everything. Those who followed it would prosper, those who didn&#039;t faced his wrath. Together they marched, eager to smite the heathens in the name of all that was just.\r\n\r\nIt was midday when the two forces first noticed each other. In the distance the Demacian soldiers spied a red and black sea rushing towards them. Some faltered, began to march out of time or not at all. The lion at their head made a deafening roar and the soldier&#039;s soon corrected themselves. Some were inspired by the power of their leader, others by the fear of his blade. Darius&#039; forces continued to sprint toward the army of Demacia. Finally, their bloodlust would be sated, and the false God-King&#039;s facade would be torn down. As they neared, the armies now but twenty meters apart, Darius swung his axe into the ground, sending a shockwave through the earth. &quot;Wait.&quot; He told his army. They obeyed, his raw strength was his right to give such orders. &quot;Halt.&quot; Garen spoke to his forces. The march froze in place. His men parted as Garen walked to the head of his army, hand on his blade&#039;s hilt.\r\n\r\n&quot;You.&quot;\r\n\r\nGaren pointed to his rival with a hand cased in an intricately carved gauntlet. His voice boomed across the valley and shook Darius&#039; forces to their core. The blue magic infused in his armour flared with his shout.\r\n\r\n&quot;You insolent child. You play with power you will never understand.&quot; The Demacian army cheered, intoxicated by the righteousness of their purpose. \r\n\r\n&quot;I am God-King by right.&quot; Responded Darius, his words infused with a primal rage. &quot;I lead this army because I have proven myself. What have you ever proven, Garen? You used your power to construct an empire and then placed yourself upon it&#039;s throne. You cut down dissenters with their hands tied. You are a coward.&quot; His men howled, their war drums beating even louder than before. \r\n\r\n&quot;I will not listen to such treason. You think I wish to be cutting down my own men? I do so in the name of peace. Sacrifices must be made.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;But they&#039;re never your sacrifices are they?&quot; Darius could see the fury burning in his enemies eyes. &quot;Your peace is a lie. Conflict is what drives humanity forward. Without it they stagnate, rot and die. You care nothing for humanity, for your people. The world of kingdoms and empires is a false reality. Men must indulge the violence in their hearts.&quot; To this Darius&#039; forces howled in agreement. \r\n\r\nGaren drew his weapon, his lion was ready to pounce. &quot;You are a damned fool. Humanity knows nothing of what is best for them. We are more than them, descendants of the universe&#039;s most ancient forces. It is our responsibility to lead them where they cannot, to guide them through this world they do not understand. You think yourself just because you let them devolve to this sickening state? I am building them a utopia.&quot; \r\n\r\nDarius&#039; wolf bared its teeth. &quot;In which your justice rules unchecked? It surely is a utopia, but not for your people.&quot; The Demacian soldiers looked unnerved. His words were a serpent among their thoughts. &quot;How many other kingdoms, how many prospering civilisations have you yourself destroyed? Erased so thoroughly from this world that even history does not remember their names?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;They knew the price for defying me. They made their choice. Just as you and your men are choosing to die right now by my blade.&quot; Darius&#039; men stopped chanting. The war-drums quieted. They were afraid. \r\n\r\n&quot;You call criticism defiance? Those men did nothing to harm you or your empire. You are afraid Garen, afraid that your own kingdom may collapse if you leave any alternative standing.&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;Enough.&quot; Garen shouted. Darius&#039; men recoiled at his power. &quot;Your words are a poison. You will be executed for your defiance. All of Demacia will breath peacefully when you fall.&quot; His lion roared, it shone with a blinding light. His army drew their weapons.\r\n\r\n&quot;I will show humanity its true potential for destruction. Your empire will be the first step.&quot; His wolf howled and his soldiers followed. Darius&#039; forces felt a red haze overtake them. \r\n\r\nBoth forces began their charge. Order and chaos converged. Runeterra would never be the same.","replies":[{"poster":"LifeNotEasy","date":"2018-10-03T04:02:04.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my favourite XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"EllieS","date":"2018-10-03T04:01:09.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"aaaOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"jawny","date":"2018-10-06T14:53:51.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked the start 'Please no hate'.
