So what if you're asexual? No time needed out of your day to jerk off, ey? :P If you're worried about how this can effect dating too... I've been in sexual relationships. Just because you're not sexually attracted to someone, doesn't mean sex is impossible. Like, I've had sex with someone and it was satisfying to see that person take pleasure. \nGive it some thought though. Sexuality is weird, and, who knows, it might pick up for you one day. I never used to be interested in League, and now I am, so umm... maybe the same thing can happen with sex? :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-08T13:57:54.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"There's no rush.

Vidja Games have ruined/setback a lot of people in terms of physical face2face social activities. This may result in being less interested in seeking relationships in general. Or a lack of commitment to other people.\n\nI wouldnt be surprised that there would be a negative correlation between games played (Hours) vs Time being outwardly social in terms of physical contact (Hours). I Can attest to that. Although my opinion sees me making attempts at going out and being physically social rather than staying purely/majoritivly virtually social.\n\nVery unlikely that you have not hit puberty by 16. There are some cases in which people have late or never do have an onset of hormones so its not completely out of the question. I would probably say that due to sedation(Sitting at computer a lot. Not going out to socialise. Lack of exercise) and less social interaction with the opposite sex, that hormones (particularly Testosterone, if you are a male im assuming) are not being produced at 'normal' rates. By normal i mean rates at which there is distinct desire to reproduce and to outwardly seek a mate ( in its purest sense). Due to no constant or very irregular social interaction with the opposite sex, testosterone levels probably drop. Do you find yourself with no intention of being in a relationship or just very little intention? \n\nPretty sure no such thing as Demi-sexual... Seems just like another tag to categorise someone on the scale. I mean Demi in itself describes something as half or less and in an inferior sense than normal. You are either sexual (from hetero to homo) or asexual. I dont think you can be halfassedsexual.\n\nAs for sexual activity, youll be ready when you're ready. Those people that talk up how hot girls are as a social thing may just have a higher level of hormones that effects their thinking. When guys talk about breast and what not, its actually a very primal instinctive feeling. (most of us) would have been raised by a mother figure and most likely have been breast fed. As a infant we would have sought comfort or protection to a mothers breasts as its an integral life giving 'essence'. It only seems logical that we strive to return to what we know is good for us. Yay Titties!\n\nalso if bait 7/10.
