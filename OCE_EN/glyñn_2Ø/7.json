So that means there has already been a Top lane, a Support, an ADC and a Jungler, That just leaves an Assassin/Mage for 2016 :3. My bet&#039;s on Syndra {{champion:134}}  being the next championship skin, any thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-16T02:18:40.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir or Viktor","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T00:53:50.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Azir.
