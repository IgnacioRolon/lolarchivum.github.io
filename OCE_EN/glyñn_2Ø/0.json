I go into the shops and there was only $25 ones. I was quite surprised because I knew that they always sold $10 cards. I go into EB Games and see they haven't got it too... and they aren't out of stock because I asked and they said they don't sell them anymore. Is this True Riot? Are you done with $10 RP? (Btw they weren't the only shops I looked in. I searched everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE for one)","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-26T02:26:28.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a credit card.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-25T23:59:57.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where i am they haven't sold them for months i don't think.\nit makes me sad :c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gucci","date":"2015-02-25T13:51:49.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they still sell them in my area","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glyñn 2Ø","date":"2015-02-25T05:33:47.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I searched JB and couldn't even find it\nI went thru\nEB\nJB\nWoolWorths\nColes\n7/11","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-02-25T02:32:35.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried getting them at JB Hifi? or even Woolworths near the cards section.
