He can easily get squashed in laning phase by many champions including:\r\nMalzahar\r\nZed\r\nRiven\r\nJust to name a few. I'm a yasuo main myself and I really think he needs a buff to him sometime","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-23T22:46:02.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol Wasn't mad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-22T10:49:05.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee has a jump on a 2 second.

His laning is SUPPOSED to be bad because his late game and his teamfight presence is ridiculous.\n\nAnd even for that, I'd say he's still a fairly strong laner. Near infinite dashes to confuse/dodge your opponent. Wind-Wall and shield. Good at harassing and getting out too. And at level 6, you have SOME kill pressure. Not as much as other champs at 6, but still some.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-22T10:42:49.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Yasuo wins any lane unless your simply better than your opponent. But once he hits 2 items, goodbye anything squishy.\n\nHyper carries shouldn't be allowed to win lane anyway imo they should go even at best in a pure champion v champion stand point (not taking into account player skill)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-02-22T10:24:50.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wtf are you serious? he is still like the most op champ even after the nerfs.

In order to kill one you will need a QSS and a gank from another lane/jungler.\n\n* Zed excels against squishy champions but is easy to focus once he has used everything up (granted you can survive). I have often heard the yas vs zed lane reffered to a skill matchup. \n\n* Riven just has all the mobility, utility and damage... lets not even go there.","replies":[]}]}
