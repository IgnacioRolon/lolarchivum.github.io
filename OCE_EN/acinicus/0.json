Anyhow reporting people is clearly not the answer and i tell people they are reported and I hear something along the lines of \"yeah and what tribunal is gonna ban me?\" Sadly I have no reply to this as tribunal is still not on OCE. So Riot please work on getting the tribunal up on OCE we don't want more champions. because we don't have fun playing with toxic players so it might be a good idea on concentrating on removing these toxic players from OCE , and getting the tribunal on OCE would definitely not only help get rid or change the behavior of these people, but would also give players the feeling that they have some say in what people they want in OCE. I think once these toxic players are no longer welcome in OCE we will see a lot more happy summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-14T10:40:48.472+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"No server has a tribunal, have you even been reading a single post from Riot over the past year?\n\nThey are working on a new Tribunal system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acinicus","date":"2015-01-14T09:48:58.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has proven that if someone gets banned they generally change the way they act, and they make a new account its going to be a while until they can enter ranked at level 30 with a minimum of 16 champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-15T21:10:17.696+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Acinicus,\n\n\nI'm sorry you've had to go through some negative games.

So a perma ban means the person will not be in the same game until they hit level 30 and they might change their behaviour knowing punishments are being handed out. For the people who get time bans they may change their behaviour knowing that if they continue acting the way they currently are there is a chance they will get perma banned and have to start from level 1 again. The sooner a tribunal is implemented the better.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-16T12:12:44.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but then new players would get discouraged by the abusive players who are re-levelling.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-15T20:12:08.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"OCE is most toxic server by far'... Have you been on the Turkish or Russian servers? Holy ♥♥♥♥. \nThe team that works on player behaviour is completely different to the team that works on champ design.\nNo server has a tribunal because Riot knows that the current system is flawed and does not work as well as it could. Henceforth, they are trying to make positive incentives for players to follow (IP boost, mystery gift) as well as harsh punishments like the leaver buster.\n\n**So until we do get a tribunal here is what you do:** You report them and block them and get their toxicity out of your mind. If you like, you could even make a list of intentional feeders and a list of people with extra toxicity (the ones that tell you to \"kill yourself\" or that you were \"raped by a family member and that is why you are so noob\" and when you get 20 or so names (if OCE is as toxic as you are claiming, it won't take that long) and send it straight to riot support.\n\nAlternatively, you could even ignore them all completely and make a game out of it. I like to play \"League bingo\"\nSet up a bingo card with things like \"instalocks mid\", \"kill yourself\", \"gg can't carry noob team\" etc etc and when you get your card filled up you can eat a piece of candy or something.
