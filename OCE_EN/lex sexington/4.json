Occasionally the clone will not attack structures and will prioritise minions before hitting inhib/turret - when this happens the clone doesn&#039;t respond to any commands to attack the structure, nor will it change to attack a champion or different minions - it basically goes on auto pilot and sticks to the wave &#039;til it&#039;s cleared, then it will wander over and after a short delay, join you in hitting the structure.  This loss of control has happened at least twice right after a q-r combo where the clone appears while you are still in the invisibility part of your q. Usually when pressing R alone the clone does what it should.\r\n\r\nBugs aside, enjoying the patch!\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T10:39:12.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best place to post stuff like this is here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report\n\nJust check the guidelines on the sidebar and to see if anyone else has posted it before you do.","replies":[]}]}
