I laughed and muted him.\r\n\r\n2nd game I had a Sona mid who spoke in very short rude sentences, displayed arrogance and a condescending attitude towards our entire team and afked at 5 mins.\r\n\r\nI received restrictions in both of these games but was not the offender - I openly admit to complaining in all chat about having to play a 4v5 but this is nothing new and does not deserve to be reported.  Here is the thing i need help with:\r\n\r\nI am not certain but it does appear that the program Riot use does not view chat in context; rather if any player is reported and happened to use a profanity, whether directed at another player or just simply used in the game, they receive a restriction.  Unfortunately, this means you yourself can be the target of abuse and still find yourself getting a ban or chat restriction when the abusive players decided to report you.\r\n\r\nplease tell me if this is the case as I am getting pretty sick of having feeders and afks on my team who blame me, rage at me, essentially abuse me (this is happening quite often in s7 i must say) and then I receive a restriction after all is said and done.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\ngenuinely concerned that you have made a dud program here","replies":[{"poster":"Lex

You did the wrong thing as well and thus got punished for it.\n\nThat whole last paragraph is especially bad. Let me try to put this all in perspective for you, if someone treated you the way you were treating everyone in these games, would you be happy about it? The vast majority of players say no, hence the punishment.\n\nPlayers decide what is and isn't ok by what they choose to report, so clearly the community agrees that your behaviour was not acceptable.","replies":[{"poster":"Lex Sexington","date":"2017-02-05T05:50:38.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"The fact that they don't show the whole chat is BECAUSE they are impartial.

You don't have to have said the buzz words that people consider inherently toxic to be punished for negative behaviour. The simplest way to illustrate the rules is the same way as it is described here on boards: \"Don't be a jerk\".\n\nThat said, hate speech is a very good way to get your first punishment escalated to an immediate 14 day ban, but that is rather irrelevant to your punishment here.\n\nThe tl;dr to answer your OP is that the system is working as intended and this punishment was deserved.

Simply because, despite it initially being one persons fault, the reciprocal behaviour has also had a negative impact on my experience and probably tilted me, and you could have just been like 'ok lol, not my fault, mute, if you want to indicate something use pings' and left it at that.\n\nReciprocating toxic behaviour and flame means that instead of having one toxic asshat on the team, your comrades now have to deal with two, which is arguably 3x more tilting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-05T07:04:41.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Precisely.

A lot of the times I've used chat in-game since I started playing have involved me swearing, saying things like \"f*ck me\" or \"well, sh!t\" rather than anything that could be considered to be directed at anyone or some kind of insult. Swearing in itself isn't punishable, that's part of the reason there's a profanity filter.\n\n> this means you yourself can be the target of abuse and still find yourself getting a ban or chat restriction when the abusive players decided to report you.\n\nIn every case I've seen where someone has said something like this, they were never innocent.
