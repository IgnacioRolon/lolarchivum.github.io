Each time this has happened I've gotten a message saying \"Leaving a game results in blah blah blah type 'I Agree' That I wont leave a game again blah blah blah\" giving me no other options but to type 'I Agree'. \n\nNow I've received a 5 minute penalty before being able to join a queue because I keep \"leaving\" games. Each time I've disconnected I have as soon as possible reconnected as I'm not wanting to lose the game either.......... so Id like to know why all options weren't considered before adding this new system. Why the good player is being punished over something out of my control as an attempt to stop people who intentionally leave games and don't reconnect.\n\nOne thing I could suggest is that when right clicking and exiting league of legends via the desktop icon you don't have the message that says \"leaving blah blah blah\" and disabling people from being able to close the game for a quick fix. My other option is to not play until my computer gets fixed but I don't believe me disconnecting for 30 seconds is a real issue here every now and then.\n\nI wrote this in hopes that Riot staff would actually read this and rethink their strategy and I'm not at all interested in reading comments made by anyone else unless it's positive or constructive.\n\nFew other victims with in the last few days I've read about are kurt16, mrichardist, ReKalibrated, SweetBaby, Organic Tuna and EnthunianFazul","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T06:49:26.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">unless it's positive or constructive.\n\nWhat a way to handle criticism.\n\nBut yes, I actually agree with you. People who disconnect and rejoin within ten minutes should not get a leave-marker on their account.\n\nAbout the changes to the way you quit games though, I disagree. The reason why the message always appears is so that no matter what method the leaver uses to leave they know that they might be punished for it.\n\nThe reds don't come here often, so it may get overlooked.
