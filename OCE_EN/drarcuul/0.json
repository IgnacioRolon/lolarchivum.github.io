I&#039;ve been playing it using Garena ( servers based in Malaysia / Phillipines, i think ) on and off for several years now.  I&#039;ve accrued all champions over there and have found my calling as a SP Main.\r\n\r\nAfter watching this years lolesports live world championships for the first time, i&#039;ve been inspired to find a team to make a real go of the game on a higher level of competition. Honesty I never made it futher than silver as a solo Q SP main a couple of years ago, the toxicity of the community playing on the Garena servers makes it an ugly game to play sometimes.\r\n\r\nSo I am here, starting on Oceanic servers, leveling my summoner and getting some IP&#039;s. if there is anyone interested in some duo games at some point in the future when I have lvl 30 and some champions under my belt please let me know or friend me etc.  Drarcuul is my Summoner name.\r\n\r\nLikewise if any teams are looking to form and need a SP main, I am best with Taric, Morg, Lulu, Janna, Blitz, Ornn.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacca","date":"2017-09-27T12:06:14.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an ADC Main (Silver V) and i could duo with you and lvl with you.\nBtw, what rank were you when you played on other servers?\n\nI have lots of champs so i could duo with u :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lowrider","date":"2017-09-27T05:59:55.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://discord.gg/ZAzkp8w     heres my discord link, we have a few players (including myself) that are looking for Ranked Flex  partners. :)","replies":[]}]}
