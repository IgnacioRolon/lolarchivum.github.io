Side note: I've only played until S4 then quit due to how shit the game was becoming in terms of punishment (friends getting banned without talking the entire game due to us using comms. Seeing the same 5 or so flaming/feeders every game for weeks on end.). My account with well over $5k spent on it for skins was also hacked and honestly I was so over the game I just let it go. The only reason I touched this shit was because a friend of mine made this account and trained it out of bots. Also explains the name though I would understand a ban/forced name change for this as I wasn't spending IRL $$$ on a name change for a game I no longer care about.\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1 is the most recent game I played before being permed. My team consisted of a new Azir (mid) who was quite friendly but unfortunately fed. Me and him got along though. The other 3 were a Garen (top), Singed and teemo (bot) who refused to assist in getting objectives and focused purely on kills/ksing (which was fine due to Azir not really using them and me being a tank jungler). The 3 mentioned flamed Azir and I whenever something went wrong (they lost a 3v5 they initiated) and would spam ping and flame either Azir or I. The enemy team consisted of 2 people who were on my team the previous game who both liked me and agree'd with me when telling Singed to \"Shut the fuck up\" due to his constant /All flaming stating that they both liked and loved me from both games.\r\n\r\nTell me what about this is perm bannable? I've never had a mute btw, just a temp ban which i'm fairly sure I deserved (can't remember why exactly but pre sure me and my IRL mate were shit talking each other in game and yeah. understandable)\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nSp3rmFace: tytyty\r\nSp3rmFace: just call me sperm                          (teemo called me mr sperm face, so i made this as a joke)\r\nSp3rmFace: 200iq                              (singed and teemo made a good play) &lt;-- 200iq could come off as flame so i'm explaining this.\r\nSp3rmFace: lol\r\nSp3rmFace: gj\r\nSp3rmFace: yyh\r\nSp3rmFace: found him\r\nSp3rmFace: nah\r\nSp3rmFace: forgot to get q\r\nSp3rmFace: ffs\r\nSp3rmFace: fucking ekko                                         (ekko just survived by the skin of his teeth. this was said in team chat)\r\nSp3rmFace: was 2 for 2\r\nSp3rmFace: can't be too mad\r\nSp3rmFace: we needa hit up drag though \r\nSp3rmFace: while they recall                                            (telling bot we need to get drag while bot lane had recalled and jg was top. They refused)\r\nSp3rmFace: You make my ass cry.                      (got spam pinged by bot for not soloing drag at lvl 4 as noc)\r\nSp3rmFace: ..\r\nSp3rmFace: I'm very upset\r\nSp3rmFace: flash for slash all\r\nSp3rmFace: thats why you play ziggs\r\nSp3rmFace: and slap her regardless\r\nSp3rmFace: can we get drag..                                                  (once again asking for help on a free drag, still cant solo it as noc, they refused)\r\nSp3rmFace: yh\r\nSp3rmFace: no\r\nSp3rmFace: i canrt\r\nSp3rmFace: that's why i've asked for help for 3 minutes                          (bot lane flaming me for not soloing drag. \"i don't know, can you get drag?)\r\nSp3rmFace: gjgj\r\nSp3rmFace: i tried to save you\r\nSp3rmFace: yes daddy fizz?        \r\n(Fed akali who was fizz in my previous game. he was on enemy team but noticed how bot were not team players and started talking to me)\r\n\r\nSp3rmFace: akali claism to be diamond btw             (telling my azir that the akali (fizz) claiemd to be diamond therefor be careful)\r\nSp3rmFace: &lt;3\r\nSp3rmFace: bro it seems you have a trouble fighting mobile targets\r\nSp3rmFace: azir needs an update\r\nSp3rmFace: You're very immobile and you're very meh in terms of fighting mobile targets       (explaining that Azir isn't the best at fighting akali close range)\r\nSp3rmFace: but i mean\r\nSp3rmFace: he got scuttle\r\nSp3rmFace: gonna ff                     (ekko died causing us to get a triple but he smited scuttle mid fight. Was banter in team side only)\r\nSp3rmFace: ?\r\nSp3rmFace: you ever play her in urf?\r\nSp3rmFace: My anchor hit that wall\r\nSp3rmFace: no pull\r\nSp3rmFace: SO fucked off                         (to akali who knew I wasn't flaming)\r\nSp3rmFace: in this meta i  think he is\r\nSp3rmFace: but still good to learn\r\nSp3rmFace: he is very good at defending base though\r\nSp3rmFace: woops\r\nSp3rmFace: Bro e away\r\nSp3rmFace: ate his ult for you ??\r\nSp3rmFace: It's urf dude.. Just commit.\r\nSp3rmFace: They're playing like it's norms  (team refused to teamfight. Freezing lanes and last hitting cs.. again it's urf and we were being destroyed because of this)\r\nSp3rmFace: waste of time\r\nSp3rmFace: end\r\nSp3rmFace: When?\r\nSp3rmFace: It's urf it's not like he chose nunu because it's op  (team accused me of flaming people due to their champ picks. I explained that I wasn't phased by it)\r\nSp3rmFace: I'd say gg but this was so boring due to this team\r\nSp3rmFace: ?\r\nSp3rmFace: Look man. Wanna play like a fuckwit  (getting flamed for playing the game. top lane from earlier mad I won't 2v5 now)\r\nSp3rmFace: I'm gonna do my own thing\r\nSp3rmFace: Don't cry about it\r\nSp3rmFace: It's Urf and people are playing like it matters  (people were flaming due to kd/wl/cs/gold/items.. It's urf.)\r\nSp3rmFace: They'd be surprised how strong they are if they just played the Urf mode\r\nSp3rmFace: instead of trying to play normals in urf  (explaining that my team is scared of enemy team but are losing due to themselves)\r\nSp3rmFace: You don't want kills\r\nSp3rmFace: you'r 2-11  (lane flaming me said he didn't care about teamwork just kills...)\r\nSp3rmFace: XD\r\nSp3rmFace: I died 3 times and said \"Hey i can't beat mid\" (team flaming saying i fed my lane. I explained that I said I couldn't take him and moved. you can see the explanation above pointing out that I left due to not wanting to feed to hard as well as me explaining that he had 9 kills and i only had 3 deaths so i can't be blamed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery person Who flamed was reported by me and multiple others however I still came across them in multiple games (game 1-2 happened like 30 hours apart) They used insanely foul language in such ways that the automated system should have picked it up but clearly didn't. The Singed and teemo were in another game shortly after the one I got banned from and inting. GJ Riot.\r\n\r\nIn no way is anything I said worth a permanent ban. 1-7 day mute at most and that's pushing if context matters which it sadly doesn't. Fortunately this game could die tomorrow and I couldn't give one less of a fuck. I just wanted to point out how fucking worthless the system is at handling these things. You can have a trio of trolls mass report you and it ends in a ban for someone who doesn't deserve it however the trio will always go unpunished due to them being the majority. This is why I quit S4 and this is why I hope to fuck my friends quit too. This game is cancer. The community it has and creates is cancer. Riot can't handle it nor do they are about it. They dribble bullshit statistics meanwhile every game (legit every game I've played over the last 3 days) has people flaming anyone they can for absolutely zero reason with no punishment. I don't report or flame people for doing bad. I tell people who are intentionally fucking up the game that they need to fuck up and fuck off however due to the systems inability to ban people based on this behavior it will be here forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nFuck this cancer game I'm glad I got banned. Just mad that it happens in such a way that shows how pathetic the punishment system is.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2020-01-20T08:09:38.185+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won’t pretend to be an expert on player behavior, or know the intimate details of the system and how exactly it works.\n\nFrom what I see here, I don’t see anything that (in my opinion) warrants an instant permanent ban.  But I do see a pattern of negative attitude towards people that deviate from your own views. (Which becomes very clear in your explanations) \n\nWe can only see 2 games here, (and this is assuming you are showing us everything from those games).  But there could well be a much longer track record of negative behavior that we are unaware of.  (The system obviously isn’t going to provide you with everything you’ve ever said in your league career).  \n\nAgain I don’t claim to be an expert on the system, but this could well be the result of being the last straw in a long line of complaints, rather than a huge bombshell in one or two games.\n\nAlso you say that this account was given to you by a friend.  We don’t know what punishments were placed on the account before it came into your hands. \n\nYou’ve done a lot of explaining.  But the ‘why’ doesn’t really affect anything.  You’re playing with random people and you have no idea how those people will interpret what you’ve said.  If you’ve called someone a “fuckwit” one person might interpret that as a friendly jab, while another might take it to heart.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp3rmFace","date":"2020-01-20T17:55:39.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I should mention that I generally get 2+ honors per game I play.. Even the enemy team likes me and generally I encourage people. You can't see Azirs chat but he was new and asking for advice on taking on Akali which is why there was chat of me saying \"yeah mobile isn't good for you\" in terms of her jumps. I just don't tolerate people who flame for no reason. If there is a reason I generally try resolve the situation rather than telling them to fuck up. I got the account zero punishments fresh out of bots. I'm actually surprised I didn't get done for the name in all honesty.\n\nThe explaining isn't there to explain why I'm not at fault. it's pretty much there to say \"these guys flamed, this was my response. they're not banned and still flaming\". 2 of them even inted the game right after the one I was banned for.. I mean really? I get honors every game meaning unless someone on the enemy team reports me for no reason I legitimately got banned because of trolls.\n\nAlso bans shouldn't be dealt due to the person and/or computers interpretation of a work/sentence. It's pathetic and anyone supporting it is just as pathetic. Go look at all the condescending flame bait in the forums who will flat out flame you in a comment and a mod will side with them because \"hur dhur didn't swear\".

Pretty obvious why this is the case, some people just aren't good at the game and die. I would say in almost every second game i get on a smurf in low elo, someone tells everyone in all chat to report someone for inting when in reality they are just playing either non meta champs and dying or dying repetitively because they don't know how to play. As for flaming, the new system isn't great at picking up flaming without specific keywords, but, those players you mentioned might just have reached their chat restrictions or equivalent which is why they can keep playing. Similiar principle with players leaving, systems automated and will auto detect leavers, its repeat offenses that get banned though, you have to warnings and restrictions as the first line of response because in reality, people leave games for  serious reasons and the system won't detect that. The system is flawed true, but look at it from their point of view, your account has a crap history has already received bans, you come out with a negative attitude, true maybe the other players are the real offenders, but, you responded and you really didnt have to respond like that. 14 day ban player is swearing and calling people fuckwits, seems like a reasonably decision to say hey, we don't need you in our muilti million dollar game.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-21T05:00:07.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">banned unless they literally run in straight directions down lane and die over and over.\n\nEven still, it's not a bannable offence quoting Riot. \nSource; Tickets submitted last year. \n\n> As for flaming, the new system isn't great at picking up flaming without specific keywords, but, those players you mentioned might just have reached their chat restrictions or equivalent which is why they can keep playing.\n\nThis is a yes and no scenerio here. \nChat restrictions usually occur with a GGEZ, or goes straight to a ban\n~Source; multiple friends accounts.\n\n>systems automated and will auto detect leavers, its repeat offenses that get banned though\n\nThis systems broken though.

New accounts get a lot less leeway than older accounts. Consider it as a factor of the percentage of games. 1 bad game on an account with 10 games is 10%. 1 bad game on an account with 1000 games is 0.1%. While clean history doesn't give you a free pass to do whatever, it can make a difference when it comes to borderline behaviour.\n\nSecond, you have previously had a 14-day ban. Typically, punishments follow 4 tiers: 2 chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game), 14-day ban, then a permanent ban. There are some behaviours (e.g. hate speech, suicide encouragement, etc) that can skip those chat restriction tiers which it seems you ran afoul of with your last punishment. \n\nRegardless of how you got there, you had passed that 3rd tier with permanent suspension being the punishment for any further offences. This should not have been a surprise either, as the 14-day reform card explicitly states that any further violations can result in permanent suspension of the account.\n\n___\n\nTL;DR - This wasn't a permanent ban because of the severity of this particular instance, but because of negative history and ignored warnings. The level of the account is also a contributing factor.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp3rmFace","date":"2020-01-20T18:06:40.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mustn't have been me who got the 14 day ban however This chat log still doesn't warrant a permanent ban regardless of the 14 day.\n\nAlso I've had other \"Emissary\" mods/support staff tell me an accounts age doesn't mean anything in terms of bans. Fast as fuck way to put players off the game if it is though.\n\nImagine this: New to league. finally get out of bots (people do this in bots as well though). Get into game. Forced into support. only free champs. you say \"I'm new guys\" and get instantly flamed out (it happens frequently). you get into game. you die/give first blood/ don't follow your adc/jg into an unwinnable fight. \"Fuck you you stupid %%%% why the fuck?\" followed by frequent \"?\" or MIA pings.\n\nThis is League in Oceanic. and the fact that the logic behind it is \"experienced\" players with older accounts can flame new people out is pathetic.\n\nI can say with 100% certainty that SInce s3/s4 this game had much, much more lenient punishments than now yet somehow the game has gotten so fucking toxic that it's almost unbearable to play even with friends.

You are not exempt from any rules, nor are you given free rein to tell people all sorts of nasty things. If the system is on the edge of punishing you, that history *might* be just enough to push it back for that one instance.\n\nIf you have a strong and/or long negative history, you are on thinner ice, and that history can be enough to push it the other way.\n\nYou don't get punished for being abused, nor do you get punished for defending yourself.
