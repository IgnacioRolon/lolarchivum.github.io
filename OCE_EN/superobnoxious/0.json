There a couple of features i would like added. Maybe sort out the list alphabetically display the number of people blocked or notify us if we have maxed out our block list. The entire system i understand rarely gets much attention in patches but i believe that it needs an update to at least sort out the outdated display format.\r\n\r\nAs for emotes i dislike them, i was against the idea of them but they are here so there is not much i can do about them but mute them in game. \r\nI would like for the option to permanently mute them in the settings on client menu or /mute emotes for both teams in game its tedious at the start and can delay getting to lane or position in jungle.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s all thanks.","replies":[]}
