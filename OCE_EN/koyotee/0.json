Maybe we missed the mark on something, or maybe we introduced some pain points?  Or maybe there are some ideas out there that could really elevate the site! Or something is just plain broke.\n\nAnything you share will be gold, and greatly appreciated (even if the feedback hurts).\n\nStay awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Nancy Vandal","date":"2016-06-08T09:04:25.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Great but yea buddy no spoilers i watch VODS while at work... shhh probs shouldnt but its not a busy place anyway... never see them live, if you remove the spoilers it would be fine so long as its no spoilers with the option for spoilers (cant imagine anyone wanting to watch a match they know who wins)  also keep the three matchs cause everyone hopes the under dogs manages to get a third  match in...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thirtz","date":"2016-06-05T00:29:39.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so basically 2 things need to be changed.\n\n1. The scoreboard needs to be hidden so you don't give away spoilers.\n\n2. When you click the \"Watch\" button it shows you all 3 games (if it went to that) so you already know the results of the first two games before you have even watched them. This needs to be hidden as well.\n\nSolutions:\n\n1. [Hide](http://imgur.com/DIvLagx) the score behind a \"click to reveal\" type thing. \n\n2. Have 3 squares for the vods, even if the match was only 2 games. BUT [make the 3rd box hidden](http://imgur.com/TmafgJf) behind a \"click to reveal\" regardless of if there were 3 games or not. That way you need to physically click on it to see if there is a vod there to watch or not. \n\nI have attached a couple of visual references to show exactly what I mean. Forgive the shoddy quality. It was just a quick thing in paint to highlight the issues myself and others might be having.\n\nEDIT: Also, replicate something like this for the front page, too. You can't even go to the website without seeing the scores, immediately giving away the match results.","replies":[{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2016-06-05T04:39:48.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thirtz, thanks for the feedback AND solutions!  I'll present your solutions to the team for open discussion.\n\nPrometheusHD had written a post with similar concerns, so I've tried to get something in before the games on Monday.\n\nIf you go to http://oce.lolesports.com/?mode=no-spoilers, the scores should be hidden for the duration of your visit.\n\nWhen you want the scores back, refresh your browser or hit 'http://oce.lolesports.com' again.\n\nThis will be a super unofficial feature (and a bit rough) for now. I'll need to discuss with the rest of the team how this fits into our product roadmap, and what our long-term approach would be for this.\n\nIf you come across other pain points, or have more great ideas to share, lemme know!","replies":[{"poster":"Thirtz","date":"2016-06-06T21:36:46.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really happy to help!
