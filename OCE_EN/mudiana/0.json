While it isn't typically punished, account sharing/gifting/transferring in any way is against the terms of service, and selling aside a large part of this comes down to account security. The fact that you mention multiple other people having access to the account is also going to dig that hole even deeper.\n\nPlayer Support will more often than not need to verify original ownership of the account before they can restore access, and given you aren't the original owner, and are apparently one of many people with access to the account in some form, it is entirely possible they will not be able to help you.\n\nWith that disclaimer out of the way, support is still your best option. It's possible they may be able to help you simply reset the email, or failing that they may be able to restore the account to the friend who gave you the account, who can then give it back to you, but it will require him to remember details from it's creation.\n\nGiving an account to a friend happens, but multiple people having access to an account gets real sketchy real fast, especially when you are missing key info. Don't get your hopes up too high.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Mudiana","date":"2018-08-10T03:50:25.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only other people that know are my cousin and the original owner and i can get verification from him and yeah i completely understand where you are coming from people make stupid mistakes when they are young haha he cannot remember the email but i will send in a ticket thanks for the help ive spend upwards of 400 on this account ruff","replies":[]}]}]}
