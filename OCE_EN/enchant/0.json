Yeah he might not take as many risks and try for a crazy outplay but he's consistently in a position to do a lot of damage in teamfights. The IEM games were a pretty good example of that, with the only times he got carried away was when he went to 1v1 duel Sneaky (which was amazing to watch).\n\nI'm probably going to tunnel Rekkles when watching Alliance games now, this has got me curious!","replies":[{"poster":"Enchant","date":"2014-12-18T05:59:57.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with him doing a lot of damage in team fights for example if he plays a champ like Lucian or Corki\n\nYou will rarely see him auto attack he'll mostly just stay back far away and spam R or Q/W then go in once everyone is dead clean up and everyone calls him a god like wtf?\n\nAlliance rely wayy to much on whether or not shook/froggen perform and the reaosn why I say shook and froggen is because mid/jungle is very important and shook is their play maker imo froggen will only play make if fed. I remember him saying in an interview why roam bot and camp a brush like Xpeke for 5min when he can farm like 10 minion waves.\n\nYou could also say that the reason why rekkles did so well on fnatic is because he had two of the best solo laners in EU Lcs on his team along with 1 of the top 3 best EU supports.\n\nHe's nothing special imo he just plays safe and gets carried by his team.\n\nHence why you'll always see him have good scores in losing games because he won't take risks or try to make plays","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zeju","date":"2014-12-10T13:55:05.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that argument is interesting. You only need a 10% risk factor to get jumped on by a good team, and he had all the gold. It was necessary to play safely like that and through his mechanics he did win them a lot of their teamfights. He played those games very well, however Alliance didn't lose because of Rekkles by the same merit they wouldn't have won because of him either, he wasn't 'carrying.' Quite simply put, Alliance strategically haven't sorted themselves out, and while they're stronger than C9 in terms of skill ceiling it's apparent that the gap in skill ceiling is not large enough to overcome the incredible tactics of C9. \n\nI think Kys is correct - Reddit is full of %%%%. They tend to overhype virtually anyone and undervalue the people around them, but I don't think Rekkles is overrated, it's just unrealistic to expect him to carry like that in a competitive environment in team he only joined a couple of weeks prior vs. C9. And of course there are imbeciles that say 'Alliance 2 heavy' but c'mon, why would you pay them any attention in the first place? But then, that's just what I feel.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-10T08:12:13.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, so angsty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-10T06:55:44.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys are better than him for sure.","replies":[]}]}
