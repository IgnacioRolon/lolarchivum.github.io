I'm heading offline now, but expect to see more of me around here :) **_\n\nHey everyone!\n\nI&#039;m Kieran &#039;WeirdyBeardy&#039; Weir - half man, half beard, half adc (maths was never my strong point). I&#039;ve just relocated to Riot OCE from Riot EU, working in our creative and esports teams to deliver local content and experiences that (hopefully!) you guys will enjoy, such as [League of Origin](http://oce.lolesports.com/articles/introducing-league-legends-league-origin-76914)!\n\nShameless plugs aside - before Riot I worked at Xbox, NCsoft and Eurogamer, working across writing, design, tech and video. I&#039;ve been playing games for over 30 years, so I find it _very_ hard to shortlist my favourites, but here&#039;s a try... Halo (all), (any) Mario, The Last of Us, Portal, Half-Life, Doom and Shadow of the Colossus. And ICO. And FIFA. And Rocket League. And League. See?\n\nI have a pretty extensive collection of retro games and machines spanning the 80s and 00s (left back in the UK, *sob*). Outside of games, I am a trained coffee barista, love (but suck at) photography, my favourite film is Jim Henson&#039;s Labyrinth (don&#039;t judge me) and band is Queen&#039;s of the Stone Age.\n\nSomething that no-one here knows is that I was once on a UK videogames TV show where I bailed out in the Grand Finals by getting a question about Tekken&#039;s Paul Phoenix wrong. Live on TV. The shame of it. Still haunts me.\n\nOK, enough about me... go ahead, ask me anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-04-07T07:56:22.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya Weirdy\n\nI'm curious, because I'm unsure if I've seen you in the local scene, what experience and past roles bought you to Riot OCE?\n\nalso, on a scale of 1-10, how weird is your beard?","replies":[{"poster":"WeirdyBeardy","date":"2017-04-07T08:21:12.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jason!\n\nI arrived in Australia from the UK in January - I've been in Riot for almost four years now, the majority of that spent working in Europe where I ran our local creative team.

If I think about the OPL in the same way I think about a startup (it is still relatively new by comparison), I'm excited about what's ahead of us - successful startups are defined by their strength of vision, the velocity of getting things done and the will of those involved to win. I've only been in Riot OCE a short time, but I know already that I'm surrounded by likeminded people who share those traits and ambitions.\n\nLooking at the OPL, I believe the way we create that edge is by dialling up our support and promotion of the players and teams in the league - that's our point of differentiation, that's what is truly unique to OPL. I'm keen to start working with players to start telling those stories, and building those profiles, in the hope that the fans and support will rally behind them even more. More support = More wins (scientifically proven).\n\nOn top of that, and from what I've seen so far, OCE fans are super passionate (I think sport is a bit of a thing here?), so combined with the above, I think we have an incredible future in front of us.\n\nBtw, Sin vs Avant Garde on [right now](http://watch.oce.lolesports.com)... who's your money on? :)","replies":[{"poster":"eshanes","date":"2017-04-07T07:50:58.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought to myself last week; whoever loses the Week 10 match will win the first gauntlet game so I'll stick with Sin.

In terms of turning your hobby into a career, my recommendation would be to build up your portfolio as much as you can and send it out to any companies or people that you want to work with, if you can tailor either what you're doing to be relevant/resonant with that company or person, all the better, or try to target those who would be receptive to what you want to produce.\n\nI'm knew to the region, but try posting things up to video sites for professionals (e.g. portfolio sites or work for hire sites) that invite peers to comment and feedback on your work. Being an active voice in the community is a great way to get visibility.\n\nOn a side note, we should meet up, maybe there's something we could work on together in the future :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-07T05:43:23.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings WeirdyBeardy,\n\nFirstly, love the name, as a person who has a beard myself I highly approve.

We support the effort and ensure the team has what it needs to deliver on it, and then take all the credit for the win (jk).\n\nHonestly, we value both. We look for 'T' shaped Rioters, those who a breadth of skills/abilities and depth in their craft expertise - the OCE team is relatively small, so having people here that can tackle a wide variety of tasks is really important, but at the same time, you know that those same people can deliver the very best in their craft.\n\nMy first computer was a ZX Spectrum (128K!), and the very first cassette I loaded in was a text adventure for The Never Ending Story. It took an hour to load, but I can still remember it so clearly, I mapped the whole thing out on paper and died in the Swamp of Sadness so many times - it took me months and months to crack it.\n\nHaha, my beard is probably the least weird thing about me (my so-called friends tell me) - it was inspired by my surname and the fact I have a pretty big beard - [this guy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/ramen-beard_n_3982332) wins the weird beard thing, hands down :)","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-04-07T06:50:36.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response mate!\n\nAlways cool to learn more about the inner workings of how the roles in Riot are set up and thank you going for the detail on what sort of Rioters are looked for in creative fields.

(Have been for 2 years, designing for over 5 years) \n\nApart from that I gotta admit I am really loving doing all this stuff for the community as a volunteer, running events and discussions and interacting with them. So as crazy as it sounds, if there would be some sort of middle ground where I could do both it would be amazing, but I would mainly lean towards design if I had to pick. Also a big fan of eSports as well, I like a lot of areas of work, also having worked in IT in the past xD\n\nIf you have any advice it would highly appreciated, but I know the main thing to do is to focus on mastering on my craft and always looking for ways to improve, which is what I am doing at the moment while doing stuff for the community as a volunteer.\n\nThank you again mate! \n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"WeirdyBeardy","date":"2017-04-07T09:37:55.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you're doing great!

The casters are a great gauge of which beats in the game are pivotal to the end result, a teamfight, Baron steal or just straight up 1v1 that ends badly - these are the areas to go deeper on in the wider context of the match. If you can add flavour by including a deep-link into a VOD, even better, say it then show it. We're producing video weekly OPL recaps now, wondering if you'd seen any of those?\n\nMain champ is Cait, great balance of range, poke and escape!\n\nMm.
