What pisses me off the most about this skill its not deemed to be a move so if you \"Root\" her she can still hop. And if you manage to stun her mid hop. the timer starts at the time she is stunned not the time she lands meaning a 1 second stun is now a .5 stun... with her knock up and stun when she lands it is absolutely impossible to get away from her even if you play an ez or ahri unless you use her ult\n\nKI Burst (W) - Stuns all nearby enemies and damages them. again after doing this she gets a free hit with her passive causing bullshit amounts of damage.\n\nValor (E) - Her shield - she is an AD champ with a shield that stacks with AD... on a 1000 ad riven... and yes i have seen it - her shield is 1210 hp. and with no cd its up every 6 seconds. Minus the time that her shield is on and thats a shield of 1210 hp every 4.5 secs. it doesnt matter if she doesnt build tank items as this will make her impossible to kill anyway. then throw in a Bloodthirster or some other lifesteal item and then she has a perminate sheild all game.\n\nand finally her ult - Blade of Exile - when activated she gets a bonus 20% attack damage, her attack range is increased by 75, her w has a greater range of effect and the annoying bouncing thing now does AOE damage and therefore has a group knock up. then when you finally get away from her using ahris ult flash and any other forms of escape you have... she just hits R again and everything infront of the gets slammed with close to 2000 damage... and no teemo cant blind this ult.\n\nNow some of you Riven fans out there will start screaming that swain has a bullshit amount of life steal or darius has a true damage ult same as cho gath... but this is the final thing that really pisses me off with riven and why she needs to be removed from the game... she is manaless/rageless/furyless/energyless. besides her health bar there is no cost to using any of these skills. they are on constant spam at no cost... no mana no loss of life nothing... not even fiora gets away with that.\n\nand in typical riot fashion.... they Nerf Irelia....\n\nPlease super nerf Riven by giving her a mana bar or a fury bar... anything to make her less op","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fear In Cube","date":"2016-04-12T07:25:51.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the skin but I really hate riven since she's not my type of champion. But if I'm not correct, they did add the skin to the hexcrafting. I'm not 100% sure about this but there might be a way to get your skin you really want","replies":[]}]}
