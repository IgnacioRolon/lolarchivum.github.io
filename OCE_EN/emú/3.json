However, because of the number of signups lacking, it&#039;s up to me to try to promote this event to reach our minimum number of teams before it starts. So if you have a 5&#039;s team that wants to enter, win some cash and maybe even a Triumphant Ryze skin each for your whole team, then get on board!\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n**Event type** Summoners Rift 5v5, Single Elimination\r\n**Cost** $20 per team\r\n**Date** September 5th 2015\r\n**Time** 1pm\r\n**More info** [Right here!](http://campmylane.com/events/september-5v5/)\r\n\r\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR SHOUTCASTERS FOR THIS EVENT. If you&#039;re looking to get into shoutcasting then please hit me up with an [email](http://mailto:admin@campmylane.com).\r\n\r\n(If any rioters are reading this, my event is named incorrectly on the community events calendar. I tried contacting Maraudaur about this but nothing happened :( )","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2015-08-28T05:10:44.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where is this tornament?","replies":[]}]}
