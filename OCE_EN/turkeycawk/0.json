However, a rising issue that has developed over the later seasons of League of Legends, along with the out of control toxicity of many summoners, has undoubtedly seen the beginning of much frustration. Yes, i am talking about the &quot;surrender&quot; option. \r\n\r\n**Draft and Blind Que**\r\nWhen a certain team works well together in displaying signs of strength through good communicative skills, cohesion and alignment this can become a very frustrating time for the opposition. For example, lets say that we have a team player {{champion:58}} versing a {{champion:85}} in the top lane and {{champion:58}} is finding it quite difficult to lane and cs (because {{champion:85}} is an electrical version of teemo). Anyhoo, {{champion:58}} signals for his Jungler, who just happens to be {{champion:11}}, to camp top. During this phase of the game {{champion:85}} is quite unaware that {{champion:11}} is camping top and therefore {{champion:85}} decides to keep on bullying {{champion:58}} out of lane. From this point {{champion:85}} believes he is on top of the world because he has pushed {{champion:58}} out of the lane and forced him to recall. However, {{champion:58}} has moved off the map and allowed {{champion:11}} to flank and create a kill against {{champion:85}}. As the game progresses {{champion:11}} remains to loiter around top lane to assist the struggling {{champion:58}} and after 20 mins the duo ({{champion:11}} and {{champion:58}}) have piled a total of 5 kills between them and 5 deaths for {{champion:85}}. After an exchange of toxic words through the team chat portal, {{champion:85}} s team decides to forfeit as they have snowballed too much. \r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE MOST ANNOYING THIS IN THE WORLD OMG {{champion:17}} \r\n\r\nNo seriously this may be my OCD talking but, a game where you have completed out-witted your opponent and caused them to have no other option other than to surrender is the worst thing in League of Legends at the moment. Summoners who cannot deal with the laning phase and being out-played need to learn how to counteract this!!!! (build armour, ask their jg to hang around top lane etc.). However, when things get tough for the opposing team all they want to do is surrender at because they don&#039;t have the initiative to fight back and create good game plays to hopefully establish a come back. \r\n\r\nI personally believe that by removing the surrender option this would enhance the gameplay for many summoners as they would have to establish a way to counteract the strong opposing laner, create a more clam atmosphere and give teams a value to fight for when on the rift. \r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-06T03:22:33.857+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"its like removing life rafts/boats from a sinking ship..... stay on board and eventually the ship will sink despite your best efforts or get off as quickly as you can.\n\nno","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-06T02:45:53.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-11-06T13:43:00.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To reiterate your point:\n\nNo. Nope.

Especially as you go into ranked with the mindset of \"I will do my absolute best this game\".\n\nBut I think the surrender option should stay in normals, because normals is pretty much exclusively for having fun. And its really not fun when you're stuck for 50 mins against a juggernaut team with ridiculous damage that you cant do anything against but isn't good enough to just push and win. It just feels like youre running into a wall for 50 mins.\n\nIm not a fan of surrendering, and I **never** surrender because I got outplayed or just because I don't think we can win _(I've won games where out nexus is literally on 1 hp, so it's always possible)_. and there are always lessons to be learnt from losing too.\n\nI only surrender if I'm just really really not having fun for whatever reason _(I mean, isn't the whole point of playing a game to have fun? why keep doing something your not enjoying, for no other reason than to finish it? thats just a waste of life)_","replies":[{"poster":"Rito POS Client","date":"2017-11-06T06:08:37.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FF still needs a 4-1 vote. It does feel good to shove the ff vote back in their face when you win but if 4 people want to give up then not much you can do about it. The surrender system is there so that if you feel a game is over you can move on. The worst thing is being stuck with a sheitshow for 20 mins while the enemy team drag out the win. Yea 1 out of 10 times the enemy will throw but most times your team mates are virtually squaring up out the front of Coles.\n\nI tend to actually find the opposite situation happens more for me. It's clear that we are going to lose as the 0-6 bot lane has fed and they are being childish blaming the jungle for not ganking or the mid for letting their lane opponent roam (The good ol 1001 excuses book for it's not my mechanics) and they try to FF but the others reject it out of spite. Maybe it's an Australian thing but if you are a kunt you are going to get it back just as hard","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2017-11-06T16:27:35.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it should be removed. If it's a complete stomp, and the winning team is just fucking around for the sake of it, I'd prefer not to sit around, feed more, and wait for them to finally end the game. It's just a waste of time, and it removes the fun from the game.

Silver and Gold is an unstable elo, where anything is possible, all turn arounds and throws are possible, but people are still so quick to give up.","replies":[]}]}
