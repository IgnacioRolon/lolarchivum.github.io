Nevertheless, I ask you this: have you ever been bullied out of a lane by a 450ip or 1350ip champion? Has this champions stun ever lasted more than what feels like a year? and have you, my fellow summoners, ever raged so hard in one game then in the next game you just turn around and play these types of champions just to make people feel bad? Ya bunch of hypocrites! Only joking calm down {{champion:17}} Jokes, fook dis guy! \n\nAnyhoo, of course i am talking about {{champion:1}} and {{champion:22}}  and any other champion that takes no damn skill to master yet is so much more overpowered than an {{champion:268}} main. Not too recently within patch 7.21 Azir&#039;s abilities were decreased by roughly 5%. Now as an Azir main i was quite unable to comprehend Riot&#039;s thought behind this decision? With the possible exception of {{champion:64}}, {{champion:268}} is perhaps that hardest champion to master with all of his extreme handling, angles and precision. In saying this, when mastered he can be so very very annoying to lane against if he gets an early kill and snowballs, however, that is beside the point. Ask yourself, what is it that makes these 450Ip and 1350Ip champions so hard to deal with? \n\nNot too long ago i was in a game where i was playing {{champion:268}} in the middle lane and funnily enough i was versing {{champion:1}}. Now, prior to level 6 {{champion:268}} and {{champion:1}} s trades are fairly even taking into consideration your starting health, mana and power/ability distribution. Speaking solely about {{champion:1}} it only takes her one item to ruin your game and that is {{item:3165}}. {{champion:1}} can just stun you, set you alit and then ult your ass ergo effectively snowballing the entire match from this point onwards. \n\nSpecifically speaking, this is not the only matchup of champions where this is a detrimental deficit Riot. So many more uneven variables come into play when discussing this issue but the point i am trying to portray for the community is - even when 6300ip and 4800ip champions are mastered to the closest pinnacle you could, why are 450ip and 1350ip champions so much more unbalanced and powerful than these champions that desire so much more attention and time to master? For example, why is {{champion:17}} so much stronger than {{champion:64}}? and why does {{champion:75}} s Q destroy {{champion:39}}? \n\nIn a nutshell, Riot, nerf the champions that need nerfing like {{champion:1}}, {{champion:75}}, {{champion:17}} and {{champion:11}} etc. not the champions that already struggle on the rift.

The only real threat she poses to him in lane is the flash-ult, but she can only use that once every 300 seconds.\n\nTeemo is not stronger than Lee Sin either.\nTeemo isn't good for much, he's really really really good at harassing in lane, dueling ADC's, being a bit of a nucience, and setting up ambushes, but not an awful lot else. Meanwhile Lee Sin is both a tank AND an assassin _(a stupid combo on its own)_, with no mana, high damage, low cooldowns and multiple engages/escapes as well as a solid mixture of hard and soft CC, not to mention a shield. There is virtually no situation where he doesn't excel.\nin my opinion Lee Sin is probably the most overloaded and overpowered champion in the game.\n\nBut I don't quite see the relevance of their price in this discussion?\nThe price is not an indicator of a champion's potential,  power, or skill required. The price is usually an indicator of how long ago they were released.\nOlder champions periodically move down in price as new ones come out. \nAre you saying we should nerf champions just because their price was reduced?\n\nEvelynn is a much harder champ than Blitz, but Eve is much cheaper.\nKatarina takes much more skill than Talon, and has a much bigger impact on the game, despite being a 3rd of the price. \n\nThe absolute lowest price champions (450 IP) are priced low because they are considered the easiest for beginners to pick up, so that new players can have access to appropriate champions relatively quickly. _(You wouldn't want a new player to buy Aurelion Sol as their first champ, because there would be no quicker way of putting them off the game! Its much better to give them options like Annie or Nunu as a starting champ, so they can get used to the game without having to think too much)_\n\n\n___________\n\nI do agree though that some beginner champs either need more counterplay at higher levels, or just a flat reduction in their current strength.\nGaren is basically unkillable, yet can kill you instantly from half HP with a single move that he doesn't even need to aim. Annie has 1 ability that actually requires any effort at all, and yet she does more damage than most skillshot mages. Master Yi pretty much 1 hits you if he gets close, but he cant be kited. The supposed counter to Nasus is harass, yet his passive just heals back any damage you do to him.\n\nSo I think these champs should get some kind of nerf, but it shouldn't be relative to their price.\n\n____________\n\nOne of the issues here is the misconception that the harder a champion is to play, they better they are.\nAurelion Sol is very hard to play, he doesn't require great mechanics thats true, but his positioning requires absolute perfection otherwise he is pretty much just decorative. However Aurelion Sol's impact on the game isn't as strong as Zac or Vayne, who are both champs that don't require as much effort to play.\n\nChampions are just options, each one poses a different way to approach the game, an people just pick which way appeals to them, by definition of being 'different' some options are easier than others. But _(in theory)_ no option should be too much better than another.\nOtherwise you'd end up with a whole lot of easy to play but useless champions that no one plays.\n\nSo champions that require skill, don't necessarily have any more or less impact on the game when mastered, they are just a different and probably more interesting/fun way of playing.","replies":[{"poster":"TurkeyCawk","date":"2017-11-06T07:04:42.741+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am studying to become an English teacher at University and i must say, despite you ruining my argument ;), you have bloody great writing skills!","replies":[{"poster":"TurkeyCawk","date":"2017-11-06T07:09:08.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, my main focus of the argument is why are riot nerfing Azir when there are so many more champions like Annie that deal so much more damage and stun time that its stupid?

So if they did nerf Annie, she would be pretty much unplayable in high elo. Meanwhile Azir is _(or was at least) _pretty much unplayable in low elo anyway due to his skill requirements, so they prioritise his nerfs/buffs around high elo with little regard to low elo, because few low elo players would use him anyway.\n\nSo these changes balance things out at high elo, but down here the strong stay strong and the weak get weaker unfortunately.\n\nHowever in saying that, as a fellow Azir main you've probably experienced him 3-shot Adcs and other squishes in late game, which is just as frustrating to them as Annie is to us _(except he can do it from twice the range)_. So I can understand the Azir nerfs, however I agree there are champions that should come before him on the nerf scale, Lee and Yas to name a few.\n\nAnd yes I 100% agree that either: Annie's damage is too brutal for the amount of time you spend stunned. OR Her stun time is too brutal for the amount of damage she does. One of the two should be changed to reflect a bit of counterplay.\n\nAs QAPLA points out, Veigar also falls into this category.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-06T07:11:32.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=i3KUb8XM,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-11-06T06:51:52.749+0000)\n>\n> I am a firm believer that no champion&#x27;s hard CC should last enough time for them to solo 100-0 you before it wears off. _(at any stage in the game)_\n\n{{champion:45}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-06T09:34:39.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2017-11-06T07:57:06.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and {{champion:33}}  got nerfed too :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-06T05:21:50.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Nerf this!\" XD\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dZigb","replies":[]},{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-11-06T05:07:34.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think we all know singed is the hardest champion to master ;)","replies":[]}]}
