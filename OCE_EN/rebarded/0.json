This song, like all their songs, was different from all before it, as each one worked to describe the _exact_ nature of the problem that needed solving. Bard had heard songs of war, songs of sickness, and songs of sorrow - all these were songs that the chimes knew well, and they sang them to only one being.\r\n\r\nThis time, the chimes rang of fear and darkness. There were nauseating, quivering lows and sharp, screeching highs, all of it discordant and without any sort of rhythm.  The chimes&#039; eternal lullaby had died in the wake of this new song&#039;s furore, and they would be speaking to Bard in this new, vicious voice until the danger had passed. Bard was a creature of only joy and duty - if fear was a thing he could possibly feel, perhaps he would be feeling it now.\r\n\r\nA wish was all that was needed to leave the space between worlds and journey to the source of the song.\r\n\r\nWhat greeted Bard upon his exit was a dank, damp basement, brown with dirt and green with mould. A not-unfamiliar shriek of surprise greeted him from a huddled form in the corner, barely distinguishable from, or audible over, the constant song. The form itself contained a man and a woman, both dressed in tatters. Bard put up his hands in a show of innocence, and offered a peaceful tune.\r\n\r\n&quot;_By Gangplank&#039;s galleon_!&quot; said the woman as she rose to her feet. &quot;First the monster, now this. _Get out_!&quot;\r\n\r\nBard didn&#039;t. Instead, he took a moment to survey his surroundings. The entire place was wooden and wet. Cold, too. And everything was _moving_. The entire place seemed to sway this way and that, slow enough perhaps to go completely unnoticed by some. There were vibrations moving through the planks, too. But what was the source? Bard concentrated for a moment, searching for the sounds of the world through the chimes&#039; harsh song. Ah! It was the sound of footfalls on the boardwalks above. The caretaker nodded to himself - perhaps the damp and the mould should have been enough for him to know he was in Bilgewater.\r\n\r\nBard&#039;s duties took him many places, many of them bright and wonderful and a little more on the warm side. He would always do his work, but between a palace in Shurima and a Bilgewater basement, Bard knew to where he&#039;d rather be summoned. _Lives are lives, caretaker_, sang the chimes. Even through the demonic orchestra, the chimes would still offer their wisdom.\r\n\r\n&quot;L-look here,&quot; it was the man now. Half the size of the woman and a third the size of Bard himself. &quot;I don&#039;t know what it is you&#039;re wantin&#039; comin&#039; &#039;ere, b-but we&#039;ve been through enough tonight.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe man received a slap on the back of the head from the woman. She was about to start shouting again, but Bard quickly cut her off with some frantic arm-waving. And when it was clear she wasn&#039;t going to speak, he pointed to the place from which the song was playing: the splintered pit in the floor of the basement, and the sloshing black water below.\r\n\r\n&quot;He took him. Came through the floor and took him!&quot; Started the woman. &quot;Our son&#039;s a bloody fool, thinking he can go about making deals with people he doesn&#039;t know. &#039;_He&#039;s going to help me with the fishing, keep us fed for the winter_,&#039; he says. Comes back two days in a row with triple any haul he&#039;s ever made, and not _two minutes ago_ the floor opens up and he&#039;s _gone_! _Snatched_!&quot; She sank into herself. &quot;Our _son_.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe man finished: &quot;There was just a voice. It said, &#039;_He succumbed to his hunger...._&#039;&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;&#039;_...just as I..._&#039;&quot; continued the woman.\r\n\r\nThen, together, &quot;&#039;_...will succumb to mine._&#039;&quot;\r\n\r\nThe universe worked in strange ways, it seemed to Bard. Not a few moments ago, he had been taking a nap between tending the celestial gardens above Runeterra, and now he was standing in a cold, rotting basement. There was no choice in it, only duty. After all, only he could hear the chimes, and so only he could soothe the song of the universe. He did always wonder, however, what kind of being he would be if that duty had never been placed before him.\r\n\r\n_Go. Find the boy._\r\n\r\nBard took one last look at the cowering couple, the two whose lives were moved this way and that by the flow of the universal song - really, they were no different than he was. He nodded his head in an offer of understanding, and dived into the black depths - the place from which the music swelled, screeching, deafening.\r\n\r\nDown here, there was nothing but the song - the lazy sloshing of the black water was nothing before its cacophony. Bard floated just above this rolling mass, the glow of his mask illuminating the area only a few metres before him. Silently, he weaved through the rotting stilts that held up both the Bilgewater hovels and the boardwalks that stitched them together - how long before it all collapsed? Perhaps the vibrations from the song would finally bring the place crashing down into the murky depths. Bard quickly stifled the thought, and carried on.\r\n\r\nIt wasn&#039;t much further until Bard caught up with the mysterious creature, manifesting as a silhouetted, heaving, breathing mass. It was perched on an artificial island of broken planks, torn clothing, and bones. Bard knew it could see him.\r\n\r\n&quot;What&#039;s this now, that&#039;s come to interrupt my dinner?&quot; Asked the monster. He sniffed the air. &quot;You don&#039;t smell like anything I&#039;ve ever smelt before. Don&#039;t look like anything I&#039;ve seen either.&quot;\r\n\r\nBard just shrugged - after all, this wasn&#039;t his first encounter with a monster. _Don&#039;t underestimate this one_, sang the chimes.\r\n\r\n&quot;Now, that makes me curious...&quot;\r\n\r\n_Watch out, caretaker._\r\n\r\n&quot;...extremely curious...&quot;\r\n\r\n_This one is a demon._\r\n\r\n&quot;...how you taste.&quot;\r\n\r\nA tongue lashed, snake-like, through the darkness, striking Bard square in the chest. He tumbled backwards through the air, beard flicking the surface of the putrid water - but he didn&#039;t let himself fall. No tongue, no matter how demonic, could force Bard to succumb to a force as basic as gravity, especially given the sloshing muck below him.\r\n\r\nThe thing&#039;s rough and slimy tongue retracted with a wet snap, and then a long grin made up of sharp, grey-yellow, and misshapen teeth appeared in the mass. &quot;Delectable,&quot; it said.\r\n\r\nA sweeping of an arm, and a shadowy form was flung towards Bard. It landed in his outstretched arms. _The child._ The deafening source of the song,  he was sopping wet and reeking of death, yet alive and unharmed nonetheless.\r\n\r\n&quot;He was missing a little somethin&#039;. Understand, otherworldly spices don&#039;t often find themselves down in these waters. Put together, you two will do nicely.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe hulking black form dived at Bard and the boy, and in those seconds as he entered Bard&#039;s light, details of its hideous form emerged. Slimy grey skin, emotionless eyes the colour of rotten lemons, ropes of shining saliva whipping from between those teeth. And one very out-of-place top hat. There was barely any time for Bard to consider this beast - what he was, where he was from, and what he wanted.\r\n\r\nAgain, Bard wondered whether he would be down here at all, in the stink and the damp, if it wasn&#039;t his duty. Without the chimes&#039; song to drag him through the world, righting wrongs and correcting mistakes, would he be just as dutiful? Or would he be selfish? Bard pictured the celestial gardens - the sparkling strands of starlight and blossoming orange novas at their ends - surely he would stay up there, admiring their beauty, all while letting the grand orchestra spiral out of control.\r\n\r\nThe song reached its crescendo, a single piercing note screaming out and making Bard&#039;s head ache. \r\n\r\n_So make it beautiful here, caretaker._\r\n\r\nBard snapped a finger only a moment before the first tooth touched his mask. From his fingers spread that familiar golden light, coating the water, the wooden stilts and the demon itself, all in an instant.  What was only moments ago a purple cavern lined with teeth and decorated by bits of foreign flesh was now part of a toad-shaped golden statue, which itself was part of a shining diorama of Bilgewater&#039;s underworld. Bard took a second to admire it all, for it would make a better memory than the sodden, black labyrinth.\r\n\r\nThe song drew to a close, to be replaced by the soft sloshing of the water, the breathing of the boy, and the chimes&#039; peaceful lullaby.\r\n\r\nBard wished, then sent the boy on a short journey home.\r\n\r\n_Well done, caretaker._\r\n\r\nBard wished again, and he was gone.","replies":[{"poster":"scarybear","date":"2016-07-09T09:42:43.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"11/10 would read again and again","replies":[]}]}
