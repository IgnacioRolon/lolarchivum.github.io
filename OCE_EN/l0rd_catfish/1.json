Very odd. In the fourth lobby I was the last pick. When the timer displayed 15 seconds left it kicked me from the lobby and said that I had failed to pick a champ.\r\nAfter my 5 minute leaving timer ended and I could queue again I was given last pick. This time I hovered my champ straight away, and as the timer got down to around 15 seconds it locked in for me.\r\nThought I&#039;d let y&#039;all know.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-16T07:43:07.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lord Catfish,\n\nYou might be getting some lag or packet loss during champ select. If the client doesn't get the information from the server that a player locked in, your client will just assume it should move on to the next step when the timer hits 0. If this happens, the next timer will be wrong.\n\nKeep an eye out for this, and check out the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you need to fix your connection. If this is indeed a bug or false timer not connected to lag, please submit a reported over on the [**NA Report a Bug forum**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
