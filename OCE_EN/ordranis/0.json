She shifted throughout the cosmos, witnessing supernovas and blackholes. She saw planets bombarded with meteor showers, desolate rocks floating in nothingness, galaxies forming and seemingly dancing, putting on a show for her. She loved every moment of it, she had no control over where she ended up, but she didn&rsquo;t care. She was seeing things no one had ever seen before! It wasn&rsquo;t too long after though, that she was moved to darkness. What gives!? She attempted to speak, but no words came from her body. She tried to move but she realized that she wasn&rsquo;t in control. She panicked, she didn&rsquo;t know what to do, how to get out of this situation. A moment later her arm rose, holding out some&hellip; weapon? It was emitting a soft golden light, just enough for her to make out small details. Wait, that&rsquo;s not my arm! She thought to herself. She now realized that the arm was wearing a golden armguard, covering a dark purple sleeve. It was a weapon, a bow to be precise. Another arm came up and pulled back the drawstring, light collecting at where the fingers met the string. She heard the body sigh, A girl? She thought to herself as the body released the drawstring. \r\n\r\nAn arrow shot from the bow, pulling her along with it as it made its journey. The arrow landed in an abyss of nothingness, exploding with a stunning light, seemingly creating life around it, leaving her in awe. \r\nA second arrow flung, drawing her away from the newly formed celestial bodies, leading her across the cosmos to another empty canvas ready for paint. A third arrow flung, another system born, a fourth, a fifth, sixth. With each arrow fired, she followed, excited to see what would form, excited to be the first to discover the new life. \r\nAn arrow shot through the space once more, but this time she wasn&rsquo;t dragged along with it.\r\nOdd. She thought to herself. She thought about following it and was immediately flung in the direction the arrow was heading. It felt different from before. All the other shots had a filled her with a sense of wonder and creation. \r\nThis one felt wrong, malevolent even. She came to a halt, confused. Around her was a collection of stars and planets, much like what she had seen before. Did I miss the creation? She wondered, looking around for any trace of the arrow. It was then when she noticed something hurtling towards her. A comet? A bright orange object was heading right for her, a trail of malice following it. She knew it was bad news, she so desperately wanted to move out of its line of fire but was, once again, frozen in place. \r\nAn immense pain rushed through her as the comet finally reached her, she wanted to scream out but not even a yelp was made. A darkness began to expand from where the comet made contact, growing rapidly, seemingly eating all that crossed its path. First just asteroids, then stars and entire planets fell to the seemingly endless hunger, and she was helpless to stop it. Right in the middle of the destructive power, she could feel it all, the pain of the life forms that called the dwindling galaxy &ldquo;Home&rdquo;, how scared they were, and a sick satisfaction from the darkness around her.\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity of torture, the darkness had finished consuming everything. All feeling had stopped. She was just left with nothingness.\r\nA figure began to emerge from nothing, far larger than anything she had seen before, even larger than the voidlings she had fought in the past, but it gave off the same feel. An endless hunger, a need for destruction. \r\nWith each passing second the creature just continued to grow, bigger than a mountain, bigger than a city. As it grew she could make out features forming. An exoskeleton, no, just a skeleton. Claw like hands. Insect like limbs protruding from where shoulders should be. Spiked back. Revealed, jagged teeth. Two pointed horns, extending from what could only be the upper skull, jutting out from where cheeks would be. She wanted nothing else but to run, she knew that it was danger. \r\nShe heard laughter. She had been so fixated on the emerging being she hadn&rsquo;t noticed a second figure appear on the playing field. \r\nLooking right at her.\r\nShe felt as if this titan of a figure could easily destroy a Solar system if it wanted to, and it probably has already. \r\nThe figure moved right up to the girl, looming over her, it moved almost like a well-oiled machine. Oiled with death&hellip; She thought to herself.\r\nThe figure tilted its head and laughed a robotic laugh that sent chills down the girl&rsquo;s spine.\r\nThe figure had a large, spinning key like object jutting out of its back, spinning with each motion. The being as a whole was reminiscent of a dancer. From hell.\r\n&ldquo;I hear soft things.&rdquo; Came a voice. She could only assume where the voice came from. \r\n&ldquo;I know what makes you tick. I know how to make the ticking stop.&rdquo; The voice said. \r\nA large black orb with a metallic belt encasing it appeared out of nowhere, the figure held it in its hands, the girl heard one final word, no, one final command before everything went black.\r\n&ldquo;Pulse&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nLulu woke up in a cold sweat.\r\n&ldquo;Loopy&rsquo;s awake!&rdquo; Jinx yelled out, standing in the doorway of the first year&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;&rsquo;bout time too, I&rsquo;m starving, can we eat now Poppy?&rdquo; She continued, leaving the room.\r\n&ldquo;Not yet! You still gotta do the dishes!&rdquo; Poppy yelled out from somewhere in the house &ldquo;After the state you left the kitchen in last time, you&rsquo;re gonna be on cleaning duty for a long time! And blowing them up doesn&rsquo;t count as cleaning them!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Laaaaaame!&rdquo; Jinx moaned, now down the hall. Lux was the first to enter the room with Janna and Poppy following shortly.\r\n&ldquo;Hey L- Are you alright?&rdquo; Lux started, racing to Lulu&rsquo;s bedside after noticing how pale she was.\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, I think so&hellip; I had a bad dream.&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say, a few hours ago I heard a cry come from here and came to check it out, you were squeezing on to Pix for dear life, poor little guy couldn&rsquo;t breathe. Had ta have Janna here take a look at the little fella.&rdquo; Poppy said in the &lsquo;Matter of fact&rsquo; tone she often used. \r\n&ldquo;We tried waking you up but no matter what we did you just didn&rsquo;t seem to be effected.&rdquo; Janna said with a tone of concern.\r\n&ldquo;Jinx even shot off a few rockets in here, but nothing. Don&rsquo;t worry, I cleaned up the mess&hellip;&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;What was your dream about?&rdquo; Lux asked, holding Lulu&rsquo;s hand in support.\r\n&ldquo;It was weird&hellip;&rdquo; Lulu recounted the events that took place in her dream.\r\nThe guardians all looked at each other in science, worried, until Janna spoke.\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that was just a dream&hellip; I think that was a warning from First Star.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Poppy demanded\r\n&ldquo;I- I have heard of beings such as the ones that she has described. Horrid creatures&hellip; Many a guardian has met their fate to things such as them&hellip;&rdquo;\r\nJanna paused, a pained expression on her face and a small crack in her voice.\r\n&ldquo;I&hellip; The last time I heard of a sighting I also heard of a guardian dreaming of them beforehand. I can only assume it was First Star trying to warn the guardians team&hellip;&rdquo;\r\nHer words hung in the air.\r\n&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us of this before, how do you even know all this!?&rdquo; Poppy exclaimed, visibly annoyed at the lack of information.\r\n&ldquo;What happened to the other team?&rdquo; Lulu asked.\r\n&ldquo;They&hellip; What happens to all stars, they burnt out. I&rsquo;m sorry Poppy, but some&hellip; some things are too painful to talk about&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Tch, Fine. I won&rsquo;t pry about your past. But you gotta tell us about those things.&rdquo;\r\nJanna looked at her smaller companion, a flash of relief on her face, only to be replaced with a more serious expression.\r\n&ldquo;I will, but first we need everyone.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Jinx! Get your butt in here.&rdquo; Poppy yelled\r\n&ldquo;Not just her. Lux, can you contact Ezreal?&rdquo; Janna motioned to Lux.\r\n&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re going to need more Guardians.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n*\t*\t*\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You sure it&rsquo;s them?&rdquo; Ahri asked, eyeing the night sky.\r\n&ldquo;Yup, I&rsquo;m positive, the signs are the same as last time.&rdquo; Sarah answered. &ldquo;The Dark Stars have surfaced again and are heading our way.&rdquo;\r\nAhri held the small pendants of her fallen comrades to her chest.\r\n&ldquo;Hey, Ahri! Just got word from Lux, her team wants to meet, it sounded important.&rdquo; Ezreal called out from inside, &ldquo;Personally I think we should.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Agreed, arrange it for me. They could be useful for this.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
