He&rsquo;d create rocks from nothing and send them flying and would be happy with a simple act such as that. Then he started to experiment.\r\nHe was so proud of himself when he created First Star all those year ago, he had somehow managed to create something that could generate it&rsquo;s own magic and that could imbue simple rocks that flew by it with life but no matter how hard he tried he could not replicate what he had done with First Star ever again.\r\nIn an attempt to make a star like First Star he used it&rsquo;s power on one of his failures in hopes that it would absorb it but what happened was not expected in the slightest. Tenkai, a small, round creature with fur that seemed to have a metallic sheen was born.\r\nSlowly more and more of her kind came into existence, although they didn&rsquo;t all look alike, some had tails and some did not while others were white there were some that came in blue. They took care of First Star and it&rsquo;s creations, they felt like they had a sort of&hellip;duty to serve and protect it. \r\nThe more First Star was tended to the more it seemed to grow in strength and it began to create stars on it&rsquo;s not long after.\r\nThe Father of the Stars began to slowly grow jealous of the devotion First Star got and the power that grew from it, he was the one who made First Star and it was because of him that it&rsquo;s creations even existed. \r\nThe more things created by First Star the more crowded and cramped he felt. First Star was taking more and more space from the Father of the Stars without any sign of it stopping anytime soon. He began to think that sooner or later there&rsquo;d be no more room left for the Father of the Stars to create anything himself. His canvas was being filled up but he wasn&rsquo;t the one painting on it and that was unacceptable. \r\nHe&rsquo;d had enough of it, First Star and it&rsquo;s creations had to go, there was only enough space for him and he wasn&rsquo;t moving. He attacked First Star without warning, firing a comet through the magical entity that he created long ago, but First Star wasn&rsquo;t defenseless. \r\nThe beings that were born from the stars sprang into action, some started to attack him while others flew to the damaged parts of First Star to mend it, whereas the ones that were born from the stars that he made, such as Tenkai, seemed to be hesitant to move, conflicted on who they should be helping.\r\nHe unleashed a stream of cosmic energy from his mouth, shooting it at First Star and the beings attacking him, wiping out a fair amount of them but no even making a dent in their numbers.\r\nFirst Star began to pulse, radiating a bright light that seemed to draw many of its creations to it, even some of the ones born from his stars began to fly to it. \r\nThe remaining beings flew over to Father, as if to side with him, seeming to have made up their mind.\r\n&ldquo;Wise choice, my children&rdquo; He boomed, firing more comets at First Star and its protectors.\r\nFirst Stars glow glew dimmer and dimmer after each of The Fathers attacks and he was sure that he was almost finished it but it was too good to be true.\r\nFirst Star finally stopped pulsing and for a short moment Father had thought that all of its magic had finally ran out. \r\nFirst Star emitted a massive shockwave out all around it, having no effect on the creatures protecting, that repelled Father and his &ldquo;children&rdquo; and solidified into a barrier once only it&rsquo;s protectors were left.\r\n&ldquo;Break that down!&rdquo; Father ordered his children as he frantically began to bombard it with attack after attack, desperate to get to First Star before it could regain its strength.\r\nFirst Star began to burn brightly once again seeming to have had enough time without being damaged to recover its expanded energy and, much to Father&#039;s dismay, vanished.\r\nNothing was left. Everything contained in that bubble had vanished.\r\nThe beings left behind were at a loss for what they were supposed to do. Tenki was the first to speak up.\r\n&ldquo;What happens now?&rdquo; She asked aloud, their whole purpose was to protect First Star but they had chosen to fight against it.\r\nFather felt humiliated. He wanted to kill the Star but failed, he had lost and he didn&rsquo;t like the taste. He had never finished a project incomplete and he wasn&rsquo;t going to start now.\r\nThis was no longer about him not having the space to create that he deserved or that his garden was being filled with someone else&#039;s flowers, this was about him seeing it through to the end and as long as First Star still burnt he&rsquo;d never be able to move on.\r\n&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t over, my child&hellip;this has only just begun.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long had he been doing this for? Ten thousand years? Ten million? Each time that he&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d had First Star in his grasp it&rsquo;d do something new and throw him off course. \r\nFirst was always expanding its influence. The galaxy that it fled to was one that was full of life unlike any that it&rsquo;s protectors had ever seen before and the Star being there only made the life forms evolution even more fascinating to them.\r\nWith First just existing there it altered their evolution track in ways that allowed for mere mortals to harness and use abilities that would otherwise be impossible. \r\nWhen Father had found out about it&rsquo;s little dwelling he put together a plan to distract the stars protectors by setting loose a few of his own new creatures to wreak havoc while he took care of First but he wasn&rsquo;t prepared for how much power First had managed to obtain over the years and just how capable the beings that First had helped were.\r\nFirst seemed to always have the perfect defense to whatever was thrown at it, no matter how many times he&rsquo;d go after it head on it&rsquo;d always be able to combat him.\r\nBut this last headache gave him an idea. \r\nThe life that First had raised had gone after him, they had found out that he was behind the danger sent Firsts way. \r\n&ldquo;Star Guardians&rdquo; they called themselves, claiming to be warriors of the light and that they couldn&rsquo;t turn a blind eye to his evil doing but they were no match against him.\r\n&ldquo;So, it&rsquo;s sending fighters after me now, is it?&rdquo; He said, not really expecting an answer, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bold move.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Star Guardians, eh?&rdquo; Tenkai responded &ldquo;They talked big game but they didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to follow through with what they said they&rsquo;d do&hellip; think First has more o- Wait, what&rsquo;s happening to them?&rdquo;\r\nThe bodies began to shine vibrantly, each guardian a different color, then, one after the other, the color left them, shooting back the way they came.\r\n&ldquo;What was that? A call for help?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;No&hellip; I think that was the Stars magic!&rdquo; Father exclaimed &ldquo;Remember when I first fought with your kind? When they fell to me something similar happened to them, just on  much smaller scale. I believe that Star infused its power into those creatures...&rdquo; He began to fly in circles, the way he&rsquo;d always do whenever he was coming up with a plan.\r\n&ldquo;If First has more of those things in its ranks then maybe I could&hellip; Tenkai, I think I have an idea on how to beat Star once and for all.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re having second thoughts, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Tenkai asked, noticing her close friend fidgeting in place. \r\n&ldquo;That obvious?&rdquo; Orianna replied, &ldquo;I.. I just don&rsquo;t know if I can go through with this...&rdquo; She continued as she walked over to sit on her bed. &ldquo;These people, they trust me now! They laugh at my jokes, help when I cry, fight when I fight! They accepted me as one of their own!&rdquo; She pulled her legs up to her chest, a gesture she learned from studying her &ldquo;teammates&rdquo;, and hugged her pillow them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt so much because of my time with them, I&rsquo;ve learnt how to care and how to feel joy, I&rsquo;ve learnt how fun it is to dance and how good pizza tastes and I feel like I could learn so much more from them than I ever could from the Father of the Stars..&rdquo;\r\nTenkai hovered over and sat beside her, &ldquo;I know what you mean, our time spent here was the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had and honestly I don&rsquo;t want this to end&hellip; what are we gonna do?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What.. What if we don&rsquo;t go through with it?&rdquo; Orianna asked, turning to face her little round companion.\r\n&ldquo;The Father of the Stars won&rsquo;t be happy with us, he&rsquo;ll send wave after wave of monsters after us if we betray him.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve beaten wave after wave of his creations before, that&rsquo;s how he trained us, but this time we won&rsquo;t be alone, the other Star Guardians will be there for us.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;If we decide to betray him we&rsquo;ll have to tell them the truth, about how he created you to become a Star Guardian to get close to the First Star and destroy it, do you really think they&rsquo;ll trust us after that?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;m tired of lying to them! I want to be honest with them, show them that I actually care about what we fight for because I actually do!&rdquo;\r\nTenkai sat there for a moment and thought of what their best move could be but was having trouble coming to anything worthwhile. \r\n&ldquo;I was created for the sole purpose to aid in the destruction of First Star.&rdquo; Orianna began to think aloud, &ldquo;Using the power of a fallen Star Guardian, Father made me so I&rsquo;d be a realistic Star Guardian and tasked you with being my &ldquo;Spirit Familiar&rdquo; to make it more believable. I am a weapon, pure and simple. So why do I feel this way? How can I feel? Why am I even considering going against him? I was meant to be created to be the perfect weapon that would finally end his fight and yet I somehow was able to feel, it just doesn&#039;t make any sense to me.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s because of First Stars power that lies within you that allowed you to learn to feel.&rdquo; Tenkai explained &ldquo;Father may have created your body but it was First Star that created your soul.&rdquo;\r\nOrianna thought long and hard in silence about her options ahead of her.\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make Father angry&hellip; but I also don&rsquo;t want to hurt my friends&hellip; I.. I just want to do what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;I want you to know that, whatever you decide to do, I&rsquo;m with you %100 and I that will never change.&rdquo; Tenkai declared, bringing  smile to Orianna&#039;s face.\r\n&ldquo;Thank you Tenkai, for everything. I&hellip; I believe that I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. I&rsquo;m still very new to feeling and it&rsquo;ll take a while before I&rsquo;m used to it, right now my mind is having a hard time thinking of what to do but I know what my heart wants to do.&rdquo; She let go of her pillow and sat up properly, grabbing her phone from her bedside table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve followed my head for my whole life but now it&rsquo;s time to follow my heart. This is what feels right.&rdquo;\r\nShe sent out a group text to the rest of her team, saying that she needed to speak with them and that it was urgent, she then stood up, placing her right hand on her hip, pointed out in front of her and declared, &ldquo;I am Orianna, my duty is to protect the people I love and destroy darkness whenever it shows its face. I am a Star Guardian!&rdquo;","replies":[]}
