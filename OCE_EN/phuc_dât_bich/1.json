However I have noticed a lot of players do tend to Disconnect from ranked games during the mid 20 minutes of the game. As a person who was previously using TPG&#039;s Internet I understand the frustration that comes with unpredictable Internet and unexpected Dc&#039;s. But however as contradictory as it is to the statement i just made. Why would you play ranked if you know you are going to lag ? Like are these players intentionally joining games they know they will disconnect? So \r\nI don&#039;t know maybe if riot considered the idea of player internet prerequisites prior to joining ranked games and turning this idea in a more practical way. I know most of you will read this and view it as selfish ( to the extent that only people with good internet is able to compete in ranked games) But however, what about the people that needs to play the game with 1 or even 2 less people? it is unfortunate and I can live with if it&#039;s 1 out of 10 games but I honestly think the number of people who disconnect are more than that... And I&#039;ll probably get higher ranked players that would think &quot;What a noob, learn to carry, it&#039;s because you can&#039;t 1 v 5&quot; yes I am aware that I am not as good at the game, that is why I am writing  this article :) \r\n\r\nKind Regards","replies":[{"poster":"gimble","date":"2018-09-30T13:40:47.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually... might not be a bad idea to put a connection check into the client, so when you click 'play' (for ranked only) it runs a quick latency, packet loss, jitter test... and displays the results.
