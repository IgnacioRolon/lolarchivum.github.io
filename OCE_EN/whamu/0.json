Straight up mute them, don't fight back, it's not worth it, even if there is someone you dislike, its better off to ignore and play than uin the game for the 8 other players.\n-Bronze players aren't all bad, and all diamond players aren't boosted - you cannot win every game, there are too many variables.\n-Always buy a pink early, whack it in your jungle, you'd be surprised how much worth you'll get from it.\n-Champ select, if there is someone being 'toxic' let them have their preferred role, and fill, if you are a good player - or if not! simply attitude wins games.\n-Encourage your team, try call objectives after winning fights - too many extend the game or lose pressure simply by not taking a free drag or obtaining ward coverage.\n-Know a toxic friend help them out play some norms, get their confidence back up, friends in this game help so much! Even just skyping with a friend to vent > typing abuse.\n-Build teams properly, don't just go to your fav champ every game - if you see your team with no hard engage, pick someone who can etc. Synergy!!\n\n\nI've been chat restricted for the 1st time ever and I've been playing since s1.\nI know I've been problematic lately and I'm fixing it.\n\nCheers -Whamu, nicest guy around.","replies":[{"poster":"ghost cat","date":"2015-01-30T16:19:00.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate every event that happens in your life, because on some level - as abstract as it could be;\n\nit's benefiting you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Whamu","date":"2015-01-30T03:36:10.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I feel, riot should just mute all chat in Ranked Solo Q, test it for a week.\n\nWatch the ' toxicity'  drop\n\nMinus champ sel.\n\nEnough variety of pings to communicate effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-30T11:07:40.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about noting down drag and baron timers for your team.
