However I just tried it today, and it is still running. I have lots of skins and champions on this one, and was debating if i should commit to my old account, or continue with my current account out of fear of getting a perma next. Since I have not played on it for 6 months now, does the banning reset, or would I get a perma if i slip up? ty","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2019-06-02T09:03:37.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"system is broken. just had 2 accounts banned within 2 days. a grand total of 4 non-bots games played. 2 with premades.\njust give up on this game. its not worth it. you get banned for OTHERS abusing and theres nothing you can do about it cos OCE and LOL as a whole is toxic AF.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-02T03:24:22.801+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"It does, but with good behaviour over a significant number of games, not with time. \n\nIf you don't play on the account you won't drop in punishment tiers and the next offence will still be perma even if you haven't played on it for a year.\n\nIf you truly can't control or at least redirect your behaviour, then look into ways of preventing it from affecting other players.

Riot set it up like that because they dont care about negative behavior if they did there woudnt be chat in game anymore","replies":[]}]}]}
