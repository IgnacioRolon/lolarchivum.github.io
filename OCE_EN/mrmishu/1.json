Can his main account get tracked down and shutdown?\nHe added me and told me that i suck at life, im bad, i should give up, that im worthless and im clueless. He is 23 years old and he is telling me, a 17 year old that im failing at life, that i will give up eventually (commit suicide). He made me angry, i don&#039;t think when im angry, he acted as if he knew me personally and that how i am one moment defines who i am overall. Can anyone please help me?\n\nHe starts swearing and being really negative, i call him an idiot once or twice, i get reported for offensive behaviour. This does not make any sense. He willingly talked to me after game and harrassed me","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Blackblood","date":"2015-11-17T14:41:19.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... ban him from your friends list. done.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"MrMishu","date":"2015-11-30T05:36:46.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i know i did that... why do you think i wouldn't do that? don't act like i'm the idiot","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-19T21:13:24.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey **MrMishu**,\n\nFor players who commit offenses outside of matches or who violate the Terms of Service but don't fall under one of the standard categories, you can send Riot a report by [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot Games Player Support with a screenshot of the said offenses and any additional information that you'd like to add. \n\nIf you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to advise you to remove any summoner names in the post, as it violates the Boards guidelines of name and shame; keeping them in the original post may result in a warning or further punishments. \n\nThank you for your diligence.","replies":[{"poster":"MrMishu","date":"2015-11-30T05:36:35.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok i may do that, I don't get the whole name and shame thing, if this person is disrupting the community then they should be known as infamous if they are\nMy main point is these people always say \"oh yeah report me, I don't care this is my smurf, not even my main, coz reporting is gonna do something\" \nThey do not care about being reported, as they know how untrustworthy this system Riot has is","replies":[]}]}]}
