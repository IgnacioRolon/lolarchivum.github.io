Rune pages were the same deal but stored in the server. You simply could NOT buy any extra pages.\n\nAs far as I remember you could always change masteries in lobby (I'm not  a beta tester), however rune pages were always fixed.\n\nAs the game matured Riot included the ability to get extra mastery pages, since they were stored in the computer they could not make them buyable.  Eventually, they moved the mastery pages to the server removing them from your computer.  \n\nRune pages were always stored server side... eventually they made extra rune pages available that people could buy with RP and IP.  I remember spending money to buy a 7 page bundle a long time ago.\n\n\n**Mastery pages were setup as free because you could always modify them in the in-game lobby and they were initially stored in your computer**.  So riot really couldn't keep track of what was happening with your mastery pages.  Changing them to buyable when they were stored in server would have enraged the community as it was something they already had for free, usually Riot tries to avoid that kind of negative feedback.\n\n**Rune pages on the other hand have always been stored in the server.  Riot viewed this as an opportunity to make extra cash when they made it possible to buy more**. If I remember correctly, they gave everyone a 3rd free rune page on the same day to appease the community.  There was some backslash about \"buying power\" as many consider extra rune pages to be equivalent to power. However, many others supported Riot's decision, saying that most of the game is available for free, and Riot has to make money somehow and everyone was receiving more than what they had before (from 2->3).  \n\nThat's basically why rune pages are bought but mastery pages are free.","replies":[{"poster":"MrMishu","date":"2015-12-02T01:12:35.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhhhh alright I see what you mean.
