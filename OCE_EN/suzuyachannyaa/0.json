What happened that may have caused this change? I have been playing with the same ping for a few months and when I came back from holiday and decided to play again, the increase in the ping has made the game quite unfun to play. What are some solutions that i can perform to get back to my original ping?","replies":[{"poster":"FF9","date":"2018-12-30T19:33:41.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have exactly same issue, i used to have 60-70ping, now i have 95-105 ping last 2 days, can't enjoy the game.
