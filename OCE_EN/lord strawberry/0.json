You get to use one autoattack, the item's active ability once (if it has one), and the chosen ability once against a \"punching bag\" with *infinite health* and no damage modification stats/effects (like Armor/Magicres), so everything you do will essentially deal True Damage. These Three Actions may be done in any order, and any amount of time may be taken between the actions (to wait for \"passive cooldowns\" such as Sheen). The Punching Bag is the only target in range, and thus will be immediately targeted by passives such as Quinn's Harrier.\n\nThe Only Modifications that apply are the Item you choose, and any passives the champion has (increased stats etc.) No Runes/Masteries.\n\nDamage dealt must not be variable - you cannot assume a critical hit. However, when considering abilities that deal the most damage based on differing areas, such as Ziggs' Mega Inferno Bomb, assume that the most possible damage is dealt.\n\nAutoattack buffing abilites like Talon's Noxian diplomacy count as abilities and do not count as the one autoattack (so you get one autoattack plus the ability-empowered autoattack) Autoattack buffing passives that require stacks, such as Caitlyn's Headshot, are assumed to be at 0 stacks.\n\nAbilities that deal more damage if the target is below a certain percentage of health (such as Zed's Passive) do not deal any bonus damage.\n\nFor Abilities that deal damage based on health percentage:\nAbilities like Elise's Neurotoxin, that deal damage based on the target's maximum or current health, have the monster damage cap applied.\nAbilities like Elise's Venomous Bite, that deal bonus damage based the target's missing health, don't deal any bonus damage.\n*edited* Abilities that deal flat %hp damage, like Deathfire Grasp's active, deal no damage in this scenario.\n\nInfinitely Stacking abilities like Nasus' Siphoning Strike would be assumed to be at 0 stacks.\nStacking Passives such as Tear of the Goddess and Casseopeia's Aspect of the Serpent can be assumed to have any number of stacks (up to the set maximum)\nSunfire Cape is not allowed as an item in this scenario.\n\nAny other loophole effects/abilities that you discover please comment below. \n\nHappy Mathsing!","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-18T08:03:33.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nunu ult start channel, dfg, full cast ult, stop channel, AA.\n\ndeathcap, deathcap, Lichbane, dfg, archangels staff, zhonyas, elixer of socery.\n\nassuming the target has 2,000 HP.\n\n300 (DFG)\n3648.75 (Nunu ult)\n871 (Lich Bane proc + AA damage.\nTotal (4819.75)\n\nAssuming Nasus, Veigar, Sion and Thresh aren't able to be apart of this. \n\nIt probably isn't the highest possible, but that's the highest I can think of right now with no runes/masteries from one ability, one active, and one auto.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Strawberry","date":"2015-01-18T09:20:01.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunu ult was one I thought of initially aswell, however a couple of situational errors:\n\nYou're only allowed one item - not a full build.
