So if your MMR is equal to that of Silver 5, and then you win most of your provisional matches, you will most likely be put in Silver 5 for the start of Season 5.\nI hope this helped :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-14T15:31:43.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ended the season in Bronze 4 then yes you will most likely be Bronze again come next season.
