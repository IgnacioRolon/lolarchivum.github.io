This change has made him lose his early game lane pressure and in result makes things harder on fizz to poke other early game champions. As of the assassin rework, he was a Burst mage... Not a mage. In my recent game of fizz, I was up against a Kassidin which yes I was poked out and being bullied but I felt with the new W that I cannot do any sort of bullying in the early game now.  \r\n\r\nThis was only my 2 cents worth and i am pretty Disappointed by the results of the Fizz rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-18T05:51:10.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should fizz be allowed to poke in the first place?\n\nHes a melee all in assassin.\nHis power comes from going ham on a squishy, not from poking them down.\n\nMages are for poke and harass, assassins are for jumping in and 100-0ing someone.\nYou cant be a lane bully, AND someone who can 100-0 a target in a second.\n\nIf you want Fizz to have good poke/harass, you have to get rid of some of his all-in kill kit.\nYou can't _(and shouldn't)_ have it both ways.\n\nYou wouldn't give Xerath or Ziggs the mobility and 100-0 potential of Fizz. So why should Fizz have decent harass/poke?\n\nThe counterplay of being an assassin, is that because you have to go all in to do your damage, you get bullied in lane by champs who poke and harass you when you aren't going all in. If you give Fizz easy poke as well, that removes that lane counterplay.\n\nKassadin should be able to beat Fizz, because Kassadin's main weakness is getting his ass poked into oblivion pre-6. And if you cant do that, you get smashed when he gets his ult and isn't behind. Fizz doesn't have that harass, because he too becomes a monster at lvl 6.\nThe difference being that Kass has the mobility and the MR to negate a lot of Fizz's stuff. So Fizz is just a bad pick into Kassadin.\n\nYou got beaten by a champ who counters your champ, thats not a reason to buff Fizz..","replies":[{"poster":"GoodGurlWarWick","date":"2018-07-18T07:06:59.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I was more saying is now with his current W, he has nothing to poke with, the W does very little in the terms of damage and now he just has to hope he gets to 6 without being abused. You use your W to one shot and then leave with an 8-second cooldown. Now it is just a bleed which is the problem I hate. it is an awful move on riots behalf. They made this choice in the assassin update and made him better with it and an actual assassin, not having this Bleed shit that gives him an empowered auto. I might as well go play zed because he has more harass. \n\nI understand I was counter by Kass but the more i look at this W being live and seeing fizz mains dropping fizz is kinda like... well riot... you have stuffed up with 2 reworks in a row (1 major, 1 minor).  I just really think this was a bad choice to place an assassin who is now not an assassin anymore. They did not give him anything in return for this change other the fact he is on hit.\n\nFizz was meant to go in, dive and kill, then tripole out. Now it is, Dive, Auto, W, Auto, auto, E. Like you should not even be in there for that long","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Fizzed","date":"2018-07-18T03:18:26.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree","replies":[]},{"poster":"ALONEinTheVOID","date":"2018-07-18T07:59:39.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assassin Fizz in mid lane the end. \nWelcome,  Fizz bruiser top and jungler :-(","replies":[]}]}
