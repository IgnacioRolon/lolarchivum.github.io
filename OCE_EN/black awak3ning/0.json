The first point is **not knowing when to stop playing**. if you play a game and you manage to go 0-8 in 20 minutes, i can guarantee you, that you're tilted out of your goddamn mind. Just stop playing for a while. or for the day. You're going to go into your next game with a bad mindset and screw your team over because you'll have flashbacks of the last game which upset you, and you'll just get angry all game. Also, limit yourself to 3-4 wins in a row  a day if you're not that great.  If you win 3 games back to back, just take the win and take a day off of the game. works for me.\n\n2. Ego problems. people are hungry to carry games here, and it often results them into feeding.  You have to learn to accept that you're trash at this game, and if someone is doing extremely well early on and putting you on their back, your job is no longer to carry the game, but act as an enabler to get to the finish line and win. Also. \"F**k the peopel who just soft int because someone called them bad when they are bad. IF you're playing bad and deep down you know it, just don't say anything back or int. just try your best as you'll only see that player for the last time.\n\n3. TYPING. This is particularly a big one and I myself am guilty. i got chat restricted coming back to league because i bothered to type back to random nobodies that disagreed with whatever I had to say to help them. If people can't help themselves, don't waste your time and mental energy. Just move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2019-12-16T14:00:45.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4.  People doing the same stupid things over and over.

Even bronze people can insec as Lee now. it's not hard.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2019-12-26T05:08:14.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Scripts,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=o4kEAEib,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2019-12-25T14:23:15.729+0000)\n>\n> Rengar, Riven, and Lee Sin don't take nearly as much skill as you think.
