I played a bad game, and a player called Itz Royal was really toxic.\r\nTelling me to kill myself and all this, i snipped what he said to me but i dont no how to add it to this.\r\nWas only playing norms aswell which makes it funnier. Gotta love life :)","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-07-17T00:33:56.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, I don't think you can name shame here on the boards.\n\nSecondly, I'm pretty sure that the other regions have toxic players but also neutral and genuinely nice players. It's unfortunate you had to play a game with toxic player(s). However, you need to realise it's not just this region. \n\nYou can always report these toxic summoners in the post screen page anyways so make sure you do that :) _(I do that )_\n\nEither mute them immediately or ignore them because if you start taking back and getting aggravated by them they have basically made you toxic as well and you could end up getting punished. \n\nI just remember being told by riot support don't fight 'fire with fire'.  \n\nI hope you have more enjoyable games tho :D","replies":[]}]}
