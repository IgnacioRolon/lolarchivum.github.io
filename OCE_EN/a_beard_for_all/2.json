I ranked bronze up until the year before iron addition which I got into silver. \r\nI am greatly aware of a lot of my own plays that cause me to be in this elo so this is not about how crap I can be.\r\n\r\nmorely the years of play and thus created mmr and game win to lose ratios.\r\nis it better for me to just start a new account from scratch so I can skip fixing my mmr? I am guessing yes\r\nbut also how hard would it be to forge on with my beloved account and drive its mmr up until I can hit higher levels?\r\n\r\nthis question is brought about by the fact I can play in silver 1 in my promos but still have bronze 4-1 players all through the game. kinda ruins the point of even saying its a silver to gold promo more a bronze to silver. or is this caused by newer players joining with no current mmr so they can verse higher elos with there newly inflated mmr?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2020-01-02T01:26:38.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a new account isn't gonna magically fix your elo if you're playing in the same elo you're meant to be. Enjoy the steady climb and stop playing ranked in the pre-season. It's a waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2020-01-15T06:41:30.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was not in anyway the question.
