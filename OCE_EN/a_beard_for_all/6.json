I understand that speed helps getting in for a critical shot but still that's not enough for what it is.\r\n\r\nthis year we are getting the new crit items and reworks on them. but I think its wrong and here's why\r\ncurrently from what I know brawlers gloves are getting removed and agility cloak is staying.\r\nI think it would be healthier and make a lot more sense to completely swap these items and how they work with zeal.\r\n\r\nso make zeal the build into the larger items that do not get attack speed and adjust brawlers gloves to fit with that. soo zeal would go down in cost or could just be placed as the build from agility cloak and keep that with the traditional attack speed sirt items\r\n\r\n then swap agility cloak to the attack speed crit items. because all of the items have a movement speed boost but where from. if agility cloak was modified and moved here it would make perfect sense\r\n\r\nplease say if I got anything wrong there or need to explain better thank you","replies":[]}
