You disappoint me, soloq needs supports and there are only so many support mains, dodging because you had to play support every once in a while is poor form. Also soraka is like 450ip that's less than a quintessence and you don't even have to be good with soraka to do well with her since she has harass, silence and heals; mechanically braindead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-07T00:08:11.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rekt","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cawub","date":"2016-08-06T23:27:08.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't need to dodge the game, auto-fill is there so that you don't wait absurdly long times to play a game that could possibly only last 30 minutes.
