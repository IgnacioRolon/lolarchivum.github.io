Obviously if they say something like \"because your Syndra winrate is trash\" then that's reportable.\n\nBasically what it comes down to is \"was there a valid reason to ban that champion\". If the answer is yes, or you think it's no but they give you a valid answer then it isn't punishable. If the answer is no then you can report it under \"unsportsmanlike behaviour\" in post game, or submit a support ticket with screenies if you don't make it that far.\n\nIf you're unsure about what a valid reason would be, feel free to post a client screenie here and we can discuss why the champ you intent picked might be banned, _**just be aware that the boards has a no name and shame policy**_ so you should black out the summ names before you do something like that.","replies":[{"poster":"Zang99","date":"2016-05-25T09:28:35.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kk I'll keep this in mind for next time it happens","replies":[]}]}]}
