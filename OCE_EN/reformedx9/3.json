You learn a lot more from watching your own games rather than mimicking high elo players. From watching your own games you'll be able to see what YOU are doing right and wrong and your areas of improvement. If I had the time I would add you and coach you which would involve spectating your solo queue games, analyzing your own game play styles and areas that require improvement then setting you homework as in, making you work on said areas then versing you in 1v1s to see how well you are going on an individual level in terms of the personal skills you would have needed then spectating more of your solo queue games to see if you are actually improving. Find a coach who is willing to do that. But I still strongly suggest that you find a way to spectate your own games.","replies":[{"poster":"Reformedx9","date":"2015-03-27T09:17:36.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am well aware of your suggestion (yes i have lol replay) and I am not asking for suggestions.  I want a high elo player to play with in game and 1v1 allot, discuss ideas strategies and mistakes.  Sometimes being around others that are better then you can help improve you quicker as I have seen in the past with my friends learning from me.  Some people out there enjoy teaching players as I have done with many myself in the past.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Point","date":"2015-03-28T06:09:27.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Fog I disagree with that simply watching your own games yes is effective but only if you know what to look for, i dont know what elo this guy is but alot of the time lower elo players don't even know they made mistakes, so they cannot improve of what they don't know. It helps to just have a helping hand in pointing out your faults and mistakes to improve you faster and you get knowledge of a higher caliber player.\n\nThis is just my opinion obviously everyone learns differently but just going off my own experience and feed back from other players i have helped this seems to be a really good method. Also i don't like the \"1v1\" system alot of people do because its not a real case scenario and wont serve any real point, unless its just purely mechanics i don't believe in it.","replies":[]}]}
