Head over to [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations) and get yelled at for posting on the wrong board there. Or just go to [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) and be completely ignored. Your poison.\n\nFor the moment you're literally just best off using LolKing or the like. Think of it like the shoddy online Match History that forced you to open it in a browser.","replies":[]}]}
