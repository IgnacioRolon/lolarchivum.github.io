The 'w' on zoe is interesting and is unusual thus I'm looking forward to playing her on the live client. \n\nIF anything I need better fps support with my potato PC.","replies":[{"poster":"Loose Kunt","date":"2017-11-08T02:45:01.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"interesting\" doesn't touch on the fact that flash has been the absolute biggest impact overall on this games meta. wtf is riot thinking releasing a champion that can take up to 3 flashes from enemies, what kind of counterplay does that leave at all? You flash to try and escape her killing you she just uses her W without even wasting her own flash then she can simply flash out when needed or use it again to follow up further. Thats not even mentioning the fact it can steal item actives, literally leaving 0 counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-08T02:52:43.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Loose Kunt,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=z2xtEskX,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-11-08T02:45:01.583+0000)\n>\n> &quot;interesting&quot; doesn&#x27;t touch on the fact that flash has been the absolute biggest impact overall on this games meta. wtf is riot thinking releasing a champion that can take up to 3 flashes from enemies, what kind of counterplay does that leave at all?

So if she misses her q's in fights then what good are her multiple flashes going to do if  she cant land combos and q's in a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Loose Kunt","date":"2017-11-08T03:28:39.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive is basically a sheen proc and it really isn't hard to land her skill shot its an AOE that just has to be moved to an area and does increased damage the further it travels go watch the highlights and plays of her already out and see how much damage it does too when moved not that far of a distance","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sonatics77","date":"2017-11-08T00:37:14.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I agree on that","replies":[]}]}
