I tried it on a friends client (different computer/same patch) and it worked fine. I tried googling/searching the boards but to no avail could i find any relevant information on how to make this feature work. Any help given would be hugely appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-10T09:53:48.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat sounds odd, I've just tested and it's working on my end.\n\nCould you try [repairing your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq5)? let me know if that helps.\n\nAlso make sure you're not adding a space or anything when typing out the words (At the start or the end)","replies":[]}]}
