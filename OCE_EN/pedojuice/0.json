It just means that your mmr is higher than your actual rank.

That's just how the game works. On the plus side, you get to improve your skills dramatically as you play against players ranks above you. It's hard, but i'm thankful for it coz now i can honestly see that i've improved alot in the past 3 months than i have in the past 2 years. Like seriously, my farming and laning phase is better now compared to last year. Just take it as a learning experience and play with an open mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
