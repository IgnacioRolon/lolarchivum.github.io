Usually they go in order one at a time, but extremely toxic behavior may result in skipping punishment tiers. Remaining a positive player for a long period of time may reduce the tier you are on.\n\nIn this match nearly every single time you used chat it was negative, abusing your team in one way or another. This kind of behavior only contributes to a negative environment that is likely to make yourself and others play worse more than anything else. If you are having issues with another player in chat, just mute and report them. You don't need to tell them they'll be reported (that in itself is negative behavior), and they'll be judged for their actions while you are judged for yours; if you don't do anything wrong then their reports won't do anything to you.\n\nIf you're unsure how you're expected to act, I suggest reading the below articles for guidelines on being a positive player;\n\n[The Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/)\n[Behavior Worthy of a Champion](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874)\n\nIf you feel your punishment was a mistake you may submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to appeal it.

I just wrote up a really big post and accidentally refreshed the page haha so here's the short version.\nOne of the reasons i fight back in chat is because 9 out of the 10 times i've reported people for being toxic they don't get punished at all, and because i've had prior punishments if im reported i'm the priority for punishment over the trolls in my games.\nI recently made another forum post complaining that i couldn't receive champion mastery tokens due to my prior punishments and just the other day i received one and i was really happy, I thought i was reformed ahah anyway..\nI dont understand why riot cant just remove my accessibility to the chat instead of removing my access to the game as i've poured hundreds of dollars into the game itself. The pings are there for a reason and they can get the point across of all the callouts needed by using chat. Its a shame, i will probably quit league at this point, i've got multiple lvl 30 accounts but its not the same not being able to play on my very first account all the way to the end.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-13T09:39:11.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna be blunt here and say, how do you know they didn't get punished? If they were negative (for more than one game) chances are they got punished, or at the very least have been punished in the past. \n\nIt usually takes a couple games for a player to face punishment (especially if they have no negative history), and only those who reported them in the last game they play before their punishment see a notification. Very few players ever actually see the notification saying their report has been actioned, hell I only saw my first one recently, and I always make sure to report that kind of behaviour.\n\nThere is no priority for punishment, the system evaluates each players behaviour separately. It doesn't matter who started it or who finished it, if all reports are valid then all of them will be actioned, perhaps that is in the form of a strike against that accounts history, or an actual punishment, but one person being punished doesn't stop others in the game from being punished as well. And punishments don't reduce the weight of your reports either, only consistent false reporting will do that.\n\nIt's easy to understand why this would be so frustrating, and whether or not you continue to play League is of course your choice, I can only hope to clarify things for you a little.\n___\nOne of the reasons Riot doesn't use permanent chat restrictions is because it doesn't solve the problem. That person is still negative, and if negative enough, will find other ways to get to other players (spam pings, intent feeding, AFKing etc). Riot has done their best to create a system that encourages reform, and permanent chat restrictions don't do that, it's only a bandaid solution. \n\nThat said, some people really feel a permanent chat restriction would be the solution to their own behaviour, like you do, and sure you may even be right, but there are ways to enforce it yourself, and if you really want to reform then it is your responsibility to use those. You can unbind enter, move your chat off screen and mute everyone at the start of each game.\n___\nChoose to keep playing or not, that's your choice, but if you do keep playing, I just hope you take this as a lesson, and good luck to you either way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Elfalion","date":"2016-06-11T12:21:48.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is my chat history for this game.

Responding with toxicity in kind is not ok, and you only open yourself up to punishment.\n\nThe BEST way to deal with negativity aimed at you is to ignore it completely. Anything and everything you say will be used as fuel for the fire and will only make it worse. Muting is recommended but if you choose not to just don't engage.

I can't pretend I've never fired back in a toxic manner because I have, plain and simple, and yet I've never faced a punishment myself.
