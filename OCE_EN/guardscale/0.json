Can we please stop using what appears to be the rise of an imperial system patch numbering) I do agree they need to give her better AP scalings on her Q and E but her heals are already great. Stop letting supports only be supports! Top Braum, jungle Leona, Soraka mid, please make them real!\n\nPlease Riot, push Soraka into a more healer support, sustain mid (The closest thing right now is the utility mid, CC support Morgana and the poke mid + support Karma) direction by lowering her base (support affecting) damage and increase her AP (bourgeois mid laner gold affected) scaling on her damage, and make her sparkly W more noticeable (visual update, please add something opaque instead of see through smoke on her main ability).  Another thing to do is to make that Q slow more accessible for peeling by lowering the slow on the middle, adding slow to the edges and increasing the damage in the middle to encourage the same things you would in a mid laner (hitting your skillshots accurately and constantly) while encouraging the things usually found in a support (timing of peel rather than outright constant accuracy). Finally, let E hit minions to compensate for the massive Q peel buff by making pushing and accidental farm stealing a slight problem while stopping her from becoming sub optimal in mid lane for the same reasons as Ezreal (not much roaming or all in potential as LeBlanc and not much lane pressure as Viktor at the same time).\n\nI pray for a Ritoian to hear my pleas","replies":[{"poster":"Guardscale","date":"2015-10-01T12:13:17.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually hope they will listen. if not we will know that riot does not care about soraka...in my opinion she is one of the funnest support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-29T15:56:23.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her scalings have been changed once over a year ago since season 3 which you werent even playing in to even know about. i would honestly put money on you being drunk, high or 12 when you wrote this stupid babbling nonsense","replies":[{"poster":"Guardscale","date":"2015-10-01T11:38:22.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played the OLD soraka,so you can be quiet,ill have you know that ive never done drugs in my life so there is NO possible way that i could be high,also you've got my age wrong ^_^ Her scalings used to be WAY better...but riot was like \"MAKE HER SUPPORT SHES USELESS!\" i hope you understand that....HER WHOLE KIT IS AMAZING IF YOU BUILD AP...to be honest i think shes meant for mid.....not support,but thats just my opinion...hence the fact that she can burst down champs decently when she has a lot of AP items...sadly,its gotten Harder over the year.","replies":[]}]}]}
