It has always been setting up scrims (which is why the top teams have always done it).\n\nI would highly suggest reaching out to the other OOL teams (you should know them all now after playing a few tournaments) and setting up scrims. Obviously it sounds like you are already doing that which is great, but if you want to practice more I would recommend organizing more scrims! I'm sure a lot of OOL teams would be up for it.","replies":[]}]}
