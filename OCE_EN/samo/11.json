(I\"m a student so I can't play all day but I try to dedicate as much time as i can)\nI know that's not much but I'm going to keep trying and improving until I reach high diamond and I won't stop there!\nI have a high MMR and am getting matched with plat4/3s and am confident I can reach diamond in a few weeks if I keep climbing at this rate.\n \nI'm 22 years old and am looking to garner more experience and really just improve as a player. I promise I will be an asset to your team just give me a chance!\n\nI main trynd because I'm trying to climb, but love playing tanks like shen, tahm and also rumble for ap top. I'm willing to pick up any champ for what the meta is and what the team needs.\n\nI'll add you in game this evening, I just wrote this cos I'm currently at college and keen to try out.\n\nyes I can commit to the tournaments and practice schedule","replies":[]},{"poster":"My Lucid Dream","date":"2017-03-13T05:22:16.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support god thresh{{champion:412}} ","replies":[]}]}
