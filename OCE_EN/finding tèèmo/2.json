Been wanting to move out for a few months now and parents semi directly basically told me to piss off (i didn&#039;t do anything bad like drugs or burn the house we just don&#039;t get along standard stuff) Going on other forums but i figured, hey theres probably a alot of uni and older people also out there they might have some experience or advice on moving out. So yeah any advice and tips in general on moving out, and also importantly on finding a good place to stay and with who. Any not giving troll advice appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2016-04-20T00:01:09.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a job and find someone else who works to help you cover rent and bills its tough doing it on your own you will barely scrape by week per week. Also I'm sure your family still loves you even if you dont get along just ask the fam to help out wherever possible like old furnitures and shit so you dont go blowing budget on what you need to move out. internet isn't that expensive I get 500G a month for $70 I never go over the cap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-04-19T09:39:15.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just moved out of my home and off to a different City (Wellington) I was expecting it to be a huge change but honestly It wasn't so bad. I think Ideally you want to live with friends however I am not and that's not so bad. I think the absolute most important thing is having money. I needed to play more than $800 as a bond for my apartment (and its not an upper class or even every nice one. and then had to play the rest as soon as I moved in and keep paying it. Having very limited money can shut you down very hard and fast so I think before you even think about doing anything, make sure you have as much money as you can get. Maybe a past time job or savings or something? I didn't have to find other people to flat with because the agency that owned the apartment did that for me but If you can't find people to live with you might end up paying double or even triple the amount you wanted to play, until you find people. Other than that Its not actually a big change, just keep up with the mess. buy and eat good food and if you are studying, don't skip out on class. I get a student allowance from the government because I am studying and that helps pay the rent and such like but if I didn't have that I really really really would have needed a lot of money to start with. The general rule is: the more money you have the easier things are. I hope everything works out and you can find something good for your life. Things can be hard but just think of your dreams and hold onto something good in your life. Good Luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finding Tèèmo","date":"2016-04-18T08:45:41.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yeh im living in auckland","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-18T09:03:59.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Living in Auckland, the best thing you can do is try and find shared accommodation (rent a room, not a house/apartment). Cheapest way to do it. Have a look on trademe, as well as the Facebook groups. Make sure to inspect the place first, and meet the people. \n\nIf you go to uni, maybe check out the Princeton apartments on Symonds street or the Columbia building on Whitaker place. I hear they are pretty good.\n\nIf you haven't got one already, you are definitely going to need to get a steady job, living in Auckland is super expensive. Finding a job is also super hard, so I would suggest linking in with a temp agency to help. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]}]}]}
