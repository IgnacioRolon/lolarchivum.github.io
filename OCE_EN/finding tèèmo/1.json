Specifically for the league side of things could anyone give some pointers on some good editing software and what ever i might need to edit youtubes videos. I was gonna source some material to practise editing on from a mate who is a huge playmaker but need help getting and using the tools to make some cool vids. Any help would be awesome. I dont mind paying at all for some good quality stuff if its not like thousand dollar movie editing stuff or subscription based.","replies":[{"poster":"Finding Tèèmo","date":"2016-04-25T03:28:36.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks everyone been a big help :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-24T08:48:28.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what I've seen most people use depending on their experience:\n\n+ **Basic Level**:\nWindows Moviemaker\n\n+ **Intermediate Level**:\n Sony Vegas Pro\n+ **Expert Level**:\nAdobe After Effects, Sony Vegas Pro, SkinSpotlights Replays\n\nThat's just what I've seen and I'm not very into the whole League videos thing. There might be better software you can use. I'm pretty certain on SkinSpotlights Replays and After Effects though, those are pretty much the best and everyone uses them.\n\nI'd recommend getting in touch with **Arkadian**, **PentaMagic**, **Mega Gnar** or **Mr4eva** (sorry if I missed anyone) to ask them what they use. Those are all their in-game names, they make some of the best Youtube content on OCE, but they're still small enough to be somewhat approachable.\n\nI hope this helps a bit :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fear In Cube","date":"2016-04-24T08:56:17.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, you should skip Movie maker and try to look for something like Sony Vegas. Movie maker is REALLY garbage and you'll waste a lot of extra on it. Another good replay  website is Replay.GG that I personally might use in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-24T13:32:46.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BaronReplays is on point you can convert the game straight to mp4 and add camera angles or just spectate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RainbowLlama","date":"2016-04-24T10:10:39.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you do make a YouTube channel, remember, you won't be the worst. *cough* Donnie Fro *cough* \nSo good luck and please tell me how you're going.\n;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-24T08:26:49.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh movie maker probably has everything you're looking for in a video editor.","replies":[]}]}
