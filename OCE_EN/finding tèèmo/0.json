Some obvious ones are pantheon and the spartans, but then there is also some like darius and darius the king of the persians, and wukong and the monkey king in chinese mythology. I thought it would be cool if people could give some info about the origins of some of the characters in league, like who they are based on, some history etc.. basically how riot got their inspiration for their champions.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-16T04:14:38.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm like 90% sure zed was inspired by the shredder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-22T04:31:09.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few champions I see that remind me of characters from other stuff. I'll just make a list.\n\nBrand and Heatblast. Now, I don't know who came first but Brand does remind me of Heatblast from the Ben Ten series.\nSpeaking of Ben Ten, Zac and Goop. Again, I don't know who came first but Zac is basically Goop without his Anti-Gravity Generator. Hell, Zac's abilities are pretty much all Goop does, except for all the flying around that is.\nCassiopeia should be pretty obvious. I mean, she's obviously based on Medusa.\nFiddlesticks and Scarecrow. If you're thinking \"Wizard of Oz\" Scarecrow, just no. I'm talking about \"Batman\" villain Scarecrow, after all his whole thing is fear. Though it is a somewhat loose resemblance.\nLissandra seems to me to be pretty much based on the Snow Queen, the main protagonist of the Hans Christian Andersen tale \"The Snow Queen\", the same tale \"Frozen\" is (supposedly) based on (yeah right, Didney).\nI don't know about you guys but I do see some resemblance between Malphite and Geb, the Egyptian God of Earth (if I'm not mistaken).\nNunu has resemblance with Emperor Sifrat XVI from Arthur and the Invisibles.\nShaco and The Joker. Yes, another Batman reference. But let's face it, it's entirely feasible.\nTwisted Fate is obviously a rip off of Gambit from Marvel. Just look at the similarities.\nVolibear and Iorek Byrnison from the Golden Compass are pretty much the same person.\nWarwick seems to be based off Fenrir from Norse mythology.\nLastly, Zyra and Poison Ivy. Yep, another Batman reference. Let's face it though, same powers and very similar style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Finding Tèèmo","date":"2015-10-22T03:27:51.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2015-02-16T02:42:30.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorrick has his abilities named after the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse.
