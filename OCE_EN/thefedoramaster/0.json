Delete Blind Pick, it's atmosphere is cancer for newbies and low MMR, and put in TB which is better in every aspect than Blind Pick, and then Riot can start having TB Draft Pick with TB Blind Pick and eventually TB Ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-11T23:24:26.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it \"sucks ass\" because no one will play supp or adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"CptFurious","date":"2015-08-10T22:38:23.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Ow7Hhbuq,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-10T16:23:04.027+0000)\n>\n> The only reason TB \"sucks ass\" is that no one plays it.

It's kind of a negative cycle where we steer away from TB because the wait times are too long and in doing so reduce the amount of people playing TB so keeping the wait times too long...\n\nI would love TB to be a viable option, makes it so much easier to brush up on particular roles/champs without having to compete with instalocks or \"MID or FEED\" type players in blind pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-08-10T23:55:49.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rather Normal Draft please.","replies":[]}]}
