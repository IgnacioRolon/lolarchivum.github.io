Help please?","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Riot, please hear me out, and I hope someone can help me out.\r\n\r\nI moved from SG to play on OCE, and created and leveled my account from scratch 2-3 years ago. Recently, my account was compromised out of the blue (I&#039;ve most recently played at a gaming cafe once, about three months prior, and otherwise at home, or at a close friend&#039;s place). There was a namechange and the person who accessed my account bought a skin with the RP on it. I also noticed that my summoners were switched to Flash on D instead of F.\r\nI submitted a ticket to Riot Support and they were very helpful and immediately recovered the loss as well as switched my email address.\r\n\r\nI woke up 4 days later to an automated message informing me that the account would be permabanned due to &#039;malicious 3rd party programs&#039;. I wrote in immediately to Riot, who told me it was &#039;definitely not a false positive&#039;, and I informed this team of the recent incident of my account being compromised as the possible trigger. They refused to tell me when the incident occurred that triggered the ban, yet I cannot think of any other reason. Moreover, their final response was that &#039;since the act was performed on the account, the account must be suspended&#039;. I personally feel that this is unfair because to me, clearly, my account was hijacked and used as a tool to break the ToS. This is reasonably analogous to a car owner being held responsible for the outcomes perpetrated by a carjacker, and then being told that &#039;he should have ensured the security of the car&#039;.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a long time league player, I used to play somewhat competitively, but now I&#039;m just a casual player playing normals and the occasional ranked game with friends ever since uni started. There&#039;s nothing else I can say that to prove my innocence, except for fellow gamers whom I&#039;ve met over the years who can vouch for my character.\r\n\r\nAt this point it isn&#039;t entirely about the time and effort I&#039;ve put into leveling it up from scratch, and the limited edition content from attending events such as IWCA and PAX. I could create a new account and enjoy league with my friends still, albeit a tiring process, but I want to know why my account was banned. I&#039;m not getting answers in something that I feel was extremely unfortunate, and most certainly unfair to me, and I really hope that after reading this, I may be able to be provided some resolution.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Account wrongfully permabanned, and I have my suspicions on what actually happened. I&#039;m hoping that Riot Support will notice and thoroughly investigate and that I may be exonerated.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-17T01:00:11.910+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey onelifeonetale,\nThis does seem like a bit of a weird situation. I've had a chat with some people about how the ban would \"interact\" with the compromise and it seems that if the \"triggering acts\" occurred during the compromise then you shouldn't have received the ban (and if you still did it should have been sorted out by support when you contacted them).\n\nGot some people who are happy to check it out and see what's happening (you know, just in case of human error), so we've got that process started. If you could provide the ticket number I can pass that along to one of the support staff and they can take a look at what's happened behind the scenes and figure out what should happen (or should have happened).\n\nKeep in mind, though, there's no guarantee the ban will be revoked. We'll do what we can to get to the bottom of this, but if that leads to the same conclusion that you've already been given there's nothing more anyone can do. I just want you to keep that in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"onelifeonetale","date":"2017-07-17T10:43:21.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello HeartVine,\n\nThank you for the prompt response. This is the ticket number regarding the suspension: #30454577, and this is the initial ticket regarding the account being compromised: #30379519.\n\nI really hope what actually happened can be unearthed as soon as possible, and I'd like to thank you and the team for working on it in advance.\n\nRegards.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-18T00:25:50.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got word back and was told it looks like you were compromised, but it might not have been related to when the 3rd party programs were detected. You can feel free to submit another ticket, but at this point there doesn't seem to be anything that can be done unless there's something no one has notice yet, which is unlikely.\n\nIf I had to take a guess, I'd say there was probably something running in the background when you used the computer at that gaming cafe you mentioned. It's always worth it to check Task Manager for anything suspicious when using a public computer, though not much to do about it now. I'd assume you were using a personal computer (laptop, maybe) when playing at your friends place, if not it might be a good idea to ask them what was installed on the computer you used. That said, if the computer you normally use is shared I'd say it's worth asking anyone else who uses it about anything that might have triggered the ban.\n\nI doubt finding out anything at this point would change the decision that Riot has made, though, but if you choose to start from scratch it will definitely be a good idea to figure out which computer it happened on (and even which program[s] were responsible), so you can play without risk in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"onelifeonetale","date":"2017-07-18T08:50:48.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello HeartVine,\n\nWould it be possible to identify and match IP addresses? The IP address logged when the '3rd party program/s' detected. It's quite unlikely that it had anything to do with the PC at the cafe, because it would have been more than 2-3 months since I went there that the ban was triggered and issued. Ever since, I've only ever played on the same personal laptop, be it at home or at a friend's place, and I've definitely only ever run the same programs that I've always been running.\n\nI'd be glad to submit a new ticket and provide a list of programs that run on my laptop, so that the team may see if any of these might have triggered it inadvertently. Should I just re-link the previous tickets, as well as this post?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-18T10:57:10.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if it would be viable to try and match the IP addresses in question, and I'm not sure how the support staff would feel about that (from a technical standpoint, that is). Should you submit another ticket, there's no harm in asking, and I would definitely recommend including the ticket numbers for the other tickets included in this series of events, makes it a faster process for everyone involved. As always, it's best to provide as much detail as you can.\n\nOne thing to consider with 3rd party software bans is that they're done in waves, each one several months from the last. So even though the occurrence at the internet cafe may have happened ~3 months ago, it could still be a very real possibility that that computer (and the programs running on it) is responsible for your account getting picked up by the system. It certainly seems like that may be the case.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gerk","date":"2017-07-27T11:52:19.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they give you back your account, why would you spend money on a new one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-17T10:56:33.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only thing I can think of in this situation is that the behaviour that resulted in the perma ban was not during the supposed account \"hijack\" otherwise Riots just up to their usual ways of screwing people over.","replies":[]}]}
