The weighting of original placement matches would have to be much heavier than what they are currently, so that a win streak in placements means something, instead of ending the season at gold V, winning 8/10 and being placed silver 2 anyway. Instead, the placements would begin at a middle ground (I would suggest around gold level) and the ELO points of players is adjusted after each game. This would me that players who have done badly in previous seasons, but have improved to a point where they perform well, but not enough to carry a game solo, would have a chance to start fresh. High ranking players would most likely win the majority of their placements and continue to climb back to their original rank. I believe that Overwatch has a similar system to what I propose, but haven&#039;t done any research. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, this thought was due to me experiencing ELO hell at the end of the season after only playing normals with friends all year. I find myself performing consistently and more often than not, better than (at the very least) the rest of my team. However, I am not good enough to carry games solo. I would like to be in a rank where I feel that my contributions to the team matter, rather than having a huge kda and not being able to use it to take objectives as I have to baby sit all my team mates. \r\n\r\nYes this is a bit of a vent, but I still believe it would make the games ranking system much better, and reduce the amount of boosting going on. Feel free to be brutal and toxic, had enough of it in solo queue so it won&#039;t bother me. \r\n\r\nInb4 tldr","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-10-17T15:21:15.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system works fine, if you are not climbing that is because you dont deserve to climb.
