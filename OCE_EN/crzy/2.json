This thread is not about nerfing champs or anything (that&#039;s a different category all together), this is about what Riot is doing to the game and how it is affecting play styles across all manner of skill levels. This might end up being TL;DR, if it is, don&#039;t read it, and don&#039;t complain about it being too long, I gave you a warning.\r\n\r\n So to begin with, I started playing the game in about July 2013 during season 3. I was new to any sort of MOBA game and so had no idea how to play the game but got hooked and have been playing regularly since, even more since I finished school. But as I have been playing for some time now, I have noticed some changes to how riot has been creating the game with their choices in updating the game. I feel one of the biggest things they have done (in my opinion) is reduced the gap between needing skill to rank up, and winning games. The game has become less about individual skill level and team tactics, and more about who can pick the most &quot;OP&quot; champions.\r\n\r\n When I watched the LCS in season 3 I learnt a lot about how the professional teams create their team composition and how to form plays based on their enemy players. This was done in a multitude of ways but one in particular that caught my eye, was the use of tactical picks and bans in the draft champ select. Specific teams would research each individual player on the opposition&#039;s specific play style and champions they are most comfortable with, and therefore, most likely to succeed with. The team would then focus banning out the champions that those players liked to play to reduce their effectiveness in the game. For example, a lot of teams would focus on banning Faker&#039;s Zed because of how good he was at using that champion in particular. Then the team would pick popular picks for certain roles depending on how they wanted their team composition to be. Roles such as support were not regularly seen to be as important to counter pick based on counters and so popular supports such as Thresh and Leona were picked first to take them away from the enemy team. Then the other roles such as mid and top lane were more focused on counter picking the opposition&#039;s counters to try and make them least effective in the game or to gain the upperhand on them. Picks and bans were more interesting when you had to pay attention to each teams choices of preferred champions in the LCS. This also applied well to lower ranks as you could usually guess what sort of strategy the enemy team had in mind going off their bans. For example, if the enemy team banned Caitlyn, there was a good chance they wanted to play Vayne as (at least in low ranks) she was a massive counter to her and for less skilled adc&#039;s was unable to be  played against. \r\n\r\nHowever, now I feel that the game has become less about forming team compositions and focusing bans on specific champs to influence the game, and more about banning the most &quot;OP&quot; champions. In Worlds this year (although I wasn&#039;t able to watch most of the games) teams were forced to use their bans against the &quot;OP&#039;s&quot;. In every single game of SKT vs KOO in the finals, the bans were all the same. Ban Mordekaiser, Gangplank, Elise, Renekton, Kalista and Tahm Kench. For me, it was sad to see such an interesting part of the game be reduced to nothing purely because some champions were too hard to counter (even for the pros) and so they had to be taken away. Not only was the bans reduced to nothing, the first 3 picks were always the same, pick Lulu mid, Gragas or Reksai jungle and Alistar support. I feel that Riot has been making too many changes to champions (and quite a few at a time) without giving the community time to adjust and form specific strategies to counter each champion picked. I am all for the changes to champions to give the community a change of pace every now and then (except for whoever decided to give Darius a heal and speed boost, you need to quit your job and dedicate your life to making up for the horror you unleashed), but give us time to adapt. The large majority of your player base is below platinum level and watch the pros for tips on how to deal with the champions they feel to be most trouble in their rank, except now the problem with that is that even the pros no longer have any counters to these champs except to ban them. I would like Riot to stop forcing a &quot;meta&quot; on us and allow us to adapt and form our own play styles. Please stop changing the game to the point where it is no longer recognisable and go back to just spamming skins for money, after all, that&#039;s all you care about anyway Riot, the community never mattered except for their wallet.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading if you got this far, constructive criticism please. I don&#039;t want people screaming abuot how &quot;wrong&quot; I am as the majority of conversations I have read on these forums seem to be someone offering an opinion and then 50 people just commenting &quot;no&quot; and downvoting them into oblivion. Also, Riot if you are reading this, change the text box so I can read what I am typing instead of having all the options for bold and italics all over the right side of what ever I am typing. It&#039;s really annoying (not sure if bug, is so, apologies and continue)","replies":[{"poster":"Sierra 117","date":"2015-11-22T03:31:14.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot forcing a meta on us? The meta was player created...... I remember when there was no set meta in season one, and it was common to see ashe go mid and rush zeal. Then after the Season 1 LCS and Championships, the meta was defined due to the effectiveness that the pro's displayed using it. The point of releasing all these new items and champion tweaks is SO that the meta can shift e.g. Kindred.\n\nOne thing I do not like, and has been happening every season, is the shift from solocarrying, to more of a team based game. Yes, in terms of an ESPORT, this is a good change. But most league players like you said are in silver and bronze, where there is very little team cohesion.","replies":[{"poster":"Crzy","date":"2015-11-23T16:21:37.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that LCS has a big impact on how players pick champs (as evidenced by the influx of Kennen ADC's I saw a day after worlds) but in reality, if you want to carry yourself in low ELO's, you pick the easiest and most \"broken\" champ in the game. I did it using Tryndamere as his damage output is insane and he has an ult that makes him unkillable for, what I consider, to be quite a substantial length of time. Champions like Annie are also popular easy win champs because they have high damage output with kits that make it too easy to steam roll games. Annie is a pet peeve of mine because of how her q can be used to farm as a high damage auto attack that stacks her passive up. It's impossible to play against as she just farms using q, never loses mana, and then ult stun combos you. I think that riot need to start making the game more balanced for the meta you mentioned and make it so that every role is countered by another, making team cohesion a bigger part of the game, especially now that they are effectively removing solo/duo queue and making it possible to team up as a group of 5. At the moment you have to counter pick each individual champ, and some are just too hard to counter for low skill players. I feel as though each role should counter another so that the game is fair and more balanced. For example, mid counters adc through burst, top counters mid through sustain in a fight, adc counters top through kiting, and jungle and support allow you to stack onto countering and backing up a role each like having a a support for your adc to buff them in fights, and a jungle to counter one of the other lanes twice as hard. With that meta it revolves around team comp but also each role still has a chance to be beaten by another so that if one lane wins (eg top), every other lane isn't completely screwed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-22T20:07:24.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Meta's not very simple.\n\nTurrets. Team Fights. Assassinations. Split pushes. Gang pushes. Ganks. Roams. Rotations. Damage Types. Resistance Types. Strengths. Weaknesses.\n\nTanks can get to carries. Carries can take objectives. Tanks can tank objectives for carries.\n\nAP's can assassinate Carries quickly as can AD Assassins. Tanks and Bruisers can interrupt Assassins and AP Carries and to some extent kill/get to AD Carries. AD Carries can hurt Tanks/Bruisers if they are trying to fight their team. Plus they can generally hurt AP Carries whose skills are on cooldowns (and ultimates) if they chose to use them on a Tank/Bruiser during a fight.\n\nSupports are good at pimping out people in team fights.\n\nSo it's sorta optimal to have a Tank/Carry/Bruiser/AP/Support.\n\nThere are plenty of combinations and when you've played a few games it's pretty quickly obvious how mixups and basics usually go. APs tend to suffer to tanks a lot more (if there are 2 APs) (Heavily offensive teams usually suffer to sieging/wave clearing more and in some cases split pushing).\n\nBruisers excel at wave clearing and pushing in a lot of ways so at least having a bruiser and a carry works well as a baseline for strategies (offtank top, tank top or semi-defensive top) although tops can vary a lot and still be effective at this (sort of situational though).\n\nIf you sat there and did the maths you'd probably come to a baseline composition of 1 Tank, 1 AP, 1 AD, 1 Support and a Jungler that works well with these which would probably be a bruiser if you had a tank top or a tank if you had a bruiser top as support/carry is a nice combo and usually works better than a tank, carries bot solo are food, bots near dragon so they can get to it quickly and easily plus mid is near blue buff so makes sense for APs and this is probably the basis for the EUW meta which is basically global now (The current ADC/Support/AP/Solo Top/Jungler was popularized on EUW servers and swept to NA and the other servers and we were NA so we basically ended up doing it too.\n\nOther stategies and micro-strategies arose and currently there are a lot of lane swaps to top and this season things will probably change a fair bit - but the problem of a meta is that it is self-enforcing once it comes about as people tend to stick to it rather than experiment so even when there is room for improvement it often takes a long time for things to change and tbh this worlds was probably the first that was closed to balanced; regular bans show common knowledge of power levels and popularity and a lot more of it was about skill and strategy than the random Chaos that pro play used to be however I guess it's up to the person to decide how they feel about this and/or whether they agree or not but this is what I think anyway and I think it will continue (as I consider it improved) to improve.","replies":[]}]}
