Just let us see other summoners champions in their profile. That way we can see what champions they have unlocked and their mastery level with them because currently you can only see the top 3 champs and progressing champs of a player which means if they have more than 3 level 5 mastered champs they aren&#039;t shown off. Just thought there isn&#039;t much point of mastering a bunch of champs if people only see you have mastered 3. Maybe I am alone but I would really like this.","replies":[]}
