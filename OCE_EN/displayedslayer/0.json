So whenever i fight someone on league of legends my abilities do very little damage and it takes about 20 hits to actually kill someone as for them they kill me in 3 hits. Iv tried many champions but still they all do very little damage. People in game call me dipshit since i dont kill anyone and often feed the enemy. Anyone know why this happens?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-12-17T09:26:19.807+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't building any damage items.

Build damage items, if you're playing a mage, build ability power, if you're playing an ADC (attack damage carry) build Attack Damage\n2. Go watch some youtubers to find out how to play\n3. Don't lose faith, the game is not easy, and its not beginner friendly, just learn how to play, it takes time and effort","replies":[]}]}
