I was Gold 2 at the end of season 4, was place in Gold 2 and I have been climbing since then. As stated in the title, I am a jungle main, however I can play all roles if needed.\n\nI am comfortable on nearly all jungle champions. Currently, my go-to junglers include {{champion:113}} , {{champion:254}} , {{champion:54}} , {{champion:106}} , {{champion:76}} , {{champion:59}} and {{champion:64}} .\n\nI have access to Skype and TeamSpeak, and if needed I can get another form of communication. I am 16 years old, and I can play 2-3 hours on a weekday and 5-6 hours on a weekend. I am very positive in game and I am always willing to learn. The team I am looking for would be one that is serious when it comes down to it, but can have a good time as well.\n\nIf interested, my IGN is **Satanic Chicken**. Feel free to add me if you wish to discuss details.\n\nEdit: Won promotion series to Plat 2","replies":[{"poster":"Street","date":"2015-04-09T12:36:26.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, if you would be interested in creating a team here is a link to my post:\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/smxWnEHv-gold-1-junglertopmid-lft\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nI am currently still patching so can't add your ign yet :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sataníc","date":"2015-04-10T02:20:38.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds good.
