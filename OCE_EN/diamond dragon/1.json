Try a different role or a champion you don't normally play.\n\nPersonally, I find when I'm in such ruts that I'm playing purely reactively rather than actively. basically playing on auto-pilot. Playing a different role or champion helps to get me out of that auto-pilot mode and back to actively participating.\n\nLosing on your main can also bad real bad for morale cause you feel like you should be better, where losing on an off role/champ is just a learning experience, so I find switching things up helps with that aspect too.","replies":[]}]}
