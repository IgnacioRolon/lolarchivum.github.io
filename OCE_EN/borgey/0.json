I got notified by friends that my nickname had been changed in my LoL account which was weird because I never changed my name, so when I had the time, I logged in and did an account recovery, I changed the name back and started playing like normal. About a week after that I got a perma ban for this account and explained the situation to the mods, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nI had asked the mods to check the location of the logs to show that it wasn't me that had logged in at the time, but they weren't budging on the Perma ban or adding any information to what happened.\r\n\r\nAfter about 2 weeks of fighting the appeal I just gave up, so I haven't been around since then. Normally i'd just make another account and move on, but my account was from the start of LoL and I put alot of $$ in it at the time. Afew of my friends said that I should bring it up again in the forum to see what the mods could do or any insight that I could have to fix my account. So I figured i'd try to appeal again.\r\n\r\n-Borgey","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-13T03:25:50.699+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to appeal again, then Player Support is where to go: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nTime is probably going to work against you here though. Without knowing all the details, there are a few reasons they wouldn't return the account in that scenario, some justified, some probably a result of old policies.\n\nFor example, if you had ever shared the account, or were not the original owner of the account, that will often prevent recovery in circumstances such as yours.\n\nEither way, take it up with support and see what can be done.","replies":[]}]}
