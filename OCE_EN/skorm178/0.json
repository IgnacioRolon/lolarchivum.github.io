The same thing happens if I attempt to open the LoLLauncher.exe in the RADS section.\r\nIf I run LoLPatcher.exe directly, the patcher will open but will always say Calculating Differences with one file scanning, will never complete and eventually crash to Bug Splat.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried reinstalling League, deleting the lolpatcher folder in RADS, attempting to repair when I run the patcher, disabling firewall and all anti-virus software.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:27:38.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're on Windows, but which version?
