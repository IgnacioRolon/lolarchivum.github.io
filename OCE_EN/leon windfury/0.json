I just remeber combo's like this from dynasty warriors #goodtimes\r\n\r\nThanks for your time,\r\n\r\nMagerburn","replies":[{"poster":"MAMASWAN","date":"2015-08-29T10:13:18.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are a list of tricks with crescent sweep:\n\n--Ult flash (similar to Lee sin's Kick flash) gives your oponent very little time to react while avoiding any downtime\n-_Dragon's Breath:___E onto minion near target to slow them then Ult flash them into your tower or your team\n-Autoattck a minion/ward/structure/champion to reset passive and ult the enemy away\n-Position yourself so that you can ult the enemy over the wall when escaping. This is much more effective than simply ulting the enemy back randomly, but is hard to pull off\n-Use ult to cancel gap closes (E.G. resonating strike). This is extremely difficult to full off.\n-Ward mid ult animation to cancel the recoil animation of the ult (And thus animation cancelling). This trick is extremely useful to cancel gap closes.\n-Use ''Typhoon'' in combination with flash to isolate a target and assassinate them (This is extremely useful for escaping). One very important trick is to Ult an enemy into your tower and E them to escape the enemy team and get a kill.\n-Use R mid E to cancel any downtime (R will activate as soon as you reach your target){{champion:5}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-24T16:12:34.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most champions already have inbuilt combos just gotta be a tricky lad","replies":[]},{"poster":"awsumlad","date":"2015-03-23T23:16:54.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would not work as they would have to change the interaction they already have with his ult/passive which means whoever he last auto attacked or E'd will not be knocked away, so the combo you are taking about wouldnt be able to be done in 1v1 situations since whoever he knocks up with q will have the passive applied. I think if they changed the ult passive interaction it should still only work on champs that xin knocks up himself or it would be massively OP in team fights situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-23T03:45:32.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is fine as is what you should be thinking about is how xin can use his ult to combo with others.\nLike bard ult I have had a bard on my team he ults I ult 3 of them into his ult and this wasn't planned even though we were using comms","replies":[]}]}
