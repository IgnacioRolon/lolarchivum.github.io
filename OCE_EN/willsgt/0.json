Urgot is niche pick but can be played mid/top or ADC against certain champions.\n\nRiot don't really know what to do with Yorick, that much is certain.\n\nEDIT: http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/08/red-post-collection-august-10th-patch.html","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-16T04:04:23.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your right about poppy they sed that poppy and taric are to get a rework first in that order about the same time too as for yorick he is gona be don't some time early next year","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-17T11:15:32.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're reworking one trick ponies and adding hugely diverse Champions.\n\nThe old Fiora just autos and ultis - that's her whole life story.\n\nThe old Garen just Q's and E's then walks away then Q's and E's then walks away then Q's and E's then R's.\n\nDarius just ran around mashing Q on people then tried to grab them or get stacks on them and ulti them;\n\nThey added Diversity to these Champions;\n\nPoppy has so much in her kit it's beyond a Joke - Damage >10% current health reduced by 50% - Invulnerability to 4 Champions and their CC's plus % bonus damage, AD and AP scaling; % Current HP damage, a stun, a dash; Stat boost on autos or instantly boosted and a move speed steroid - all in all a ridiculously hard Champion to balance hence they have given her like 1 Stat change since her release despite her falling out of favour and probably did so to look at her kit as a whole later in a diverse update that puts her in a good spot, rather than a few nerfs/buffs or w/e that will lead to her being a monster again or will fail to tackle the correct issue which is making her a 50-50 Champion.\n\nYorick is similary hard to balance because his power spikes are all over the place which is why he too was just nerfed shortly after release and left because he needs a thorough update and Urgot is similarly hard to balance because of how diverse he is so all in all 2 of them (Poppy and Urgot) were left because of how diverse they are and hence hard to balance and the other has power spikes all over the place and I'm pretty sure - seeing as the majority of what Riot does is add interest and diversity to the League - they would rather leave a Champion intact and put them on a priority 3 and add new Champions with a priority 8;\n\nAll 3 of them are still playable although Urgot and Yorick aren't quite as good as they used to be and Poppy is difficult to play but can still perform reasonably well - because they are still \"entities\" and have so much diversity and are still played and adding interest is Riots #1 priority - adding content creates for a more fun game than simply balancing does - because that's literally what a rework to a Champion is- a balance change; while adding a bit of diversity - and a more Chaotic game is better than a simple click war - the more diversity, the more randomness, learning, chaos and fun the game is - while balancing is keeping it under wraps so things aren't chaoticly ordered where power figures rise to monstrous levels and to keep it chaotic and always keep you in new and interesting situations new Champs are added and as a less important priority to Riot IMO - Champions that have fallen off in a lot of ways are updated but keep to their style to some extent while being made more chaotic so as to be floated back to that 50% mark eventually and as the game tumbles forwards keeping fresh and new, the outliers that fall behind are given a bump back up every so often so that while it is constantly new and Changing; there are still familiar faces on the frontlines of the struggle for runeterran glory.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-09-17T08:43:51.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Different people working on them.\n\nand $$$$$","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T22:36:20.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rarely see any of those champs but I think I read up somewhere about a Poppy, Ryze and Yorick rework in the works from one of the rioters that work in the champion design team on the forums.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-16T14:38:13.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because those champs are protected by the fact so little people play them that a rework would only attract people to play the champion (as if it were a new champ release), thus wasting time by having haters give non-constructive criticism on the boards, while not giving as much hype.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-16T14:31:47.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can understand Taric, if used correctly he can be devastating.\n\nBut Yorick and Urgot? I only play Yorick because he can push lanes extremely easily early game, but with no real escape you must either utilise his early game or suffer late game.
