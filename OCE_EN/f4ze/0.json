If you see his current stats, he no longer plays Jungle or any of the champs the Booster used. \n\nIf you do see him in any of your games do not overestimate him, he may have the Diamond border and icon but his skills are High Bronze at the most.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-27T05:42:45.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy just salty cause this guy climbed and he can’t","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-12-27T10:34:46.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1OrTcmPu,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-27T05:42:45.777+0000)\n>\n> This guy just salty cause this guy climbed and he can’t\n\nHaha, im Salty to...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-27T02:07:44.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow I know name removed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mrsandwich","date":"2018-01-19T16:14:53.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think i just played with this guy, name was [name removed]\nhe is bronze 5 2LP in flex queue at the moment and he was 2017 diamond border and icon","replies":[]}]}
