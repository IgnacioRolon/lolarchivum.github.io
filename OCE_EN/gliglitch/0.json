After all, they just released a patch which resets your sound configuration. Maybe it's an artifact of that.\n\nAre you still getting this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"gliglitch","date":"2015-01-30T04:54:56.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"out of interest where is the setting to make all mouse clicks register? :P interesting addition to it, was just playing thresh (the only champion i dont smartcast all spells on) and when manually casting the left click wasnt registering either, and ive checked all settings anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-31T02:52:05.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The clicks for the mouse are not normally configurable in League of Legends. The only thing you can really change with them is what happens when you press Ctrl, Alt or Shift with them.\n\nI did a bit of research, and found this:\n\n>Navigate to your config folder and open input (League of Legends/Config/input)\nAdd in the following lines of code:\n\n>[GameEvents]\nevtPlayerMoveClick=[Button 1]\nevtPlayerSelectClick=[Button 2]\n\n>If [GameEvents] already exists, just add the last two lines below it (That would be if you already have changed current keybindings inside of the game).\n\n>There you go.\nRight click is now left click, and vice versa.\nSo for all of you who want to left click attack move and right click select items, have at it!\n\nQuoted from Riot Morgageddon about one year ago.
