She just isn't flavour of the month anymore. She doesn't really need to be changed.\n\nAlso a super long range ignite? LOL you know how many times im just out of reach of ignite and they get under their tower?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-29T12:15:22.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea. Nidalee's spear has a huge range though, and stuff like this would need to be implemented for a lot of characters for it to be balanced. I imagine mages would be able to pop exhaust on single target spells?","replies":[]}]}
