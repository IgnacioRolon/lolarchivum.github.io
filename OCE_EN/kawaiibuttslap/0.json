It does affect my experience because i just want to jump in and have a casual game but i&#039;m getting teammates that just aren&#039;t as good as my opponents. I get people raging almost every game for small, irrational things, and most of the time they lose lane. Long story short, i just think that the way normal games are found and matched is skewed against me. Is it due to factors such as my win-loss ratio in normals? even so, my teammates should be equal ranks to my opponents.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T12:35:35.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KawaiiButtSlap,\n\nHere's what Lyte had to say about the matchmaking system:\n> The matchmaker's goal and purpose is not to force 50% winrate on players; in fact, the goal of a matchmaker is perfect prediction--it should be able to predict the expected win percentage for teams in every game, regardless of which skill level players are matched.\n\nMatchmaking's goal is to give everyone a close match and put people together such that the win percentages are close/balanced. And as you know, ranks have no effect on normals matchmaking. Diamond players could lose all of their normal games because they want to practice various champions that they don't play in ranked, and the Gold players could be an ADC main who literally doesn't play any other role. While it's frustrating to lose, just keep playing your best and you'll end up at that perfect prediction mark.","replies":[]}]}
