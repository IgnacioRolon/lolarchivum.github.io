Until the abuse cases can be mitigated at the very least, something like this will never happen, since the cost to players and to the overall health of matchmaking would be higher with such a thing in place than it is now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeastKiwi Nz","date":"2018-08-31T07:09:03.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes i agree i have had this same problem i think riot made the surrender vote at 5mins due to afk but if someone afks after that its gg your LP i have also had net troubles and DC before game but i always come back say after 5mins and my team has not surrenderd i play a 40min game and my team win even though i dced at the start i loose LP even though i have reconected and helped the team to victory wish is unfair on my part as the team had multiple chances to surrender","replies":[]},{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-08-15T04:03:43.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I dont believe that you shouldn't lose any LP because of an AFK, I think more should be done about it. It sounds good in theory to not lose any LP as a result of an AFK, It can be highly abusable. Maybe another way to compensate for leavers ingame could be a reduced amount of LP lost or maybe an LP boost for the next game if you win. It's a very difficult situation to deal with for riot but I am still hopeful","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2018-08-15T08:32:33.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I know what you mean regarding abuse - a reduce LP lost could be good. I was thinking more on the lines of... if someone went AFK for more than 50% of the game-time then that's when this kicks in, and the person that leaves loses the full LP","replies":[]}]}]}
