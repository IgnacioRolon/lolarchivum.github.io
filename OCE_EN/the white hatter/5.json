We&#039;re currently 4 ( Supp/ADC/Top/Mid) and we&#039;re looking for someone who likes playing jungle and being a team member rather than a lone wolf. \nOur Mid can jungle and would be ok to swap mains if needed, and top and adc know how to jungle as well, but they main the other positions, so the odd swap here and there is also possible but they do main those lanes.\n\nContact me IG or via here and we can set up for a few games to see the chemistry with the whole fam - \n\nWe play pretty much every night (Sydney time) and some of the guys also play earlier/later cuz they live in perth and qld. We use discord and love to talk sht while playing btw. \n\nOh, and should not be homophobe/racist/supertoxic!!!!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-01T01:04:24.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait are you all gay?
