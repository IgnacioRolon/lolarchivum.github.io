I understand people getting frustrated and telling other players off in ranked because its the real deal. However, I have found that there are more people who flame other players in norms other than ranked! It is unbelievable how people can have the nerve to tell someone off when you&#039;ve never even met your teammate before and put them down and make them feel bad and do shit the whole game. \r\n\r\nNow, regarding reporting players for their shitty behaviour in PvP games, where do the reports go? Does anyone even bother to check the report? I mean there are so many people out there that keep flaming and thinking they can say whatever they want whenever they want and riot isnt doing anything about it. Do they not care about the behaviour of their playerbase? Its horrible even though its &quot;a game&quot; and we&#039;re here to &quot;enjoy ourselves&quot;, not put up with other people shit that they have with you.\r\n\r\nSo the real question is... What happens when players get reported? and why is no action taken against those who keep &quot;terrorising&quot; the rift? You could call its cyber bullying because they do it pretty much every game.                                                                                                                         {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gerk","date":"2017-07-27T13:12:06.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets be honest, what most of you snowflakes call bullying, other people call teaching or sometimes even conversing.

Because thats the ONLY time I receive feedback. I've reported intent feeders and griefers countless times and NEVER received feedback regarding the outcome. Not ever!\n\nAlso that brings me to another question. Since the retarded reporting system cannot detect between someone intent feeding or simply having  a bad game, does that mean if you report them for feeding etc you're report weighting is decreased? As in it thinks you're phantom reporting?\n\nI'd very much like to know the answer to this as it must be pretty fucking complicated considering it's an automated system. My guess is that it doesn't work at all, only in extreme cases such as Tyler1 and I'm sure a Riot staff member would have had a hand in his ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-07-27T05:36:23.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont think its automated, I think theres admins actually reviewing the report....\n\nYes, i only report verbal abuse... because only 3 times out 1 year i have seen intentional feeding...\n\nEvery other time its just a bad player who cant do much but dying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-07-25T11:35:57.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The nature of a moba is you meet random, and rarely ever see them again.

Moba games like league, helping 1 dude that feed during your game is from good will, but pointless. \n\nSo, it easy for team mate to vent their anger on the underperforming player, and yes some take it too far \"personal insult etc..\"; But those people get 14days ban to permaban very fast, as their reports racking up way faster then a guy that rage out about ingame problems; Example, calling some 1 a nub for having certain items, or play badly. \n\nI think aslong as the conversation strictly kept to ingame contents, it is fine to rage.","replies":[]}]}
