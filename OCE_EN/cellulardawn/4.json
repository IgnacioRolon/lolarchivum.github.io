I then watched a bunch of videos on gameplay and other things like that. So after the patch 7.14 release that I waited 4 hours in the morning for, he was no where to be found, but, along with every new champion that will be released, they are usually seen in the &#039;Collections&#039; tab.\n\nCollection > Search > Kayn \n\nKayns data is all there but he is inaccessible in game as he is no where to be found in store. When this happens it usually means the champ is going to be released soon, but i want to know how soon. How many days? Weeks?\n\nPlease help!\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Saintphoenix","date":"2017-07-12T09:00:42.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im guessing you are new to league?(not flaming) its usually anything from half a day to 2 days, not normally any longer unless something major bugs out, my issue was that his unlock button was lit up and i spent 3 champion permanents to get him but hes not available","replies":[{"poster":"Known","date":"2017-07-12T09:15:09.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saintphoenix,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=Ql6Kgva0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-12T09:00:42.087+0000)\n>\n> Im guessing you are new to league?(not flaming) its usually anything from half a day to 2 days, not normally any longer unless something major bugs out, my issue was that his unlock button was lit up and i spent 3 champion permanents to get him but hes not available\n\nYou will know when he is released because you will see people in your friend's list playing him but there will also be a second patch that will mean he is available to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Saintphoenix","date":"2017-07-12T09:29:02.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how the game works, just his button was lit up","replies":[{"poster":"Known","date":"2017-07-12T09:33:02.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Saintphoenix,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=Ql6Kgva0,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2017-07-12T09:29:02.170+0000)\n>\n> I know how the game works, just his button was lit up\n\nThey put the champions into the game but they are disabled until later which is probably why you thought he was available","replies":[{"poster":"Saintphoenix","date":"2017-07-12T11:14:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well no, its normally they button is grayed but today it wasnt and you could click it but it takes you to a blank page and thats not normal at all","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
