But at the moment when I got in to loading, it changed to Grasp of the Undying automatically so I thought it was an error that has came out after recent patch. So I tried like 10 times to settle that issue in custom game and practice game and normal, but I can not find what&#039;s problem now. I want to ask you guys that is this issue only happening to me or to you guys. Also I hope that Riot may help me with this.\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n{{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-06T03:06:03.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't take Aftershock on Kha'Zix because he can't proc it, in the same way it switches slightly magical boots on Cass to perfect timing because she can't wear boots.","replies":[{"poster":"Slide away","date":"2019-01-06T07:40:08.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, now I see the reason.","replies":[]}]}]}
