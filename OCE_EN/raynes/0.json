I was wondering if league of legends will ever see such a film made as the lore we have is soo in depth and very interesting with many unique theories based on them. To have a movie about it would be great in my opinion. Currently all we have is small teasers which are great but a movie based on lore would be amazing.\r\n\r\nYour Opinions.\r\nRioters please do tell if the game would ever develop something of this type or if you have considered it.\r\nThanks","replies":[]}
