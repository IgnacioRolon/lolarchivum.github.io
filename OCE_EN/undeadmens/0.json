Only when you need to help them secure objectives e.g. towers, dragon, baron ect... or when you see an opportunity to TP gank otherwise you can always roam mid when your ult is up but 9x/10 you just end up wasting your time. \n\nOn Malphite Top you typically want to use these runes: \nAD red's, \nArmor yellow's, \nMagic Resists Per Level Blue's and \nMovement Speed Quints.\n\nWith Masteries you typically want to go 4/23/3, \nputting your 4 offensive points into CDR (Cooldown reduction) \nand 3 utility points into MS (Movement speed), \nthe 23 defensive points are pretty obvious. \n\nYou want to build Malphite tank (AD Malphite sucks and AP Malphite deals a lot of damage but is super squish and loses against most top laners) \nWhen you're laning against an AD top laner ALWAYS get Frozen Heart first, why? because it works extremely well with Malphites E and basically shuts down champions that rely on Auto Attacks to deal damage, if you're laning against an AP champion Spirit Visage is the best way to start and then build accordingly, like most builds it really does depend on the matchup and who the biggest threat is on the enemy team so it essentially all comes down to your knowledge of the game, knowing what items work well with your champion and also what works best against your opponents. \n\nHere are the items that work well on tank Malphite:\n\nArmor Items: \n{{item:3047}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} \n\nMagic Resist Items: \n{{item:3111}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3102}} \n\nOptional Items: \n{{item:3190}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3800}} \n\nHope that helps, if not you can always look up an in depth guide.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-14T01:06:53.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you build Malphite for AD.

What is the primary damage source of their Top and Jungle (maybe even consider their midlaner)\nIf their top and jungle are primarily AP then I look to build a abyssal if I am ahead or a spirit visage if I am even or behind\nIf their top and jungle are primarily AD I look to go randuins OR sunfire into a frozen heart\nIf its a mix I build randuins or sunfire into a spirit visage then frozen heart\n\nA few general tips Malphite is inherently tanky thanks to his W (which gives him % bonus armour) AND E (which reduces atk speed of opponents hit) Building a combination of armour and MR and health is always the most effective way to be a tank.\n\nHe also has decent AP ratios and most of his damage is Magic so getting Abyssal can boost your threat levels and really help you soften up the enemy teams back line when you ult in\n\nUsually I always look to roam when I have ult, whether thats TPing bot or just running down to mid. Malphites ultimate is devastating in team fights and during ganks. Make use of it to get kills and most importantly objectives after the kills.\n\nHope that helps","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-08-14T00:31:00.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I only play him against heavy AD teams, And I always build armor, with a sunfire  thorns etc.. the other team normally end up killing themself on you this way.
