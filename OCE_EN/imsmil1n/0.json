That was bad enough but because of Azir being naturally squishy he cant even get away now because along with his movement speed being lowered his combo gap closer cant go as far as it used to because of this patch. \r\nI thought that he did need a slight cap on his &#039;Q&#039; but not as much as riot have done. \r\nI propose the make his &#039;Q&#039; a bit further range so you can evade unlucky battles and put up his movement speed to what it originally was because\r\nhe now has the power of Bard at level 1 -_-{{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-02T19:47:15.135+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes fine, I've played him almost every day since he was released, including a lot yesterday (patch day) and he is still fucking strong! i have no idea what you are talking about with his Q, the only thing they changed on it in this patch was that multiple soldiers hitting enemies would not apply extra damage or extra slow, there is nothing about a cap on how far they could move??\nif you're referring to the 'the closest soldier will always take the middle position, soldiers will always take the closest position regardless of distance' change in 5.16 that was actually a MAJOR buff.\n\nand tbh i thought the movement speed nerf would affect him more than it did. he still has the best disengage, a huge distance dash, and a slow, and has the same speed as anivia who has no dashes at all, so he's pretty well off. his knock up is missed a bit, but I've realised he didn't really need it.\nhe is still strong and i think we will see further nerfs in the future, and I'm fine with that, as long as i keep playing him. even if they nerf him to shit he will always be viable (they kinda have to make sure champs can always be played) so theres nothing to complain about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-02T11:38:44.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir isn't meant to be powerful at level 1. He's meant to be powerful at 3, 6, 11 and 16, and have little time frames where he can seriously mess up the enemy by taking advantage of his powerspikes.\n\nAnyway, his ult is ridiculous in disengage, his soldiers give him an auto attack range longer than a whole lot of abilities, and he's a golden bird. What's not to like about this guy even with a few nerfs","replies":[{"poster":"imsmilin","date":"2015-09-02T11:57:15.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know hes not meant to be powerful at level 1 but he now isn't powerful at all.
