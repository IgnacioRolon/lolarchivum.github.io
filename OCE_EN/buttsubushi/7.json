With the upcoming Chroma for IP sale &quot;sometime in spring&quot; (Autumn for OCE) I thought it would be a good time to let others use this spreadsheet I made. Basically just edit the sheet with how much IP you have and which champs and skins you own, and it can tell you how many Chromas you can buy when they go on sale, how many of the Chromas are available to you (that you own the champ and skin for) and a bunch of other statistics like how much more IP you need and your %age of the way there. \r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t have excel, you can just upload it to google docs and convert it.\r\n\r\nAlso I made a Champion Mastery Score one ages ago and isn&#039;t as useful except for those [I&#039;M GONNA COMPLETE LEAGUE OF LEGENDS](https://youtu.be/cmNhq8Jvf8k) types.","replies":[]}
