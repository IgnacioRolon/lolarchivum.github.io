Does Riot not care at all? Like do they generally think it is OK to have people setting up scripts that will play the game for them start to finish then re-queue? Do they have some deal with websites that buy/sell/market summoner accounts? Or some Chinese programmers?\n\nIf you have no idea wtf I&#039;m going on about, I made a thread back on the old forums A DAY before boards was released, and there were bucket loads of &quot;JZ _____&quot; prefixed summoner accounts spamming Co vs AI and ARAM. Back then they only took Ghost and Heal, they always went mid, they use summoners and spells randomly, and only chose free rotation champs. Now some of the scripts send them alternating between top, mid and bot, and they start with boots most of the time.\n\n\n\nHere is just are some of those threads others STARTED IN 2014:\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=87704\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=87639\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=87441\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=87684\n\nSomeone sent a support ticket and Riot said they were investigating the issue. \nONE YEAR AGO.\nSo in that time, nothing seems to have changed. Around when I play by myself around 5am, that is all the type of players I get when I just want to try out champs with less pressure. It is harder to win one of these games then a ranked game with 2 afkers unless you are playing Katarina or Yasuo.\n\nThis is bloody disgraceful. ONE WHOLE YEAR.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-04T06:37:56.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as there is a market for new, pre-leveled accounts, there will always be bots.
