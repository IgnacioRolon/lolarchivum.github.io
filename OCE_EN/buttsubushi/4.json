Are there any hot-fix to make them bigger (like editing some .ini or .xml files) or are mod or add-on that will fix this??\r\n\r\nThe reason I don&#039;t want to change the resolution is because I need to use borderless mode to get the LSI overlay working. I know if i go fullscreen and run it at 1080p it will be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-06T12:02:14.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's possible to make them any bigger than it is, or maybe it's still possible but editing the game file might be a little dangerous since you won't know if Riot counts that as illegal.\n\nSo I guess for LoL you need to tune down your resolution to play properly, kinda sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2015-05-06T15:55:34.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are allowed to mod league, just not with anything that gives an unfair advantage.
