So to get more people to play this queue and hopefully have better more competitive games, I&#039;ve put together a rundown on the TT meta, good and bad champs, and key differences from 5v5. If you are _really_ into reading massive textbooks you should check out [the 3v3 Bible on the shadowisles.com](http://www.theshadowisles.com/3v3-bible) which is basically has been summarized here.\r\n\r\nSo first thing the meta, which there are 2 different types of teams you can (and should) run:\r\n1) Support/ADC Meta\r\n2) Jungle Meta\r\n\r\nA typical Support Meta team will look something like this:\r\n{{champion:222}}~{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:4}} Clears three camps, then going top\r\n{{champion:57}}~{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:4}} Leashes one camp, then going top\r\n{{champion:63}}~{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:4}} Going bot\r\n\r\nAnd a typical Jungle Meta team would be:\r\n{{champion:58}}~{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:4}} Going top\r\n{{champion:154}}~{{summoner:11}} {{summoner:4}} Jungling\r\n{{champion:134}}~{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:4}} Going bot\r\n\r\nAny champ can be played in 3v3, [but the best champs in each position from patch to patch are updated here ](http://www.theshadowisles.com/tier-lists-c24vq)\r\n\r\nMost say that the support meta is the stronger of the two overall, and Jungle meta is only strong early from about levels 1-6, and Support is stonger after that since the ADC has both top and Jungle farm and can outdamage everyone while the support protects them. However very late game Jungle meta is a little stronger since they have 3 damage dealers with max items and Support has only 2 damage dealers and the support themselves are usually underfarmed and underleveled.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:11}}\r\nEach team _definitely_ needs smite to secure Vilemaw since getting it makes pushing even easier than Baron on SR, and also makes it easier to take the enemies shrine. Support teams are usually stronger with Vilemaw than Jungle, since the ADC can siege more safely.\r\n\r\nAlters\r\nYou can recall on an alter as you capture it, as long as you don&#039;t immediately start recalling has you touch the platform, either wait 0.25 seconds or move to the center then recall. Generally this is the safest way to take the enemies alter.\r\n\r\n_Copied straight from the 3v3 Bible:_\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Jungle Camps **\r\nSpawn time - 1:35\r\nRespawn timer - 1:15\r\nTip: The camp that you cleared first normally respawns around 3:00 along with the altar activating. \r\n\r\n**Vilemaw**\r\nSpawn time - 10:00\r\nRespawn timer - 6:00\r\nBuff - 3:00 / 3:27 with Runic Affinity\r\nTip : If you miss the timer of when vilemaw was killed, simply add 3 minutes to when the buff expires to know when it will spawn again (type this timer in chat)\r\n\r\n**Health Relic**\r\nSpawn time - 3:00 (same as altars)\r\nRespawn timer - 1:30 \r\nTip: When relic is taken, immediately type &ldquo;relic&rdquo; or &ldquo;health&rdquo; or &ldquo;+&rdquo; in the chat. Then you can look at the time stamp and add 1:30 to know when it respawns\r\nTip: The relic has global vision, meaning that when either team takes it the icon will be removed from the map essentially revealing the person who took it.\r\n\r\n**Altars**\r\nUnlocks at - 3:00 (Same as Health Relic)\r\nLocks for - 1:30 once captured\r\nCapture time - 8 seconds \r\nTip: If you plan on recalling while the altar isn&rsquo;t captured by your team, it is always time efficient to recall on it. Make sure you stand on it for 0.25 seconds before starting your recall or you will back before it is fully captured.\r\nTip: Both altars have global vision even before they are captured, meaning that you will be able to see the altar being captured through fog of war.\r\n\r\n**Summoners**\r\nFlash        5:00 / 4:15 - with Insight master (-15% cooldown)\r\nHeal        4:00 / 3:24\r\nExhaust     3:30 / 2:59\r\nIgnite         3:30 / 2:59\r\nSmite         1:15 / 1:04\r\nCleanse     3:30 / 2:59\r\nBarrier     3:30 / 2:59\r\n\r\n**General**\r\nMinions meet at 1:37\r\nMinion waves spawn every 30 seconds\r\nCannon minions spawn every 3rd wave\r\nInhibitor respawns 5:00 after being destroyed\r\nSurrender time is 15:00\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------","replies":[{"poster":"traloop","date":"2016-12-27T03:27:41.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome guide! I think I might get into 3v3s. I was just wondering; how do builds work? Do you build differently in this game mode as the items/ playstyle are completely different?","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-12-27T08:56:26.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A couple of items are different: e.g. {{item:3089}}  + {{item:3157}}  are combined into a weaker item {{item:3090}} for this map to try and balance the faster game time, and since you start with 850g instead of 500g.\nSome odd items like {{item:3137}} which is a {{item:3139}} but gives attack speed.\nRiot doesn't really keep items up to date on this mode, and sometimes some broken items enter the map, like back in the Spirit of the Ancient Golem days were you could build one of the odd jungle item components Quill Coat which allowed you to place wards! And there was no way to sweep for them!\n\nGenerally item builds are the same on here as SR and maybe ARAM, only difference is starting items which can be {{item:1055}} +{{item:1041}}  for an ADC, {{item:1054}} +{{item:1001}}  for bruisers, and {{item:1056}} +{{item:1001}} for mages. The more popular champs and playstyle seem to be ones who can 1v1 and 1v2 and 2v2 well.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2017-01-06T00:49:27.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Buttsubushi,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=VKqpUoAs,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-27T08:56:26.610+0000)\n\n> Some odd items like {{item:3137}} which is a {{item:3139}} but gives attack speed.\n\nDervish blade was removed a while back when Riot brought in the B.F.
