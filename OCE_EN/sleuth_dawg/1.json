Thankyou.\r\n\r\nI truly appreciate this new report system, it is a more more complex and defined way of showing that we disliked a certain players behaviour.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of all trolls, I would like to thankyou that it does absolutely nothing. That i can continue to troll for as long as I like and say whatever I want.\r\nI really like how it seems like its doing more but really its just a shinier piece of shit that does nothing. Thankyou for allowing trolls with multiple accounts to keep on keeping on. xoxo love all trolls everywhere &lt;3","replies":[]}
