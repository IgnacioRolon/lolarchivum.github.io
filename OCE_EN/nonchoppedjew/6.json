Kayle has a top tier winrate in toplane but that doesn't mean she lacks decent counterplay. She can't fight without her E up or even risk farming without it. She pushes lane super hard and lacks mobility of any kind, making her super vulnerable to ganks. Her level 1 is unparalleled for sure but after that she falls off until at least 25 minutes when she's able to stack a significant amount of on-hit damage and attack speed.\n\nRather than make a single-sentence post declaring that you have no clue how to deal with a 450 IP champ, how about researching her counters or just banning her.","replies":[{"poster":"nonchoppedjew","date":"2016-12-14T15:56:36.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cant ban every broken champ in the game","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-12-14T16:20:13.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kayles ult blocks dmg not cc so when you engage either burst her with cc before she can ult or cc her when she ults champs such as {{champion:122}} {{champion:420}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:150}} do really well against her but champs like {{champion:86}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:27}} will struggle against her as they lack the cc and dmg needed to 1v1 a kayle these champs are usually more useful in teamfights though as they can have a bigger impact anyway she has a 2% play rate with 55% win if it was 10%+ with that win rate then yeah something is wrong but just learn how to play against her","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-15T05:04:01.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol the only example lacking cc is garen","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-15T12:38:28.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silence is a cc","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HierosGodhead","date":"2016-12-14T23:26:08.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think I've ever heard someone unironically say that Nautilus and Maokai lack cc, well done.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-15T02:48:04.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HierosGodhead,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=A5LtR4pq,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2016-12-14T23:26:08.446+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard someone unironically say that Nautilus and Maokai lack cc, well done.\n\ncough what hard cc does illaoi and yorick have cough","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-12-15T00:41:36.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the dmg like yeah they have high cc but that cc buts them at melee range and kayle shreds tanks also maokais cc is a snare so if he uses it rip naut can ult yeah but thats a waste of an ult","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-15T01:09:46.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all of those are pretty decent but actually statistically darius get's dicked on by kayle. Try {{champion:36}}  or {{champion:8}} instead. \n\nAnother of kayle's key weaknesses is she doesn't like short trades and she'll want to try to get as much e harass off as possible during laning phase since her abilities do consume a fair bit of mana and she needs to be able to zone to farm. Her combo is usually her q to slow you and then e all over your face as you run away and if you turn to allin her she ults. So mundo's cleavers or vladimirs blood drain both cause her a bit of trouble since they sustain really well and rush a spirit visage and piss her off and both of them have ways to avoid kayle setting up to kill them through mundo's cc reduction and vladimirs blood pool. \n\nBoth of them also have a surprising turn around and just run at you with alot of damage capability too, so kayle won't even be able to use the full duration of her ult safely since both mundo and vlad can just turn around and rush at you, even when you're under tower. Even when ahead, the durability and sheer difficulty in killing these champions means that it'll be very hard for kayle to snowball hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-14T17:10:54.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, Kayles strength is people don't know how to play against her..
