I&#039;ve read most of the storylines of all of the champions in League Of Legends, and I think they are amazing. So basically I&#039;m suggesting a new mode: Adventure Mode. So in that mode you are a champion of your own choice, and throughout the mode you have to face whatever is in your lore. I hope you guys do like the mode and if not I have made a poll.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nTony (ThanChemGio) in game","replies":[{"poster":"Nothing bots","date":"2016-08-10T01:39:27.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#i dont really care <3 make it or dont","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThanChemGio","date":"2016-08-09T10:16:58.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please reply to this post, and also can you guys help me with one thing: What do you guys think is the best champion for me? I like top lane, and Fighter/Tank role. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-09T10:47:37.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its an alright idea... I think it would be better as a spin-off kinda games series, maybe even Telltale could make it? Now THAT would be cool.\n\nPersonally, I don't think riot should make it as that would distract them from bigger things like updating the game, new skins, buff and nerfs etc. etc. It would also be a massive project.. your basically asking them to create 140 different games with different storylines (1 game per champion).\n\nAs for your query about top lane Fighter/Tanks, look no further! I have played many tanks and fighters and here are some of my favourites. Of course this is just opinionated, but my favourite tanks are Nasus, Gnar, and Hecarim. My favourite fighters are probably Riven, Fiora, Akali and Ekko.\n\nBest of luck with choosing a champ! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
