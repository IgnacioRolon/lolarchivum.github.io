{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-13T16:46:21.309+0000","title":"NZ Earthquakes. Fun & Games. Not.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I was in lobby for ranked just after midnight last night (NZ time) when the first earthquake struck causing me to drop power momentarily. Just before the power went out one of the other people in lobby said &quot;EARTHQUAKE!!&quot; to which I replied &quot;its not stopping&quot; followed by &quot;fuck&quot;. And then the power went out and I dc&#039;d. This meant I unintentionally dodged and have subsequently lost LP. Bugger. Can do without that! LP is hard to come by as it is without losing it through something I have zero control over. It probably also scared the shit out of my team mates in lobby; to have someone say that, and then just leave.\n\nHaven&#039;t played since. Haven&#039;t done much really except be glued to live updates and refreshing the GeoNet webpage every few minutes to get &#039;live&#039; data on further quakes. \n\nThat was over 5 hours ago. Since 12:02:56AM NZ time until now (5:25AM) there&#039;s been 14 earthquakes classed as &#039;severe&#039;, measuring over 5.5 on the Richter Scale, and 10 classed as &#039;strong&#039; with a reading of over 4.6 on the Richter Scale. In the last 45 minutes alone, up and down NZ from Christchurch in the middle fo the South Island, to Te Araroa in the north-east of the North Island, we&#039;ve had over 35 earthquakes... so we are averaging 10 every 15 minutes or so. For the last **5 and a half hours*. Seriously uncool. I have only felt 2-3 here at home (Hamilton, NZ) since the first one (the one that knocked out our power and me out of lobby) but nothing as major as that. That one struck in Hamner Springs in the South Island. That&#039;s a lineal distance of over 560 kilometers away from where I am and was felt as far north as Auckland, a further 100km away. \n\nI had no idea what was going on to begin with. I was just sitting, minding my own business, mentally cursing the fucking idiot who decided to pick TF as support (I guess I dodged a bullet there as well as a lobby) when my body started to kind of jiggle. Not a &#039;fatty-wobble&#039; kind of jiggle, more like what it felt like when my cat would be sitting at my feet and start to scratch behind its ear and knock my chair. A kind of mild rhythmic movement. But I looked and there was no cat. Then I wondered if I was imagining it, but nope I could see my body move and when I put my hands back on the desk they seemed to be moving too. Next thing to go through my mind was wondering if I was getting MS or Parkinsons or some bloody mental disorder that screws up balance and movement (omfg my mind goes strange places sometimes!) and that was when I looked over and noticed the water in my fishtanks sloshing about... 7 tropical fishtanks holding about 800 liters of water between them. That&#039;s a *lot* of sloshing! And *that* was when I realised what was going on and I just about sloshed something else myself. I stood and walked over to the tanks to check them when the gentle movement suddenly got a lot less gentle and I started to feel a lot less confusion as awareness and fear started to take over. I stuck my arm in the biggest of my tanks to break the water movement and had a hand on a 1.7 meter long wall tank (as if that would stop it coming off the wall... derp) when I heard the *bong!* sound telling me it was my turn to lock in my pick. So, derp me, bronze4lyf, I went back to my desk and sat down to lock in... because, ranked right. Srs shit. That&#039;s when I saw the other guy say &quot;EARTHQUAKE!!&quot; and I replied and then the power went *poof*. \n\nThe rolling went on for what seemed like forever after that even though it was only for a minute or so, which is still a long time for an earthquake, and I started to get seriously worried about my tanks as a couple had already lost a few liters of water over the sides. And then there was my wall tank that I&#039;m really attached to. But not attached to as it is the wall, thank fuck! I did not want anything to happen to it especially considering only a few days earlier I&#039;d had a &#039;vision&#039; of it coming off said wall. That minute or so of being inside a drunk house that was rocking and rolling was more than enough bloody time for me to know I did **not** like it, tyvm! \n\nI heard people talking outside my ranchslider and realised the quake had woken 3 of my flatmates who had come outside to escape the house (not me, nah uh, too busy worrying about fucking LoL and fish) so I went outside to commune with IRL humans. Let me tell you, fear *is* contagious, even when you&#039;re trying to be the calm logical one. The two girls were just frightened af and my brother was freaking out of the strange flashes of light he saw in the sky to the north as he came downstairs to go outside. That may or may not have been related to the quake but it coincidentally happened at the same time. I even found some clips of it on youtube (sheeeeit people are fast to upload stuff these days! there&#039;s already heaps of footage from lastnight) But the lights on top of the quake just made everything too spooky for my brother and he was like &quot;fuck this shit, we *never* get earthquakes in the Waikato, wtf is going on??!!&quot;. He has a 7 year old son too so he really had something to worry about. More than my fisktanks and &#039;bloody video game&#039; - his opinion, not mine.\n\nI&#039;ve been up all night so far and I&#039;d really like to have a game to take my mind off things because I sure as shit can&#039;t get to sleep!!! But you just don&#039;t know when or if another quake is going to hit so I&#039;m not going to risk queuing for one just yet game. Not fair on myself or teammates (if another strikes in the middle of a game and I dc). \n\nThe majority of NZ cities are on the coast and I&#039;m triple glad I live in one of the very few inland cities as there&#039;s been widespread evacuations due to the imminent and very real threat of tsunamis as the faultline that has caused this spate of quakes reaches over 100kms into the ocean. Also majorly uncool. Christchurch-specific Civil Defence says that waves of up to five metres high are still expected. In Kaikoura, the closest large town to the quake epicenter where the first tsunami waves hit, the tsunami warning remains in place until the high tide at 6AM today. \n\nI don&#039;t even want to contemplate the full extent of damage and injury caused in the last few hours here. Some of the pictures filtering through into the news websites now are bad enough. And those were taken at night with limited visibility. It will only be worse once daylight hits. I don&#039;t want to think of people being hurt like it&#039;s Chch all over again but so far there&#039;s only one reported fatality and that was due to a heart attack bought on the the first quake. Can&#039;t say I blame them.\n\nSo, this is not exactly what I had planned for tonight but I count myself lucky to still be here with all my possessions intact. I would however rather be doing anything other than having to sit passively and powerlessly though this. \n\nEven if it&#039;s only playing ranked in Bronze. \n\nGG Mother Earth, GG.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-13T21:41:24.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I hope everyones ok.\n\nChobi lives in NZ too, and they are ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-14T11:29:54.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're fine here too.

Must be a nice feeling, all safe and secure being a jafa, when other peoples lives are thrown into complete, and often permanent, disarray. And you sit there behind your keyboard and minimise it as a \"garden chair fell over ...ooooo\". \n\nI guess the seabed around Kaikoura, the area hardest hit by the quakes, that has risen by up to 2 meters in some places and naturally countered the effects of very real tsunami tidal surges means, in your eyes, it was only a \"2cm high wave\" and doesn't merit concern either. \n\nBest you change your attitude before karma sends something unpleasant to your doorstep because you're in dire need of a lesson in homegrown humility and compassion.","replies":[]}]}]}
