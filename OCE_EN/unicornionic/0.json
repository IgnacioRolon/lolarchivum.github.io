They were talking shit in the whole game, and I reported them for the verbal abuse reason, but after a while, I was reported as negative attitude.\r\n\r\nWhat is the fairness of reporting system？\r\n\r\nCan I say if I found 3 other players in the same team, can we  report any other players for any reason and that &#039;bad guy&#039; will be judged no matter the fact which he did or not?\r\n\r\n\r\nI see the patch updated lots of times, but does Riot really care the players feeling?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-27T00:55:56.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nYou can find out all about our player behaviour systems here - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nAnd below is an excerpt about how the reporting system works.\n\n> **Reporting**\n> \n> **What happens when you report someone?**\n> \n> When a player is reported, the full report is recorded and stored for analysis by our behavior systems, including information about the reporter and the game.\n> \n> Reports are used by the Instant Feedback System in the following way:\n> \n> Teammates or opponents of the offending player send reports and the system validates them to make sure they aren’t false\n> The system examines the case and determines whether the behaviour deserves rejection or punishment based on community-driven standards of behaviour\n> The system fires a reform card through email, sharing the chat log of the offending player (we scrub other players’ names and chat logs) and the punishment for the behaviour\n> Follow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished\n> You can read more about it in Lyte’s post: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing\n> \n> **Does Riot read every report?**\n> \n> Every report is analysed by our system. Reports and corresponding game chat logs are reviewed by our Player Support team when we are considering severe punishments such as permanent bans. We also regularly use comments from reports and logs to ensure the accuracy of our systems.\n> \n> **What about false reports?**\n> \n> When analysing reports, our systems look for behaviour patterns. Only consistent reports from reliable players will be enough to trigger a punishment. Players who attempt to abuse the system with false reports are flagged and their reports are ignored.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrMishu","date":"2015-11-13T11:05:27.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude i know exactly how you feel, was in a game with two people being rude, offensive and toxic, i got reported for saying \"idiot\" once coz they were being rude to my friend and i.
