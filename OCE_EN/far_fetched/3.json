When another player tries to invite me, they get the above issue. We've been trying to fix this all day, and are, as of yet, unable.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any issues,\r\ncurrent fixes are things like logging out and back in, client restarts, playing more games to try and force an update to my rank.\r\n\r\nAny advice is greatly appreciated, esp as the time for locking is drawing mighty close.","replies":[]}
