Was it to make her more viable as an ADC or as a solo laner? People just interpreted the text along side the patch notes differently and I wanted to see if either was the particular focus.\n\nSecondly, which was the main point of this post, was to give some feedback on the current status of Quinn in the game. I sent a message to Riot support under the feedback section and they politely directed to a different forum, and was then once again re-directed here by a well informed user. So I wanted to ask, although of course this is just one voice, what the chance of having at least some parts of Quinn&#039;s old kit back. Many people, including myself, found success with her in ranked ques, be it in top lane or directed more in the bot lane. There wasn&#039;t anything wrong with the way her kit worked and now that you have taken off her blind and made her one method for &#039;getting in the face&#039; of enemy ADCs as well as chase down/execute at the end of a fight it just seems like her charm has been seriously diminished. Right now it is hard to differentiate Quinn from Draven, whereas before it was always making a meaningful choice, whether you wanted to ult and try to get the final hit with the edge of your ult&#039;s execute.\n\nIf you want to shift her from being a top laner into more of a bot lane threat, maybe you could give her better teamfight/sieging by increasing her range and maybe even something which synergises with having a lane partner in the same way Kalista does. It just feels tragic that you are changing a champion kit which felt so fun to play. The number of miracle outplays using careful combination of Q/E/R in rapid succession over a wall to escape which we will never see again is somewhat tragic, considering her 3 second channel time. She also looses her potential to re-engage and turn a fight with careful planning/decision making and mechanical prowess.\n\nI beg, you please to at least consider bringing her old charm and play-style back into the game.\n\nKindest Regards,\nK Bell (Quinning Streak)\n\nP.S. On my previous post I had support from a few users as well, which hasn't translated across to this one.","replies":[{"poster":"JBOXES","date":"2015-11-21T22:11:21.788+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old Quinn- More burst damage, more offensive capabilities, decent roam potential would have to ult at crucial times for decision making, great duelist, more utility. Use to be top 3 early damage adcs making her a lane bully which compensated her short range. (Draven, Graves, Quinn).\n\nNew Quinn- Less damage and only decent damage over time, No cc or any kind of utility, not a great duelist, no good wave clear, easily beat in lane, still low range, greater roaming potential. \n\nSo from my understanding they Nerfed a lot of her Kit so she can be fast which she already was before, just now it has low cool down. They try to advertise her as a good split pusher but she honestly is not. Sure she can get to lanes fast, but her wave clear sucks and she cant really one versus one anyone, since lack of damage and utility from blind. She cant really pick off anyone out of place, again because of lack of dueling potential. You can be 5/0 and still lose to a 1/3 graves. Her ult is now high mana cost, delay set up time, and canceled if hit by any champs, slowed by minions. Before her ult was instant cast, and a valuable ad steroid. It just seems like she really did not gain much. I honestly would rather the blind and less harrier strikes compared to now. Sure she has more harrier strikes but it sucks since her damage is mediocre. She is not a good split pusher, she is more of a let me recall right before a big team fight, buy a long sword and get back to the team because im fast. Seriously I know  I sound like a dick, but really, I think we can all admit she sucks now. The only people who disagree are the people who did not actually play her before. She dint suck before, she was just unpopular. Her new ult is not really an ult, its more like a half assed transformation that you still have to wait to level  6 to get. Look at all the champs that have transformations, Gnar, Jayce, Nidalee, all get brand new cool downs and is actually effective when they transform instead of waiting 3 seconds and being able to move fast with no other skills. Even the old quinn did not get new cool downs when she transformed, so you had to be decisive about what skills you are going to use in what form, and how you are going to use your ult since it had a high cool down. The old ult does everything the new ult does better except for being able to get to more lanes faster. Old ult, better damage, better chance to pick someone off cause you can actually duel, better play making, better chance to actually make a viable decision, more attack speed, better in team fights, just better in general.\n\nI can rant all i want but riot already said her ult is staying the way it is. So my suggestion, is to give her Q some kind of actual utility, and make her W also offer some kind of actual utility. All she provides now is mediocre damage, with nothing else. If just baffles me how they can remove the offensive power from her ult and also take away damage from her regular form along with taking away utility. You have to let us have one or the other Riot. Fine leave the ult the way it is, but ether buff her damage or make her Q and W worth something in terms of utility.

She just doesn't really do much at the current time. I would mainly like to see her ult back because of how much depth it gave the rest of her kit. changing the utility of her other spells is a brilliant balance idea but I think she won't ever be quite what she was before without some drastic reworking of her ultimate. She is kinda just AD carry Rek'Sai but... with less damage/tankiness/CC. Just a shorted CDR ult. I really appreciate that Riot games are trying new things (and it is rare that they don't work well, I mean for them imbalence is a 55% win rate. We should appreciate just how awesome that is) I just feel that this particular experiment is a failure and it should go back to how it was :(.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-21T09:22:42.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the new Quinn is much much better than the old one, however i am not a Quinn main and i understand your frustration, if they changed Azir (even for the better) i would be mad because i love him just how he is.\nbut i like how she plays now, i do think that because of the blind removal and how you can proc the passive multiple times in quick succession she excels more in the solo lanes than in bot lane as a result of this patch (however i still think she is improved as an ADC because of it) \ni think the change to her ultimate is the best part, it gives her a very unique position of being the 'back to lane quickly before they take the turret' choice or the 'map pressure, roamer' as opposed to just another adc with an execution ult. \n\nyou have to remember as I'm sure you are aware, that her new ult is an initiation ability rather than an execute, and that changes the whole play style considerably, rather than being an ADC that finishes the fight, she's now one that starts it. and her Q is now the execute ability.\n\ntbh i think she is too powerful atm, but unlike other powerful champs, i don't want her to get a nerf at this point.\n\nshe definitely plays more like an assassin now, you R in at lightspeed, proc your passive on them which activates the damage of your ult as well, then E off them before they can engage you/escape, proc the passive again, then Q them for the missing HP damage and then follow up with a final passive proc to finish them off. \n\npersonally i think she is better this way and puts her in more of a niche (which is what riot wanted to do with the marksmen updates) and i personally hope she stays how she is (i don't want them to touch the ult at all now) but i do completely understand where you are coming from, i would feel that same if they changed Azir.\n\n(plus the Corsair Quinn skin R looks soooooooo cool now)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-21T11:49:33.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to take a wild guess and say you haven't read the 5.23 patch notes...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-21T16:37:39.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when they release the official version ill read it.\n\nif you are referring to what is currently on the pbe you'll have to be more specific I'm afraid.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-22T01:44:22.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn's Q.

Her overall damage output is down.\n\nSecond of all the itemisation changes, meaning she can get 100% crit (which I feel isn't the best build but I will agree she can get 70/80% without compromising a solid build path) doesn't relate to her S6 changes. the itemisation would have been, in my opinion, even more beneficial to her old kit. Her trades were, as stated, good enough with her double proc until she had the means to (in teamfights) continuously proc/kite etc.\n\nOn to her 'unique role', or potential lack there of. That is a valid point, so this is why changes are good. I would love to see Quinn seeing more play, and giver her a unique play-style would definitely, but at the moment she combos like so:\nEmpowered Auto-Attack -> Movespeed Buff -> Empowered Auto-attack -> Movespeed buff etc\nwith no other game-play elements except that she can knock aside enemies/interrupt dashes with her 'E'. Which to me is basically just a less effective/lower damage output version of Draven and once the freshness of the rework wears off, she just is left, once again, in the dust. On the other hand, her old kit relied more on timing your CC, making choices when to ult which, given the easily interruptable nature of the ability as well as the three second channel, can only really be used to get to lane faster, is just not viable now. Before she had the option to try to ult for disengage, for the follow up, for the flank etc. Now she just has to Draven around until she dies or is out of danger. To me that is way less 'unique' than she was before, even if you consider the base champion to be not very unique (which I would disagree with but if Riot wants to make her more fun... I am not complaining (jk)).\n\nAlso on the topic of viability, Quinn had been used to success in the OCE region at the top level. This is in both soloque as well as some play in the (I beleive) grand finals of the season 4 OPL. I feel like the new Quinn doesn't have enough strength to see that level of competitive play. She just doesn't have enough in her kit, however this last part, I do need to make clear is entirely speculative and doesn't stand on any hard reasoning, just anecdotal evidence in an attempt to support the claims I have made.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A Moist Crevice","date":"2015-11-20T22:07:49.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They gave her a disarm on PBE on her Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Far Fetched","date":"2015-11-21T03:00:59.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is awesome news.
