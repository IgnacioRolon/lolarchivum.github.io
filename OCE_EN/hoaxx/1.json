More likely if one of your teammates is duo with a shitter, then the support will be of a higher mmr to compensate, because support position is not as popular. This means a free loss because support cannot impact the game as much as the enemy player who is killing/outplaying the shitter.\n\n(in layman's terms)\n\nIf you like in terms of numbers mmr:\n\nTop - 1500 Enemy Top 1500\nJungle - 1200 Enemy Jungle 1500\nMid - 1500 Enemy Mid 1500\nAdc - 1500 Enemy Adc 1500\nSupport - 1800 Enemy Support 1500\n\nBalanced? According to the regulations yes.\n\nIn your Thresh game you are a whole division ahead of the others, however unluckily you are in the support role.\n\nIn your Lucian game, you have a gold 1 mid laner Ryze that did less damage than Bard. Unlucky. It's BS like this that helps to keep people's winrates around 50%. \n\nIt would be preferable to have an option for players to click a button that says \"I prefer longer queue times to get better matchmaking\". If Riot implemented this simple option, a lot of players would be happier.\n\nOh and also delete blind pick normals, when we have draft pick, that would also help with queue times.","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2018-07-31T01:01:44.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeh too many queues... not enough people","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hoaxx","date":"2018-07-27T05:00:50.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too true my friend, thanks for the good reply!","replies":[]}]}]}
