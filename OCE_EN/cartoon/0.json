It would make sense, since there's a fair bit of stuff that can be purchased with RP only and more keeps getting added to the list. Not to mention, there would be very few people who actually have everything that can be purchased with RP (that isn't able to be repetitively purchased). At the very least, I'd like Riot to go with something like this.\n\nThat said, it's entirely possible it may be something else entirely. All we can do at this point is speculate on what the compensation may be.","replies":[]}]}
