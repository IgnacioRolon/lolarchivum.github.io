I&#039;m over calling a lane then some troll just locks in and lane hogs whole game? I have to waste up to 30 mins with someone that is ruining 4 other peoples experience and if I leave I get dodged? This is BS and it needs to be addressed. Sick of these kids coming through and not abiding by the rules!","replies":[{"poster":"Preddator","date":"2017-12-04T21:52:27.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Teddo","date":"2017-12-05T08:01:38.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still new so I'm trying to build up my char base before I go into that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-06T01:05:11.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I locked a lane. 2 people locked over me and trolled lane.
