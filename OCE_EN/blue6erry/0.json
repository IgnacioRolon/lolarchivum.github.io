To be honest, I hate it a lot. It just feels like I have to 1v2 the lane (maybe it is not true but it is what I feel) Personally I feel like auto attack on the early levels means a lot and having yuumi attached to you constantly means that you will have to give up a lot of pressure and the enemy laner could walk up and deny you farms or take a favorable trade especially they have 3 potions together and you only have one. (you could argue that yuumi has heal and some poke but I feel like the heal is very weak unless you are low health(which could mean that you are under their kill range). This means that if the enemy laners walk up to you together, you will have to back off. I personally hate this and like to go at least even in lane and not constantly get shoved under turret. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that during team fight, when yuumi is attached to another teammates and the teammate dies. They will automatically force you to pick them up even if that means you might just die with them. There are a lot of things to take care of in a team fight as an ad (everyone one shots you, you might be thinking of a crucial ult{{champion:54}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:9}}   or cc{{champion:412}} {{champion:53}}{{champion:12}}    and try to position in a safe place) and it is so annoying that I have to \"get taunted/charmed\" by my support. If you did not pick them up in even one team fight. The chat and pings just run you over and they will connect to other teammates and not heal/peel for you.\r\n\r\n I am not good at ad and still in the process of learning. If it is okay, I would like to hear the thoughts from other ad players and get some advise if possible. Is there a certain champion for me to pick with yuumi or I might be doing something wrong? \r\n\r\nThank you! &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"manutdfan","date":"2020-01-05T23:47:24.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are willing to try something a bit more unusual, maybe consider a {{champion:86}} , {{champion:122}}  or similar bruiser as an adc (there is quite a decent bit of synergy between {{champion:86}}  &amp; {{champion:350}} )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-25T06:03:31.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll summerise what to do:\nWork with the Yuumi.\nYou aren't solo laning, you're just making his job and yours harder by doing nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-10-23T23:55:47.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This must be a low rank issue, if a Yuumi remains fully attached, it means they're garbage, her entire kit revolves around Attaching, Detaching, Autoing and Reattaching every chance she can (if opportunity presents)\n\nAs for suggestions, Pick up Jhin, Varus or Caitlin they are extremely good with Yuumi because of their ability to sit out of range of enemy team whilst still farming safely and dealing damage with their poke.\n\nWhen you see Yuumi's Q go off, move toward the enemy (if it's safe to do so) so that she can poke them then back off and Rinse/Repeat, you'll soon find that Yuumi is a good support when she's played well, if you're in an Elo below Gold, Good Luck lol, Yuumi's below gold are shit","replies":[]}]}
