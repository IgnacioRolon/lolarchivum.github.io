Two players in two games consecutively went mobi and kept running it down mid and made the game unplayable. For some reason, the team does not even want to surrender and it is so frustrating see them getting kills over and over again. This really ruins my experience. I want to go and get a drink and do something else waiting for the game to end instead of wasting my time on the game screen. I feel like that is reasonable but people just threaten me that I would get reported and banned if I went afk. \n\nThe thing is that it is not like they lost lane normally and got killed over and over but are still putting in effort trying to play back. They ran it straight down into the enemy team and got killed. This is so frustrating. \n\nThe links for the games are here:\n[REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]","replies":[{"poster":"DiceKey","date":"2019-12-18T08:37:25.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Being AFK for any amount of time is not OK. it lets your teammates down and your own game down. /mute all and play your own game :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2019-12-17T20:37:50.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Leaving games doesn't give you any suspensions, only low priority queues. Leaver buster is the system implemented for afkers/leavers. \n\nHowever because riot only cares about what you type to their players and it's the only thing that gets recorded, saying retard can even land you a perm ban if you are on the last warning. (you get a total of 3 warnings and 4th offense is a perm ban).","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2019-12-17T20:39:13.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Also, you have about 3 minutes to afk before leaver buster detects that you're afk.
