It looks like you were banned for intentional feeding. I think at the time there was a bug where sometimes the instant feedback system would send through chat logs for intentional feeding bans which leads to the weird chat logs. behaviour like this is not acceptable in our game. I know this is from April last year, but please do think of your fellow players. Do not ruin other peoples experience and look to instead be a leader and sportsmanlike force in our community =D.\n\nAll of these games were in Ranked.\n\nGame 1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VGkKsO4.png\n\nGame 2\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MjIjw59.png\n\nGame 3\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lmxeHcu.png\n\nP.S.

Pretty sure they should put a tag on there that at least signifies what kind of category of offences you are banned for.\n\nIf not you could always wait for a hopeful red response here, or you could always try support ticket. Assuming you aren't banned for cheating the game or something like that, you shouldn't be met with just bot copy-paste responses (though from my experience with their support, their first response tend to be very bot-like for some reason, it's usually the second or third response in the same conversation chain where they actually resemble a human typing to you).","replies":[{"poster":"YourAutism","date":"2017-01-08T05:52:33.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"was something along the lines of verbal abuse but dont know since the ban is already over only showed up because it was the first time i logged in  since being banned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2017-01-08T22:41:10.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YourAutism,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=ipatURE0,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-08T04:52:36.412+0000)\n>\n> its real dunno how u want me 2 prove it though xd\n\nScreenshot the whole ticket????","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-01-08T07:21:39.894+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"YourAutism","date":"2017-01-08T08:23:53.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"my ban was over nearly a year ago thank u though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-08T04:23:19.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This better not be real...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-08T04:46:49.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I had to guess, I'd say it's the summoner name.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-08T05:12:04.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He'd probably just get a temp name for that, I'd say more likely (assuming it's unedited) it was something like what happened here: http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/sU5wOfFJ-proof-that-the-automated-system-is-broken?comment=0029","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-01-08T04:38:07.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is fuckign so stupid, this better not be a thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-08T04:36:06.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be a legit complaint, but it could also be a deliberate slander.\n\nI'll leave it to Riot to sort out.","replies":[]}]}
