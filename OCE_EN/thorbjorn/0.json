Did you experience fair game-play and good sportsmanship?\n\nAny contributions would be greatly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-03T13:59:02.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started Season 2 on NA server.\nIt was very pleasant.\n\nI felt like a wee bit useless, as do most people playing something for the first time.\nBut the sportsmanship was great.\n\n(Obviously nowadays on OCE, it's total junk and full of unhappy children. However that's not what you asked.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThorBjorn","date":"2015-05-03T10:56:33.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the comments guys, this is exactly what I'm after, appreciate the help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-02T11:58:01.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I started around 2010 I think, there weren't that many players yet so nobody knew WtH was going on (what to do, who to play with or against, what to build etc) when leveling up accounts since smurfs and bots really weren't a thing back then. \n\nPeople might have more champs depending on how much start up money they paid but everyone was on the same boat, equally clueless.\n\nHence from my memory, new player experience was completely fair. \n\nAlso as far as I can remember, people do seem to type less back then, if anything they would just type jokes or random chit chats, some cries about OP or not and for others they may troll but I don't recall running into offensive trolls that often but more of those generic and sometimes funny trolling. Not sure if it's just nostalgia though.\n\nThere obviously were large scale shiet heads who would verbally insult both his and the enemy team, but you wouldn't run into them often, I have only ran into like 5 of them in a season or 2 before.\n\nAbout the low level player matches now since smurfs/bots are running everywhere I wouldn't bet it's very sportsmenship-ish down there atm tbh.\n\nThe max level play? I would say it's half chance and half skill, in solo queue that is. Otherwise for fully fair matchups it's either 5 man premade or Ranked 5s so you can dodge the sometimes trolly matchmaking system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-02T08:11:39.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played back is Beta/S1.\nI had no idea what I was doing but thankfully, neither did the enemy.\n\nI mainly picked champions who looked cool, then played.\nI spent forever just messing around, and just playing champions.\n\nIt did seem fair to me, but I dont really remember what has happened 4-5 years ago.\nBut when I created another account (A smurf)\njust to get that nostalgia of being new again, I found myself not caring as much. (Again)\nand just doing shit for the fun of it. \n\nHowever, I also encountered people who would Roffle-stomp over new players because they thought it was funny.\nIt wasn't a new player VS new player.\nIt was someone in Bronze/Silver etc VS new player. and was even harassing this new player.\nThats usually when I camped his lane and made his game not as fun as he thought.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nommable","date":"2015-05-02T07:51:59.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first PvP match was where a friend decided to take me, an unsuspecting newbie to the genre who hadn't quite grasped the concept of using right click to move, into a level 30's game. I was asked if I was a smurf and when I said that I didn't know what one was my teammates gave up and surrendered after treating my duo friend to some abuse.\nIt was a great way to learn about the mechanics of the game, especially the surrendering poll.\nI still said 'gg' at the end and in the post game, most people left instantly but some stayed back to wish me luck for the future.\nIt really shows that the pressure and heat of a game can bring people to quickly abuse, but it's relieving that there are some people around who can empathise.\n\nAs for whether or not the gameplay is fair, I think computer gaming is the pinnacle of fair. It's quite hard to cheat and apart from player skill, the biggest variable affecting the fairness of play seems to be your internet connection. The game may not be balanced but it's certainly fair in that you and everyone that plays this game can go pick the most overpowered character for the next game and every game after that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-05-02T07:12:10.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't remember what LOL was like when I first started, probably alittle friendly since I stuck with it.
