The pc I use to run League on is worth over $2000 and is only a couple years old. The graphics card I have is MSI GTX 970 and I have an i7 processor. League has always been working fine for the last year or so. That was, until a couple days ago, when I logged into league, as I do almost every single day. It was the patch between 20/04/18 - 21/04/18. When it finished downloading, I went for a quick game. That was when I noticed something really unusual happening. After the first 10 minutes of the match, I started having FPS (frames per second) issues. Usually league runs at least 60 fps and I never have any problems with lag etc. So after 10 minutes league dropped down to roughly 30-26 fps. It wasn&#039;t horrible but was incredibly frustrating. But, that&#039;s not the worst part. It seemed that the fps was gradually dropping more and more over time. By the end of the match I believe it had dropped below 20 fps (can&#039;t remember the exact number) but by that stage, the game was LITERALLY unplayable. Riot, I don&#039;t know what you&#039;ve been messing around with, but to have a game that works 100% fine every other day, and then suddenly shit itself after a single patch, you know you done messed up. Before anyone comments, yes, I have checked my graphics card etc. and made sure it&#039;s up to date with the latest drivers. I have also tried playing other games and they work perfectly fine. I even completely uninstalled league of my computer and waited about 6 hours to reinstall the game, but alas, it was no use. So this is a League problem, not a PC problem. I have spent at least $70 on this game so to suddenly not be able to play is ridiculous. I have already sent a bug report a day ago but so far nothing has come out of it. And there&#039;s only one other person I know who is having the same issues; but yet I don&#039;t seem to see anyone on these forums posting about it. If anyone can please pass this on to Riot that would be great. Cheers.\r\n\r\nImportant things to mention;\r\n\r\nThis is not only a problem with the in game, but also with the client as well. To summarize, basically the mouse cursor lags across the screen whenever I move it anywhere, and there is a slight delay after I click on a button. \r\nIf I exit League, but then reopen it, the problems still subside, almost exactly the same from when I last closed the game. It&#039;s only when I fully restart my pc, when I first open League after restart, where it will return to the normal FPS. If I leave the game or client open for about 10 minutes, that is when LoL will start dropping FPS gradually once again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-24T09:39:26.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing I would recommend is to update your graphics card drivers.
