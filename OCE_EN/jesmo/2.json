For about a week now I haven&#039;t received a hextech crate from a game. I have no idea why though; I play Blind Pick 90% of the time. I am level 33 and apparently you are supposed to receive a hextech crate when you score an S- on a character for the season.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s an example. I got an S- with Twitch. The game says I have an S-, and I haven&#039;t gotten a crate with Twitch yet. And yet, no crate?! Here are some images just to prove. https://imgur.com/a/1gTay Is my game bugged? Please help. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-18T13:31:46.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a chest available on your profile?
