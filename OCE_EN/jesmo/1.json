I&#039;ve been playing league for roughly a year now. Before the latest season, I reached Honor 4. Then of course, as soon as the new season started, I got placed back in Honor 2. It&#039;s been about a few months since the new season, yet for some reason, I&#039;m still Honor 2, while I see other people reaching Honor 3! I don&#039;t really understand how this makes any sense, as I have had a crap tonne of honors from team mates. Almost every time I log into League, I always recieve key fragments that tell me that I have been honoured a lot in recent games. I also honour other players quite a bit too. And the worst part about all of this, is that there is no crystal clear indication of how close you are to the next Honor rank. Riot can you please get your crap together and sort this out please. I don&#039;t really feel that it&#039;s fair that I haven&#039;t been progressing while it seems everyone else is. Also btw just to clarify as well, I rarely ever afk or dc from games, and I haven&#039;t been banned once this year, apart from dodging queue penalty which has probably been like 15 minutes max. It was really easy for me to level up my Honor progress last year, what the hell went wrong this year? And not to mention I have been playing a significant amount more games this year too.","replies":[{"poster":"JESMO","date":"2018-04-03T04:20:14.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, guys. For some reason I got downvoted because someone didn't agree with my opinion and they must have been offended somehow lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T09:06:20.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A downvote doesn't have to mean someone was offended, it could simply be they disagree as you mention. They aren't mutually inclusive. That's the thing about downvotes, there's no context. It's safe to assume that a downvote means someone disagrees with you in some form or another, but to assume anything more isn't going to be accurate a lot of the time.\n\nPersonally I don't often downvote, but I do disagree with your post and might consider it if it was a topic i felt I wanted more say in, but I'm hardly offended by you thinking honour gains are too low, just as I doubt you're personally offended that I think the honour rates are pretty good. Fast enough that it feels like you're making real solid milestones, but not so fast that the last half or more of the season is meaningless for honour.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-01T22:05:54.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was honour 5 for most of the time it was possible last season.\nI do see a slower progression this season (honour 3 with 2 checkpoints down atm).\n\nI haven't been playing much lately, but it seems that you can still progress steadily on 1-2 games a day.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-04-01T18:57:53.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does sound like you should be progressing in honor. Maybe write into support and ask.\n\nYour progress is slowed if you are negative, even if you're not punished. You will progress if you're neutral or positive, and even if you don't type anything.\n\nThis season, honor is much slower, since we have the whole season to do this, whereas last season we only had a fraction of the season with the updated honor.","replies":[]}]}
