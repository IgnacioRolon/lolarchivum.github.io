The splash art would be relatively similar to Ironside Malphite, just modeled on another ship (e.g. black sails and flags, a different coloured hull etc). The in game appearance of the skin would also be similar to the Ironside Malphite skin except it would be catered to Maokai&#039;s in game attributes (his walk, his auto attacks, his size etc).\r\n\r\n-His Q ability (Arcane Smash) would be somewhat similar, maybe with small tweaks to the colour etc.\r\n\r\n-Maokai&#039;s W ability (Twisted Advance) would be exactly like the bilgewater &quot;butcher&#039;s bridge&quot; mark/dash ability animation (seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn575_vlPwg).\r\n\r\n-His E ability (Sapling Toss) would instead launch cannonballs that move towards the enemies via small crab legs that sprout beneath them when a targetable enemy is in range; the cannonballs would include a fuse that slowly burns out over the 35 seconds they stay viable for, then explode.\r\n\r\n-His R ability (Vengeful Maelstrom) would create a swirling whirlpool around Maokai in which the debris of sunken ships would float around him for the duration of his ultimate.\r\n\r\nViable skin concept, yes or no?","replies":[]}
