The splash art would be relatively similar to Ironside Malphite, just modeled on another ship (e.g. black sails and flags, a different coloured hull etc). The in game appearance of the skin would also be similar to the Ironside Malphite skin except it would be catered to Maokai&#039;s in game attributes (his walk, his auto attacks, his size etc).\r\n\r\n-His Q ability (Arcane Smash) would be somewhat similar, maybe with small tweaks to the colour etc.\r\n\r\n-Maokai&#039;s W ability (Twisted Advance) would be exactly like the bilgewater &quot;butcher&#039;s bridge&quot; mark/dash ability animation (seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn575_vlPwg).\r\n\r\n-His E ability (Sapling Toss) would instead launch cannonballs that move towards the enemies via small crab legs that sprout beneath them when a targetable enemy is in range; the cannonballs would include a fuse that slowly burns out over the 35 seconds they stay viable for, then explode.\r\n\r\n-His R ability (Vengeful Maelstrom) would create a swirling whirlpool around Maokai in which the debris of sunken ships would float around him for the duration of his ultimate.\r\n\r\nViable skin concept, yes or no?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-10T04:21:06.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"TREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nIS\n\nWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD\n\nNOT\n\nIROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-10-10T05:49:45.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Then what do you call an Ironbark Tree?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-10T12:38:47.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n\nWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD\n\nDUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","replies":[{"poster":"frampsac","date":"2015-10-11T04:14:13.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iron\"side\" - not Iron\"wholebody\" lol","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-10-10T22:03:32.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He is a tree....","replies":[{"poster":"frampsac","date":"2015-10-11T04:12:51.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what are boats made out of?","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-10-11T05:24:52.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are made out of {{champion:92}} thats how they carry people across the seas :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
