I have spent hundreds of dollars on the game (not an excuse) and i was rightfully banned. It has been a year and i have rethought my life as a whole and become a better person from different experiences. If possible i would like for my account to be unbanned. I can understand if u do not unban me but i would like to just ask for this request anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2017-06-19T08:45:41.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi summoner,\n\nLike Heartvine said yesterday, we cannot help you on the boards due to this being an account specific inquiry.
