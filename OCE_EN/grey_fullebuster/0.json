Maybe just identify it as {logintocontunie}.\n\nYou are also going to have to **remove the guys name** as it is against boards policy to name and shame. Just send it along to riot in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) with all the info so they can get right onto it.\n\nMake sure that if you see the link commented anywhere on the boards/news items to report it ASAP using the report feature in the bottom right corner. ♥","replies":[{"poster":"grey fullebuster","date":"2016-03-15T04:41:41.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"umm yep op sorry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrup","date":"2016-03-14T03:57:22.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there grey,\n\nI might almost recommend (as well as reporting this person) to change your account passwords - including your email address and Boards account. This suggestion might seem a bit obvious but it's one of the simpler ways to protect your account quickly! \n\nI hope you get this sorted out.
