It was removed to avoid confusion, because while it did have some value as a meaningless let off steam, it perpetrated this idea that you could be banned for being bad (which isn't and was never true).\n\nIn my experience even 4 reports from _different_ games sometimes isn't enough to prompt a gameplay punishment. That system is much slower than any of us would like to confirm and subsequently punish gameplay offences, but ultimately yes, while rare, false punishments aren't impossible.\n\nI'm gonna pretend you didn't just report yourself, but RE support, the first response is often a macro response it's true BUT that doesn't mean it's meaningless. The macro responses address the vast majority of problems, and using a generic \"your punishment was valid and will not be revoked\" doesn't mean it hasn't been looked into. Support isn't perfect, I'm the first to admit that, and if I see something suspicious or inadequate I do my best to follow it up, but they get a lot of flak they don't deserve as well.\n\nIf you want more context or feel your ticket wasn't adequately addressed, a simple reply is enough to escalate it. Pretty much only the first response will ever be pre-prepared (there are of course exceptions, but for the most part, particularly with PB, this is the case).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZedHotChiliPeprs","date":"2018-10-16T10:20:41.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A little update,\n\nban is now over and my level 5 honour is wiped, so now I can't even get the end of season rewards.\n\nThis is such a joke. no wonder this game is losing people...","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-16T13:31:49.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Less than 1% of players see any form of punishment.

From the top of my head, hate speech and things like suicide encouragement, gameplay related offences like feeding or win trading, and boosting which will also result in a loss of all ranked rewards for this season and for any previous.\n\nIf the reform card doesn't say much, it's likely your punishment was either gameplay related or the result of a manual review, so if you want more context, you'll have to submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nYou can also appeal your punishment in the same way if you feel it was made in error.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-22T10:13:15.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras, is there a penalty/suspension for you-played-shit?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-22T11:15:01.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is not.
