Arguing before you even start the game is a sign of someone being toxic, or someone threatening to troll and intentional feed.  I should have the right to dodge any ranked game, especially during a promotion series, to have a team that has good cooperation and supportive attitudes.   \r\n     I think its unfair for riot to penalize me for not wanting to play with these people as I&#039;m trying to climb the ladder up.   Riots policies of toxic players then strikes those who dodge because of toxic players in champion select is unjust.   Yes, once your in game, stick it out and try your best but if you see the red flags before the game starts you shouldn&#039;t be held punishable when you leave a RANKED CHAMPION SELECT because of turmoil, trolls and arguments.   Change this please!  I dont mind the time penalty but dropping me from my promotional series because I don&#039;t want to play my promo game with trolls and toxic people and potential feeders is not Cool!!!!!  Fix Fix Fix PLEASE!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-09-03T07:01:42.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I concur....  I'd also like to see a previously played and report system capable of handling these situations.\n\nWhen you get someone on your team with the disgusting \"yolo\" attitude and saying he's going to feed because they don't care, they should be punished, not the people trying to avoid him.","replies":[]}]}
