Barbecue Leona is stoking her fire for her smoking Rakkor oak wood chips. She has been using this wood for all of her smoking since she was a child. Growing up in the mountains, Barbecue Leona would spend weekends learning from her parents how to barbecue her own meats from the animals hunted in the area. Leona took great joy from this as during the week was for the battle training.  \r\n\r\nLeona would lament having to learn how to be a strong warrior who would crush any enemy. She would rather protect the vulnerable with her strong shield and sword. Her award winning Rakkor native spice blend has always won her the village cooking competitions at home. Paired with her signature smoked brisket she is a sure-fire win for this Pit master cook-off that weird Tahm Kench is hosting. Oh well 1000 gold will go a far way to making her the pride of her village, whether they like it or not. \r\n\r\nBaker Pantheon is feeding his fire in his small Baker&rsquo;s oven. The temperature needs to be just right for the flaky pastry like bread to really crunch when you bite down. His Raptor breast is in the marinade and looking just about right. The smoker that his father used in the Bakery was always hot and ready. This travel one he has now takes a little longer to get hot. Baker Pantheon&rsquo;s family Bakery was loved by everyone in the village. His mastery with weaponry was only matched by his love of baking. This recipe of smoked raptor breast hot bun has been passed down from his Ancestors for centuries. Baker Pantheon&rsquo;s family is a long line of Bakers and he will not let that shame from his tribe, Barbecue Leona, take this win from him. \r\n\r\nLoud banging is all that can be heard from the far-right corner. Butcher Olaf has his giant mortar and pestle out on the bench and is pulverising his dried chilli&#039;s into a fine ground powder. Thinking to himself the entire time about how the chilli must be hotter. Rummaging through his rucksack of different chilli&#039;s from all over the lands of RuneTarra. This dish is his absolute favourite from his home land. Chilli crusted roasted Red Buff rump. Thinly sliced and the meat just melts in your mouth. Tahm Kench won&rsquo;t know what hit him. These weak main-landers have no idea what they are up against. They think they have a chance compared to the knowledge of every land we conquered and all the varieties and burn your mouth spiciness of the combined chilli&#039;s?. Ha, Not likely. \r\n\r\nLight bubbling can be heard from the fish tank on Sashimi Akali&rsquo;s table. A young juicy scuttle crabling can be seen inside. The crab must be as fresh as possible for the balance to be truly right. Balance is the key to food as it is the key to life. The Kinkou have perfected the balance that must be found in good food. The midnight&rsquo;s kiss is a poisonous leaf that is grown in the river beds of Ionia. If used in certain drinks it can put someone to sleep for good. The Martial Order of Kinkou have found a way to prepare the Midnight&rsquo;s Kiss which removes the poison and unlocks the unique flavour of his amazing leaf. When smoked the leaf takes on a meatier taste and will balance perfectly with the sweetness of this scuttle crabling. A true delight for the Tahm Kench River God.  \r\n\r\nSitting in his river throne is the Master Chef Tahm Kench himself. Licking his lips in pure gluttony and delight. Watching all this food being prepared for him is making this 1000 gold prize money he is coughing up all worth it. For years Tahm Kench has travelled the rivers of RuneTarra and seen all the amazing culinary delights that this world has to offer. What else is there to do while hunting for weary travellers?. He has had a dream of all these cultures come together and cook for him in an all out Pit-master Cook-off. He spread the word far and wide, calling on all the masters of the flame and smoke to compete together and decide who is truly the best of the best. \r\n\r\nWhile hours toil away every contestant works their flames and smoke to absolute precision. Sweat pouring down the faces of each and every one. Determination in their eyes to show what it means to come from their homes and childhoods. The gold is just a bonus to these fierce competitors and the glory all the more prize possession. When the sun is starting to set over the mountains overlooking this bit of river bend. The meals are presented in unison. Each and every one a feast to the senses. Tahm Kench starts with the first, Akali&rsquo;s Scuttle Crabling Sashimi served on a bed of slow smoked Midnight&rsquo;s Kiss. He picks up the whole plate and eats everything in the one bite. The sweetness of the crab is perfectly balanced with the meaty and smoky flavour of the river leaf. Although the concept is simple, He loves it. \r\n\r\nMoving on to the next dish is Butcher Olaf&rsquo;s Chilli crusted Red Buff Rump. The chilli coating has given the red chilli&#039;s a black charcoal touch that makes the meat appear to be engulfed in flames. Butcher Olaf looks on at his dish with a proud grin. Thinly slicing it in front of Tahm Kench. He lays it out on a board for the river god&rsquo;s eating pleasure. With one fowl swoop the board is in Tahm&rsquo;s mouth and wiped clean. The explosion of chilli first touches Tahm&rsquo;s tongue. Fireworks are going off in his mouth but the rush of juice from the tender meat soon puts out all the fire. The flavour is immense and changing by the second. Tahm savours every last bit.  \r\n\r\nThird up on the rank is The reigning Rakkor Annual Cook-off champion, Barbecue Leona. Her special blend of native spices has given her slow cooked dragon brisket a multitude of reds, yellows and brown all over. She thinly slices some for Tahm and pairs it with a green vegetable soaked in vinegar from her village known as a Pickle. Laid out in front of Tahm Kench he remembers all the times in the past he has tried this award winning Dragon&#039;s brisket. The Annual Rakkor Cook-off is something Tahm Kench would never miss. He flings his long tongue out at godly speed and snatches up the Dragon&rsquo;s Brisket from the table in one smooth motion. Savouring the hard spice crust matching with the tart bite from the Pickle. This was the dish he would travel miles for every year to eat. An absolute winner so far. \r\n\r\nLast up was the Rakkor Baker and Legendary Warrior, Baker Pantheon. He has brought with him a special type of Baker&#039;s Oven made with the hard and dense mountain clay of his home village. This allows the heat to cook a special crust that the Bakery is known for and has been loved by many for centuries. One dozen golden brown buns, each the size of a fist was on a stone platter. The smoked Raptor meat tucked away inside each bun. Coated in an ancient blend of herbs and with a creamy milk-based sauce from the wilder beasts that resemble what the lowland people call cows in Rakkor. Tahm Kench slammed the table with his fist and sent the buns up into the air. Catching all of the buns with his tongue in rapid succession. Each bun burst in his mouth with each bite of the comforting and smooth mixture. The creamy sauce was paired perfectly with the gentle smokiness that the marinated Raptor breast. With the herbs gently coming through in a harmony of flavour.  \r\n\r\nTahm has made up his mind. Lining up the contestants he spoke with great joy the food was that everyone had cooked today. With a short but bitter sweet silence for suspense he announced Baker Pantheon as a clear winner. Handing Baker Pantheon the 1000 Gold and proudly naming him the best Pit-master in all of RuneTarra. Reminding the other contestants that this will be held again next year and all are encouraged to return and claim the Title of Pit-master themselves. \r\n\r\nBaker Pantheon looks on in astonishment and a hidden measure of pride for beating the &ldquo;Famous Barbecue Leona of Rakkor with her Brisket&rdquo;. His only words to sum everything up was: \r\n\r\n&ldquo;My profession?! You know, now that I think of it, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a baker.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, a baker.","replies":[{"poster":"SxTyrannosaurus","date":"2018-09-28T03:08:28.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huuuuuungry, Y U do dis? {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZÅ“ X Lulu Hentai","date":"2018-09-28T02:18:34.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just food p*** at this point.
