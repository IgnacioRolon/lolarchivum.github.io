I&#039;ve been around the traps for a while but for those who don&#039;t know me I was the 2014 Oceanic wildcard representative, I came 2nd in the 2015 Luna Park Final and was voted All-star jungler for Internation Wildcard Allstars. Feel free to ask me anything about my time in Oceanic Esports as a player/owner, my life before esports or anything really. So long as it isn&#039;t too personal because I got yelled at by my girlfriend one time for answering a question I apparently shouldn&#039;t have!\r\n\r\n!
