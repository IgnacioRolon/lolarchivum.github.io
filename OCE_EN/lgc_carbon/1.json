I&#039;ve been playing competitively in OCE since late 2013 and have been on a number of teams (all with the same people though) in Mindfreak/AvA and ultimately my current team legacy. Last year I represented OCE at Wildcards in Cologne and am currently playing in the second inaugural season of the Oceanic Pro League. I was Diamond 1 in NA before OCE opened and have achieved rank 1 in every season of OCE (bar this one unfortunately, I&#039;m all washed up {{champion:32}} ). \r\n\r\nOutside LoL I graduated university at the beginning of last year (Health Science @ Latrobe) and have worked for a long time part time as a swimming instructor. I turned 23 this year and spend most my time either playing LoL/Smash Bros Melee, working or seeing my friends/girlfriend.  Ask me anything regarding the jungle, competitive  league or soloq! I will also entertain personal questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can follow myself and my team at:\r\n\r\n[@OCECarbon](https://twitter.com/OCECarbon)\r\n[Legacy Esports](https://www.facebook.com/LegacyEsportsLoL?ref=hl)\r\n[@LegacyOCE](https://twitter.com/LegacyOCE)","replies":[{"poster":"Not Sarah","date":"2015-06-12T08:24:20.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who do you main in smash?","replies":[{"poster":"LGC Carbon","date":"2015-06-12T08:29:47.137+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marth!

Yes they are your teammate and friend, but changing role in a competitive season drastically makes your team worse and it's best to sometimes just man up and kick them.\niM also did it, and have suffered for along time, Ryu has slowly got better but he still below par every other top laner in OPL (even SF have a better top laner then these 2 teams)\n\nLegacy have also done this with Tallywacka in the past, which he still seems to not be perfect with his positioning and such (where you could pick up cardrid from your B team or so many decent ADC players in solo q and make your team much stronger) , i'm just curious about the reasoning teams prefer struggle through season with changes like this, when a clear as day option is much more suited. \n\nIs it a ego thing for players? thinking they can change easy? Or an org decision to trust in the player and pretend they are not the reason they are losing? or is there a lack of talent to pick from?

However, if you're about to teamfight it's best for you to use your smite on the gromp so you get the thornmail poison thing. If you're invading it's really good to use smite on their wolves so you get the vision buff in their jungle. The golems are basically only good to smite for your original clear or if you're about to siege (the golem buff gives you a small damage increase on your first hit on towers). It gets a bit trickier when you starting playing with red/blue smites. Do you smite the camps for the buffs or do you save it to use on your next gank? Is dragon spawning soon, will there be a teamfight? Do you then use your smite to help you win the teamfight or do you save it so you can secure the dragon after the fight if you don't manage to kill the enemy jungler.

That's my opinion on it at least. If you have been jungling for a while you probably have ganking down pat, try to think more about the way you're pathing yourself and where you're putting  you wards. If you invade his red side jungle and he isn't there, where do you think he probably is? Warn that lane.\n\nEarly pressure = Lee Sin, Eve, Reksai, Gragas\n\nScaling junglers are super risky because jungle is usually only strong for the first 10 minutes of the game and if you opt into making yourself weak during that time you give your opponent a window to snowball. That said Sejuani is a good scaling jungler.\n\nMy _favourite_ is poppy. However go-to would be something like Rek'Sai i suppose, she is good in the meta and also has good early pressure with a decent mid game due to her ult. I'm waiting for Elise to come back though, I loved playing her last season.\n\nThere are two paths you can take Vi down, I've seen a lot of full DPS Vi's in soloq which can be reasonably successful (warrior into tri/bork) however this doesnt work very well in an organised environment as team fights are more structured. The cinderhulk is much safer and actually does prety decent damage anyway so better to take this option in my opinion.\n\nGood R5's junglers are just whatever is in meta, Sejuani, Gragas, Reksai. That said, I suggest you just play whatever you are good at. Too much emphasis is placed on the meta and I've seen many players put bad perfomances in on meta champs because they feel obliged to play them. You're much better off just playing whatever your main is.\n\nThanks for the questions! I love talking about the jungle.","replies":[]}]}]}
