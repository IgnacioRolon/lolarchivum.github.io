And Riot seems not trying to solve those problems, due to many times met SAME afkers in games. In my opinion, World Championship is a big evidence of showing how bad this server is because there are 2 reasons make it happen, 1. TOXIC PLAYERS - People won&#039;t improve well if there are many toxic players. 2. (off topic one) Most Oceania internet is RUBBISH. \r\nA team fight game need everyone&#039;s cooperation; otherwise, many toxic players will only make game sucks. Therefore, I don&#039;t think join [OCEANIA] LEAGUE of LEGENDS is a good choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-20T04:46:39.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And there is no toxic people in NA, EUW etc. The only server with the least toxic people is probably KR. It's just how it is man, toxic gamers would never disappear and some streamers actually encourage toxicity so never expect toxic players to disappear. Such streams are tyler1, grossgore etc but I have to say that toxic streamers are really funny to watch and entertaining but they are never good to watch if you want to learn etc","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-20T06:14:47.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd imagine in the high intensity of korea that you'd get just as much if not more toxicity. There is no way to avoid the toxicity so the easiest way to keep your cool is to place wards and play something irritating like zilean and then be a total nice guy about it even though you are laughing your head off when you revive someone and denied the enemy team a kill.","replies":[{"poster":"Neo89","date":"2016-07-27T13:48:10.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fukkin approve your note.    :)))","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-20T06:31:01.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play teemo because when someone dies you just spam laugh and they tilt super hard","replies":[]}]}]}]}
