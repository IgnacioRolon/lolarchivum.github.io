It's more profitable to ban the toxic player, and keep the positive players in-game.\n \n> That's why Riot actually wants to ban people. Each toxic player in the game makes people leave and causes players to play less. This has a negative effect on profits.  Less people buy skins, less people buy RP and less people tell their friends about the game.\n\n__*\n\nSo there you go. It definitely is all about the profit and that exactly why it's in **Riot**'s best interests to try to fix toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-19T09:15:22.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">If I tell you that Riot employees are decent people like the rest of us, you wont believe me.\n\nI will believe that, that doesn't mean the system works, or is actually designed to take out every toxic player.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-19T11:10:54.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whether the system is working up to standard is definitely up for debate.

It means that once a week a positive player might have a game that's not up to standard with their usual behaviour. They might step out of line very infrequently, but it adds up. _This is a very difficult problem to solve._\n\n**So what is Riot doing?**\n\n1. The instant feedback system isn't ideal for banning toxic players. It was designed to reform players and give small punishments to good players who were just getting it a bit wrong. That's why it uses a 4 tier incremental system, rather than just instantly banning players.\n\n This was implemented a while ago but it's still working today and punishing players as we speak.\n\n2. There is also a focus on extremely toxic players. [Manual audits](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ol8no/riot_banning_toxic_players_faster/) are used on repeat offenders and extremely toxic behaviour. \n\n3. **The tribunal is being developed right now.** [Lyte](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3suitx/riot_lyte_on_the_status_of_the_tribunal/) said that the design for the tribunal was finalized, and [Riot Slumber Jack](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mEIlagLk-when-is-the-tribunal-coming-back?comment=0006) confirmed that it will begin production after the new champion select (now finished).\n\n4. The player behavior team is also responsible /remake and designing the new champion select, with the aim of reducing arguments and making the game more enjoyable.\n\nThe player behaviour team does a lot for us, but for some reason the community doesn't really even appreciate the gesture.\n\nI challenge you to find a game which has more systems than League to fight toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-20T09:08:43.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah beautiful the riot game strategy of throw a bunch of useless numbers out that don't actually mean anything, i see they taught you well.\n\nI really cbf with this shitty argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-20T11:47:07.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually you're right.
