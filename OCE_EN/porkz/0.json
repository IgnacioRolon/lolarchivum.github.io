I have around 30-40 ping average and 200-400 FPS average, but for some reason my game always trips out and starts freezing up, I can still click around and move around the map. For example, I&#039;m in a 1v1 against Ekko as Riven, if I were to Q all I would see on my screen would be Riven moving forward without animation and Ekko&#039;s health bar deplete (sometimes nothing happens at all). \nMy current specs are, Intel i5 6600k, EVGA GTX 1070 SC and an ASUS Z170 PRO GAMING. Any feedback/Help is appreciated {{summoner:13}}\n\nEDIT: Capping FPS at 60 does seem to weaken the lag, but only by a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-06-17T23:16:26.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds to me like some major packet loss.\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
