I have no clue to what it could be at this point, but just so you guys can help me figure out here&#039;s some info:\nPrograms im running in the background: Skype and LoL\nLaptop Specs: i5-4200U 1.6 Ghz\nNvidia Geforce GT 720M (2 GB Vram)\n8gb ram\n1 Tb hdd\n\n Any help is appreciated THANK YOU!!!\n\nEDIT: Ive confirmed skype isnt changing anything.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-26T08:43:25.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Porkz,\n\nSounds to me like your graphics drivers are crashing, this could potentially be due to a heat issue however before we go down that route please try the following.\n\nUpdate and/or reinstall your graphics card drivers, [here](http://www.geforce.com/drivers) is a link to where you can download drivers for your card, alternatively you can install [GeForce Experience](http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience) to automatically keep your drivers up to date.\n\nIf the above does not resolve your issue then this may be a heat problem, as you're on a laptop this is definitely a possibility, I'd recommend monitoring your temperatures next time you're in game, there are many free utilities out there to do this however my favourite is [SpeedFan](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php).\n\n* When was the last time you cleaned your laptops fans? \n* Are you playing on a flat, hard surface to provide adequate airflow or are you playing on something soft, such as a bed?\n\nHope this is useful :)","replies":[{"poster":"Porkz","date":"2016-01-26T20:12:05.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much im trying out these solutions right now!\nI already have GeForce Experince but now that I think about it I recently updated my drives (2-3 days ago) and thats when this started happening!\n\nMy laptop's fans havent been cleaned out since I bought it actually which was about a year ago but i'm not too keen on cleaning them out myself, i'll probably break something knowing me.\n\nLastly I play on a wooden desk so no problems there haha!\n\nThank You !","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-27T01:07:15.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, in that case you may wish to roll back to a previous version of your GPU drivers, achievable from the same page linked in my above post.\n\n>My laptop's fans havent been cleaned out since I bought it actually which was about a year ago but i'm not too keen on cleaning them out myself, i'll probably break something knowing me.\n\nI'm sure any small computer repair store will be willing to do it for you for a fee, however it's possibly not needed. As stated above, monitor your temps next time you're in game and see how they go.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
