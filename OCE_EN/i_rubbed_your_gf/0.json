You're fueling the very fire you hate, if you take team toxic players on the chin and good grace. You find you've taken the wind out of their sails quite well. Also, you have a MUTE button in game. Use it. Pings still work from players so you can still use in game communication to work around. \n\nComplaining in forums in a way is just as toxic as players ingame. You're promoting crappy behavior, we all know its there, we all know it happens, there's not much riot can do about it. Do you really expect them to hire a department to read every chatlog and watch every game to scan for these people? \n\nIf random players bother you so much... Stop joining games solo! Que with friens, with your club group etc. Its what it's there for. \n\nIt's up to the player receiving the crap also to toughen up and be smarter with how they play and whom they play with. \n\nTill I update my laptop i dont think i'll be doing any real ranked, i dont have the stable 60fps and 1920 resolution, i run 1320x900 or something like that, so i get smaller lane vision etc. I find around 7-10am can be a bit risky, but also quite alot less toxic, people are waking up usually in OCE and want a game or two before work/school, the downside... Some of these are young players who's parents bust them and kick them off the pc making your game a 4v5. However, maturity wise i find it better. \n\nSame way at night, you may still get some ptahetic 16-21yo losers who are up late being idiots, but for the most part... I find its generally the more mature people playing. \n\n\nThat being said; I just got the idea to create the club \"25 and up\". Name speaks for itself, 25yo's and up, or at least known players who can be mature/nontoxic. They may not be the best, they may only play norm/aram etc, but at least you're certain to find people will communicate clearly, have a reasonable thought, likely to try with objective play and listen to advice etc. \n\nWe all like to win, but a good loss is just as fun, these moments are even better when you're with people who can just have fun yet still play the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-20T09:24:17.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are doing everything they can, but no matter how many times these players get banned, new ones just rise up.
