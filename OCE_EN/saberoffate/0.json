This could mean better games for all of us so we can know if we are lagging for some reason before the game. Yes i know you can do it through CMD but there are too many loops.","replies":[{"poster":"mosguinz","date":"2016-11-09T04:30:48.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A ping indicator would be great, I have seen this suggestion several times and have upvoted them all, since I'm one of those who has a lot connection problems.\n\nGames are hosted by Riot's server (client-server), not peer-to-peer. Although, you can't directly ping the game's server, you can try using this IP (203.50.11.97) to check latency for Oceania instead. This IP is not official by any means, this is the IP that [LolReplay2](http://beta.leaguereplays.com/) uses to check latency.\n\n{{champion:17}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-11-08T07:20:52.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better idea. Riot please implement a code that checks peoples internet speed and warn them into playing a gam when they play a game. If their speed is awful which can cause them to DC from the game at the beginning or during ban them until their connection is better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilverLightning","date":"2016-11-07T22:06:19.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro, you don't get how it works, the ping in the client wont show the ping in the game, so that's why they can't implement it, the ping in the game depends on the host for the game and connections and other players of the game and can be on a different server, the ping in the client would be inaccurate but if you just want to check your internet speed you can go to www.speedtest.net","replies":[]}]}
