The city was ablaze, he could hear the screams of the people that he was all too familiar with, however there was another noise he could hear, there were screeches that he has never heard before. Part of the city was collapsed in the ground, giant stone pillars glowing purple could be seen sticking out from within the city. He was ordered to come here to deal with the insurgents known as the Suns of Bel&rsquo;zhun, a group of locals trying to overthrow the current Noxian ruler of the city, but the situation seemed very different from what he was told.\n\nDarius turned to his men and with a loud voice he boomed &ldquo;Men, we have arrived, however as you can see we have a new task ahead of us. Save the city. We will make our way to the palace to find Dorrik and extract him. That is our top priority. Now MOVE OUT!&rdquo;\n\nDarius and company began to make their way into the city. Around them they could see the devastation from what has happened, buildings torn in half, soldiers with their armour torn to pieces strewn about on the floor, and the people of the town shortly after them. Giant marks across the victims, some creature had done this, something not of this world. As they reached the gate of the palace the gates were torn open, something had bent the gate inwards. As the men entered dozens of soldiers could be seen and among these bodies, were bodies of creatures not of this world. Darius approached one of the bodies to inspect it, from a distance it looked like that of a giant purple worm, he rolled it over with his axe to keep his distance from the thing. It was a hideous creature, it&rsquo;s mouth was vertical with what appeared to be four eyes, two on each side of the face, he then saw that it had numerous legs on the underside of it and on the sides of its body appeared to be spikes pointing forwards. Some had pieces of armour attached to these spikes. \n\nOne of the younger soldiers called out &ldquo;Commander, wha... what are these things?&rdquo;\n\nDarius keeping his cool as he was as confused as the young man sternly said, &ldquo;It does not matter, we continue with the mission...&rdquo;\n&ldquo;But what about these creat...&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;WE continue the mission, no matter what, we must protect Noxus and its people.&rdquo; Darius raised his axe and cut the creature in half. &ldquo;And as you can see they can die, remember your training and you will get through this.&rdquo; He pushes past the young man and heads to the doors of the palace. As he begins to open the door a faint screeching and clashing can be heard.\n\n&ldquo;Men ready yourselves.&rdquo; Darius pushed open the door and began moving towards the noises. The sound of the screeching and clashing now with men shouting began to get louder and louder until they arrived. Upon entering the room Darius saw what appeared to be half a dozen men fighting those creatures from before without hesitation Darius leapt into action and joined the fray. Slicing up two of the creatures closest to the survivors, their bodies collapsing to the floor. He turned to the survivors and in a gruff voice said, &ldquo;Stand back I&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; One of the creatures dived towards Darius as his head was turned, one of the survivors quickly pushed Darius and decapitated the creature with his scimitar.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve still got more fight in me&rdquo; The survivor boasted. The fight was over quickly, however not cleanly several men had fallen victim to the creatures. Darius looked around the men still standing, the youngling before didn&rsquo;t make it, Darius looked at the boy a slight tinge of pain ran through him but disappeared as quickly as it had come. This was life, only the strongest survive. \n\n&ldquo;We need to leave fast before more of those things come,&rdquo; As Darius turns to the survivor he comes face to face with the man&rsquo;s scimitar. &ldquo;I know who you are Darius, the Hand of Noxus, and I know you are here for my head, but I warn you I won&rsquo;t...&rdquo;\n\nDarius knocks the blade out of his hand with one swift hit and picks up the man the throat, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t threaten me unless you can kill me.&rdquo; He dropped the man on the floor. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re the leader of Suns of Bel&rsquo;Zhun, what are you doing in the palace?&rdquo;\n\nThe man got back up on his feet and dusted himself off, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to give the people a safe place to escape from the streets are swarming with those things and the palace is the only safe palce where us Suns can protect them.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your job to protect them&rdquo; Darius turned and begun to walk away. &ldquo;That is the Stewards and the soldier&rsquo;s jobs.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;THE STEWARD IS A COWARD&rdquo; the man yelled out. Darius stopped in his tracks. Softening his voice he whimpered, &ldquo;The soldiers that survived are currently evacuating some of the survivors through the hidden tunnels in the palace.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Darius questioned.\n\nThe man stuttered &ldquo;The, the steward?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;YES&rdquo; Darius&rsquo;s voice boomed, &ldquo;WHERE IS HE?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;In his room, the guards saw him lock himself in there&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Wait here&rdquo; Darius commanded. Five minutes passed before he returned. &ldquo;Noxus has no room for cowards, you boy, you are no coward, knowing who I am you still tried to confront me, you may be Shuriman, but you have the heart of a Noxian. I will teach you personally, what is your name boy?&rdquo;\n\nConfused as to what was going on he muttered out &ldquo;My name is Salah&rsquo;Den&rdquo;.\n\nDarius with a loud and clear voice ordered &ldquo;Alright, men move out, we can&rsquo;t save this town with those creatures here, the new mission, evacuate as many survivors alive as possible, and you,&rdquo; pointing to Salah&rsquo;Den, &ldquo;you stay close to me, I don&rsquo;t want you dying on me. Now show us where these tunnels are, the survivors may be under attack already.&rdquo; They made their way to the tunnels to protect the survivors from the creatures.\n\n~\n\n&ldquo;Good he&rsquo;s bringing the boy back, now we have another strong piece to use. We must gather as much strength as possible for the upcoming invasion, we must be prepared or we will lose everything, the void must be stopped before it spreads too far. Now did you bring me what I asked for?&rdquo;\n\nOut from the shadows LeBlanc laughed, revealing a small light blue vial. &ldquo;Of course, this is the remainder of it, and remember our deal.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Of course, my dear, I won&rsquo;t forget our deal. Now preparations must be made, we are running out of time&rdquo; Swain took the vial and left the room with a smirk on his face.","replies":[]}
