This is because the matchmaking system cannot comply with the demand: I do not want to be placed in any of the games/teams which a person on my block list is in - to well as it could potentially make matchmaking sessions much longer due to a large amount blocked players. This could also incite \"troll accounts\" to block a large amount of users and go into matchmaking and then decline the game or wait out the time period to accept the game thus creating anger within the communities for excessively long queue times.\n\nExcessive feeding are not bannable offences nor are they a choice in the report option. If you want to them to be punished due to toxicity, in the report menu choose \"Verbal Abuse\" or similar options* as you see fit. If you wish to have them punished for intentionally feeding, choose \"Intentionally Feeding\" or \"Assisting Enemy Team\" (This one is a bit hard to determine though).\n\nThe report system sometimes cannot {{champion:86}} tee a ban straight away unless a large amount of players repeatedly report him over the course of a few games.\n\n* \"Unskilled\" is an option in the report options however as it says when you hover over the option, it is not a bannable offence and only serves to improve the matchmaking system.","replies":[{"poster":"Noxide","date":"2015-01-26T10:23:02.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer to have a longer wait time then play with toxic players, Feeders don't worry me to much as most of the time our team will just focus the most fed and win most team fights. \n\nand as for this\n\n> [{quoted}](name=ChaoxShadow,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=JtJHNuhA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-26T05:07:49.764+0000)\n The report system sometimes cannot {{champion:86}} tee a ban straight away unless a large amount of players repeatedly report him over the course of a few games.\n\nIt doesn't help when the other team don't care and usually honor them for the win.

Then someone on the team would back the person getting blamed up then the toxic player would just start abusing both players then start blaming the whole team for being bad. So instead of just playing they would just blame blame blame then say to the other team report his team for being bad. They are toxic enough to start saying they wish everyone's mothers got cancer and hope they die, and then start telling the team how to play or should uninstall the game.\nThat's when mute comes in handy even if I say to the team just mute them they are to busy arguing with the troll/toxic player.\nRiot really need to get their act together and help out with these toxic players.\n\nStarting to get sick of them, everyone on the team reports them, then the other team just honors them for letting them win. Usually the other  team don't report as they get the win and just wave if off. \n\nEven if I mute the troll/toxic player its hard to carry when all the bronze elo do is argue and rage. \nPeople say just carry to get out but its a lot harder to carry when your team is arguing, and ignoring calls from other players to group up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noxide","date":"2015-01-25T14:38:17.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"last season i had toxic players on block list and after a couple of days i was getting placed on there team a few times.\nBut i couldn't tell ya bout this season as its only early.
