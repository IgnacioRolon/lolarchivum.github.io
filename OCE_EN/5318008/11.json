You just said he was on the \"same team\", in which you didn't reference that to anything. In other words, all you said was, \"He's on a team.\"\n\nSecondly, Ziggs cannot placed turrets which fire upon enemies. That's either Heimerdinger, Zyra or Azir. Ziggs is the bomb yordle.\n\nIf it's Azir, I think I can say I've actually seen that. Don't worry though, it's just the aiming reticule that's persistent, it's not actually firing, and it only occurs if there's a target in range as the turret is created.\n\n[Here's the bug report board.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)","replies":[{"poster":"5318008","date":"2015-01-27T07:30:33.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oops i meant heim not ziggs my bad\n\nyea it wasnt damaging anyone or anything at all but the animation was the same as it would normally attack enemy champs/minions","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
