All her abilities cost so much mana, she does no damage to anything without her passive, thus needing to use her abilities, thus early game she runs out of mana very quickly.\r\nI have to start the game with 2 mana pots and a Faerie Charm (mana regen) simply because she is so mana thirsty. Thus early game she is 'behind the 8 ball' so to speak, because other mid laners can start with damage or AP items, making her not as strong as her opponents.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\nHer cool down should be reduced on her abilities by a fraction to allow her to get her passive off easier.\r\nor\r\nThe cost of her abilities reduced so you can start with AP items and not mana regen items.\r\nor\r\nHer base ability power should be increased early game but scaled the same as before per level to get her a bit more of a chance early game.\r\nand/or\r\nHer Base AD should be increased slightly but scaled the same per level so she doesnt solely rely on her passive early game.\r\n\r\nThoughts??{{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Morisman","date":"2014-12-11T01:32:05.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is fine as is, stop spamming skills without a blue/chalice and you'll be fine.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-15T02:52:37.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:99}}’s mana is alright, but as a person who plays champs who either have mana regen in their kits ({{champion:38}}) or non-mana champions ({{champion:157}}) these days I understand why spamming is so fun :3\n\nLux does quite some good damage, it’s just it’s a little risky since she’s a high ranged mage and needs to walk up to AA range to take full potential of her passive.\n\nHer cool downs, well, all of the base cool downs, none are lower than 10, that much I can say.\n\n\nBuffs for {{champion:99}}? I wouldn’t mind her having lower cool downs but her scaling on her E could definitely be 65% instead of only 60%.\n\nOther than that, maybe some higher mana regen/lower mana costs but all these buffs would make her Tier 1 mid again (since god tier mids have assloads of mobility)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-15T02:22:23.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doran's Ring and get last hitting. I main Ori man, her mana costs are crippling and I've never had mana problems early. Because I keep my head down and just farm early because she's not a strong laner. Never played Lux so I wouldn't know the case with her.\n\nSyndra is different. She's the Renekton of Mid lane for a reason. She doesn't have a lot of mana problems which is what makes her such a lane bully. Some champs are stronger in the laning phase then others and we just have to accept that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-11T18:10:41.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I just had a look at things.\nIf you want more mana, DON'T start with a Fairie Charm. It takes until level 10 on Lux for 25% mana regen to be more than the three a Doran's Ring gives you.\nIn addition to this though, the Doran's Ring gives you mana back when you kill a unit. You will get more mana regen from a Doran's Ring until late game, where you would get rid of the Ring anyway.\nI play Lux a lot lately though, and my mana management on her isn't too bad. I only go low on mana if I am wasting it all in a desperate attempt to save myself or kill an enemy. I feel like you are spamming your abilities too much.\nLike all mages, she needs her abilities to deal some good damage. That is the point of mages, with only a few exceptions like Diana who can do a bit at least.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarthEvader","date":"2014-12-11T15:36:13.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As i said, starting with a dorans is too hard because you cast basically 3 spells and your done, where as other midlaners ive played, like syndra, you start with a dorans, thus getting an AP advantage...\nHence my comment about how Lux starts behind because her basic attack damage to minions and champs is nothing without her passive - passive requires spells-which require mana- which after 3minutes in youre out of regardless of \"spamming\" or not :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-11T05:47:38.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarthEvader,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Eti6K0Aw,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-11T00:58:20.840+0000)\n> Lux is often seen as OP lately \n\nim out","replies":[]},{"poster":"dslxk","date":"2014-12-11T04:52:07.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux's mana is fine. not that diff from all the other mages like ori or ahri. your mistake imo is getting a fearie charm instead of doran's ring.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-11T02:02:11.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realise how mana hungry most mana based champs are in the early game when you spam spells, right?","replies":[]}]}
