What i noticed was over time is games with a competitive or ranked element have a larger player base. As it allows people to compare their skills against others and see where they place in the population playing those games. \r\n\r\nI have been playing this game since season 2, and 3v3 was a huge element to the LOL community, especially on NA (mainly cause there was a competitive queue). It is the 4th Season the OCE server has been out, and we were told all queues would be eventually out, and 3v3 had been in a test phase ever since. It isn&#039;t really a test if all the elements aren&#039;t on the table to see what happens for a period of time, open up ranked 3v3 for a season, see the numbers and see if it is a queue worth continuing. I guarantee the numbers of total 3v3 players would grow. \r\n\r\nI have played dynamic queue with a group of 3 and wondered why we all wonder at sometime or other, whether it would be easier without the randoms. We always say it would be easier, and i believe it would be. 3v3 is a very competitive game mode, strategies, communication, map awareness and individual skills have to be a lot higher, as it is easier to snowball a gold lead.\r\n\r\nNormal 3v3s on the other hand are not in any way enjoyable. I supported it by solo queuing when i had no one on and with friends when they were. When we played as a 3 man premade vs another premade the games were hard, and the opposition was good to vs, which is fantastic. Soloing on the other hand is the most infuriating thing i have ever done on this game, peoples concept on how to play the game mode, as well as play styles and no communication means it is horrible to play. Trying to teach them how to play the map does not help either. Meaning my game time is spent waiting till 15mins to surrender as the team doesn&#039;t understand rotates and how to apply map pressure. \r\n\r\n3v3 is a game type where 3 friends get together and play competitive, without randoms reducing communication skill, or taking roles. It is easier to put together a 3 man than a 5 man team, meaning more people making a team up to play some competitive 3s while waiting for the rest of the 5 man team. \r\n\r\nDynamic Queue has its place with the primary and secondary picks, it means less toxicity in champ select. But when you allow 3+ people into a solo/duo environment. Thats a competitive team entering and the randoms are put at the mercy of their decisions. \r\n\r\nBring out ranked 3s for a season, or a couple of months, as the test currently is always going to be inconclusive as you aren&#039;t capturing the major competitive player base of the LOL community, and that is a large population. See how the number stack up. More people would play 3v3 in normal&#039;s if ranked was open, so they could practice and get ready to play competitive.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-12T11:55:22.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As always a big fat yes from me for 3v3 ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Mayfly","date":"2016-02-12T11:59:55.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, always good to see support of the 3v3 ranked queue","replies":[]}]}]}
