Why not make superhero skins. {{champion:238}}  could be like Batman with batarangs instead of Shurikens, {{champion:126}}  could be Thor or something. Sion could be like hulk with some giant bad ass war axe and {{champion:53}} /{{champion:412}}  could wear like a spiderman outfit and like have webs when they pull. Also {{champion:112}} could be like doctor doom and stuff and it would be awesome. And {{champion:105}} could be... AQUAMAN!!!
