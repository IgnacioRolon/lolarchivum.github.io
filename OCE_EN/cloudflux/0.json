Now, I&#039;m about to say what some people won&#039;t know about. Usually, when everyone is 100%, I don&#039;t go into the match. So I constantly have to alt+f4(would make different post but too lazy) to get back in. Eventually I do(rito pls fix), but this happened to me for the first time. Instead of having the normal LoL cursor, I have the default one(you know what I mean). I can&#039;t click on anything, such as upgrade/unlock an ability, click on shop, etc etc. So, I decided to alt+f4 and then reconnect... But I can&#039;t. I try to alt+tap, esc, etc. Doesn&#039;t work. I noticed I had 16fps and a decently high ping, which is very unsuall. Me deciding not to let the team down, I restart. Unfortunately I had to update as well.(damn windows)By the time I logged in, reconnected, it was past 8 mins. I apologise to my team(even tho beginner bots :P) constantly. Luckily, I caught up and we won. Then, to my surprise(not really, this is rito we&#039;re talking about)it comes up with the LeaverBuster, saying I have to wait in a lower priority queue etc. I&#039;m like &quot;WTF&quot; I came back, reconnected, as well as it not being my fault.Now, this is annoying. Like, come on rito, you make only one game yet you can&#039;t fix bugs until a decade later. My suggestion is, you can put in a report or something and riot checks, and the leaver buster thing is lifted. Seriously,there are probably many people out there like me who suffer from bugs and get PUNISHED for it. It needs to be fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T00:55:28.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbuster will put a leave marker on your account if you're inactive for greater than five minutes in an active game. This marker is never removed under any circumstances. If you get a marker when you already have a few markers that you acquired recently, you will be put into low priority queue.\n\nWhat seems to have happened is that Windows didn't properly bring window focus to the game's client (probably due to an Windows Update message or something equally stupid), thus why you weren't able to interact with it and the mouse cursor wasn't the League one. Since League is full-screen, you may not have seen the update message come up.\n\nMy suggestion to you is to remedy the problem you're having with not being able to connect to games first. If you need help with that, tell me your OS and ISP.","replies":[]}]}
