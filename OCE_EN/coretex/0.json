None of those times were by choice and almost all of them were caused by internet issues or more recently computer issues. Where I live my net is... well... frankly terrible. My ping can be 30-40 when no-one else is using the internet and it doesn&#039;t drop out when no-one else uses it but this means that I usually confine my playing of LoL to between 5 and 7 am, or occasionally on my weekends Ill play all night when everyone is asleep. I do everything I can to ensure that I will be alone in my using of the internet, both for my own fun and for not-stuffing-over-my-team. However, sometimes flukes happen and the net drops out for a few minutes. Or more recently as I mentioned my computer&#039;s first game from sleep will be ridden with frame rate drops and long load times as it loads everything into memory (I think my memory may be broken but i&#039;m building a new PC in a few months so all will be well soon). \r\n\r\nThis morning I played a game of ARAM because I woke up late and didn&#039;t want to get caught in an hour long normal. Unfortunately the previously mentioned memory problem presented and caused the game to never load (the client closed and started game screen, but that took 2 minutes to appear). I quit and went back into the client to reconnect and this time it loaded the screen, but when I had reconnected I was unable to move, speak or take any action at all. After a few minutes of waiting and trying to click things/buy from shop the game told me that I had been disconnected for afk. I reconnected once again (this time restarting my client) and this time was at last able to move with no framerate or ping issues at all.\r\n\r\nNow, this situation sucks for my team I agree, and It was pretty miserable for me as well. At no point was I purposefully afking or leaving and I spent the whole period of the game trying to connect to the game. I admit that the &quot;first game of the day memory issue&quot; is on my side and unfortunately I cant fix it just yet. The rest of the experience (note that this was the worst memory glitch and only would have lost me the first 2 minutes of the game, 30 seconds of play in ARAM) was as far as I am aware out of my control. \r\n\r\nIf there was something I should have done/could have done please let me know. I have no intention of having a miserable time or inflicting the same on my team. I also really don&#039;t want a punishment withdrawal or anything like that. I am just concerned about situations like this where I had expected the system to realize &quot;oh, hes trying to reconnect --#&amp;*^ bloop, something broke, oh hes reconnecting again&quot; was not the sign of a malicious AFK/Leaver.\r\n\r\nIf there is a question of past offenses this is the first time I have ever gotten any sort of punishment. Although I would be happy to hear from Riot where they think my behavior should improve.\r\n\r\nSorry that this got so long\r\n\r\n**TDLR:** Got a punishment for afking/leaving when I was unable to reconnect despite my best efforts. I thought the system was smarter than this.","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-07-13T12:47:03.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange.
