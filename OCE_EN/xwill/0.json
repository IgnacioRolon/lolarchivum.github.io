After entering my account details, the client opens then closes after a second. Takes multiple attempts to login, and even when I do, I get constantly disconnected from chat after a few minutes.\r\n\r\nI can enter games fine in the brief moments the client works, and nothing is an issue when I&#039;m actually in game. After the game ends, I return to the client and it crashes instantly.\r\n\r\nI have the latest OSX installed, and I&#039;ve also tried repairing and repatching the client but nothing seems to fix it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to fix it? \r\nAny help is appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-11T10:44:25.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey xWill,\n\nPlease give the solutions in the [**Login Issues (Mac)**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761944-Login-Issues#section-mac) Riot Games Support article a try, and let me know if the issue persists.","replies":[{"poster":"xWill","date":"2016-03-12T06:04:20.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I tried everything suggested in that article and still experiencing the same problems.","replies":[]}]}]}
