The main game screen comes up, nothing.\r\nLook for a chest, nothing, look for some kind of token or anything at all &amp; still nothing.\r\nSo i decided ok lets look at my icon&#039;s, and there it is...ok search for the skin and yep, it is there.\r\n\r\nAwesome all looks good im glad about it, but cant help but feel my excitement was unnecessary.\r\nThere was no Flair,excitement nothing, was just added to the account like I&#039;ve just brought any other skin from the store.\r\n\r\nNot sure if i was expecting to much, but even an announcement like you get when moving up a full division would of been nice.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else, feel the lack of something here ?\r\n\r\nFYI: love the skin and happy with my border ^_^.\r\n\r\nCheers Shdw {{champion:432}}","replies":[{"poster":"senorsouley","date":"2016-11-11T06:37:53.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesss finally someone gets it! I thought I didn't get no flair in season 5 coz I was silver and thought you only get the flair if you're gold and now i ended the season in gold, I've never felt so empty. #wheremyflairat #whynoflairrito","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-11T07:01:42.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean there should be flair for every elo, like if you got a skin there should be a like a firework animations and a 'congratulations you're awesome' and if you got silver it should be like 'hey you're average, so ok' and if you got bronze 'either you aren't playing enough or you should stop'.","replies":[]}]}]}
