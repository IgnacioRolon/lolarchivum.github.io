I think alistar is perfectly viable. I have been doing fairly well with him and even in games lost my KDA has been very fair.\r\n\r\nIs it just because people dont see him as being viable anymore or they prefer someone else personally or am i missing something completely ?\r\n\r\nHe has great sustain good cc, very good peel for adc, and has a heal ( small but its still works ) and he dosent really seem to drop off at any point lv2 combo onward is amazing CC and you either gain more damage or become a cc tank.\r\n\r\nBut if i could get some opinions on the matter and maybe a discussion on supports in general :)\r\n\r\nCheers Shdw","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-08-28T10:09:40.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh i trust in Braum...

Which means that the randoms probably played with a noob Alistar (a lot) and they probably lose their lane very hard because of the noob support.  Well past experience can really give you some nightmares so much so that you will convince ppl something is bad just so that you won't experience that same nightmare again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-08-28T04:18:00.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you forgot to mention unbreakable will... easily one of the best tank abilities in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2015-08-28T05:48:33.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yes its amazing. been testing out alot of builds as such for fun and it funny to see how little happens to you in team fights.\n{{item:3110}} {{item:3069}} {{item:3117}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}}  i tend to find i build around these the most just for a best of both worlds option then fill with whats necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-28T06:03:55.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to build talisman but opted for face for extra lane sustain.
