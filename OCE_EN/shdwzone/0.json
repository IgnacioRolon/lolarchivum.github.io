( you are welcome to bring roaming and jungle into this )\r\nWhich Champ&#039;s do you think are dominating the top, and why?\r\nDo you think with the current 40min turtle /tank meta coming back in a big way , that we will see a repeat of S4?\r\n\r\nAnyway just wanting to have a chat about this lanes current state and the game in general.\r\nFeel free to chime in with your * productive thoughts *","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-07-09T01:46:10.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top lane has been **significantly** diversified from last season, the current state of teleport is very prevalent in team based play, _though I'm not a big fan of smite top_. The cool thing about the 'Smite meta' is that it opens up new possibilities for champions to play top lane and scale rather than a lackluster jungle phase into being behind, but overall it's not necessarily a welcome change to having a smite at all. The thing with smite top's is that jungle champions that are bruiser generally can top so if they nerf or change the smite so top can't have it, the jungler's suffer. It's an awkward position and we've seen it leak into the mid lane also with Runeglaive (Gangplank, Nasus, Ezreal, MF)!\n\nTop laners being able to teleport and roam is a major factor into why it's so great now as a lane, champions can be split push or teamfight focused, duel or support oriented, tank or bruiser even.. the possibilities are not explicit in being tank any longer.\nMaokai, Hecarim, Gnar and a couple outliers such as Rumble and Irelia, the more niche picks into strong or skill matchups are generally the champions dominating top. Though Riven mains, Sion's and many more are making an appearance here and there!\n\nI think the key difference between the tank meta coming back is the forced change of the meta introducing multiple extra sieging options, Baron buff and Dragon win conditions are very important for preventing Turtles. Even further is that the tanks are being backed by ranged hyper carries. \nThe cool thing about tanks is that when they fall behind they geneally stay behind, so in this meta the tanks that are winning can close out with strong execution of mechanics.\nIn saying that I find the weakness of the tank meta is this exact fault, where there are barely any chances for comebacks because of the snowballing of tanks in the same meta.\n\n_Happy to answer any further questions you may have_ or I may have missed but these are my thoughts, as an ex-pro and current OPL caster alike.\n\nCheers, \n\nRusty!","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2015-07-09T02:44:15.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Rusty! Was a Good read and some very good points made. <3 ^_^\n\nBut to touch on the top smite Meta.\nTo deal with tis new META is faily simple I feel by putting pressure on the laner. This is works best in a straight up 2v1/1v1 lane set up as a Smite top laner can do decently well in a lane swap scenario while they have to sink some gold into the Smite item to actually be able to use it in a fight. The pressure has to be relatively early into the game in order to take advantage of the lack of escape summoner spell effectively.\n\nThis can still be a pain once mid and late game hit though because your opponent will have two Smites. The easiest way to deal with this is getting vision control and creating picks as a result. If you are able to pick off the top lane or jungle, not only are they missing one of their Smites, they're in a 4v5, making it rather inadvisable for them to try and fight you straight up.\n\nTop lane Smite will be around until Riot changes the way  smite/items work. The combination of these two things is the reason that it has become so popular. The Smite offers incredible dueling and farm potential however to change all this means a large effect on the jungle & its whole state.\n\nAlso i just want to ask what are your thoughts on bruiser {{champion:76}}  top? I main her and do Extremely well, but dont see it to often.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2015-07-11T12:09:11.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruiser Nidalee top ah; my old friend and foe. There's something about her that just keeps me coming back for more.\nNidalee as a bruiser and as a top laner does not really suit the meta as much anymore, with a lot of focus in the top lane being on tanks and the like who can impact the map with teleport, where bruiser Nidalee generally likes to translate being a lane bully into direct split pushing.. it just doesn't 'fit'\n\nIn saying that I find that in 5's if the support commits to a role such as Braum/Naut or Ali who can fill the big front line as a secondary option for your team aside from the Jungler, it opens up the possibilities in top lane immensely to cheese or anything you'd like and are strong on, such as your Nidalee!\nTo build on it a little bit more, the fact most top laners are running smite gives her essentially a free lane, with the capabilities of running ignite or a mobility summoner to provide immediate combat stats during early laning phase, (also try to avoid fizz at all costs, holy crap he wrecks Nidalee).\n\nSo my tl;dr on it is, strong but not always viable. Only situational and even then you need to be an expert!\n\nHope I shed some light on the subject for you,\n\nRusty","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2015-07-12T01:14:26.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Rusty.\nThanks again for your insight, seems you and I are the only ones who want to talk about the top lane haha.\nBut thank you for your time and effort you put into your responses, i really could keep going on forever about top and the game itself, so i will leave it at this :).
