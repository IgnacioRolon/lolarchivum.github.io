I main support but I'll usually go something quirky, Blitz sometimes, Morgana, occasionally Leo or even Trundle depending on who they pick.\n\nI really don't like playing engage champs at my elo (gold) in soloq because half the time you see a great opportunity, ping, go balls out all in only to see your adc farming behind you who doesn't follow up. Better and easier to play something with some form of dis-engage I guess because you can't rely on others to play their roles.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-27T04:47:34.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel morg, blitz or leona are really that quirky... quirky support is more like sup mundo (you just do so much damage), sup brand (so much damage), sup trundle, sup lulu (divebomb people with twitch, then just buff the hell out of him when he pops out ulting and the burst is amazing and nobody can escape due to lulu ult), sup fiddlesticks (because people somehow think this is good?) or if you really just want to piss people off and your adc picks kalista and the enemy adc picks something with high atk speed, pick rammus. I haven't done rammus kalista in ranked since I'm not great at rammus and nobody plays kalista, but in the 6 normal games I've done it with a friend, 4/6 times the enemy adc went afk or toplane as soon as we hit 6 and kalista ult into rammus ult then rammus knockup into taunt with his w up and boom dead.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-27T04:50:55.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus + Kalista is not really amazing but support rammus is great against assassins which usually bone kalista pretty hard and the amount of damage you do and the amazing single target cc, makes the enemy adc/carry assassin cry. Imo it's much more stupid than kalusta+alistair and though not as good as ali, rammus deals more damage and the lockdown is slightly longer and again it's just so much damage even though rammus will build full tank and having a rammus botlane who has a thornmail and a face of the mountain is just so annoying since hitting him is a big no no for adcs.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-27T05:26:21.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only problem with rammus sup is that, pre that 6 you have nothing vs a mage sup that will just poke you for days. I know we are talking a cheese comp with Rammus + Kalista but it would be horrible lane pre 6 and even if you arnt vs'ing a ranged sup, say leona you will find yourself having to take the cc yourself or peel her from you ADC leaving the enemy ADC free. you have to be in there face and no sup/adc will let that happen willingly.  I find something like {{champion:429}} {{champion:111}}  to keep it to using an adc or you have {{champion:1}} {{champion:111}}  or better know as the Bio Shock lane haha.  The hook into passive stun from {{champion:111}} then stun from annie R from naugh then Tibbers from annie...... thats a kill 99%.   Syndra Zilean. You can put a time bomb on an enemy minion, use Syndra to toss it with her W onto an enemy champion...lol  or if you just want to be the most anoying people on the planet Heimerdinger and Shaco, they cant do anything","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-28T02:17:21.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when I mained heimerdinger, my favourite botlane cancer was Gnar+Heimer and Kogmaw+Heimer. 15 minuntes into the game a 9-0 Nidalee comes to gank a 0-0-1 Heimerdinger and 1-0-0 free farmed Kogmaw. She comes in from the side to help save the Lucian+Leona botlane who have just been zoned from any cs by the asshole heimerdinger who just won't stop spamming his dance and threatens to 100-0 either of them with an UltW if they try to get a single minion. She comes in, with a spear from the bush on kogmaw, she pounces, she gets stun grenaded midpounce, Kogmaw activates his W, whilst nidalee is standing in the middle of 3 heimerdinger turrets and in 0.4s she's been 100-0'd and Lucian has just been ult rocket sniped and she just starts swearing in allchat and then goes afk.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-28T03:04:40.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha sounds like fun, I could imagine the GG @ 20.   Himer is just one of those champs that owns a lane and even if you can counter him , he is hard to shut down, even early he's hard to deal with well not him just his turrets, you kill 1 and there is still 2 more and if u get another his cds back up to place more haha.\n\nBut the best thing i love to see is a proper adc/sup lane , just going ham and melting everything as a team, i love seeing synergy and what comes of it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-27T03:20:30.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain  ''half the time you see a great opportunity, ping, go balls out all in only to see your adc farming behind you who doesn't follow up.''\nPlaying zyra alot and feeling this very much, as i have alot of presents in the lane and ill get a good snare and see nothing but there backs as my ADC just sits there. I dont mind sitting back and just waiting for laning phase to be over but I dont like doing nothing. I find myself playing these engage champs so i can be proactive, but generally in champ select ill ask the ADC how they want to play offence/defense and pick based on that as well as trying my best to counter pick the lane. People say its hard to carry as a support but if You play an engaging champ you can do alot more to help you ADC as you can engage in def or offense. I feel the more cc / poke the better if you can own the lane and make them play on the back foot you have a huge advantage but it also leaves you open to ganks if your pushing to hard.

Sure, he requires a lot of skill, map awareness and split second decision making but when you've got those, like they do in the pro scene, hold on for the ride! From his ability to trade in the laning phase to life saving tunnels and game changing ults there's a huge amount of space for experimentation and creativity within his kit that makes him such a great all around pick. Considering that lane swaps aren't a thing and Bard does well in 2v2 match ups I'd imagine he's going to be seen at least a few times at worlds.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-28T05:13:14.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha Thanks for noticing <3  I love him was my first lv 7 champ, And something i can play for days on end win or loose i always enjoy him very much.\nHe is ..I feel top picks for support , his trade in the early laning phase is amazing. Though i do feel he has his place. His kit works well with vayne for example but vayne lacks the range, so leaving her in a 2v1 while you roam and collect chimes can be a big no no, but you should always pick when you do this, as you are pushed up or returning to lane have you just won a fight have have enough vision to roam with out the worry of a gank ect ect. I see this as being one of the biggest mistakes {{champion:432}}  players make, they want them chimes like a leprechaun whats his charms :P\nHis ult can be very mismash as well as there is a cast and land delay over a distance so you have to predict and if you get it right its amazing but if you get it wrong it can be a very bad outcome.. i know ive done this more than i care to admit haha. But I think {{champion:432}} is one of the best champs out there always fun always fast paced.\n\n@Nijiiyo \nA league champion walks into a bar.\nHe asks the Barman \"Can I have a pint of your finest ale?\"\nThe Barman replies \"I can't serve you, you're {{champion:432}} .\"\n#Cringe ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-28T11:03:58.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheeky, Cheeky ; )","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-09-27T18:52:03.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You guys forgot about Karma who is the really dominant bot lane support.

Every one has see a lulu R someone who has just gone headfirst into an enemy team and gone oh #$@* haha.\n\nYou have a shield , attk speed buffs,long range poke, good dmg, a hard CC and a perma 2sec slow on Q and an amazing ult that saves lifes and lets u go ham. Apart from not having a heal and you can negate that by buying {{item:3174}} and using the passive with shield so shes a good all rounder and can peel effectively with her slow and hard CC so whats not to like....\n\n\nZil on the other hand..well he can stun with a double bomb , slow enemy's  speed up allies, save someone from death and zone out a lane... but he has no real peel or heals or shields for his adc so there is better picks by far, still fun though, but not something i would pick as there is alot better.\n\neye is good as its a gold income item and ward item all in one, it then allows you to build another item since your saving 1 item spot, however frost queens has it's place the slow is very powerful and having {{item:2045}} as your 2nd item with the 500hp and 20% cd on active items for the sake of {{item:3222}} {{item:3190}}  ect ect  Its really a personal preference and play style as each will benefit your team in some way. personally eye of the watchers is the best way to go as u get the hp/ap/regen/ward all in 1 item as frees up 1 slot, with frost queen u only get the +25ap and a active slow but you loose the hp and the extra slot. If your playing someone who;s buying into alot of active items the Ruby sighstone can be amazing, with 20% cd on {{item:3512}} {{item:3060}} for example and the {{item:3222}} {{item:3190}} and so on but its best to build for your team needs, and if your playing karma for example having frost queens slow into your W ( snare) with you R-E your whole team for movement speed to follow up can be an amazing play. But as Ive said is specific to your champ and play style and what your team needs. Most items have there META place while others have there own little niche corner.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-27T02:51:33.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say Janna and Sona are dominating botlane currently. Due to wind speakers blessing, ardent censor and Mikael's crucible buffs, their heals/shields have become much stronger than previous enabling them to have a safer laning phase while Sona in particular puts out a lot of burst. Sona's mini rework definitely pushed her out on top with changes to how every one of her abilities function. \n\nRiot in the past patches has tried to give initiating or engage supports such as {{champion:111}} and {{champion:89}}  some buffs, not to say they are weak as an attempt to bring them into the meta as they are inherently strong against the top tier supports at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-27T03:30:35.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see how alot of Sona players  play very aggressively due to there poke and as you said she is very good at it.

Early game alot of supports lv1-3 feel very strong with poke and engage , untill 6 you dont see much more then after that you kinda fall off as there kit dosent change to much as ( unless they are going full mage/tank) so this is when utility of the champ comes in.
