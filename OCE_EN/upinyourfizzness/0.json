Bard, Rek&#039;sai, Kalista, Azir... all these champs have so much more to offer when it comes to the lore of league. all of their lores are only around 4 lines long. i miss the days when we could look forward to something amazing like yasuo&#039;s lore and his connection to Riven, which mind you has still not been confirmed, giving us the freedom to explore with their lore. take a look at Azir&#039;s lore...\r\n\r\n&quot; once a mortal man blinded by his own hubris, Azir has recently returned as an Ascended being with unmatched dominion over the burning sands. He seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory, but but some dispute his right to rule them. Azir&#039;s power, however, is undeniable.&quot;\r\n\r\nthis is a pathetic attempt to give us a story that we can work with to create an entire universe around. i keep coming back to Yasuo&#039;s lore because it created such a hype with all the conspiracy theories and so on. i miss all of the hype about the interactions between characters. Jinx and Vi are a perfect example, or even vel&#039;koz and helmet bro for gods sake. i think that although it would be stupid to have an avenger type thing where they get EVERY champ together but, i would love to see several groups get together and create a lore. I really hope that this will unfold with the full release of ekko. if they could bring together Ekko, Vi, Jinx, Urgot and Victor all together with a champion in the future, i reckon there would be so much more hype. we need a team of writers, or even just community conspirators to give Riot some ideas on how they can up their game in the lore section of league. who knows, if this were to happen, i reckon that Riot could pull off creating a full movie on the lore of a selection of champions. how many of you would love to see either a weekly animation based around the champions and their interactions, or even a full fledged movie. if Riot could step up their game ( Although i still think they are doing a phenomenal job) then i think we would see an entire part of league being revived, expanded and improved upon.\r\n\r\nleave your comments on what you reckon should happen :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-17T11:39:54.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito gave up on actually being fucked with lore, which is why they did the lore retcon.\n\nThey SHOULD put more effort in, sadly it doesn't mean they will.","replies":[{"poster":"UpInYourFizzness","date":"2015-05-18T06:59:21.082+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=W92rplTF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-17T11:39:54.221+0000)\n>\n> Rito gave up on actually being fucked with lore, which is why they did the lore retcon.\n> \n> They SHOULD put more effort in, sadly it doesn't mean they will.\n\nand thats the thing that annoys me. they are a multi million/billion (not sure which) dollar comapny and yet they cant be bothered putting any story behind the character.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-20T15:52:29.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is sacrificing lore quality to make it easier for them to design champions, completely removing the intricacies of why they want to be in the LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. This means more and more champions, more intricate abilities which may equate to better gameplay. \nAzir literally has no need to be in the League of Legends because summoner's don't exist meaning he can make as many sandcastles as he likes around Runeterra, especially in his most beloved Shurima.\n\nA large majority don't mind not knowing anything about lore. Riot is targeting the large majority so that they may enjoy the game more often improving ratings and whatnot. I'm probably the only one in my group of associates that play League that really care about lore matchups in game. I decided to play Renekton because not only is he a strong laner, but also has conflict with Nasus.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-20T15:14:50.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot. \nRead this now please. \nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-19T01:46:43.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That has actually bothered me too. I mean, it is much more engaging to play a champion that you know a little bit about than it is to play a champion which all you know of them is that they are a bird (is the word). Maybe go through and fix up the lore in an update or something, make more lores like Yasuo's or Xin Zhao. I even found Galio's (what is a Galio?) lore to be incredibly interesting. If not about their story then what about their intentions for joining the League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-19T04:30:07.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(none of the lore your talking about is any longer canon)\n\nRito decided it was too hard to do lore, therefore said \"all lore isn't canon cause we say so\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T09:25:20.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"either copypasta or bump","replies":[{"poster":"UpInYourFizzness","date":"2015-05-17T09:36:12.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=W92rplTF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-17T09:25:20.365+0000)\n>\n> either copypasta or bump\n\nyou know what to do ;)","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T09:38:38.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=UpInYourFizzness,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=W92rplTF,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-17T09:36:12.945+0000)\n>\n> you know what to do ;)\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"jozza123","date":"2015-05-17T11:01:37.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can shuffle my pancake ;)","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T11:02:57.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jozza123,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=W92rplTF,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-17T11:01:37.489+0000)\n>\n> you can shuffle my pancake ;)\n\nOooh bby xD Come give me some of dat sweet syrup (LOL WTF)","replies":[{"poster":"jozza123","date":"2015-05-18T22:57:09.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i do not even know :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2015-05-18T07:08:39.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A full movie would be nice, Though weekly animations could be just scrap.\n\nThe lore bothers me, and all those who write fanfictions about League of Legends... the only lore's that actually make it and is mainstream on the Fanfiction League of Legends archive is the Yasuo and Riven one... since it is apparently the most hyped up lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-17T11:52:42.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PREACH!","replies":[]}]}
