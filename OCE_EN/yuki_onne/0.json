At least double it or something. 51 for a normal game.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-25T11:17:18.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it takes roughly 10 games to get 1000 IP (unless you are on some crazy lose streak). So takes an \"average\" player about 9-10 days to get 6300 IP.\nI think thats ok. Seems like a crazy amount for new players but its really not.\n\nBelieve me when I say, once you own all the champions and runes you need, you realise pretty fast how quickly you gain IP.\nI mean, 60K unused IP made in just under 3 months.

It really does take way too long to get anywhere in this game. To prepare for ranked i need to buy so many runes and champs for all roles. It really is stupid how little we get. Maybe if we could get an ip boost that stays until we hit lvl 30","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-25T10:04:11.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting 51 IP in normal wins, then something is wrong. But losses always award less IP, especially shorter games.
