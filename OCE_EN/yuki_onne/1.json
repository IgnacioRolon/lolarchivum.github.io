Nocturne stood there watching Zed sleep soundlessly. His white eyes showed no emotion as his corrupted heart hungered for more agony. Nocturne slowly crept closer to Zed, his mouth curling upwards into a wicked smile. &quot;Drip drop, the sound of blood,&quot; Nocturne whispered in a blood curdling tone as he slithered closely around Zed. His mouth now had turned into a snarl. Zed&#039;s eyes flashed open in an instant, his body paralysed as sweat began to trickle down his face. &quot;I sense fear. Do I scare you, summoner?&quot;. \r\n&quot;What do you want Nocturne?&quot;, Zed questioned in a calm voice.\r\n&quot;Let us become one Zed, together we achieve power and with power, fear&quot;, Nocturne replied in a daunting manner while staring directly to his eyes.\r\n&quot;Do not deny me Nocturne&quot;\r\n&quot;I know...... and that is why you&#039;ll be an amazing vessel. A minor pawn within my grasp. A dangling, helpless creature at hand&quot;\r\nNocturne placed two sharp knife like fingers onto Zed&#039;s chin and applied pressure, his nails slightly digging into his skin, &quot;Embrace every drop of blood, every pitiful scream, _every shadow_&quot; Nocturned whispered as his mouth became unhinged and devoured Zed.\r\n\r\n**_None Escape Their Shadow_**\r\nZed woke up immediately, his crimson eyes glowed within the dark room. He turned his head to the right, watching the moon spill its light into the room and creating a shadow of his window. He laid there thinking, was he an innocent man possessed by Nocturne? Unable to speak nor move. Would people of Ionia accept his burden if he was to return? Would Shen even forgive him for his sins? He re positioned his head and whispered to himself &quot;What I have done...... cannot be undone&quot;. Zed slowly closed his eyes and drifted to sleep, embracing every shadow that gripped onto him and pulled him deeper into his monstrous ways.","replies":[{"poster":"Waysted1","date":"2016-06-29T00:01:27.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is great","replies":[]}]}
