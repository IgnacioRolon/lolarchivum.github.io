I got to s1 eventually and from that point on I&#039;ve started to decline a lot, and I swear to god, it&#039;s not my fault ( I know it&#039;s a cliche ). Now I&#039;m in S5 with 0 points, and if you look at my previous match history you&#039;ll see that I barely ever lose out my lane, and I try to carry, but no one can carry that, I just finished a game where I was at one point 5/1 on Lucian, with a support Morgana who gave out first blood, then died 2 times after that, in like 3 minutes. And not to mention top Yasuo, who ended up with 0/8, next to 0/10 Morgana. I get it that someone loses a lane, I do it too, but I don&#039;t feed as much, these games are beyond recovery, 10 minutes into the game they&#039;re all godlike. And I just keep on losing, and losing, when I win a game I have to be like 20/2 or beyond fed to carry this. Last 5 victories I had were 22/3/10 with Diana, 21/8/11 with Jayce, 21/2/12 and 12/4/18 with Ez and 20/2/6 with 318 farm with Graves top. This is something that keeps on happening and I can&#039;t deal with it anymore, I&#039;m thinking of quitting the League for good, this is just frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-28T04:08:44.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't follow metas so hard, that your at the point where your  not even checking  enemy item builds or trying to build for how your team is playing.

I can hold my own in lane against gold and plat players and yet I play solo queue dynamic on the current patch and cannot for the life of me win 50% of my games in bronze matches. Even duo isn't enough, so I've been forced to trio or quad man dynamic to have half a chance. It's a real shame because this game used to be fun and if you put in the hard work to improve you would see results but not anymore =-\\","replies":[]}]}
