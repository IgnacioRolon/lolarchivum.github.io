The top prize was 1000RP, but in this case I happened to get 1300/1400RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-27T02:53:46.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By chance have you changed your name between now and the contest?

If it was a confusion with summoner names, I would have received 1000RP, being the top prize for the contest (getting a S+), but I happened to received 1300/1400RP instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-27T11:45:52.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah okie dokie. Unlikely the second amount was related to the contest then, any chance it was a gift you missed? I think they only appear on the little bell in the top right now. Past that, your best bet is to submit a support ticket enquiring where the extra RP came from, since they'll be able to see the source :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
