Then I refereed a friend to league of legends and to help them start off I created a new account to play with them. I have found that it is extremely discouraging for new beginners to play the game. Unless they have an experienced player with them there is almost no guide on roles, common playing style and normal in game commands.\r\n\r\nProblems with starting to play this game from the beginning:\r\n1) Not being able to use all summoner spells is a massive disadvantage. Beginners don&#039;t get to use flash until they reach the lvl of 8. In every game played this is the one that is mostly used and yet those that start the game are unable to use it. I believe we should let them learn to play with flash being a main skill they get used to. Instead of always using heal and ghost and then being unused to flash later on. \r\n\r\n2) In the early lvls there are a lot of smurfs. But with a new player playing the game they have no idea what to do. This therefore creates anger towards new players for having no idea to do things like; be a support in general, two in bot lane one in top and so on, and when to attack or defend. This mostly comes from experience but since there is no guide the new players are getting abused at in order to learn. Therefore you&#039;ll be loosing many new players with no idea of the game. I suggest a 2nd tutorial where it shows you how to support, jungle, adc, mid and top.\r\n\r\n3) I believe not having runes in the jungle is much harder. Almost all the junglers rely on runes and masteries to survive the jungle except for of course warwick. Therefore we should have tier 1 runes which help deal damage to minions and monsters. \r\n\r\nAnyways these are a few of my ideas. I love this game and without new players it won&#039;t reach its full potential.

There are \"common playing style\"s but by no means does a person *have to* play by them or *even know they exist*. Of course, that will probably be to their detriment to not knowing, but if we just forced everyone to play the exact same way every game then things would get really boring really fast.\n\nThe reason why the summoner spells are restricted per level is to 1. Not overwhelm the player with options, 2. Provide incentive to level up and play more and 3. Allow them to try out all the spells, know what they do, without feeling like they're missing out because there are \"better\" spells. It's not like once they reach the level for Flash, they're immediately put into ranked and have to play with all that pressure. They can still take many games analysing and playing with each spell to see which of which is better in what scenario.\n\nPlease remember, \"top, jung, mid, adc, support\" is only apart of the \"meta\" which doesn't have to be followed strictly. If you were a truly experienced player, as in playing the game before it got to a professional level, where there *was* no such thing as a meta (so players where playing any champs in any positions, remember roaming Blitz kill-bot?) you would realise that this doesn't need to be enforced on new players. If they can manage without this knowledge, then they might stumble upon a strategy that's simply better than what everyone else is using and hence change the meta themselves without realising it, and I love it when that happens. Meta shifts are good.\n\nSmurfs are of course detrimental to the on-boarding process, as it's a wildly inaccurate portrayal of what players should be expected to do at their levels. Of course, this could be seen in the light of, \"I can't wait to be as good as them, so I'll learn from what they do,\" but more often leads to player's frustration at the fact that someone at their same level is capable of doing so much more than them (some smurfs/boosters will not advertise that they are doing it, because it's against the EULA, hence they'll think it's just another new player).\n\nAbout the jungle, though, I partially agree. Earlier on, the jungle was just a 'resource' that players could go to to get gold and experience, as an alternative to lanes. Eventually, it was seen to be extremely efficient to have one player specialise in slaying monsters in the jungle and occasionally have them assist other lanes; that's how the jungler role was created. Runes weren't as necessary to taking monsters from the jungle. Now, it seems, to be taking monsters from the jungle, you have to spend a lot more resources yourself (health and mana) in order to do so, making it ever more prevalent to have a player specialising in slaying them to efficiently make use of your team-wide resources. What I think is that Riot want to make the jungle seem like an area that *only players with the correct runes and masteries can actually go into* so that players can focus more on making sure they can properly lane and roam better. If that's their aim, then what they've done make sense. If viewing it from the old perspective (jungle as a resource, not another way of playing the game entirely), then this is detrimental. Your suggestion on having runes specifically to deal damage to monsters and minions in the jungle (if adjusted to only assist in dealing damage to monsters) is a great one, for it allows inexperienced players to try out that jungle role they may want to genuinely play early, but there's a catch. Runes cost IP, which even as easy as it is to gain in the early levels, is not unlimited. You might be causing players to pigeon-hole into this role by doing this, limiting what they can do elsewhere. Runes and masteries matter a lot in the early levels.\n\ntl dr; The changes have been made intentionally so as not to overwhelm new players.\n\nAnd last note, this probably isn't the area to be discussing such matters. You'd want to head over to the [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations) board to discuss player-made content (including suggestions on how the on-boarding process should/shouldn't be changed).\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2015-04-23T02:30:54.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i understand how you feel i tried to get my gf in to the game and smurf would go crazy at her trying to learn and steal all the fun i understand that we have bans for ranked players and stuff like that\nbut at lower lvl should be harsher to teach the respect","replies":[]}]}
