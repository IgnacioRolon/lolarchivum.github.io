I know what i said was bad and disgusting and i should have never said such a thing.I know that doesn&#039;t justify anything but this game has been a way for me and my family to connect as my uncle and brother and cousins all play with me including all the friends I&#039;ve gotten in to the game. I would like to be giving one more chance and have my ban changed to a 2 week suspects. As me my family and friends who all play league of legends have been searching for the past 2 day for a way to help me get un-ban and it has been unsuccessful this is why i am asking from the bottom of my heart to give me one chance. As I will change to become a better player for the community. I know all the other Un Ban me forums say the same thing. The lesson I&#039;ve learnt has been a good one and i am willing to change to better the community for all league of legends players. I have summited a ticket to riot (Link above) with my request to be un-ban. Please give me one chance to show that it is possible for toxic players to change if we are given a chance I know riot has giving chances before in the past with only 5% of players actual changing to better the community and i know i can become one of those 5% of players. As i really don&#039;t want to lose my stuff that i&#039;ve spent lots of time earning and buying. Even if you can give me some advice on where to look or who to contact so i can sent a video with me apologising for my behaviour i would really be grateful for it.

The steps are;\n- 10 game chat restriction\n- 25 game chat restriction\n- 2 week suspension\n- permanent suspension\n\nIf you had previously received a 2 week ban or chat restrictions, those are classified as your warnings and chances to reform your behaviour for the better. Very rarely are bans lifted, especially when the behaviour was so toxic.\n\nAlso be sure to go to your friends and family and talk through any issues you may be feeling IRL.
