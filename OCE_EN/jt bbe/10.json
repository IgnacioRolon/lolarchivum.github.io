This has never happened before and only just happen now just as i finished updating the patch, i wasnt able to do anything and i was also forced to remake a game and lose lp, how is this fair when it wasnt my fault that made the client screw up? What am i meant to do riot when your clients are always doing this to people? Please fix this, thanks.","replies":[]}
