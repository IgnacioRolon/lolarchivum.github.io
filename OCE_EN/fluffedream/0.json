You still have to pay RP for champion specific eternals. I think It's incredibly disrespectful to the playerbase to continue trying to 'dress up' selling stats to us. ESPECIALLY after removing the stats page and now essentially making us pay for it. When eternals was proposed earlier there was a ton of feedback from the playerabse and it seems that Riot has taken almost none of that. Riot has failed to deliver on this completely and no matter how they dress this up I refuse to pay for stats.","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2020-02-20T07:12:23.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude , it's a business model - the game itself is free and they're not asking you to pay.\n\nThere are MANY games online that are subscription base, in-game item mall, pay for expansions, etc... They do that to pay the developers and other staff that make the game possible.\n\nWhile it sucks to have to pay for content, it's understandable that they have to pay people... or would you work for free?\n\nMe for once, i'm not gonna pay for the extras because I don't feel i HAVE TO - actually, never spent any money in the game myself. it's not compulsory, so yeah...","replies":[{"poster":"FluffeDream","date":"2020-02-20T07:24:25.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Throughout the lifetime of league of legends the game has generated over $20 billion in revenue. League of legends is BY FAR the most profitable game out there on the market right now. League of legends is making Riot literally billions of dollars every single year. I completely understand that it is a free to play game and It has to have some forms of monetization (which it has and which make them billions) but making us pay to view stats is just absurd no matter how they dress it up.","replies":[{"poster":"The White Hatter","date":"2020-02-20T09:08:43.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Revenue is not the same as profit - whilst their revenue is that high, they also have high costs given the quality of content, not just in game but also with the music stuff, tournaments, etc...\n\nI'm just exposing the other side of it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2020-02-20T07:15:10.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to Riot Logic, enjoy your stay.","replies":[]}]}
