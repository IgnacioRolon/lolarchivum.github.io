Multiple people have the same issue and not sure if anything is even being considered of being fixed.\r\n\r\nProblems include:\r\n- client crashing during load screen \r\n- client says game in progress - didnt load in the first place and you cannot reconnect resulting in you being afk and being penalised lp because of ritos broken client. To fix this issue you have to restart your pc and by the time thats finished and relogged into lol reform has already been accepted\r\n- client puts you into a black load screen - cant even reconnect does some thing - have to restart pc to fix\r\n\r\nbeing penalised in ranked for riots client having these issues shouldnt be a thing. The fact people including myself have lost 18+ lp because of riots client not working is absolutely absurd.\r\n\r\nplz fix. thx","replies":[]}
