When I finished the game, I got a message from LeaverBuster telling me that due to \"consistent AFK behaviour\", I was being punished with a 20 minute wait before my next 5 games. Is this a joke? This is the first time ever I have received such a message or warning, and the FIRST ROUND of penalty is a 20 fucking minute wait before each game?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-22T05:09:53.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bull%%%%.\n\nI've had several leaves in the new leaver buster, and i'm still yet to get anything.","replies":[{"poster":"heee3de","date":"2015-02-22T05:31:45.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh one example, well wrap it up everyone this guy has put in the necessary research to reach a logical conclusion.\n\nSeriously though if that's how you normally think, just don't bother ever sharing your opinion with anyone, it's worthless.\n\nLooking for a Rioter to address this issue, it's clear many other people are having the same problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-02-22T06:30:26.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it was ranked (looking at your match history, it probably was) leaver buster is even harsher.
