This is a secret which is only revealed after the fact. \r\nI have been suspended two times and if it happens again it will likely be a permanent suspension. \r\nThe problem with this is that the items I paid for with real money in a business transaction are actually for sale, because I bought them and I am protected under consumer protection laws. \r\nBan or not, if I pay for something and it is taken away, then my money should be taken back and given to me for the things I paid for. \r\nI do not trust Riot at this point because they banned be for vary vague reasons and claim their summoners code states that being toxic or mean can get you a suspension in the hopes of reforming my behavior. \r\nOkay here is a simple solution, CHAT BAN. \r\nThe game should be trying to get as many players as possible, not kick people out who get voted to be banned because they said something or made a mistake. I didn&#039;t break any real rules in this last ban, I just wasn&#039;t being very nice and neither was my team, so why am I the person who gets the ban? (Don&#039;t answer that I don&#039;t care) \r\nRiot is not your parents, they can&#039;t insist on reforming your behavior, and the fact that behavior is an issue is due to the internet sucking real bad and the fact the client supports chat. \r\nThey need to fix the problem and stop banning people and making enemies. \r\nI assure you if enough people who paid hundreds of dollars for RP and skins start getting banned, there will be a huge lawsuit for unfair trade practices.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-08T08:01:49.920+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sounds like you have yet to read the [ToU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and [EULA](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/eula), which you *must* have agreed to before actually playing (this happens on account creation, with *every* patch and every time the \"agreements\" are updated).

Its only a matter of time before someone seriously makes a case against Riot. Given I am not permanently banned yet, if I do become permanently banned I will be seeking the money back and not rest until I get it, and I am willing to go so far as to start a case against Riot and follow it to wherever it leads. \nPunishments and bans are a stupid attempt to fix their broken game, its not our responsibility to behave or conduct ourselves, they should be giving out incentives for people who don't afk, and finish the match, but not banning players. They should want the most people playing so they make the most money. \nAll this banning system is doing is making people frustrated and hate each other more, and its bad PR because I am only going to tell people what has happened and be pissed off at Riot. \nNo one is reforming anyone's behavior. \nIf they reserve the right to ban people who paid money for stuff, then the player should get their money back, its only fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-09T02:09:01.755+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"First of all, as you say, you rent the content from Riot. You legally acknowledge this every time you click yes to the EULA and ToS so ignorance of the fact won't help your legal defence any. If you leave or get kicked out of a rental home, you don't get the rent back now do you?\n\nSecond, even if you did own the content, there is an exception in the ACL regarding \"Life of Purchase\" and returns. My getting your account banned you would effectively be ending the life of purchase (same as if you say, dropped a laptop on the ground then jumped on it a bunch of times) and you would still have no good legal defence. \n\nThird, you don't get banned for no reason. A false positive may happen every once and a while, but for one person twice? Sorry but no. If you really think it was a false ban then post your chat logs and prove it and maybe something can be done about it.\n\nFourth, the vast majority of players would see a chat restriction and go \"oh shit, I need to fix this, if only so I don't get banned and lose all my shit\", whereas your attitude seems to be \"I was an asshole ruining a whole buncha people's games and I got banned for it? Nah screw that I'm gonna sue Riot to preserve my right to be an asshat\". For some players, the only deterrent to negative behaviour is the idea of permanent monetary loss, for some others, even that is not enough and they get banned.\n\nThis is a free to play game. Easy to join and easier to leave. The biggest deterrent to new players isn't how much money they have to spend to play it (WoW) or the lack of quality content (most other ftp MMOs) or anything like that it's the toxicity. If you're first game as a new player is someone abusing you, insulting your race and threatening to do things to your mother, you aren't really going to be inclined to stick around are you?\n\nIf you really think you can sue them though, you're welcome to take it up with their legal team. Good luck to you. OR, hear me out here, you could just stop being toxic in game.

Terms of use are not laws that govern fair trade agreements. Imagine if you were to rent a house for a month, and in the terms of agreement it specified if you are too loud, then you can be banned from using the house. Well you pay the rent for that month, and the landlord tells you that you were too loud when you paid, and bans you from the house for 2 weeks. Hey, you don't own the house, and you broke the terms of use agreement by being too loud. This is illegal no matter what the terms of use are because state and federal laws dictate what you can and can't do in tenant situation to protect people from being abused or taken advantage of. \nBusiness laws and consumer protection laws work the same way on the state and federal levels, it protects people from exploitable situations when making business transactions, which in this case is clearly exploitable. \n\nFirst the rules are not clear, meaning there is not an actual standard for being banned, its based on how others feel you have acted and its automated, so its not based on any standard. \nAlso they don't tell you the things you pay for are rented, plus give you no way of getting your money back if they decide to ban you. \nLastly the perma ban doesn't keep players from playing the game, it just takes access to the account with the money spent on it, which doesn't ban people from the game, it just steals their money and makes them have to pay for all the stuff again on another account if they want it back, which is exploitable. \nWhy ban people if it doesn't work anyway, and why steal people's money? This is not legal or right no matter what they say in the ToU because they can't write their own laws, no one voted on these terms and on how to ban people, and its a unfair without and real clear standard.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-09T02:00:50.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be clear here, there are literally thousands of game companies that use agreements that are basically the same as what Riot have set out, if this kind of thing was illegal you can bet that there would be at least *one* case where someone had successfully won in this kind of situation, and if that had happened you can bet all the other companies would have taken notice and changed their agreements.\n\nI would also like to say that your analogy isn't too great for the point you're trying to make. There are laws regarding \"noise pollution\", so if there were something in the rental agreement about the landlord reserving to right to revoke your access to the property should you be \"too noisy\", and they had received complaints from neighbours about the noise, then (based on what I understand) they *would* have the right to exercise that part of the rental agreement.\n\nThings aren't necessarily as black and white as you seem to think they are, there's a lot of nuances involved in these kinds of legal situations that make it basically wrong to say that a situation is always one way in the eyes of the law.\n\n> Also they don't tell you the things you pay for are rented, plus give you no way of getting your money back if they decide to ban you.\n\nAs I pointed out before, Riot do indeed inform players that all accounts and \"virtual items\" are indeed owned by Riot and \"rented out\". If you were to go to court over something like this, it would certainly come up about the agreements and whether you had accepted them. If you were to answer \"yes\", they would point out that it is all explained in the ToU and, thus, you *must* have been well aware of the terms of purchasing RP. If you were to answer \"no\", they would point out that you have no legal position to take responsibility for the account, and therefor have no case.\n\nQuite simply, ignorance isn't a defence.\n\n> First the rules are not clear, meaning there is not an actual standard for being banned, its based on how others feel you have acted and its automated, so its not based on any standard.\n\nThere have been plenty of discussions involving Rioters about what is and isn't acceptable behaviour. There are plenty of ways for players to find out what will likely result in a punishment. The baseline of it is \"don't be a jerk\", which should be pretty simply to accomplish considering it takes no effort whatsoever to *not* do something.\n\nAs a final note, if a player get's perma-banned, then chooses to make a new account and purchase RP, that's not Riot exploiting the player. That's the player making the conscious decision to spend money on a game where they've been previously banned. Riot isn't responsible for the actions of the players, and don't try to argue that they are because that won't go down in court at all.","replies":[{"poster":"DBS Ronovon","date":"2017-07-09T02:35:13.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Business and Professions Code - BPC\nDIVISION 7.
