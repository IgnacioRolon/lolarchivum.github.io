Remember, these champions are tested and changed on the PBE too.\nWe get the same illusion of \"This champ is %%%%\" as well, I think, due to the number of people who can't play said champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss of Souls","date":"2014-12-16T09:29:39.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah its just the unfamiliarity that makes them seem op","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2014-12-17T23:48:47.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And even then, when a champ comes out (like {{champion:150}} and {{champion:268}}  ) people will try them out for a couple of games and then decide that they are weak and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ champions.

And the people who left after a couple of tries start shouting 'OP' and they will be nerved.\n\nAnother example was the numerous threads about how OP {{champion:25}} is. She isn't OP at all.
