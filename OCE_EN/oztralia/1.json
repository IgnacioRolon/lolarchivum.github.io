I won 6 out of 10 games. good scores on all games but yet still get shafted to bronze 4? which is cute considering some players in silver had less game wins and when I viewed their stats had worse scores?!

Usually this means that someone will begin a new ranked season with the MMR of the players 1-2 divisions less than they were before. They play the 10 games (with the first couple having the most impact on mmr changes), as they do the MMR shifts to try and place them in the appropriate skill category. At the end they get their ranking. \n\nFor example: \nI was placed in bronze V last season after my original placement matches. I managed to get to bronze I at the end of the season and had a high win/loss ratio. I did my season five placement matches, winning 7/10 and ended up getting back into bronze 1. \n\nMy friend did his original placement matches in season 3, where he was placed in bronze 1. In season four after the reset he was once again placed in bronze 1 but managed to climb to silver 1 throughout the year. He did his season 5 placements, winning 3/10 and ended up getting into bronze 2 (he had a little cry about it but has since climbed back to silver 1).","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-03-16T03:03:08.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice thanks for the info","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-15T04:54:21.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lost 8/10 in S3 and didn't bother to complete the ranked 10s...\n\nS4 I won 4/10 and got placed in B4...\nMy friend won 3/10 and got S5...\n\nThe world is unfair man, just deal with it without burning out yourself aye","replies":[]},{"poster":"tempname952","date":"2015-03-15T04:18:28.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Won 7/10, Silver 2.\n\nKthx","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-15T03:16:15.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it takes into account WHO you are playing, not just how many games you win.\n\nI could play against a team of bronze 5's 10 games in a row and go 10-0.
