Trolls would play with trolls... people on the same level would play against each other... not this HORSES#?T system that is in place now and hasn&#039;t changed since its release.\r\n\r\nIf you ask almost anyone that plays league if they feel that &quot;ranked&quot; is worth the grind putting up with shit like trolls, leavers, afk&#039;s grievers etc.... if nothing is done the League community will turn into a bitter, toxic environment... you only have to see YouTubers like &quot;Magicarpusedfly&quot; etc make videos about how S#?T ranked is currently... League is already getting old if the community continues to become more and more toxic how much longer do you think your money farm will last?\r\n\r\nCome on Riot start listening to the community","replies":[{"poster":"mfis","date":"2018-03-16T11:14:19.886+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-16T11:20:11.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But by using that philosophy, the enemy also has a higher chance of having a booster or a smurf, as well as a higher chance of having a fed 1v5 member on their team.","replies":[{"poster":"mfis","date":"2018-03-16T11:22:48.916+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-16T19:37:56.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering it's Bronze V and no one wants to be there, there's a *much* higher chance than in Gold or Challenger.\n\nMy comment had nothing to do with me blaming my teammates for my <20% win-rate (because I know I'm the most garbage player in OCE), but rather to point out that if you just assume your reasoning, then by extension my reasoning happens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oztralia","date":"2018-03-16T11:47:31.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were in a \"rank\" based on your past person efforts vs players of a similar score level I don't see boosters or a smurf being an issue.. if they start playing at a level far superior to everyone in their \"rank\" they move up... its that simple.. \n\nusing Lolsumo as a reference... say in the last 10 games I average a overall score of \"gold\"... then from that I should be placed with and against players with a similar level. If your average stats start to decrease you decrease... if they go up... you go up... ranked game progression based on personal player skill not based vaguely on the amount of games you've played... ie; If you and I are technically exactly the same skill level as a player... but you can play 100 games a week and they can only play 10 does it seem logical that they should be placed in a lower rank?, simply because I can't \"grind\" their way out of their \"rank\"?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Oztralia","date":"2018-03-16T11:29:32.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get that \"you would try and get the best stats\" but in all honesty if the system was based as Lolsumo bases your overall score on numerous different aspects  and everyone was \"trying to get the best stats\"... Then I very much doubt this would be a concerning issue with many people.  \n\n Basically now your level in ranked is some what dictated purely as a numbers game... ie- most players currently would struggle to get much higher than 50:50 win rate when playing in solo que. This is what creates the grind and in turn has created a system that is not rewarding unless you can play hundreds of games and grind your way out of bronze... you can't hope to play with players on an equal level. So every game is a Russian roulette.... \n\nWhy should any player be punished for the acts of another? If you play a game where 9/10 players are genuine and theres 1 troll which way do you think that game would swing.. If you play a game and someone on your team doesn't connect and you early surrender you lose LP.... why should you lose LP Because someone left or didn't connect?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-17T05:19:51.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know how the 50/50 theory work?\n\nWhen you are progressing and your skills is way above your current standing; The win % will be high 60-80% But as you climb and eventually hit the skill cap where you belong. You wont be able to carry a 60-80% win rate any more, it will be reduce down to 50-55%. \n\nI checked your op.gg. You play at a bronze lv for 5years in arow. That mean your knowledge of the game didnt progress well enough. Me for example, i dont like to put effort in climbing rank, so my knowledge of the game has decline and cap out at gold tier.\n\nWhat you need is to learn the game, not blame your team. Bad luck happen to everyone, dont blame team for your halt in progression.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-03-17T06:05:13.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-03-17T11:30:45.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i just made a thread on this.... \n\n ( \"Hi, : )\n\nThis may not be a new idea,\n\nIf you get an -s, s or s+ in promos and you lose, it should not count as a loss or full loss. \")\n\n\ni don't play well, but this is an idea i think people may like.\n\ncheers.\n\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}}","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-17T11:34:30.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then you would get people that refuse to team fight to save their kda?","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-03-17T14:22:44.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can get a 's' without team fighting? cool, tell me how?     ;   )","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn Bot","date":"2018-03-19T17:57:33.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cs is a stat that heavily impacts if you get an s rank or not so hes right dood people would play for personal reasons to 'save their kda\" instead of playing to win","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-03-18T01:37:25.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By not joing fights when team are losing, save what KDA you have manage to stockpile.

Players should *never* be ranked *solely* on their own ability in a team game like LoL, there needs to be a significant consideration for team play, not just individual play. If you were to say that such an idea should be implemented in solo queue, and *in addition* to what is already there, I'd agree that it would likely help. That said, the team aspect of LoL is *just* as important (if not more so) than the individualistic aspect, and ranks should be determined with that in mind.","replies":[]}]}
