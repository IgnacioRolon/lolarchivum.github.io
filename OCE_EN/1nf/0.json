But it got banned, then he got all tilted and decided to play Camille. He started to feed his top lanner and starts to complain to our jg that he didn&#039;t gank enough after he feed he came down to mid and started to cs our mid laner fizz&#039;s cs. I was starting to tilte but i stayed cool until camille came down to my lane which is bot and started to take cs and purposely feed bot lane. I told him that he should not play rank if only knows how to play yasuo, all my team m8s agreed on what i said and tried to ignore this camille. About 8min of playing game quietly when everyone starts to come back on the late game this camille brings up everyones win rate and makes fun of us, that&#039;s when i exploded i said things to him. After the game he reports me and i get a 14 day bann, is this fair? Riot please i was trying to win the game and have fun when a angry yasuo main tries to tilt the whole team. Please unban me....{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Princess Dubz","date":"2017-07-28T13:38:55.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"1NF","date":"2017-07-29T08:56:00.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feels bad man...
