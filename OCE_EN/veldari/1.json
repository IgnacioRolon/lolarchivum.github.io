They wouldn't just grab iBlitzcrank and say _\"Yea, jokes guys, we are gunna change this into a PROJECT: Skin now, have fun!\"_. they were even hesitant to change Pulsefire Ezreal, even after tons of people asked them to. So I fail to see why champions should be so easily thrown around.\n\nMind you... I do have a personal stake in the matter.\nI have 10 lvl 7 champs and 5 lvl 6s in my main champion pool.\nOut of all of them, only 5 of which have not been either reworked or had a rework announced.\nFeelsbadman.\n\nBut don't quit league over this.\nWho knows how the next released _(or reworked)_ champion will synergise with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-06-11T07:50:38.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It happens.
