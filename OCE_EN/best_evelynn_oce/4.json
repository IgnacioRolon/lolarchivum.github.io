If they steal your role but aren't reportable for other reasons like toxicity, then nothing will happen. I've reported some people for role stealing in both drafts and ranked, and I've also reported for toxicity. I have yet to see a role thief I've reported get banned, but most of the people who are toxic enough for me to bother reporting have been banned. In riot's eyes role thieves aren't worth the effort.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-26T11:27:52.129+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"And before Seras complains, or whatever, here are screenshots of Riot's responses... bare in mind I had screenshots, logs, timestamps, everything, used IFS (which we all know doesn't work most of the time), and they refused to do anything: https://imgur.com/a/0spNY\n\nThey literally say \"*this is a serious matter! we won't do anything!*\". Even another Mod here was shocked at the language Riot used, but they never did anything about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-27T04:16:36.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you're looking for here. Did someone make a death threat in game? Then use the report system. If you are legitimately in fear for your life, then you should contact authorities (and that's exactly what Riot would do if it were credible). \n\nDeath threats are unpleasant to deal with, for sure; but if you're asking for *every* death threat to be looked into by Riot, then I think that's absurd. \n\nIf you're struggling on whether or not to contact the authorities, you should consider first and foremost whether that person knows any personal information about you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-27T01:12:29.125+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"You've never given anything to indicate what you actually reported though. Those responses could easily be to \"hey this guy was an ass, also what do you do about death threats?\" _or_ a response to a response and therefore missing a lot of context _or_ have their ends cut off because most agents will close with some sort of signature. \n\nThe point is we don't *know* and you have failed to provide any information that could actually be used to follow it up like your original ticket, ticket number, a name censored version of what you reported etc. Also note that they didn't say \"we won't do anything\", they said \"we can't often take action on reports sent through tickets\".\n\n*Assuming all you sent in your ticket was \"this guy sent a death threat here is the threat\"* then it's **not** a great response by any stretch. It's misleading and a very dissatisfying answer given the subject. To me it looks essentially like \"we can't tell you anything about the subject of your report, please continue to use post game reporting\", just a rather shit way of saying it, but given your reluctance to post any evidence, or offer any other means of actually following it up, you aren't exactly giving me much faith in that being the case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-26T21:11:42.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea, there's nothing that really stops anyone from doing that.
