The only person who actually seemed to want to win looked like Faker. Huni has never been much of a team player and in a game against an SSG lineup who were a very good team, they showed exactly how much team working was lacking. Especially that third game, SKT1 had the game but each team fight would be lost and that lead to a lost. A lot of people talk about how dominant SKT1 has been in the past, that's because in team fights they would always outplay the enemy team. Peanut also seems to be only good at lee sin and since he isn't in the meta they don't want to pick him, yet they pick a yasuo for huni . Selfish like every yasuo player that is what Huni represents. I think the next season SKT1 will struggle either to form a new roster or if Faker decides to retire or if they decide to stick to this line up (which I highly doubt). All that being said, SSG played at their optimum level, they reminded me of SKT1 of 2015, this might sound like a very high praise of them, but I have a feeling that this SSG team were never really pushed to the brink and so they stuck with their normal picks. {{sticker:fiora-cool}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-04T13:11:02.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel SSG was ever pushed out of their comfort zone, because I feel SSG is far more adaptable than we give them credit for. They got comfort picks for these matches, because these picks were simply effective against the SKT draft, and SKT wasn't responding well in dealing with SSGs draft. \n\nSSG's gameplan and strategy were adjusted for each match, and they showed much better overall macroplay, it felt like they had practised each gameplan they executed thoroughly, in comparison to SKT feeling like they were making it up as they went along after being routed in the first match by the same kind of early aggression they have shown weakness to before, and failing due to being unable to keep up in tempo when they tried to go on the offensive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-04T13:02:42.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT started showing cracks as early as Misfits, SSG just saw these and adjusted. Also Faker was visibly tilted in those matches, getting caught out a number of times more than he usually does.\n\nSKT got desperate near the end, in the last game, copying Misfit's aggressive picks such as fervor Leona, Tristana + Karma mid, aggressive midgame combinations designed to take a lead in the botlane and use it to secure a definitive damage and gold lead, and using that to pressure the game, but ended up investing in toplane instead and not pressuring botlane like misfits outlined, leading to their botlane having a neutered impact and ultimately leading to a less convincing lead in midgame teamfights despite a team total gold lead. Fervor on leona helps early all-ins, but it doesn't scale very well in terms of defensive stats, and forces the 18-0-12, leading to less bulk, from lacking the legendary guardian buff and courage shield.\n\nI feel that SKT was kind of sloppy in terms of their macroplay compared to their performance in past seasons, they still showed great individual play and positioning, but it just feels like they weren't adapting to their opponents this time at worlds. \n\nSSG on the other hand, whilst not showing as much individual performance, their teamplay and macroplay were very polished, the way they adapted and found gaps in SKTs gameplan and controlled vision in the first two games, and picked teamcomps and fights around powerspikes from levels and gold distribution, was subtle but so impactful. \n\nThe first game, was SKT not respecting the weaknesses that were exposed in their traditional gameplan shown in their match against Misfits.\n\nThe second game, showed SKT failing to close games out with leads due to a lack of practice playing an aggressive gameplan, and not respecting the lockdown and peel from SSG, Yasou needs a frontline and Gragas doesn't have enough peel or tankiness to counter SSG's peel with the Malzahar, Jarvan, Janna, and Gnar. SKT didn't respect the specific choices made by SSG, and this lead to SSG scaling back into the game and winning midgame teamfights and eventually winning the game. Yasou didn't really fit the teamcomp is you considered what SSG was drafting, and SKT didn't really have enough consistent or chain CC to fulfill that carry yasou dream.\n\nThe third game, was poor execution of the misfits style of gameplay, though excellent aggressive ganks, there wasn't enough focus on botlane, which was core to the aggressive denial gameplan and taking objectives before the enemy team could catch up in gold, messy map control, losing towers and inability to keep up the gold denial, that the misfits gameplan requires. SSG had a better midgame teamfight, and their gold was better distributed. SKT got leads, but was unable to keep up the tempo, having their gold invested in a splitpusher against a teamcomp that had fast engage and lockdown, and anti-tank damage, meant that the 4 members wouldn't be able to zone SSG effectively, meaning that their fed splitpusher would need to be pulled in for teamfights, where the gold is more valuable on adcs, and they would end up losing due to an inability to match the backline dps from SSG.\n\n\nSSG showed that well rounded teamplay, vision and map control, and adaptability is key to being champions. So for now SKT needs to sitdown and learn from this experience. Being champion means you need to be ready to take anyone on, no matter what they bring, or how they want to play. Not just being the best at playing your way. Because your competition is hungry, they will seek the slightest sign of weakness and they will do whatever they can to bring you to your knees.\n\n\nand that's the evaluation by some silver knowitall, mock me if you will, but this is what I think of the finals.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
