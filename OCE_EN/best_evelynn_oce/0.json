Xin mains were complaining he was useless and weak, but that's far from true.\nComparatively, the Kogmaw rework looked good, but in the end it had to be reverted because it was just so sink or swim and usually sink.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-11T12:56:55.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, but there is a difference between a proper new champion that they have been concepting and working on for years, and a quickly thrown together rework they've stamped out to suit the current meta.\n\nNew champs are OP or UP because nothing like that has been seen in the game before, its hard to know how Xayah and Rakan's unique dynamic will affect the game, or Kayn's wall walking, etc. Riot obviously have a better idea of how OP it will be than they pretend to let on, but a lot of it like you say is because it is hard to get it exactly right.\n\nReworks on the other hand are unbalanced because they are just sloppy.\nWithin a few years many if not most of their mini reworks will have been partially reverted or reworked again. They slap them together to suit the current meta and the immediate cry of the players, with no long term future in mind. \nMany champions take years to develop and fine-tune. Azir was in development for 3 years. We all know how long Ao Shin was in the works. Then they randomly pop out a Xin or Kog rework after a month or two and then act all surprised when they don't hold up...\nIt's painful to watch.\n\nKog, Ryze, Malz etc. only took a few months to be reworked again _(and sometimes even AGAIN)_. They have now set their sights on LB and Kindred yet again. It's actually pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-11T22:55:28.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have to say though some reworks come and go and not much happens. I was up in arms against the shaco reworks, and I do miss the ol' shaco, and I feel playing ap shaco in the jungle has been hit hard, but aside from being a fair bit weaker after the first rework, rebalanced after the second rework, and a little stronger (for ad lethality builds) after the third rework, not much else has changed. From an outside perspective, they were basically small nerfs and buffs.\n\nStill trying to work out how to redo my old cinderhulk, titanic, deadmans, bork, tanky locket build though. Running a shaco clone to tank 4 shots of a jihn ult, some harass from his team and managing to still explode it in his face when they discover that tanky monstrosity was only the clone was really fun.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2017-12-18T07:26:55.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope she just gets removed from the game tbh.
