I used to be in silver 1 (almost got to gold) but ranked became too stressful for me so I stopped playing it for a whole season. Now I started playing ranked again (in silver 5) and I mostly main ADC. As I got to the game I realized that my farm sucked so I decided to focus on my farm. I did get mostly good farm and I avoided dying so I didn't feed either but for some reason I went on a HUGE losing streak. Over 15 games lost in a row. While I did not feed and my farm was good as soon as the midgame started to die a lot and fall behind. I remember thinking \"what am I doing wrong\", so I observed myself and realized that while I was in the game, I was never present. I prioritized farm over teamfights, so if I saw a free farm I went to get it instead of going into the fight. Ofc I did join the teamfight after clearing the wave but by that time, 2 of my teammates were already dead or if not dead at least very low. I also realized that because I arrived so late to the fight I had trouble positioning myself which led me to die to the enemy and I was also not able to take advance of my teammates plays to secure kills, because my teammates had already burned all their skills.\nAs soon as I realized this and made a chance to prioritize my team over farm, I started to win a lot more. Granted I still lose and my farm still sucks, because I'm not focusing it too much aside from casually trying to get better at it instead of being hardcore but at least I've started to win a lot more. My winrate has also started to even itself out (even if the +15 losses still weight on my stats). You need to understand that all the gold you get from the farm you have is useless if you can't put it in good use. Think about it farm = Gold = Items = Damage = enemies dying = chance to push and take objectives. If you have the items but you're never there to deal the damage, the enemies will not die and you don't have a chance to secure objectives. You may know that objectives are important but you do not seem to understand that there's time and place for every action.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-20T02:04:05.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-20T02:39:48.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Did you read any of the chat?
