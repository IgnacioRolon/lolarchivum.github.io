If you Alt + F4 and press &quot;Leave Game&quot; (as opposed to clicking &quot;Exit&quot; in the Settings menu), Leaver Buster won&#039;t affect you. I&#039;ve done this about 9-10 times on my main account without repercussion (I&#039;m hoping you won&#039;t ban me for honesty).\r\n\r\nJust thought you may want to check that out.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-06T07:54:27.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with the Leavebuster system is that it will look at the consistency of leaves/AFKs. There needs to be a significant number over a short period of time (for example, 5 with the course of a month) for a player to get picked up by the system. Not to mention, each instance would need to last at least 5 minutes for the system to even consider it.\n\nAs an example, you could have 2 players each with 12 leaves over the course of a year. The first player has those leaves spread out relatively evenly, so once a month. The second has them all occurring in a 1-2 month period. The first would avoid being picked up for punishment, as there's no significant frequency to them while the second *should* get picked up and punished, since it's a very significant number of leaves over a (relatively) short period.\n\nSo this would only indicate a bug if it's over a shorter amount of time, like 1-2 months, not if it's spaced out over (for arguments sake) 5 months or so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-08-06T06:35:28.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaver Buster is based on a comparison of game's AFKed/leaved versus how many games you actually play.\n\nAs long as you don't reach a certain percent based on how many game's you play in total during a week/month Leaver Buster will never touch you.","replies":[]}]}
