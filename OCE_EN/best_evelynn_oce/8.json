He was the trend setter for the new breed of 'rock star' scientists like himself, Brian Cox and Neil deGrasse Tyson. The impact of which will inspire countless new minds to pursue a career in science, that otherwise may not have gone down that path. Perhaps one day, a mind even greater than his own. Truly what legacy could be greater than that?\n\nRest in Peace Stephen Hawking. \nFew men and women in all of history will _truly_ never be forgotten, you sir are one of them!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-14T09:24:47.810+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The world lost one of it's best minds and biggest inspirations today.\n\nTruly a loss that will be felt for centuries to come.","replies":[]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-03-17T11:54:35.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R.I.P Hawky.","replies":[]}]}
