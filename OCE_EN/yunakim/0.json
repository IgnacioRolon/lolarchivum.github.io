I would admit this happened if i actuall i afked but i was on loading screen for 13 mins and on my screen Yasuo was 80% Master Yi was 13% and Annie was 0%. So i was waiting and keep thinking that they have slow internet or something because i was 100% then i went on face book. Then i quit the game and press reconnect it led me into game with 13 mins have passed. And of Course we lost game due to i was late. but my friend says i was on from 2 mins but didnt work on my screen. Well i dont care about loss but why the hell would i get the afk penalty with 20mins per game? Will You please FIx this or at least get rid of penalty on me. If YOu cant believe me please check the replay. out of 34:26 mins i wasted 13mins on loading screen.\nPLEASE RIOT GET RID OF THE PENALTY I HAVE NOW!\nAnd i WAS Jinx.
