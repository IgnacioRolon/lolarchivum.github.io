That&#039;s only barely approaching &quot;Late&quot; for many people, let alone actually late.\nWhat about people who want to pull all nighters, maybe with mates as well?\nPeople who work night shift and have to be awake to maintain the sleep schedule?\nI queued up with a mate just before the queue was disabled and our queue popped within 40 seconds, unfortunately the game was dodged due to someone not liking the pick.\nIf I&#039;m getting queue pops of under 1 minute as the queue is shut off I refuse to entertain the notion there isn&#039;t enough players to maintain the game mode throughout the night. (Also bear in mind by the time it starts getting really late i.e. 3-5am, the east coast has woken up again and no doubt will start queueing up).\nI go through this every time we have a featured game mode and it is simply more frustrating each time a featured game mode rolls around.\nIf any reds are reading this PLEASE pass it on or forward the suggestion to keep the game mode playing throughout the night.\n\nFrom, \n\nSomeone who would glady stay up all night playing One-For-All (in this specific case)","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-18T05:34:58.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get why they bother, queue timers, amount of players, who really cares.
