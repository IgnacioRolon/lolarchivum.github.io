After playing a game with a troll jungler who stood in base half the time and did nothing (&quot;bcz its normalz&quot;), and experiencing similar games for the last few weeks, I realised I wanted to play with like-minded individuals who play the game for fun. I don&#039;t mind if the club likes to play off-meta champions\\\\. And yes, I am in Bronze, because before a month ago I couldn&#039;t care less about playing with people who think they&#039;re God and all of their teammates are just &quot;worthless feeders&quot; (now I&#039;m forcing myself to play Ranked matches so I can see how good/bad I really am, rather than have people who look up my LoL King profile before a match tell me about it).","replies":[{"poster":"crazyhead","date":"2016-08-13T04:02:12.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"join my club it's got lots of bronze and silver and we've got 44 members","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackie Frags","date":"2016-08-08T09:43:13.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey dude, hit me up! i feel the same way as you, im an anti toxic gold 5 jungle and support main, i quite often love to play just whatever suits me and i mute at the first sign of toxicity. i current roam around on teamspeak with a few friends who feel the same way, and we have fun whether we win or lose. add me ingame \"Jackie Frags\" and the teamspeak i currently use when im not working is ts3.srcshosting.com.au. i play 2 - 3 games a night when its slow and maybe more when im really feeling in the mood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jusoraas","date":"2016-08-02T12:13:04.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure I'll hang with ya, send me an invite.
