I started playing at the end of Season 3, and Nidalee was my first main. Can you imagine my excitement when I saw a Red post that Nidalee is getting updated splashes! So I waited, and waited, and waited... I&#039;ve mained on and off 20 other champions now, but finally, updated splashes!\n\nWhatya think of them? Personally, I think she looks wayyy too young in the French Maid splash and it doesn't even look like Nidalee, and the Pharaoh one could use some lightening up (I had to move my eyes close to the screen to make out any features besides glowing eyes). The rest are pretty cool though XD","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-27T09:16:07.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"3.5 years, damn i have played this game too long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-26T04:44:33.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my new favourite Nidalee splash art\n\nhttps://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CYA7gqlUe7E/V0TQh9WQ3jI/AAAAAAAA7JA/PsQVOYQIYKosTD4gJkl3GxvlTIP7ydsTwCLcB/s640/Nidalee_Splash_4.jpg\n\nShe just looks so freaking powerful...too bad I suck at Nid jungle =(","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-05-26T06:54:48.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=alWvVjvE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-26T04:44:33.706+0000)\n>\n> This is my new favourite Nidalee splash art\n> \n> https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CYA7gqlUe7E/V0TQh9WQ3jI/AAAAAAAA7JA/PsQVOYQIYKosTD4gJkl3GxvlTIP7ydsTwCLcB/s640/Nidalee_Splash_4.jpg\n> \n> She just looks so freaking powerful...too bad I suck at Nid jungle =(\n\nOoooooh does this mean no more Nid nerfs?

And that Bewitching skin.... absolutely no regrets buying it in Harrowing 2013. And I think Snow Bunny looks the most like normal Nidalee XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prowlore","date":"2016-06-01T08:46:06.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A W W W W W W   Y E E E E E A A A A A A H","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2016-05-30T08:57:32.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it just me or does snow bunny look like Kim Kardashian.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-05-26T11:12:41.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got forum banned on NA for over-celebrating...","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-05-27T05:31:08.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FA Quaker,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=alWvVjvE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-26T11:12:41.656+0000)\n>\n> I got forum banned on NA for over-celebrating...\n\nDefine \"over-celebrating\".","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-05-27T15:17:30.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a penis out of Keyboard Symbols.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-05-27T15:56:17.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FA Quaker,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=alWvVjvE,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-05-27T15:17:30.243+0000)\n>\n> I made a penis out of Keyboard Symbols.\n> \n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nThat explains...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
