Second game with her I was in a mirror lane, and every time I'd QEW the other Kat, she'd at least E-AA so I didn't get away with free poke. It was effective...\nI think we can use a new combo now for Kat: Q - E - AA - W - AA. Because the animation is faster, you'd get away with an AA right after Shunpo without spending more time than you would pre-update.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-15T04:20:55.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No debate that it can be a good thing (especially on Kat) I just in general don't always like these sorts of changes, cause even a split second change can %%%% CS.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
