His instrument, unexpectedly played a deep and foreboding sound. Bard stood and stared toward the night sky, Bard had been called to protect a relic once again. \nDown the mountain Bard bounded, if gravity did not affect him, with a few skips, jumps and even a flip. With a mighty blow into his horn, Bard green, cushiony ball emerged and expanded as Bard fell into it, softening his descent.\n\nTravelling to the distant isles from which the call came, a cataclysmic event was soon to occur spelling the doom for the whole of Runeterra. Bounding across the empty plains as the deep sounds of Bard&rsquo;s horn filled the silence, Meeps began to gather by Bard&rsquo;s side ready to assist the wandering caretaker. \n\nThe sky grew ever darker as the shadowy clouds rolled in from all directions, Bard sped up to into full flight, gliding across and disturbing the still grass. Bard arrived, at seemingly innocent plain, no animal or person could be seen. Bard stared toward the sky, the dark clouds filled the sky and began to swirl above Bard, hundreds of Meeps stood by the celestial being awaiting his judgement. Bard sat and pondered at what was coming, questioning if even he could preserve Runeterra. \n\nSuddenly, a purple chain fell out from the clouds slamming into ground before Bard, the hook at the end tore into the earth gaining a solid grip. Following the chain ball, of whirling shadowy mass fell, hitting the ground and releasing a wave of purple energy, knocking down the unwary Bard. \nThe purple energy cleared revealing the a being of pure darkness, it&rsquo;s faceless head bearing three whirling tendrils, around it&rsquo;s neck and chest energy seeped out creating an ominous purple fog. In one hand he had a chain with hook with glowed with light a deceased star, in other an empty black void swirling with dark energy. \n\nBard whimpered with a high pitched tune, announcing his presence Bard stepped forward with deep, resonating sound, the light from his eyes peering through the purple fog. The faceless creature from the stars turned and smiled at Bard, giggling under his breath. \n&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; the creature asked puzzle, &ldquo;A welcoming party?&rdquo; he continued as he let out a coarse laugh which broke the silence of the foggy plain.\nBard, still confident blew into his horn, clearing the fog partially and revealing his army of Meeps,\n&ldquo;So it is a party!&rdquo; the creature, exclaimed.\n\nBard then began to flip and twist his horn in a show of intimidation, although his performance did phase the purple beast from beyond. So Bard with swish of his horn tossed one of many Meeps at the creature, once again the creature giggled as the Meep was sucked into his dark star. Bard was still determined and again threw Meeps at the purple creature, continually pelting him with only a few managed to hit him. Suddenly the wielder of the dark star exclaimed &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;, and with a heave he tossed him other-wordly hook and chain at the stationary Bard entangling him, the chain ignited with celestial energy as the creature tugged on the chain, flying toward Bard. &ldquo;You celestial fool, nothing can stop me, I am the Dark Star&rdquo; Bard squirmed attempting to escape his binds, the creature then unravelled him, swinging his chain and tossing Bard a distance from him. Bard let out another high pitch sound in pain, the seams on his physical body were beginning to tear. The Dark Star approached Bard as he attempted to crawl away, swinging his hook and tearing the stitching of Bard&rsquo;s body. Bard was ready to burst, the Dark Star stood over him, proclaiming &ldquo;It&#039;s been a long time since I had a good soul to devour.&rdquo;, he tossed the void onto the ground before Bard, dark energy began to swirl around it pulling up dirt and grass into the abyss, Bard grasping on a tuft of grass also began to be pulled to it&#039;s center. \n\nBard glanced up to see the stars he would miss, when he spied a comet streaking across the night sky toward his location. The Dark Star too looked up to see the comet, before landed before them. And ethereal dragon emerged from the crator, his blue glowing body filled with glowing constellations, &ldquo;You! You and your black hole destroying my work!&rdquo; the dragon exclaimed, &ldquo;I, Aurelion Sol, will end you!&rdquo;. Out of nothing the dragon birthed a star as a darted toward the surprised the Dark Star, he was stunned by the immense power of the star which collided with him knocking him to the ground, the Dark Star stood up pick up the void he wielded, he heaved and tossed his hook toward Aurelion Sol, but before it hit, the dragon blasted the fiend with his voice of pure light, the Dark Star screamed in agony as the dragon&rsquo;s voice blew his form into the wind, he yelled one last time&hellip; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m blasting off again!&rdquo;.\n\nBard stood, his physical form waning after every step, &ldquo;Thank you&hellip;&rdquo; Bard whispered as his mask fell to the ground and his yellow glowing spirit orb flew into the sky, leaving his physical body collapsed into a heap, the Meeps gathered around Bard&rsquo;s deflated a body and began to whisper a musical tune. Aurelion Sol, simply glanced at the Meeps, then left with no thought for the lost caretaker as he flew over the horizon into the morning sun.\n\n\n_Thank you for reading.{{summoner:31}} _","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:34:26.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if there was any way Bard could have saved himself.
