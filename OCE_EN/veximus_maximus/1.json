Or do we get to continue to enjoy the Toxicity that would make Chernobyl&#039;s ground zero hang its head in shame? Community has been supporting you for years, but we just dont see a decrease in the absolutely disgusting behavior that runs unchecked on the server. \r\nI just dont see how anyone is really expected to climb ranks when games are so full of people who tilt, flame, ragequit and just generally make the game hell for other players. \r\n\r\nI not long got my promos to Silver 2, won them, then got hit with 4 horrible games in a row after 1 win. \r\nThey included a mid who gave out first blood, so ragequit. 2 tilters, and one actual loss in a decent game. It was a salty loss, As is any game where you lose to goddamn Tryndamere. So wound up getting demoted, won a few games and got back on promos, Just played em. Feeding Volibear who&#039;d just dive anything and everything, regardless of what the lane could do to assist or followup, then blame his death on them. \r\nSecond was 10 minutes of 3v5 cause Mid and ADC didnt connect, and when they did, they just tilted the allready shitty situation, despite my efforts getting the whiney Lucian fed to heck. \r\n\r\nI just dont see how your rank means anything when every game you have is outside of your control.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-15T07:52:10.343+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just dont see how your rank means anything when every game you have is outside of your control.\n\nI climbed silver V to gold V in under 200 games, how are the games out of your control?","replies":[{"poster":"Veximus Maximus","date":"2015-06-16T03:46:45.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How arent they?\nIts not MY decision to have teammates not communicate, Feed, AFK, Ragequit, Tilt or just generally be fucking terrible. \n\nThe only thing in my control is how I play the game.

Its just that those fair games are so few and far between. \nWhat is there to learn from soloQ other than you cannot rely on anyone to play with a level head and not rampage off the deepend when they get killed, or someone dies? \nI am yet to see this year a game where someone isnt raging and killing it for one of the teams.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-17T08:53:25.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SoloQ is meant for people who are fine playing with people who aren't good at all, in fact, there's a thread talking about most average players having 40, not 50% win rate.

Dies to Yasuo for first blood at 3 minutes, Blasts the guy in all chat. No drama, just one death, I'll come in and help, after a successful gank on the Vlad in top, I moved mid and killed Yasuo too...But because I got the kill, and not him, cause in the heat of the moment I couldnt tell if Kassadin had the kill potential to secure it, He decided that it was the end of the game, and from that moment on, he just tilted. \nThats the power one person has in this game, to become a hinderence rather that a teammate, and when someone is activley trying to undermine you and the team, you cant win it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-17T08:45:55.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i vot w get oc tirbuanl, it iz vrei bnfcial tu diz txic cmounti. i bleive it iz of our bst itnerset. plz roit, maek diz hpapne","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-16T08:19:19.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, OCE has currently the same Tribunal system of NA, EUW, EUNE and other main servers.\nOCE still lacks some perks (like log notifications and a few other things), but the system is there.","replies":[]}]}
