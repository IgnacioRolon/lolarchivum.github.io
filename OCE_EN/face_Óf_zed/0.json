But i still play it because im a retard and keep wasting my time on this. Its not u rito game that has made this game not fun for me, its all the feeders out there that has made this game pointless. like if your in bronze 3,4,5 there are gonna be atleast one feeder every 2 games u play of ranked, I can grantee that. Anyways, so today i was like lets have some fun and play a normal game, it was fun i got fed and snowballed off that and we won, then i was like why not play another normal game. Then i started playing this game (linked) we were doing really good our team then i see darius who was our top laner die then i was it ok he can still beat that wukong, but then darius typed gg in the chat. And thats when the things started kicking off. we were still reking that team but then darius was also running into the tower like a fucking retard and feeding them, like this isn&#039;t the first time i have met feeders but now its just not fuking ok to see that after 2 season riot game u have done nothing about this bullshit. so then i was like to the other team guys darius is feeding just dont attack him lwt him get exicuted by the towers.  then i saw when darius went into the mid lane all 5 of them were there waiting for him to just run into the tower and feed them. then this one time wukong was in our jungle and he saw darius, i said in /all chat wukond dont kill him just dont then i see him keep walking then instantly he turns around and strikes darius. then i asked him y did u do this and kill him he was like cuz darius was going to kill me, then i pressed o and found out that darius was building Rejuvenation bead like he had like 6 of thoses. so i to,d him to look at what darius was building and u were fed how chould he have killed u. Thats all on going to tell you cuz i know even if i tell you about the whole game ur no going to do shit about this. if you are going to do something i want the whole enemy team temp banned for a week for abusing a feeder and i wasnt darius permanent banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-14T05:35:48.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok, ye, there are feeders and trolls in League of Legends.** If you report them (provided the rest of your team does as well), they will eventually get squished by the ban hammer.** If you don't report them, they wont. By the looks of the guys match history, he is probably racking up a gigantic number of reports (although, low level so many people probably don't  know how) and its only a matter of time.\n\nIt sucks to have a feeder on your team, but dude, we have all been there. \" i want the whole enemy team temp banned for a week for abusing a feeder\"- of course they are gonna get fed off your feeder, there is a 100% chance it has happened to them and they want their revenge. \n\nOther than implementing a[ tonne of player behaviour initiatives and systems ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Y9YJ60Fn-player-behaviour-faq), Riot are literally stuffing incentives to play in premade 5 groups down our throats.\n_** Why?**_\n To avoid stuff like this. If you play in a premade 5man group, you are less likely to have a troll on your team. You are less likely to have someone flame you, rage quit or feed. It literally solves most of the problems people come to the boards to cry about.  \n\nTL;DR [Join a premade 5man team](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment)","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-02-17T10:59:33.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't know how to break this to you sweetie, but, in OCE, the Ban Hammer doesn't exist for feeders/trolls and Riot are condoning troll behaviour. \nIm sorry you had to hear it from a community member and not rito themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-17T23:59:03.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes??? It does??? I have plenty friends who have been banned for these exact behaviours? \n\nJust because the people you see aren't banned immediately, doesn't mean that they aren't gonna be banned. It takes a while for a sufficient number of reports to stack up (most people don't actually report the players but instead come to the boards to complain), and once it is deemed that they are doing these things on purpose, they get punished. The punishment system works in tiers, and it takes a while to move up each tier. You don't automatically get permabanned, as Riot like to give players the benefit of the doubt. Occasionally players reform their behaviour before the more strict punishments are enforced. **It is the exact same system for each of the servers. **\n\nAs for Riot condoning trolls, give me proof.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-02-19T00:23:51.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The 2-4 intentional feeders i get every game, 1-2 afkers i get every 3 days, the 3-4 people that give the enemy team the game every day. The 3-4 flamers EVERY. F***ING. GAME. \n\nAll allowable behaviour from riot since its not breaking any rules and its following community guide lines.\n\nFunnily enough, intentionally feeding, assisting enemy team and harassment is on the list of reportable offenses. \nIf it was punishable, rito would do something about it and not give the people doing it champs/skins from the events. \nI want to say sorry, but i far from am. It's better you hear it from an active member than someone who's on once a month.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Troll Armada","date":"2016-02-29T11:05:07.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're right about the rate of feeders in ranked, that's why I simply cannot believe that recreational trolling vis a vis feeding in game is that entertaining to people, there are literally limitless trolling possibilities out there, and you want me to believe that people play a 30-45 league of legends game in order to get a cheap 10 second laugh possibly from feeding? No, of course not, it doesn't make any sense.\n\nYes, there are a portion who are just bad at league, however, that does not account for all the trolls who seem to follow the same exact format game after game.\n\nSeems to me that there are lots of fake accounts being sent into ranked queue intentionally to feed and throw. To what end, who knows, perhaps there is money to be made from lifting people into higher ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gnar","date":"2016-03-04T21:41:37.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But to be fair people can have bad games (unless they troll on purpose) and I get salty when my team is feeding even if it isn't on purpose, I bet if you responded, you would of said this, \"Well, why are they doing in my ranked game\" but if there trolling yea I understand, but if there not feeding on purpose than I guess its fine","replies":[]}]}]}
