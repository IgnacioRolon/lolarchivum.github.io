Too bad teemo is winning now. I would much rather play urgot guys, vote that %%%% up. Maybe I could become the best urgot OCE? :O\n\nI feel like Urgot is fairly strong, people just don't pick him because of his low win rate, which is mainly low due to him being the go to troll pick.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-01-19T01:11:06.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}}  but only build: {{summoner:13}} {{summoner:6}} \n\n{{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3083}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-19T00:42:45.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:18}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-19T00:39:30.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tryndamere","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-01-18T23:52:37.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:120}}, {{champion:58}} or {{champion:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-18T13:36:03.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:131}} \nyou want an ap bruiser, you got one.\nyou want an assassin, you got one.\nyou want a ap tank, you sort of have one if you get fed.\nyou want an adc, well why the **f**uck not, you got one.\nany lane, any role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-18T19:06:05.885+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"{{champion:17}} \n\nAhh...regrets.\n\nBut still, can go any lane.","replies":[]}]}
