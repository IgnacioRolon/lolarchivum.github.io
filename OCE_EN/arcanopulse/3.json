Will update after each game. :-)\n\nGame one: **LOSS** Got Top, went pretty even vs a rengar, bot lane fed hard, rengar got massive, so did their ezreal, we were pretty even around 32 minutes in, then vayne went bot when they decided they would put aggressive wards around baron, which was a pretty dumb idea, and probably costed us the match. This was actually my first ever match as Urgot. :)\n\nGame two: **WIN** Jungle Urgot was just too strong, my retarded team kept getting caught, we could of ended it in 25 minutes instead we ended it in 50 or some shit. team insisted we needed to kill every tower, get 5 dragon stacks and baron.  I don't know what elo it currently is, but it feels pretty silver. Maybe silver 4.\n\nGame three: **LOSS** My monitor randomly lost signal and I had to reboot, which fixed it for some reason, got back in the game 1 kill and 30 farm down from panth, I got demolished any time I shown my face top. brutal match.\n\nGame four: **LOSS** Another loss, I got fed early and no matter how many times I pinged, people would not engage on good opportunities for map control. w/e, shit game.\n\nGame five: **WIN** I did pretty badly, but we still won. I am already sick of playing this champ, he is so boring and unrewarding. There is no difference between being fed and being behind.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-21T03:01:31.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://cdn.meme.am/instances/500x/58296938.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-21T12:25:13.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Day 5 under the curse of playing Urgot, I think I'm going insane.. {{champion:39}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-21T01:08:41.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lurking","replies":[]}]}
