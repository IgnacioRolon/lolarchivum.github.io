One of my friends* has got the 20 minutes penalty for 5 games and keeps getting it, but that is very unfair because the person never leave intentionally and especially when their games crash they CANNOT reconnect. \nIf you were in their situation then you would fully understand, otherwise normally you would just think that these people are assholes and they intentionally leave games.\nEven if they managed to reconnect after they've crashed before the game ended, they would still GET the leaver buster penalty, or if able to reconnect at all.\nPersonally I'm also having the same problem. My Lol client file is not blocked by any firewall or antivirus, my internet is fast with high broadband data (120GB). The friend* and I could play without crashing in season 4, but ever since the instalment of the season 5 patches, this problem has just appeared out of the blue.\nI suggest improvements to be made to the Leaver Buster System.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-22T05:51:04.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't be the first person to think this.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentohS","date":"2015-03-07T07:51:08.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, most of your comments are no help to anyone, but instead they're scrutinising.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-08T02:32:51.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But I'm agreeing with this person?","replies":[{"poster":"SilentohS","date":"2015-03-13T08:38:48.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you don't agree then fuck off, it's not your issue!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
