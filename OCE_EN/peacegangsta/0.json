There were those kids (unlike me) who invested their time into receiving these. Riot, i&#039;m just a kid.\r\nWell a kid at heart but i love this game more than anything, i&#039;m not even good at it. Check the stats on my account. (stiffcamel). One day i will somehow work for riot, i don&#039;t care if i have to swim across the pacific just to serve coffee for interns. I&#039;ll be there one day.\r\nIt&#039;ll be fun too. ;-)","replies":[{"poster":"Guidance","date":"2017-09-04T05:14:30.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You called for Guidance, and here I am :) Is there any way I may be able to assist you?","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-09-05T00:53:25.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job","replies":[{"poster":"Guidance","date":"2017-09-05T02:54:05.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do try xD\n{{sticker:vayne-pose}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-05T01:12:49.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't already, I'd definitely recommend taking a look at the various Career pages on the Riot Games website, such as the [Open Jobs](https://www.riotgames.com/careers), [Working at Riot](https://www.riotgames.com/articles/20150817/547/working-riot), [University Programs](https://www.riotgames.com/university-programs) and [Internship Info](https://www.riotgames.com/internship-info) pages.","replies":[]}]}
