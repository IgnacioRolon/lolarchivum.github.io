All of my friends list was deleted, some ranked games played, and a conversation was had with one other person. Apparently my account had been bought on some website for $1 as the conversation goes from the hacker to his friend.\r\n\r\nCan riot restore my account and all my friends?\r\n\r\nI have more photos taken of the conversation between the hacker and his friend if needed. Will riot's justice hammer swing in my favor?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-05-28T15:53:51.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras covered the account recovery process, so I wont go into that (note, the account will receive a \"security ban\" until everything is sorted out with Support, just to make sure no additional changes are made while that's all happening).\n\nJust a couple notes, I'd recommend running an anti-virus scan on any personal/family/friend computers you have played LoL on recently (personally, I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, as the free program does tend to pick up stuff that other anti-virus programs don't in my experience, but up to you). It's possible that this was the result of a keylogger or similar program getting onto your computer, so just a good move to check that, and secure any important stuff like emails, bank accounts etc.\n\nSecondly, you should check out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as that will give you a pretty good idea if anything else has been compromised online. It doesn't have a complete database, but it's still a great resource for figuring out if your accounts have been compromised.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-28T05:04:53.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change your password immediately. Also change the password for the linked email address as you don't know how they got access to your account.\n___\nSubmit an account recovery ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nYou will have to be logged out of support for this process. They will ask you a whole bunch of questions to verify ownership of the account. You don't have to answer all of those questions, or the exact questions (any information not available on the account helps), but you do have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you are the original owner.\n___\nOnce your account is secured you can talk to support about recovering things like your friend list.","replies":[]}]}
