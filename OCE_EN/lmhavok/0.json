However I own both of the accounts, but one is in another region (NA) that I can't play and the account is level 2. The account that I play on in OCE was made first, is level 115 but only that account received the notice of change.\r\n\r\nI jumped onto the NA account to change the account information. But I'm unsure if that is enough for me to keep my OCE account how it is. Happy to delete the NA account if needed","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-01T01:58:10.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, we are talking Usernames (what you use to login) not Summoner Names (your visible tag) here.\n\nIf your UN exists anywhere else then you will be unable to select it as your RIot account UN because Riot accounts are global where LoL accounts are regional.\n\nAssuming you own all the accounts that are conflicting and you change all of them first, when you log-in to the update page with your OCE account you should be able to input your original Username.\n\nThere does remain the possibility that someone else shares your UN on a different region, in which case you won't be able to use the same UN.","replies":[]}]}
