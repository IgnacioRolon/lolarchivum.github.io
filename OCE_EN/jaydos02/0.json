If something goes wrong with your game or client, Riot isn't responsible.\n\nAlso, Riot reserves the right to change their stance on this program, so it's YOUR responsibility to make sure you stay updated about this. If Riot changes their stance on LoLWiz and starts to issue punishments to people who use it, _\"I didn't know\"_ will not be good enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaydos02","date":"2017-09-23T09:21:41.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, probably won't be worth the risk.","replies":[]}]}]}
