So i transfer my account into OCE server because OCE server would have lower ping than NA. BUT i have like 340ms in OCE server what the hell. Can anyone help me why is it happening and solution for it?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-11T10:26:01.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have high ping because NA and OCE aren't supposed to cater for Indonesian players. The server for Indonesian players is the [ID  server](https://lol.garena.co.id/). Sadly it's hosted by Garena which means you can't transfer your account there. You will need to create a new account if you want to play on ID.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix2446","date":"2016-12-11T14:46:05.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already have 3 ID server account and i played it like 1 and a half year.

I hear it's almost only English speakers and you'll have much better ping there.","replies":[{"poster":"Phoenix2446","date":"2016-12-12T11:50:19.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh forgot SG server.
