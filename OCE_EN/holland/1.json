I was wondering if there champions that can turn the game around when all seems to be lost but can still be won with this champ. I would like the help thnx!","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-02-21T22:18:39.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ZIGGS \n\nThis little piece of %%%% literally stops all pushing, it's deadset near 100% impossible to push against this rat unless your like 20 kills down.

It is not the job for one to do the job of many, you need to work with your team to come back from behind. Communicate with pings, keep wards up, and maintain objective control.\n\nIf you are talking about backdooring however, then any AD champ or champ with high attack speed or abilities that change AA's into more powerful versions, like Garen's Q, can wreck towers faster than others.\n\nsuch champs include:\n{{champion:11}} Master Yi, {{champion:17}} Teemo, {{champion:421}} Rek'sai, {{champion:78}} Poppy, {{champion:5}} Xin Zhao, and pretty much any ADC out there, since they mostly all build AS and AD anyway.\n\nYou'll find that AP casters will be a lot slower than others to destroy towers. If you are a caster, then continue to try and poke the enemy's HP down without a full blown engage. Keep them distracted, but not satisfied enough to glance at the map and see a Teemo clearing waves and destroying towers up top with his Ruunan's","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-02-21T22:34:34.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sometimes is the job when you have an afk or a feeding team but yes it is true it's a game about team work but not all the time. Most of the time I need to carry since the team is angry at everyone and blaims them for their deaths so thats' why I need to carry. But anyway thank you for the tips.","replies":[]}]}]}
