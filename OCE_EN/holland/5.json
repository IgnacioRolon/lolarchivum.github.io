There is the event The Hunt Is on. \r\nThe buffs you get for Kha'Zix is the 4th evoulution and for Rengar he can't lose stacks for his Bonetooth Necklace. But now there has been a rework for Rengar that he doesn't lose stacks anymore so it is kind of useless now. I was wondering if you can make a new buff for Rengar since the rework has been quite some time ago. I have a few ideas for his buff. One is that he could get another stack on his item that makes him faster, stronger, heals more from his w and has a longer jump. Two is that when he uses his ultimate he instantly gains 5 ferocity then regenerates it normally. Those are my ideas that you could use or you could make a better one. Please think about this. Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-10T17:50:42.412+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im surprised people still dont know this but when Rengar kills Kha'Zix he gains increased vision while in brush, as a Rengar main i can tell you that he needs nothing else, this buff is great already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"canijo","date":"2015-01-10T07:37:27.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Rengar would be extremely broken with such a buff. Faster and Stronger, sure. But heal more from W? A longer jump? Instant max ferocity? Rengar is already an extremely strong champion, there's a reason why he is still used in competitive play. Unless you want Riot to implement this and nerf him to a bottomless pit a month later, I would never try to make a champion, even one I main stronger than they already are unless they really are weak, Shaco for example, will be absolutely toast soon, but a rework has been mentioned in the patch notes for quite a while now, maybe Riot is ready to give him a new flavor, even though I do still like him, he lacks mechanics in a fight, he's a champion that cannot duel yet he's an assassin. A champion that goes invulnerable for half the time Yi does (if not less), jungle buffs give away who the clone is, as does stats, he doesn't have super speed or a flash every 6 seconds, or a double auto attack, his boxes are breakable even in stealth from aoe attacks and stattik shiv, his W shouldn't have a cast time, the cool down is already huge and the best use of them is to block a skill shot. His E needs to hit more DoT on jungle monsters because except the first buff, he's one of the slowest clearers in the game and heavily relies on items when champions who don't rely on items can clear with both their abilities and items, having intense presence (Udyr, Lee Sin, Nocturne, Rek Sai, Amumu, Elise, Fid, Jax, Kha, Reng Panth, Skarner for example). Honestly, most top laners are more viable in the jungle than Shaco is, and given he has no way to duel people, he can't top.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-10T08:29:41.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do realise we are talking about a special event that requires 2 specific champions to be in the same game on opposite teams right? A change to this event would probably affect 1/500 games maybe. And besides, Kha'zix is allowed to evolve all of his abilities, why cant Rengar be allowed a bit of might; a better prize then the outdated one he gets as of now.","replies":[{"poster":"canijo","date":"2015-01-11T00:51:22.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing being that if you put Kha vs Reng at top lane, since Kha can't duel (fight for long), he'll get his head kicked in by Rengar, Rengar can assasinate and duel, he's already a MUCH stronger champion than Kha. Evolution is something that makes Kha really weak early game and semi-strong late game. Why do you think they nerfed Rengar? He was wayyyy too powerful, yet he's still one of the strongest assassins in the game, having the ability to duel, assasinate, sustain, gap close. Rengar can jungle, mid, top, roam. Kha'Zix can jungle and falls off extremely hard in the new jungle. Yet you ask Riot for a buff for Rengar against KhaZix. KhaZix gets most of his power from isolation. Catching a squishy target away from your team is close to impossible unless you're in cardboard 32 and your adc thinks they can roam. If my adc has tracked the jungler to be at top, we turn up and his red's up, it may be ours, but I'm not going to leave the brush until I know the adc has gotten out safely with that red, if someone comes, I peel them off and if they have to pick up a kill, it will be on me. If you catch a fiddlesticks by himself, chances are he will fear you as you jump at him with khazix, silence you and run away. Any other jungler will have either an escape or be too tanky for khazix to duel them.","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-01-21T08:16:17.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm I am not asking riot to buff Rengar I want them to get Rengar a new buff for the event The Hunt Is On.

It takes me a while to get on my feet because he needs that lil bit of extra gold for more components because he needs more items than last time for him to be truly doing the damages he used to do. They buffed the evolved W which gave him more cc but since they nerfed the Q I can't really do the execute jump in jump out like I used to do.\nIf you are going to buff rengar even more with the hunt is on pls give kha some extra stats pls. Giving him a 4th evolution isn't as terrifying as it used to be. All im saying is that if you keep buffing one hunter, then the hunt is more about how fast {{champion:107}}  will kill {{champion:121}} rather then who would be on the top of the food chain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-10T11:09:30.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about Rengar is able to detect nearby champions but they cant detect him (not invisible, but like with quin's w), because he has become the ultimate hunter right? he can detect stealth and doesn't need to facecheck while he himself cant be found except for direct vision...\n\nkalista's ghosts could see him but they wouldn't follow","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-09T18:51:44.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your right on the idea of how Rengars' buff is somewhat outdated.
