It's not like you can reverse the patch or anything, though. If you want to play League again then you'll have to find out why it's freezing on your computer and remedy it yourself. If it's an extremely technical reason, then you should probably [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nIn the meantime, could you take a look over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes)? Basically, make sure everything is updated, and that your computer is maintained. If using a disk drive, defrag it. Scan your computer for malicious softwares or just plain viruses. Close any other applications while you run League, mainly your firewall/anti-virus.\n\nWhat changing the resolution does is... complicated. You see, League is a very old game in terms of software development. There's code in there that was created decades ago (of course, not in League, but League uses it anyway). And a long time ago, a program would not run if you had a certain screen resolution. Although Riot have tried their best to reduce the occurrence of this bug, sometimes it just manages to get through. The point of testing it at different resolutions is to make sure it's not this old bug occurring. You can always switch back to your normal resolution afterward.\n\nYou still haven't explained the exact point where League freezes. Is it always at the same point, or does it change?\n\nAlso, what graphics card do you have?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
