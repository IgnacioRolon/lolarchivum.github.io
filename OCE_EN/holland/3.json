Please tell me how to beat her I can&#039;t do anything everytime I play with a Fiora she gets fed no matter what even if I don&#039;t feed her she goes roaming to other lanes and get triple kills and carries the game and gg. I need some strats on how to destroy FIora and snowball in lane don&#039;t just tell me she is countered by cc, every champ is countered by cc. I need help Fiora is such a pain in the ass to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-08-27T12:00:08.956+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"speaking as a plat 5 who also hates new fiora with a passion - you need to call for ganks early (she doesnt really escape gank well) especially if she is pushing under tower. playing around vitals is important but hard to do cause of her q, but forcing her to mistime w can be punishing. tbh though i wouldnt try and beat fiora in a 1v1 duel without a reasonable lead","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-26T15:53:54.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">when I vs her in lane she won't ever let me farm when I go near she just autos me and q and it takes down like 1/3 of my hp\n\nThis only happens AFTER you feed her.\n\nAnd hint, make sure you pay attention to where the vital is on you and position it in a way that she can't get to it and you basically win.","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-08-28T11:26:33.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually her passive is quite hard to counter she can still get to it with her q since it is such a big hitbox and it will still hit the vital point.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-29T08:34:32.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really if you keep yourself against the wall, and further back if the vital is in a position favoring her.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-26T14:59:07.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you cant beat em join em (or play em) or play renekton or garen","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-27T04:51:07.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"use. teemo. win. be hated for life","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-27T00:37:54.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With swag.
