For example Caitlyn with her range, Corki able to bait quinn with using e to bring her away from the support, and most supports are able to make the lane harder for her and people don't want to go though all the annoying and pain in laning to just get to 1 shotting the adc late game so they go for people who are good all game round.

If you want to split push well, Jinx is great at it once she gets a high level on her q. Her minigun's bonus attack speed is insane and well easily help you push lanes hard. Lucian doesn't really have anything like that especially because you build attack damage. His abilities do allow him to clear waves with the right placement but you also don't want to waste all your mana either. Jinx is also great in team fights, dealing high damage in either AoE or onto a single target and can easily clean up afterwards once her passive kicks in. I'm not even level 30 yet so my opinion might not be correct but its my 2 cents on the question.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-03-16T12:07:18.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EVERYONE BUYS JINX she's a lame adc just stand there no skill needed dude play quinn way better or even draven :,(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-16T07:53:39.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I bought jinx the end!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-15T08:11:07.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright so right now I am picking either {{champion:222}}  or {{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2015-03-15T08:15:18.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2015-03-15T08:17:15.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I mention {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-03-15T09:19:18.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FuriousFlameDude,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tVa1681c,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2015-03-15T08:17:15.677+0000)\n>\n> Did I mention {{champion:119}}\n\nNOT ENOUGH i think you need more ;D","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2015-03-15T10:46:34.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kk","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-15T03:06:50.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Splitpush - {{champion:222}} {{champion:18}} are the fastest turret killers.
