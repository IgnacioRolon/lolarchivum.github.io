Since there is mostly always a guy that has the super slow pc which takes really long and it gets boring. I was think maybe they can try making it look nicer or add a chat box for people to talk or anything that makes it more interesting. Anyone got any ideas to make the loading screen less boring.","replies":[{"poster":"TI2uE","date":"2015-02-22T14:35:37.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't seen the fan made ones check them out they look really good.

With the animated splash art, maybe there would be an option to turn it off, to just have the static images (so those with slower computers are able to get in game faster perhaps?)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XVIII The Moon","date":"2015-02-22T11:50:00.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm all for making it look nicer, that's a good idea.\n\nAdding a chatbox however would make the player with the \"super slow pc\" even slower, and it would give the others the ability to flame the living hell out of that player.\n\nWhat about doing something with those Did You Know tips?
