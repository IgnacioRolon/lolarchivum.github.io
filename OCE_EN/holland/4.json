Why not make the players become a bot after they leave so that people that are playing still have a chance in winning. If the afk player reconnects the gold used by the bot will be refunded just incase the bot buys the wrong items. I would like for this to happen because it really isn&#039;t fair to be matched up with players that randomly dc or go afk and end of losing because of them. But I think that you should put the bot A.I on medium or hard if there is one. Please!","replies":[{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-03-27T00:04:52.427+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heroes of the Storm (Blizzard's MOBA in Beta) does this. As someone who plays both LoL and HotS, it doesn't make that much of a difference.\n\nYou can't coordinate with a bot. Bot's have predictable patterns, making them easier to kill, avoid, direct or otherwise neutralize. Or if Riot change's the Bot's programming (like they did with Doombots) making them smarter, with behavior patterns, etc., then they would actually be better than some people. Making games unfair in the lower Elo and giving way to a new branch of insults; \"a Bot would be better than you, just go afk\" \"reported for not going afk and giving us a bot that wouldn't feed\" etc.. The possibility for more toxicity on OCE is not something we need.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-26T22:43:22.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense but I would prefer having the AFK over the unreliability of a Bot. There's a greater chance to win a 4v5 than winning a 5v5 which included 1 bot on one side. The Bot would just be exploited by the enemy team as a means of getting fed. Because let's face it, it's a bot. Yesterday for example I played a 4v5 match with myself being on the 4 side and I was solo support bot lane. I won lane...and we won the game straight away. We won in 30 minutes. That's how one sided our game was and we really didn't need my ADC since she had already conceded one death. \n\nTLDR: Whilst I respect your idea having a bot substitute more likely provides more negatives than positives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ritual","date":"2015-03-31T01:02:06.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Het substitutes to join the game in queue (the following game has an afk would you like to pick up from where they left of give them 5 mins jsust in case its a connection issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-27T23:38:27.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe it can be like dota and you can control the champion yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-03-27T01:37:35.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs gos' system of being able to use a bot is pretty gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-03-27T01:11:01.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome idea, but do u know how ez it is to kill a bot.
