{"poster":"AdjW","date":"2015-06-18T11:23:29.382+0000","title":"My Champion Idea.","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here&#039;s an idea of a champion I have been working on for a while now and I wanted to post the idea publicly so I can receive some feedback on the idea and concept of this champion. (Note there is an actual splash art in progress but things take time.) His main role I would say is Tank/Bruiser ideal for the top lane or jungle his early game would be weak against heavy poke champions that can easily sustain in lane such as Vlad or Rumble but I believe would be useful during teamfights for his decent cc and his ability to tank and deal substantial damage. \n\nHere's some sick fan art done by DavePowa on the NA server so show him some love:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tdRca0o.png[/img]\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C6rlrDu.png[/img]\n\nUriah The Bionic Arbiter\n\nAttack range125 (Melee.)\nAttack speed 0.615 + 0.75% per lvl.\nHealth 560 +80 per lvl.\nHealth regen 9.30 +0.90 per lvl.\nMana 264 + 35.5 per lvl.\nMana regen 6.25 + 0.45 per lvl.\nAD 53 + 3.5 per lvl.\nArmour 27 + 3 per lvl.\nMagic res 22 + 2 per lvl.\nMovement speed 325.\n\nPassive: For every 20 points in bonus movement speed Uriah gains 5% bonus attack speed.\n\nQ: Uriah creates a sweeping motion with his sword in a cone dealing 40/50/60/70/80 (+40% of AD) physical damage.\nAny targets hit at the end of the sweep are knocked up and stunned for 1 second.\nMana cost: 45 at all lvls, Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8, Range: 500.\n\nW: Uriah amplifies his leg armaments gaining 15/25/35/45/55 +2 points per lvl bonus armour and magic resistance, but his movement speed is reduced by 20/30/40/50/60.\nThis ability is toggled.\n(This does in turn affect his passive reducing his attack speed.)\nMana cost: 30/35/40/45/50, Cooldown: 16/15/14/13/12.\n\nE: Uriah leaps in a target direction dealing 5/6/7/8/10% of any target in his landing locations current health.\nIf Uriah collides with terrain he jumps again at a 45% angle opposite from the direction that he originally jumped from.\nMana cost: 40/50/60/70/80, Cooldown: 15/14/13/12/11, Range: 425 (Bonus jump is 325.)\n\nR: Uriah shoots pure energy from his sword in a cone in front of him silencing enemy champions within 350 range for 1/1.5/2 seconds if it connects with an enemy champion an additional wave extending 200 range appears slowing anyone beyond that for 20/30/40% (+3% per 100 bonus AD) dealing 100/150/200 (+20% of AD)\nMana cost: 100 at all lvls, Cooldown: 120/110/100, Range: 550.\n\nRecommended basic build path: Pot and Doran&#039;s shield --> Brutaliser --> Base Boots --> Youmuu&#039;s Ghostblade and from their situational (Imo I would probably build items like Iceborn/Frozenheart, Visage/Banshees/Maw, Bloodthrister/BOTRK for some damage and then Righteous Glory/Warmogs/Thronmail/Guardian Angel.)\n\nUriah&rsquo;s Lore:\nAs a struggling urchin on the streets of Zaun, he struggled to find his way in the world as he had no particular talents,\nhe was not strong, or fast and lacked the intelligence to pursue a future in technology. \nSurviving on scraps found in the streets as the only thing of worth in his possession is his claymore which was given as a gift given to him during his early childhood and he would not part with it for the world.\nOne day Uriah heard rumors of a man in Zaun capable of removing ones human imperfections and replacing them through augmentation.\nSeeming like Uriah&rsquo;s only hope of making something of himself he sought out this revered man of science.\nUpon arrival of the discussed location Uriah had thought of what he would have perfected his arms so that he may be strong and wield the skills necessary to use his precious sword\nand his legs so that he may move quicker than ever before.\nWhen Uriah finally met this strange man he told him this and he quickly agreed to help him as he sought it as part of this so called glorious evolution.\nIt almost seemed to good to be true he was getting all that he could have ever wanted a chance of greatness.\nAs Uriah awoke he discovered to his surprise just how easily his new found parts responded and with faster reflexes than he could have imagined as he looked for his sword he saw it could not be seen.\nUriah flew into a rage smashing the operating room with his new found strength in his mechanical arms.\nThe man came through the door into the room and before Uriah could accuse him of theft he brought out from his cloak Uriah&rsquo;s sword only it was different it had small tubes of energy coursing through it, it looked pure and powerful.\nThe man extended out his hand saying &ldquo;A gift from the glorious evolution unto one of its loyal subjects&rdquo; Uriah nodded graciously.\nThe man told him of the task which he required in return for this favour which was to bring justice to those who would oppose this great destiny to act as an arbiter for the machines.\nUriah finally discovering his calling set out to aid in what way he can in the glorious evolution although remaining sceptical of his saviours true intentions.\n\n&ldquo;Justice and evolution hand in hand&rdquo;
