I read that the same thing is happening with Renekton on NA boards.\r\n\r\nWhile im on it.. from previous patches, seems like the e stun balls going backwards has stopped, but i still see some inconsistencies where the shere flies directly through somone yet there is no CC... happens once every second game on average.. \r\n\r\nmakers her a lot harder to play..\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-01T04:34:03.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Syndra is buggerific.
