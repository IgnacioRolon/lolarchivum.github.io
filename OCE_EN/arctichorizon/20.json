The rank that you get is determined by where you sit in the rankings for that champion in that role. S+ is the top 2% as far as I know.\n\nIf you did well with say, Nami mid, you are pretty much guaranteed and S+. But getting an S+ with say, Vayne ADC is much much harder because it's played so much more and there are plenty of people that main her and do well consistently with her.\n\nIf your CS is well into that top 2% then it will certainly boost your rating, but if you then had a much worse kill participation it would drop a lot as well. It is a combination of many things, CS is no more important than kill participation or anything else, and the scores you need vary drastically from champ to champ and role to role.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-25T03:58:31.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"grats man~\ni think i've only got \"A\"s a couple time with support\nSoraka i think? or Nami...\ni think S is a bit out of reach for me atm haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-24T12:00:17.037+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Grats man ♥\nYou should make it your challenge to get an S+ on your fave champs in each role and slowly expand till you have all the S+ :D","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2016-02-24T12:41:49.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HELL YAIA.
