I hate those who feel useless and go splot push and do not join teamfights until they got enough gold and leveling while feeding enemies at the same time. U could stop trying to be a fuking superstar all games and learn to take a supportive  role for ur team time to time.

Ban Rammus.\n\nAnd it went a little something like this:\n\n* ME: \"I can't go against Fizz, if they pick Fizz and he is Mid I will play safe and still probably feed\"\n* *Game starts* ME: \" I cannot go against a Fizz\"\n* ME: *Start feeding*\n* Last pick: \"Your terrible, blah blah blah\" (He was just ranting all game from this point on wards)\n* ME: \"Fizz is probably the ONLY champion I cannot beat\"\n* Last pick: \"Rant, rave, blaming me for everything\"\n* Fizz went AFK\n* Last pick was STILL ranting and threatened to AFK, so I dared him, and he did it\n* I did NOT die from when Fizz went AFK until he came back, even with our ADC going and being a little bitch\n* Last pick came back, still ranting and refusing to listen that I can't go against Fizz, even when I note I have not died since he went AFK\n* Fizz back, I start feeding again\n* Last pick continuing to rant\n\nSOMETIMES it is better if your player fucks off and makes your game a better place. Other times, it depends on what they want you to AFK for. At the end of the day, if you are being asked to leave, it is either because you are a fuckwit and cannot play, or make a shit fuck of a decisions and either leave an OP champ in the game who I specifically told them I will end up feeding, or just make generally bad decisions that make a winnable game, a loss. I just know it, Fizz is a fuck of a champ who is just one of those that do my head in, but no, alas he was left in the game and in the end, carried the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-28T03:40:29.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Run it down mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T03:10:49.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever wonder why the sporting community isn't toxic? \n\nBecause when it does, you can smack the guy in the face, people feel 10feet tall behind screens and keep crapping on","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T03:05:36.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope but doing it will still get you punished by Riot and its autodetect leaver system, dem feels.
