Not even AFK?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I was having network issues, so i decided to troubleshoot &amp; test things with my router/etc. To test whether the issues were being resolved or not, I decided it would be a safe option to join a beginner co-op vs AI game, where my team mates would have no problems without me. I stayed active in game, but remained in base for the entirety of the game, whilst checking in-game response time/ping etc. My team won, there were no complaints or upsets that I wasn&#039;t helping (obviously. It&#039;s beginner bots...) \n\n.....BUT LEAVER BUSTER HAS PUT ME IN A LOW PRIORITY QUEUE!?!?!?!? AND THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. MANY TIMES. NOW IM IN A 20 MIN LP QUEUE..!??!\n\nI&#039;m doing no harm.. I just want to fix my issues so I can play league. Can I please have my punishment revoked? Or if not, can you at least think of a good reason why I should be punished? Shed some light. I&#039;m furious!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-29T15:09:54.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, any game with other players in it can get you leaver buster penalties, which includes coop vs AI. Ofc certain modes get higher priority, afking in ranked will get you punished much faster than coop vs AI.\n\nThat said, for you to get a 20 min means this has happened a LOT. Especially if they were all from coop vs AI. If you want to test ping/in game response time then making a custom game is the way to go. It was the fact that you remained in base the entire time that flagged you as afk, while you were technically still present, you weren't playing the game, and that qualifies you for leaver buster.\n\nIt's also worth noting that leaver buster penalties will not be removed for ANY reason, so you'll just have to play out the 5 games, and use custom games next time you want to test something.\n\n___\nAs for your actual connection issue, if it just your connection to League and not to anything else then this might be able to help you: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nIf it's not just League then unfortunately it's something we can't really help with.","replies":[]}]}
