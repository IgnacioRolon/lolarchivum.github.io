A debate should always be objective \n(which means taking yourself out of it, leaving just the facts)\nUsing swearwords shows a level of personal attachment to the argument, and having personal attachment means that you MIGHT possibly twist the facts to suit your own gain, (and is therefore frowned upon)\nif ever you are unlucky enough to be in a court of law you will notice that NONE of the lawyers have any personal attachment to the argument, you will not see them crying or swearing or laughing, (if they are good lawyers anyway)\nas soon as you bring emotion into an argument you lose credibility, thats just a fact (i don't make the rules)\n\nand i know this is an internet forum, but it still holds the same logic as a court of law even if it doesn't have the same importance as one. \n(but by all means continue to use swearwords it only makes my argument more credible and yours less so)\n\nbtw: \nCredibility isn't the same as being right or wrong.\n\nbut anyway whoever is right and who isn't, we both look like fools for getting so deep into a pointless internet dispute on a forum that doesn't even matter.

It means \"I am expressing interest in the last available position of the other four roles\". If top, mid and JG are called on or after the time of his call, ADC is the result. If all roles are called by the time of his call, he goes sup, as he did not call quickly enough to get his desired role. \n\nThe poll is in favour of Mr. A. (no surprises there). Since there's no specific rules set by Rito, and the generally accepted rules are made by the community, the community determines how roles should be called and allocated. Since, assuming accurate data in a sample size ~30, the community rules in favour of Mr. A.\n\nOn another less scientific, less politically correct note, notice the quality of the majority of the arguments from those who are in favour of Mr N. compared to those who are in favour or Mr. A. There's a clear difference in articulation, reasoning and progressive logic between the two, skewing more towards Mr. A-favoured arguments. It might say something about the superior aptitude of the majority of people voting for Mr. A.","replies":[{"poster":"M4GNU5","date":"2015-01-03T09:38:36.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too had issues with getting into the forum - but thankfully Rito has now fixed it.\n\nThere is validity to the argument that \"fill\" is equivalent to \"I'll take whatever role is left\".\nHeartvine, if Mr A had called something like \"Anything but support\" as opposed to \"fill not supp\" would you be more inclined to side with them?  \n\nIs the issue you have more centred on terminology rather that logic?\n\nYou're also correct that The Summoner Code has no rules about this; to have a rule about every aspect of the game would condemn everything to the toilet.  The Code deals more with the spirit of how people play, rather than setting down a heap of rules.\n\nIn this case, Mr A who essentially indicates \"I'm happy to play any role except support\" (terminology here, take note) is acting more in adherence to the Code than Mr N who has a conniption and announces \"wtf I called jg I'm going jg anyway\". \n\nAnyway, I voted Mr A.

In fact, because I believe \"fill\" and \"any role\" are the same thing, and it is obviously implied (in the context of the situation) that \"not sup\" means \"any role but sup\", I purposely avoided mentioning it, to try and understand why people picked on the word \"fill\" so heavily as though it was completely different, despite it meaning the exact same thing. And from what I've seen, the information simultaneously consider is simply too much for some people to synthesise accurately.\n\nI'm telling you it's the truth, couldn't care less if you \"buy it\" or not. I take pride in honesty.\n\nYou're saying \"fill, not sup\" is different from \"not sup\" and \"any role besides sup\" even though, in 100% of practical cases, the caller will be trying to convey the exact same message?

If you can see another way \"not sup\" could be interpreted (in a practical context), please give me an example. \n\n\"Calling\" in itself is just a heirachally prioritized expression of interest in particular team roles. Calling \"not sup\" in the context of a solo queue champion-select screen falls under that category. It may not be as simple as \"mid\" or \"sup\" because there are terms and conditions associated, but it's just as transmissible (assuming basic understanding of conditional logic), and in fact, less burdening on teammates choices.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-01-04T01:55:01.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of it like maths,\n\n5 - 1 = 4\n\nFill (all 5 positions) - Support (1 position) = 4 available positions\n\ninstead of\n\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n\nMid (1 position) + Top (1 position) + Jungle (1 position) + ADC (1 position) = 4 available positions\n\nnow looking at those two equations, which is most efficient for getting your meaning across?\nthe long one or the short one? the one where you have to type out 4 position or the one where you type 2?\n\nthe fact that he used the word fill is irrelevant, the definition of 'Fill' is not \n\"Unconditional acceptance of the last available position in the online game League of Legends\"\n\n'Fill' is a word used by the player base to best get their meaning across.
