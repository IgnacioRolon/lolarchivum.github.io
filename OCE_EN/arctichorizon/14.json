An Economist's Perspective","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":11,"down_votes":5,"body":"*TL;DR: Team builder is nearly dead in the OCE server (I don't know how it's going on other servers) despite the design being logically and systematically superior to blind pick. With a few tweaks mentioned below (can't be TL;DR'd, read them yourself) team builder can be the better, brighter future of normal queue*\n\n*EDIT: By \"nearly dead\" I mean \"no where NEAR as popular as a Summoner's Rift mode should be, and certainly not popular enough to have acceptable queue/organistion times\".*\n\n*If you disagree, or just want your opinion taken seriously, read everything I have to say and **explain yourself.***\n\n**To Riot Staff and anyone who gives thought to Team Builder and/or its potential,**\n\nIn OCE (not sure about other servers) Team Builder is spiraling out of popularity, AGAIN, as wait times are spiraling out of control, AGAIN. Does this mean Team Builder is ultimately inferior to Blind Pick (at least for a population the size of the OCE server)? Right now, possibly. But ultimately? No. If you're just looking at statistics and current practicality, then *yes*. If you open your mind to model-theory and potential, *NO*. \n\nMy greatest fear is that you (or your OCE team) will look at the 2 mode's statistics (TB Normals vs. BP Normals) and say, \"it looks like team builder isn't going to work (at least in OCE), it had a good run but the trial is over. It's a failure when compared to blind pick.\" Granted that is the easy, simple, effortless thing to do, but it's not the best, or most profitable solution - particularly having invested time and resources into developing team builder.\n\nI know what you were thinking when Team builder was internally accepted as a new, permanent mode for Summoner's Rift. Team Builder was introduced because Blind Pick has flaws. Calling your lane and hoping your team mates will cooperate, fighting over roles, **disputes over chat desynchronization**, not getting a lane you wanted... It's not a flawlessly enjoyable experience. You recognized this, and developed a mode that was theoretically genius. On top of that, the UI was aesthetically gorgeous! And so it was introduced. So why, at least on the OCE server (not sure about other servers), is it not performing so well?\n\nFirstly (and you/your OCE team actually identified this problem), TB didn't have momentum to begin with. A mode with no momentum can gather none if it's momentous rival has the exact same gameplay. Blind Pick had momentum, and TB had the impossible task of stealing it. Wait-times for TB were well over 20 minutes - and often often over 30 minutes. You recognized this problem, and introduced incentives! ***GORGEOUS* summoner icons and exclusive hours to get them** (I actually love them! Though the tank icon wasn't quite in sync with the others), **exclusive new SR beta access** (yes, yes, YES!) etc. You and I BOTH thought this would give TB the momentum it needed to succeed. After all, it's *flawless* in design unlike blind pick. All it needed was player momentum right? ...RIGHT?! \n\n...As it turns out... Not quite.\n\nAnother obstacle - the last obstacle - that stands before team builder's success has yet to be dealt with. It took me a while to realise, but there's something Blind Pick (and Draft Pick) has over normals: **Blind pick & Draft Pick *FORCE* games to start**. In Blind Pick, If you didn't get the role you want, or if someone insta-locks even though you called first, you can't just leave - you'll be punished! Chances are, someone will grumpily agree to playing a role they didn't want to play (more often than not, this means a player playing support when they don't want to), or a team will unhappily play some off-meta composition like dual-mid. \n\n*THIS* is the darkest, most effective horse of Blind Pick that keeps all its momentum uncontested. Players don't think about it, but the truth is,** they'd much prefer the* risk* of playing an undesirable role than wait around for someone to WANT to play that role for them**. \n\nAt first glance, it seems as though team builder - in essence - can't do this. It can't force players to play a role that, on average, is less desirable at any given moment. It can offer slightly shorter waiting times, but Blind Pick already guarantees an undesirable role, with the chance of a desirable role at an even shorter waiting time. \n\nThe solution is to **make these roles more rewarding to play in Team Builder**. This doesn't mean doing something drastic like reinventing the roles themselves, this means **REWARDING players, with IP, for picking that role**. As the role becomes proportionally less and less desirable, and in higher and higher demand (demand also considered increasing as teams wait longer and longer) increase the IP bonus for that role until the incentive to play it balances out. (Lane and Role variables calculated separately & combined for total IP bonus figure)\n\n***For example:*** \n\n* *Top lane Tank (+3 IP bonus)*\n* *Top Lane Fighter*\n* *Bottom Lane Support (+41 IP bonus)*\n* *Bottom Lane Marksman (+12 IP bonus)*\n* *Jungle Assassin (+22 IP bonus)*\n* *Mid Lane Mage*\n\nThis way, not only are the demands & supplies for each role balanced, but unlike Blind Pick, players feel as though they WANTED to play that role in the first place. It forces the completion of individual teams, and thus, decreases queue times **dramatically**! This could even inadvertently suppress the stigma players have towards particular roles. I understand the potential problems with rewarding bonus IP and am more than happy to discuss it!\n\nTwo other flaws I'm briefly going to mention are:\n\n* **The inability to change champions once you've joined your team:** Of course it would be absurd to have a team leader build a team, only to have the matched players change entirely - that would defeat purpose, and be highly exploitable. However, *not* having a way of changing your champion is unnecessarily limiting - especially when considering the advantages of team-synergy. I recommend a \"request champion change\" button that asks the team leader if they can change from one champion to another *specific* champion, and giving the team leader the freedom to change at will. To moderate delays caused by team-synergy disputes, a timer (similar to the one in blind pick) must also be added when all team members have joined.\n\n* **The lack of penalties for leaving teams**: Another thing slowing down Team Builder is the fact that people who don't like their team comp will leave instantly. Dont like taric support? Switch teams. Someone's playing Teemo Top? Switch teams. It's inefficient, and encourages people to be picky and closed-minded. This isn't possible in Blind Pick, as there is a 5-minute (and increasing) punishment - Again, Blind Pick FORCES the game whether you like it or not. To solve this problem, I recommend a function similar to the \"re-roll\" function in ARAM. Except instead of re-rolling a champion, you can re-roll a team. Storing 2 switches maximum, and slowly earning them back through gameplay. This encourages people to save their team-switches for only the most severe cases. Any other form of leaving would result in a 5-minute queue ban - as is the case in other modes. \n\nFinally, I'd like to point out that team builder no longer has incentives to help gain momentum. The new SR is now available on all modes, and almost all people who want the TB-icons already have them. Even with these changes, **momentum can't be stolen from one mode to another if the gameplay is the same. This is absolute.** \n\nThus, I would like you to take a risk. The aim for the future of League of Legends is finesse - unique, definitive finesse. Finesse that can only be achieved in a free-to-play business model. The logic and design of Team Builder holds more finesse than there is in Blind Pick, and having them compete alongside each other will never do Team Builder proper justice. Every Sunday, if Team Builder (with the above changes) REPLACED blind pick, people would have the opportunity to experience the full brunt of its finesse.\n\nIf this happened, creature-comfort players (and closed-minded players) would no doubt leave their turtle shells and experience the beauty of its finesse. Perhaps at first there'll be nay-sayers - the same nay-sayers who shun Facebook UI updates and iOS changes, but in time they'll grow into their new shell, leaving League of Legends in a better, more enjoyable place.\n\nI understand that there are potential problems with the above solutions, but I believe the gravity of the problems they cause are nothing compared to the gravity of the problems they solve. I also believe there is a solution to every problem, and a way to improve on every imperfection which is why I'm making this proposal/argument in the first place. The team-builder model can be flawless if you guide it.\n\nArcticHorizon","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-26T02:42:36.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only just come across this thread, but I was contemplating over this a couple of days ago. It's a little late, but I feel as if you've got something good going on here - so i'll pitch in. \nIf we are allowed to pick & choose champions before groups are legitimised, then it is for this reason that TB doesn't have as much momentum as BP.\nThe problem with BP/RDP is that people often don't get the roles they wanted rather than vs. what people pick . Having said that, being able to choose *who* joins your team is definitely just an open invitation to slow down matches from happening.\nBecause of this, we should be focusing on the matter of *getting* roles rather than *who to choose to add to our team*\n\nI can see it working like this : \nOpen up queues->Select TBNormals->Select the role you want-> queue in and wait till a match has been made - > once you're in, discuss who is playing who.\nFor Draft pick:\n\"->Select the role you want->Queue times->then via the process of draft pick, select champions accordingly.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-06T05:50:33.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with Team Builder is so much simpler than all this, though, and I've pointed out why so many times. Riot overcomplicated the whole thing. The experience we love so much is being able to build as we go. You get into a Normal Blind and once you've all sorted out your roles, a couple of people will hover pick their champion (select but not lock in). This next part is what is really important. Based on what is already being hover picked, I'll select my champion to complement the team composition and give us the most well-rounded team I can. YOU CAN'T DO THIS IN TEAM BUILDER. Once you're in the lobby, there's no changing champions. This is what is fundamentally wrong with Team Builder - Riot removed champion select.\n\nWaayyyyy back when it was first announced, I was like \"yeah, this could be good\" because I thought they were going to do it simply and it would be operational within maybe a month. 6 months later, Riot came up with this steaming hot turd we now call Team Builder.

Wanna know why? Because it doesn't have the drafting phase where you ban champions and reactively pick champions (and on top of that, it's blind). It takes away an iconic part of the league experience.\n\nFor it to ever work in a way that it could potentially be used for Ranked queues as well as being the standard format for normals is if it is much simpler. Select Champion Role, match you with 4 teammates in your MMR bracket then go on to NORMAL CHAMPION SELECT FOR THAT QUEUE.","replies":[{"poster":"Eelic","date":"2014-12-06T07:35:16.896+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always been kind of funny to me that people love drafting as much as they do.  There's a lot of strategy to it, but when I log into League, I've signed up to play League of Legends the MOBA and not Draft the Game--putting aside entirely that losing the draft (ie, getting counterpicked) tends to feel more bad than winning it feels good.\n\nIt's necessary for ranked play, of course, but I've generally seen it as more of a bandaid to cover up polarization and temporary imbalance rather than an important experience to be preserved in and of itself.\n\nMore on topic, the reason people play team builder is because they want to play as a particular champion in a particular spot, which, if you've ever played blind pick, is absolutely a thing that people want to do.  Long build times are going to put a damper on that, though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-06T05:38:38.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other than writing an essay with some questionable suggestions simply do this:\n\n1.

Experimentally disable Blind for a short while because the reason why people don't queue TB as often is due to the longer queue time, and it just spiral down into a vicious cycle. If the result is favourable, consider the retirement of Blind mode and shift that to say custom.\n\nDo these 2 steps, then we move on to integrate that into ranked with counter picking etc, then TB will be flawless.
