If any of you missed it, here's a link the my original Orianna skin, inspired by pop culture!\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ErVsKoVy-my-orianna-skin-concept\r\n\r\nIt hasn't been confirmed whether Rito is going to add it to the game or not, but based on what I've heard prospects are pretty good! But I didn't want to stop there, not for my favourite champion. I had to create another one! This one took me even longer, but it was well worth it. It's called \"Oriana Grande\" Hope you like it!","replies":[{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2015-01-12T10:11:11.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG dem photoshop skillz are superb.
