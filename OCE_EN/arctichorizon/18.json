A Normal game is still a large investment of your time, now people wouldn't invest so heavily into something unless it mattered to them. The only real difference between Normals and Ranked is a tiny superficial icon that only serves to fulfill one's own e-peen. The effort that goes into winning those games and the challenges therein are no different, the time investment is no different. \n\nThe only reason one would suggest Normals aren't important is that of pure selfishness and would typically come from someone who is Ranked, for that is all they care about and everything should revolve around that one game mode, while modes other people play should be considered an afterthought. \n\nI'd also like to remind people that there would be no Ranked, No Tournaments and no advancement in the game if it weren't for other modes of play. You don't just start playing League as a Ranked player or Tournament contender. Normal's are the building-blocks of this whole game, just because one player treats Normal's as a place to fool around, does not mean this is true of everyone else. By saying \"who cares about Normals\" is another way of saying you don't give a toss about anyone but yourself. Normal's are Riots bread & butter, it serves as a platform to get players interested in competitive play. If it is left to stagnate and degrade into a Bot-fest there won't be much reason for new players to stick around.     \n\nGames in general are \"serious\" business, even single player games. Whether it be Singleplayer or Multiplayer there shouldn't be any surprise as to why people can be so passionate or angry about something that negatively effects their experience, the fact that they are so passionate or angry indicates just how much it matters to them. \n\nYou only need look at the vast swaths of forum posts where gamer's spend endless hours just debating over game designs and mechanics, many of which being non-competitive games. So it's apparent people do actually care. \n\nStop being so blatantly selfish.","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2017-01-07T11:46:59.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when you lay down some friendly banter but trigger the raging feminists","replies":[]}]}]}]}
