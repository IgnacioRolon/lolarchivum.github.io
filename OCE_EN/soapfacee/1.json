I want to play with some custom skins (that only I can see). The MK LoL program can do this but it also has other things such as timers, but they are implanted in the game now. So is it alright to use?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-03-24T10:27:45.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're using it for the timer the game already has it, and it's a fair timer I am not sure what kind of timer MK LoL uses.\n\nThere is pretty much no reason to install it if you're using the timer alone, and ofc its other features are most likely not allowed.","replies":[]}]}
