What is important to remember is that it really sucks for everyone else in the game too, because they have to play 4v5.  Even when you win at a 5v4 it feels a bit dirty, because you know the other team had a crappy game. It wastes everyone's time and nobody wants to be _that guy_!\n\nThats why it is important that you, as a player, are responsible for making sure that you can maintain a stable connection to the League servers when you play.  If you know you have a slow/crappy internet connection that drops out all the time - its important for you to learn what the cause is and make sure it gets fixed.  \n\nWhile everyone has the odd issue from time to time, leaverbuster is actually doing its job perfectly well when people who repeatedly leave games get put in a low priority queue.  It is there to make sure you realise you're actually causing problems for a lot of other players and to give you a strong push towards fixing them.\n\nThere are some [good resources](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) on the player support site for helping you figure out what the cause might be, and I'd strongly suggest you take a look!  You can also [get in touch with our player support team](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) if you are lost and they will help you figure out what is wrong.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Zagiri","date":"2017-06-13T22:22:29.506+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, Sometimes I get a leaverbuster even in Coop vs. AI like what?{{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dual Bot","date":"2017-08-17T06:04:05.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really now, it is MY JOB to talk to a ISP like comcast who absolutely give no fucks on their internet service because they are the only ones with the fastest connection here.\n\nI see why League is losing people around the world other than in Asia. Perhaps, Riot shall just move to Asia since Tencent is financing it and they have a better internet anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"checkeredartist","date":"2017-03-15T03:41:13.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SECONDING.\ni had to leave a game for 10 minutes due to a faulty internet connection that was causing me a lot of trouble. then when i popped out of the game i got the leaverbuster. wtf...\n/ quietly pats zagiri on the back","replies":[{"poster":"Zagiri","date":"2017-03-16T23:04:45.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya I hope they fix the system, really sux!! 10mins in queue is a waste of time","replies":[]}]}]}
