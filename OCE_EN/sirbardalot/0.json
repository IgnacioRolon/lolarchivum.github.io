Your definition of troll, grief are merely you saying it without any evidences of the other players doing so.

Usually the normal thing to do is move on because there is nothing else to do, it's one of those game and people like that are out there. Punishment or not, they've already made it clear they don't care. So why should you pour so much attention in what cant be done? \n\nYou are making it sound like these cases exist due to the game lack of attention.

You cant stop crimes, you can only prevent them using a display of threat. Most people don't do so in fear of getting caught. But those that decide that they don't care, or can get away with it. Do as they pleased. \n\nThere is a system already, the reason bad things still happen because human are creatures of emotion. \n\nYou want a nobel prize on human psychology for anti-social immunization?

I inform my supports when I am wanting to freeze lane, if I want to push etc. and I will use pings too. As an example 2 days ago, I had a senna support who was auto filled. she didn't press Q at all until like 15 minutes, we we received a gank at 3-4 minutes, she Q'd a ward and walked back to the tower, that isn't playing bad that is trolling/greifing. I check the players match history and the games the summoner wasn't ADC were loses and she has a stupid amount of deaths for the time length of games. \n\nI do not judge players that are doing stuff like constantly fighting when they are behind and so on, but my games I either have people who are clearly griefing, trolling or just afk. And with the chat log being so strict, you can not say that the penalty system is bias'd towards the chat log.\n\nThe fact that that senna is still playing games and hasn't received a penalty, yet people can get chat banned from a single games without using hate speech. is pretty much proof that the system is not balanced. The way it is, at least in my mind you are more so allowed to troll than if loose your cool in games and say one line in chat, boom get chat penalized and wait 3-6 months to get your end of season rewards.\nAt least with Dota you get penalized for anything you can't play the main game modes, and you have a huge queue timer. and that gives a reason for people not to be idiots. however in league, you get penalized you can still keep playing the main game modes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2020-02-08T11:25:33.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you deem threats you receive warnings and possible restraining orders, you can not be arrested for saying words UNLESS it is terrorism related, YOU CAN NOT be arrested for threatening people, how ever you can be given a RVO.
