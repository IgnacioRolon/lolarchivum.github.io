On Summoner's Rift (5v5), the average time is 30-45 minutes. If the match takes longer than 45 minutes and a player leaves, LeaverBuster shouldn't take place.\r\n\r\nIt's not the player's fault that he managed his time specifically as if the match would take around 30-45 minutes, only happening to play and find out the match takes even longer than that. If the player leaves for any reason, he / she should be given lenience.\r\n\r\nOf course, many can debate against this and this is anything but a suggestion but it's an idea for people to think about.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-12T11:17:56.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should always allow for up to an hour when starting a match, regardless of the stated average game time. That is only an average after all. If you don't it's your own fault for not accounting for that amount of time.
