Want to play with adults(25+)? then TOG is for you.\n\n**Who are TOG?**\nThe Older Gamers is a multi-gaming community for the over 25. TOG is for anyone over that age bracket who might want to enjoy gaming, but without the requirements that many other guilds may impose. TOG is for gamers who can't go out boozing every weekend, because we have partners, and are left at our consoles & PC's playing games after a quiet dinner or putting the kids to bed. TOG is for busy workers who need to de-stress from their busy jobs by chilling out in a game each night. TOG is also for people who have retired and find themselves with plenty of time to indulge a hobby of online gaming, Lastly, but not least, TOG is for those who just want to play with people in their own age group and away from the drama rowsdowers.\n\n\n**What do you get from TOG?**\n~ Access to our vast forum and a great community.\n~ We have many guilds/groups spanning over 50 game division and you can join any of them without needing to re-apply.\n~ Dedicated TS server for all games.\n\n**What does the League of Legends division in TOG offer you?**\n~ A mature crowd to hang with.\n~ The option to join in our ranked and social team/s.\n~ A place to chat, laugh and not feel judged on your skill or lack thereof.\n\nWe are all pretty relaxed bunch players and although we play certain games competitively and are serious about enjoying our gaming, skill level and 'commitment to a game' are not requirements to play with TOG. We expect all our members to be respectful of fellow TOGers (until you get to know them, then the ribbing can start!), regardless of their skill at a particular game.\n\nTOG has a good reputation in the wider community. We take our gaming seriously but not at the expense of other members or players, not everyone has the same levels of skill and nor should it be expected. We play and compete for the fun and enjoyment of the game. We do however have teams for those who want to play with a more committed or competitive team.\n\nIf TOG sounds like a place you could call home, come join us.\n\n**How do I join?**\n~ You must be 25 or older(no exceptions)\n~ Head over to http://www.theoldergamers.com and sign up.\n~ Make your way to 'The Barracks' forum\n~ Have a read of the stickies\n~ If you would still like to join us, and meet the age requirement, go ahead and apply for full TOG membership.\n\nCheers,\nGG","replies":[{"poster":"Thorentine","date":"2015-01-08T08:26:19.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow TOG still around i played along side those guys back in RTCW\\ET days good to see they still going..... love to have a game with you guys some time im on LOL most nights","replies":[{"poster":"Static Orb","date":"2015-01-13T02:49:38.085+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thorentine, What was your name in ET? That's where I joined TOG initially. Used to play for YoY/Rok/Ubik and a few other teams.\n\nAlso would highly recommend TOG to any over 25er's, honestly there's nothing to lose, it's free to join. Worst case scenario you don't get along with people somehow and just don't play with them anymore lol. On the plus side you get to play with people your age or closer to it and don't have to put up with all the randoms from solo queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gamer","date":"2015-01-13T09:11:24.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, we now have a public channel, TOG Friends.

I'd rather not give details to be honest but you'd be surprised how much information people put up on the internet which is relatively easy to dig up.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-08T12:26:14.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) you have to suspect them, so someone not suspicious could very easily be under 25?\nB) if your \"under 25\" methods have to rely on the internet, just one note, some people (me included) actually lie about their age online normally, cause you know, identity theft is a thing.\nC) some people share usernames with other people.\n\nJust saying there is no actual way to prove someone online is actually an age.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gamer","date":"2015-01-12T03:35:24.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) The first post is usually the place where most people trip up. Having been a Mod for a number of years, over time I've learned to spot them. Sometimes it's something as simple as the content of the post or how they write, often it's nothing tangible but something about it sends my spidey senses tingling and that's enough for me to start digging.\n\nB) I completely understand, but keep in mind that we are dealing with people, and people forget things such as accounts on other forums/game platforms with similar names, or for the sake of ease fall into a pattern that can be followed.\n\nC) True, but although some of these people share the same name, they might not share the same game interests, location, friends, etc.\n\nWhilst there's a bit more to my points above, I'd rather not go into specifics and help out them young whippersnappers ;P \n\nAt the end of the day, there is no foolproof way to make sure all applicants meet the TOG age requirement. We, as Mods, work very hard to make sure people don't slip through. We also rely on honesty, and there are quite a few honest people out there. Finally, the one's that do slip through the cracks usually get found out one way or another.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-12T13:05:59.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For B i will just say this.\n\nDue to my age being old enough for most stuff, i started lying and saying i was younger, mostly cause i don't like people actually knowing my age rather then any fantasy of actually being younger.\n\nI just think an age restriction like the above is stupid and worthless, fact is the maturity counts for more then the actual age.","replies":[{"poster":"Gentleman Gamer","date":"2015-01-13T00:30:28.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people can display maturity beyond their years, I hear you and I agree, but the inverse is true as well, and these are exceptions to the rule, not the norm. \n\nRegarding lying about your age to be younger, it's interesting, most people swing the other way but I think I understand it. There have been plenty of times where someone has asked me my age in a game and I answered honestly, only to then cop a ribbing, or abuse, for it. I can see the attraction in misleading others about my age, usually to avoid being paid out for it, but the fact is I like being my age and all that it entails. \n\nPlaying alongside other mature gamers and having the choice of playing in whatever game I choose, where we have our own servers and support infrastructure, beats playing with the young crowd any day. I never have to put up up some prepubescent kid going off in the mic, or abusing me and others. \n\nYou might think our requirements are stupid and worthless, but TOG's success says otherwise, the success is built in large part on the age requirement.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
