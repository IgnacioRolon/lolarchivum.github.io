(AUS)","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR:  Anyone else have OPTUS internet having huge ping spikes/ bouts of lag during normal games?\n\n\nHello everyone, the past few weeks I have had a whole lot of trouble with my internet and playing LoL. \n\nI have spoken to two other people in game when we were getting laggs, both of these people including \" DeadShambala\" have OPTUS as their ISP and from what they explained to me, sounds very very similar to what problems I'm dealing with too. \n\nBasically, Bot games are fine. I can play a whole game vs bots (with 4 other real human players) without a lag the whole game. As soon as I join a normal game and a enemy champion comes into my view (screen) I lag up, not every time but quite often. During teamfights especially.\n\nEDIT: A few months ago the same sort of thing happened to OPTUS, normal internet would work fine but LoL and a few other random things wouldn't work properly. It might be this again. I'm trying to work out if its just me or what...","replies":[{"poster":"SupahSandLesbian","date":"2015-03-04T10:57:47.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too have Optus and they are horrifically bad. I get the same problem in CS:GO with ping shooting up from a stable 74 to around 980. It stays there for a while before steadily declining again. It makes crucial situations impossible to comprehend.  I legit have the beefiest computer ever so it's got nothing to do with my hardware. I honestly feel like calling Optus up and telling them how much of a joke they are. 'Unlimited' bundle my ass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T00:10:44.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That's frame lag, not internet lag, and it's an issue that was introduced with the most recent patch. I've got a beast computer setup that normally runs Crysis and max settings with 1000 frames a second (may be exaggerating) but I've noticed that in team-fights my FPS drops twenty frames or so. This normally never happens.\n\nHopefully a red notices soon and makes a hot-fix. If that doesn't happen then we're stuck with this issue for a *long* time.","replies":[{"poster":"NewbTuewb","date":"2015-02-19T10:31:13.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is not FPS lag, I do know the difference.

Of course, I won't deny that these thing can't be related at all but they're probably not.\n\nPress Ctrl+F in game. What does your ping jump to when you have these lag spikes?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NewbTuewb","date":"2015-02-19T10:32:23.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just played a game and another player was spamming 'lag' in the chat every time I lagged up too.
