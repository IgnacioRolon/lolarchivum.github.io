I&#039;ll go into detail: I was playing my second game of Jhin after playing countless hours to get the amount of IP to get him the day of release, so i get into game and notice they have a wukong in the game and to be honest i really don&#039;t like him as a champion i think his gap close and empowered ranged auto makes him so hard to kite and he can literally catch you anywhere and not to mention a really short cool down on his Q-E combo makes him so broken (in my opinion) plus the fact that his ult feels like your in the air for about 40 million years and a escape that mitigates snares, stuns and literally everything if timed correctly (seems to be every wukong player in OCE can dodge %90 of the time, anything from any champion) and to top this proverbial CAKE! you have the balls to \r\n **actually give me him as a mystery champion** after ocean week. \r\n\r\nHow low can you get to put me down and you can even see the game that i played before i got him in the push in the link bar, seriously are you mocking me or something or is this some sick joke seriously fix this please this is unacceptable standards of all the champions i didn&#039;t want and after a game where i got  stomped on you gift me he as some sort of coaxing to get me to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-02T21:34:47.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't want the champion, you may submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and request they remove it from your roster.
