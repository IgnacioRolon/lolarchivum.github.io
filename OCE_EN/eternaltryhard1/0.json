It is infuriating that I can&#039;t play with people who are the same skill level in lane, it legit just makes me want to leave","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-18T21:08:01.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you never play any other season of league?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-21T13:26:36.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that personally, while autofill can be quite an annoying part of league it does have some positive aspects too it.\n\nThe first of which being the main reason it was added into the game, shorter queue times. This helps us find games much faster than before and get right into the action letting us play more league that we love and find teams faster. \n\nThe second of which and one I find that is quite interesting is that when you are autofilled you are forced to play a role that you aren't always going to be your best at. If you look at this from a learning experience perspective this can be an amazing part of playing ranked. There are many mechanics that you can learn in one role that can be transferred too your main role that you will learn faster from another location in the map. For example maybe if you get autofilled into support it will give you a good insight into how to ward around the map more effectively or better locations to put your wards, maybe you get autofilled top lane and it will teach you how to combo or trade better which you can use your advantage in other lanes. \n\nAnother reason that you could look at it in a positive light is that ranked is always the best place to learn, and when you are autofilled into a role you aren't used to, often you can say you got autofilled and ask for advice on how to play a certain lane or matchup and you will learn opinions about how to play that you wouldn't of otherwise to help you improve and better your own play.\n\nI hope this helps as a bit of my thoughts as to why autofill is a part of league and I wish you luck in your games, I will see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-12-18T22:43:16.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a support main, and I hardly ever get my first preference of the role in the mornings ;_;\nMaybe its just because support mains are only ever on in the morning?
