I have been on a terrible losing streak in Dota, and my experience with the community has left a sour taste in my mouth as of late. Its basically all Ive been playing for the past 20 months so I figured its time to at least try something else while taking a break from Dota 2. I have 1100 games racked up in D2, so I have a fairly good idea of what Im doing already, I just need advice on champions etc.\r\n\r\nIn D2 I usually play safe lane carry role, but can play mid or offlane as well. I usually play late game right clickers, and my play style is usually farm heavy as well as split push i.e. Radiance, manta style Alchemist or Spectre (for those who have played Dota). Can anyone recommend some champions that play a similar role, and are any of them in the free rotation this week? Ive been playing Shyvana top lane in my co-op bot games and have found reasonable success with her, should I stick to her or would anyone recommend anything else?\r\n\r\nLastly, Im ~3k MMR in Dota, what does that roughly equate to in LoL?\r\n\r\nThanks for any responses.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex Manisier","date":"2016-02-02T00:24:51.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lategame right clickers in League tend to be ranged, not melee. That's because League doesn't have turn rate, so it's pretty easy to orbwalk with champions like Ashe and Caitlyn when you'd struggle to do that in Dota with Drow or Sniper. \n\nLeague doesn't have a lot of overlap with Dota when it comes to split pushing carries, though. Most high-damage carry champions are either good in teamfights (Jinx and most other marksmen) or good in 1v1/split pushing scenarios (Jax, Fiora, Tryndamere), but rarely both. Based off what you're saying, Quinn might be a good free rotation choice! She can dominate most top laners because of her superior range, and her Q is really good for 1v1s. Plus if you spot trouble coming your way, her ulti makes her move fast enough to escape most ganks if you can get the channel off.\n\nShyvana's also a decent choice for starting out since all her abilities are pretty simple. If you find her fun I recommend you try other tanky bruisers like Volibear, Olaf or Darius.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-01T09:14:31.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"3000 MMR is average MMR to my understanding. So around Silver 5 - 3 in League.\n\nIf you found the DotA community terrible though, I wouldn't be so sure that you'll enjoy League ahah. It can get toxic at times, especially ranked. \n\nAs for your farm heavy split push champion, I'd recommend {{champion:75}} **Nasus** or {{champion:23}} **Tryndamere**. They are both Top lane champions, which I imagine is what you guys call _\"offlane\"_.\n\nLast thing from me, make sure you are very weary of ganks. DotA players always seem to forget there's a jungler in League, who will punish you for overextending. Keep wards and map awareness up.","replies":[{"poster":"cheeze2000","date":"2016-02-01T13:32:52.125+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not trying to contradict what you are saying but until now I never see how toxic OCE is. In my opinion, OCE is by far the 'cleanest' server. I am not sure if there is any toxic, I will still believe you because you played way more games than me.\nOk so, I actually agree how you mention about the jungler. DotA players always try to win lanes and they seldom gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-02T07:11:50.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little bit of clarity seems to be needed here.\n\nOce doesn't have the most toxicity, its just when it happens, the toxicity is extremely more offensive and rude","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2016-02-01T21:29:23.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think League is way better especially now I am in higher ranked games (high gold low plat).
