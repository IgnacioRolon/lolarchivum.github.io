The air was thick with the fine grains, buildings and rubble reduced to shadows and shapes that flickered and disappeared with the changing of the wind. \r\n\r\nAmong the ruins, a violet glow pierced the storm. It emanated from a small, three-legged creature, it&#039;s round body buffeted by the growing gusts of wind. \r\n\r\nThe creature felt hunger gnaw at its insides, however it knew it needed shelter better than the  broken surroundings could offer. Burrowing into the shifting sands, it began to glide through the earth, out of the ruins and into the deserts of Shurima. \r\n\r\nPeaking above the volatile sea of the dunes, the voidling pressed three magenta eyes into the storm, barely able to discern shapes from the shadows of the desert. Straining against the assault from the elements, it detected a lone shelter, standing firm against the winds. Sinking again into the darkness of the underground, it slid towards the house. \r\n***  \r\nSikath traced the patterns on the walls as she strode up and down the length of her house, worriedly. The sandstorm raged outside, each gust that shook her window panes increased her concern. \r\n&ldquo;Where are you Korrah?&rdquo;\r\nThe winds blew stronger. \r\n***\r\nApproaching the shelter, the voidling emerged from the sand, shaking its body to dislodge any loose particles stuck under the armoured plates of its exoskeleton. It found a small opening in the house just below the door, a swinging panel that covered a square entrance. Pressing its head through the opening, it squeezed its bulbous body into the house. \r\n\r\nSikath heard a clatter at the door as the familiar sound of the cat flap opening filled her with relief. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Korrah! You silly cat, I thought I&#039;d lost you to the storm! Oh thank the Gods you&#039;re ok!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe voidling looked up at the new creature that greeted it. This creature was far larger than it but seemed frail, with skin that wrinkled into deep crevices that creased her face and hands. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come Korrah, you must be so hungry. Let&rsquo;s get you something to eat.&rdquo; She fumbled to a set of drawers and removed a small amount of cured meat, placing it on the floor for her guest. Picking up her long staff, she tapped her way towards a weathered wicker chair and sunk into it, her joints creaking as loudly as the chair itself. \r\n\r\nThe voidling saw the meat placed on the ground and began to skuttle towards it, feeling the acute pains of it&rsquo;s insatiable hunger. Devouring the morsel, it turned to the lady with a ravenous glare. \r\n\r\nYears of life in the desert had left Sikath with milky eyes and thick cataracts that clouded her vision entirely. Her blindness was what allowed the voidling to enter her home under the guise of her cat. Now, unable to see the danger she was in, Sikath remained lounged in her chair as the creature closed in on her sandalled foot. \r\n\r\nAs the beast dove forward, ready to feast once more, it felt a sharp pain as the base of it&rsquo;s head was met with the hard wooden surface of the staff that was in Sikath&rsquo;s hand.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to try better than that if you want to sneak up on me! I might be blind but I have ears you know.&rdquo; Sikath chuckled to herself, shaking her head as she lounged back in the chair again. \r\n\r\nReeling with a screech, the voidling shook its head, confused and cautious, surprised by the speed of the seemingly helpless being that it shared shelter with. Circling the chair that Sikath sat on, the voidling kept a safe distance from the staff that rested across her lap as it examined the situation with uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe pacing and stress of the evening had left Sikath&rsquo;s bones aching. In her age and current weary state, she lacked the energy to stay awake in such a comfy chair, so decided it would be best to fall asleep on her bed rather than her current seat. As she stood up, groaning from the effort, she became aware of each joint complaining. Finding her way to her bed she sat with a sigh, her slight weight barely shifting the bed as she did so.\r\n&ldquo;Come, Korrah,&rdquo; she crooned, patting the area beside the bed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to sleep.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nCalculating as ever, the voidling looked at Sikath, who now invited it to join her on the mattress wrapped in covers of Eka&rsquo;Sul hides. Bracing the two hind legs and aiming itself with the third, it lept upwards, scrabbling to mount the bed and take a seat, staring inquisitively at Sikath. While hunger still burned deep within it, curiosity and fear kept it at arms length from the aging woman. \r\n\r\nSikath heard her small house guest jump up and, with a brief scratching of the hide that lay over the mattress, take a seat. She smiled, feeling her strength fade as she grew more tired. Absently, she reached out her hand to pat the small creature who sat just a few inches from her as she readied herself for sleep.\r\n\r\nThe magenta eyes burned bright as the hand closed in on the head of the voidling. Gaping wide, the hideous maw of the beast filled with a vile liquid that brought an acrid scent to the air. Leaning towards the hand, the voidling growled, uncertain, but hungry.\r\n\r\nSikath&rsquo;s hand made contact at the crest of the beast&rsquo;s head, running over the plated exoskeleton that protected its body. Upon contact, she instantly knew this was not Korrah, but something else, something alien. She had heard tales of the Void and it&rsquo;s creatures, yet remained steadfast as her hand inquisitively ran across the head of the voidling, over the extension of the neck and across it&rsquo;s rounded body. Her fingers traced the segmented armour and ran up and down the joints that connected body and limbs, all the while more aware of the heavy breaths and low growls that came from the creature beneath her fingers.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing her hand slowly, she considered for a second.\r\n&ldquo;Hmm...not Korrah...Kor&rsquo;Rah...yes, that is more fitting I think.&rdquo; \r\nThe voidling cocked it&rsquo;s head at the mention of this new name, it&rsquo;s name. Closing its mouth slowly, Kor&rsquo;Rah regarded the old lady with sustained suspicion, confused by her gentle touch. \r\n&ldquo;Well, Kor&rsquo;Rah, I&rsquo;ve heard what your type do, I only ask that you spare an old lady the trouble of having to fight you, I am far too tired for that and my back aches something awful. You can stay here with me if you want, or leave in the morning but I don&rsquo;t think you should go out in that storm, it&rsquo;s too dangerous for a little thing like you.&rdquo; Sikath turned to fix the covers of her bed, pausing before facing Kor&rsquo;Rah again. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think you should eat me either, I&rsquo;m not much of a meal really.&rdquo; She chuckled at her own morbid sense of humour as she returned to the covers, finally fixing them into a satisfying position.\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed now, Kor&rsquo;Rah, you can sleep where you please, good night.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nAs Sikath tucked herself into bed, her hands trembled slightly. At her age she knew she would not be able to fight off one of the Void&rsquo;s creations, even a small one like this. All she could do was wait.\r\n\r\nKor&rsquo;Rah watched the figure that now lay on the bed, her breaths rising and falling, lifting the hides gently with each inhalation. He was hungry but he was tired too. It was safe here. His hunger could be satisfied in the morning. Nuzzling against the warm body of his house mate, he planted his three feet under him comfortably, curling into a ball, slowing his breathing and eventually falling asleep beside the slightly terrified Sikath, who sighed to herself as she allowed her body to relax into an uneasy rest.\r\n*** \r\nAs Sikath woke, she noted that not only was she alive, but alone. While she was relieved, the silence of the empty house seemed more unnerving than before. She found herself pottering, looking for things to keep her busy before finding none and sinking into her wicker chair, defeated. As she leaned further back into the seat, a struggling and scraping, accompanied by soft growls and chirps, greeted her ears as a smile snuck into the corners of her mouth.\r\n&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re staying with me now, I think I might need a bigger cat flap, Kor&rsquo;Rah.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe sun baked the desert sands with unrelenting fury as Sikath sat on her wicker chair, shaded by the patchwork roof over her head. She ran her weathered hands across the shell of the jittery Kor&rsquo;Rah who waited patiently for his next meal, listening to the gentle words of his carer.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading :D hope you enjoyed","replies":[{"poster":"AvK Ðęlµxe ąƒ","date":"2018-03-24T20:46:05.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid Idea.
