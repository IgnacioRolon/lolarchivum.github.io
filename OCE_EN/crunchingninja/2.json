Even while Jax has activated Counterstrike, or Teemo blinds the enemy Udyr, both still get effected by most on-hit effects. (I believe this includes Quinn blind as well)\r\n\r\nExamples include Udyr Q and E, Blitz E and, in particular, Nasus Q. Everyone thinks that Jax can beat a 700 stack Nasus. Although Jax is (hopefully) pretty tanky, he still receives a ton of damage while E is active from the Nasus Q. Teemo still gets knocked up after blinding the enemy Blitzcrank.\r\n\r\nAnything I&#039;ve missed, please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-10T05:04:48.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummm as far as i know, the Blitzcrank E should go through (not the nas Q to my knowledge)","replies":[]}]}
