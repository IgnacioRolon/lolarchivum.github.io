During the first few minutes of play, I will experience those tiny mini disconnections that feel like lag spikes but aren&#039;t? For example, I&#039;ll go in to CS or to harass the opponent and instead of completing the action, I will get that &quot;reconnecting&quot; loading bar on my screen and then it will jump to a few seconds further into the game where I&#039;ve either walked into the enemy or just been completely killed. The weird thing is that it ONLY happens during the first 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nAnyone experience this or know some solutions?\r\n\r\nAny help would be nice, cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-14T09:28:06.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you turn on your computer and then play? It could be that there's a service set to automatically start upon boot up which is using your computer's bandwidth. Look through your startup apps and disable any that you don't need.\n\nIf that's not the case, then it could be automatic maintenance which is cancelling itself when it detects that a bandwidth heavy program has been running for ten minutes.\n\nOtherwise, you have a standard connection issue that just *happens* to only affect the first ten minutes of every game.","replies":[]}]}
