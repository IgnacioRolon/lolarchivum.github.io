Too much so.\n\nIm not an irelia player, but I too would have preferred something more akin to the old skin _(at very least keep the hair that cool ice blue)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-23T08:42:40.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">...we also saw a lot of great feedback on other parts of the skin that we want to respond to. First, weâ€™re changing hair color to bring it more blue (more ice read, closer to original - less gem/crystalline look). We added some reflective material to make it feel more like ice\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IreliaMains/comments/8675zo/addressing_irelia_feedback/\n\nSeems like the feedback has been heard, as to how drastically things will change who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-23T11:05:47.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow! thanks for linking me this!
