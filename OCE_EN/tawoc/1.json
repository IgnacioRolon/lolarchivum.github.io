You want it to be a warm and fun place where you feel welcome. You may as well think of it as a second family to enjoy a past time with.\r\n\r\nTAW (The Art of Warfare) is broken up into several divisions in which their members participate in weekly scheduled training/practice matches and internal tournaments. We also frequently play against other clans/gaming groups when the interest arises. Each game we play hosts its own mini-clan that operates within the whole of TAW making us the large community we are. From FPS games to MMORPGs - you name it - we have it all.\r\n\r\nHere in the League of Legends division we welcome all players from the casual to the competitive. TAW holds League of Legends practices twice a week over TeamSpeak. Community members are divided into squads of up to 5 which are kept as consistent as possible every week, and are led by an experienced \"Squad Leader\".\r\n\r\nThe League of Legends Division of TAW is broken into 4 Battalions. Europe Nordic and East, Europe West, North America and of course Oceania, each using their respective servers. The practice times are:\r\n\r\nBattalion 1 North America East: \r\nMon & Wed 21:00 EST \r\n\r\nBattalion 2/3 Europe Nordic-East/West:\r\nSun & Wed 20:00 CET \r\n\r\nBattalion 5 Oceania:\r\nTues & Thurs 19:30 AEST\r\n\r\nWhat sets us aside from other gaming communities?\r\n\r\nIt's our Code of Ethics and our Chain of Command (CoC). Every member in TAW (just as a fun tip â€“ we are now 2300+ members out of which a grand number of around 200 members are just in the LoL Division) abides by our Code of Ethics.(Url=http://taw.net/wikis/welcome/our-code-of-ethics.aspx)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in becoming a member of our growing organization which has been around for 10+ years, you will find TAW to be a welcoming and accepting group of good folks who just want to enjoy the gaming experience.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the following:\r\nA Working Mic\r\nTeamspeak 3(Url= http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads)\r\nProficient in the English Language","replies":[{"poster":"Boxdogman","date":"2015-12-05T09:37:59.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"MechaSam","date":"2015-10-14T08:17:32.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our Oceania events have changed to Tuesday and Friday 7:30pm AEDT (Sydney time)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-03-13T11:20:38.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um....
