When it comes to the end of the season, all the smurfs come out to play, and all the people trying to to get to gold get their smurf friends to help them. I hurts me that people feel this need to do this to try and get the reward and don&#039;t care about those of us that are normal players trying to reach gold normally. I am off to help test in PBE.\n\nThank you for reading this, \nSliver 1,\nLioncat55","replies":[{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-11-11T07:05:06.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"What?
