Riot cannot use tribunal as more than 60% of the community is toxic. If they release tribunal now, people would just be getting banned due to toxic player voting giving away punishments out of anger.\r\n\r\nNow to address this problem there are may ways to approach it. First of all i think we should look at what a toxic player is. \r\nA toxic player is someone who has lost a lot of games due to either their own inability to point their own mistakes or teammates making bad decisions in game. Now we all know that most of the player base is made up by teenagers. Teenagers are tricky to deal with as they have a very egotistical way of thinking. If they feel anyone is telling them they are wrong they take a offensive form and lash out with swear words and threaten to feed. Now say 1 person tells another person &quot; You are doing crap stop feeding fuk head&quot; rather than &quot; Play safe buddy, others can carry and u can catch up later&quot;. this makes the victim player feel embarrassed and we all know teenagers don&#039;t deal with embarrassment well so they say &quot; fuk u im feeding idc&quot;. and soon after losing that game a player who did well last game, but lost due to a feeder will get angry and go into another game with some of that toxic mentality (sort of like revenge on the community} because they dont care anymore. you need to realize when someone loses his promos due to a feeder or someone, they feel very hurt and angry, so the next game they enter is bound to be with an attitude of &quot; i really do not give a shit&quot;. this is a toxic person it starts with one person telling another person they are shit and from their on out it is just about hurting each others ego. Chain of toxicity.!!!\r\nNow of you let the current community vote in tribunal i can guarantee u will lose 60% of the player base straight away. but im sure riot is well aware of that thats why they are building a new tribunal system. you cant have people who just lost a game voting in tribunal because they have clouded judgment.\r\n\r\nSome ideas could be to only let people with a good track record to vote in tribunal. so their (Honor to reports ration is like 8:1 or something like that).\r\nYour leaver buster is working as it is which is fine. but leaver buster should include reduced LP loss ( I know this is exploitable but listen out). You could let the enemy team have a vote like a (Have mercy button). Now this could allow up to say 5 lp loss reduction on players who played, and those 5 points from each go to the leaver plus additional loss for leaving so like upto 50 lp loss. So the only way is upto the enemy team. If they know a person Afk form start they will have mercy or he fed an afks in the end. Either way this option should only come up when a leaver buster has detected a leave. However if a person leaves 5 mins b4 match end and leaver buster detects it the enemy team can just chose not to vote and for the vote to pass atleast 3 people have to vote yes and if there is a duo que present then 4 people have to click yes. Now if someone leaves for toxic reasons they lose 50 lp + This way they will learn a good lesson.\r\n\r\nNow onto the part of people who say whatever comes to their mind. Here are a list of some quotes that are very insensitive that i have come accross in league.\r\n1) I will cum on your dads lips and make her go down on ur mother so your brother is my son.\r\n2) if your parents know u were this shit they would have gotten an abortion.\r\n3) i hope ur family gets cancer and raped by a bunch of arabs.\r\n4) go kill urslelf feeder fuk.\r\n5) faggot feeder.\r\n6) i bet ur parents dont love you thats why you feed\r\nthe lost goes on and on. Riot this is important, with he current way the life is going kids are exposed to internet more than real life interactions so it will pretty much be upto you to &quot; raise them &quot; if people who are 13 14 15 see this kind of language not get punished online they are bound to think it is acceptable and start thinking it is coo. this is not the kind of message you should be sending, The fact that you have the option to remove language filter  will make people think that swearing is okay. You should really have a system where if a person get 4 votes from team for abusive language, he will get punished by riot by it. chat restriction dont do much you need to reduce LP gain for that person. Punish bad sportsmanship no people who are bad at the game, everyone is learning, mistakes happen you either learn from them or you dont. But being a sore loser and going on the offensive just because you dont want to admit ur mistake is just wrong and should be punished.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is nothing keeping toxicity in check. tribunal didnt work in the past because people were just punishing people without reading. So if you do release a new tribunal make sure the the people who vote on it have a good track record.!!\r\n\r\nthank you riot and just because someone is being toxic doesnt mean u nerf irelia!","replies":[{"poster":"TheBlanc","date":"2015-04-30T05:10:47.797+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot PLS LOOK AT THIS!!!","replies":[{"poster":"mat228","date":"2015-04-30T05:12:01.684+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesnt look at anything.

I think the one I agree with the most is how easy it is for toxicity to breed more toxicity. There are a few things I would like to point out for you though.\n\n1. You talk about \"most\" players being teenagers and base a lot of your arguments on this. What age range are you talking about specifically? 11-19? We released [statistics in 2012](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2012/10/lol_infographic-610x3217.png) that showed that 60% of our players are enrolled in or have completed some University (College being the American term)\n\n2. You said \"Currently there is nothing keeping toxicity in check. tribunal didnt work in the past because people were just punishing people without reading.\"\nHere is a [quote from Riot Lyte](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2ws22k/i_miss_doing_tribunal_work/cotzgsz) talking about a few things that we are working on or have already implemented and why the tribunal is taking so long\n\n> Every once in awhile, I see a thread like this and it's a :( day.\n> Tribunal's been down for 9 months, and we know that's a long time. However, player behavior in League has been at record bests due to a few different systems that were implemented while Tribunal is being re-worked.\n> \n> 1) The new LeaverBuster has been out for 2 months now, and has pushed leavers/AFKs to a record low in the history of League. I'm hoping to share more data around this when we wrap up analyses.\n> \n> 2) The machine learning system has been extremely aggressive at combating racism, homophobia, sexism and death threats. Right now, these types of behaviors show up in approximately 2% of games globally. An interesting \"test\" is to think about your last few games, and think about the last time you actually saw someone use the \"n\" word, or c*nt, or similar obscene phrases.\n> \n> 3) There is a new intentional feeder detection system that has been banning out intentional feeders outright. We have a record low in number of players who are actually intentionally feeding (the old days of 0-20 and 5 Zeals are gone).\n> \n> But, this is not an excuse for the Tribunal's delay. It just turns out that re-working the Tribunal required re-working several foundational pieces of League, such as the Report System's backend, how chat logs are generated on the platform, and how websites/front-ends are created across every server. When players think of \"just\" re-working the Tribunal, they don't think about all these other pieces which are each complex systems.\n> In addition to the above, the new Tribunal will have the ability for players to review positive behaviors and reward players with in-game bonuses, and some algorithmic upgrades to improve efficiency of the system, accuracy in detecting troll voters, and improves overall system accuracy.\n> I'm happy to answer some questions for a bit tonight, but apologize for the delay in the system coming back.\n\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards.

I do understand that riot is doin everything they can to fix it but a machine will never assess in  the same way a human would for example you say peopel dont swear and dont say c*** what they do say is Kunt, they dont say fu** they say fuk. \nAnd in terms of potential feeders a machine wont be able to catch them. You see i met an intentional feeder and he was really good at it without being noticed. He actually went to the effort of stealing team junglers buffs and counter jungling him just for a loss in a subtle way. and then late game purposely getting caught out. and in teamfights missing skill shots! :(\n\nI know its hard to release tribunal but what im asking is if the riot employees could somehow go over reports for people that have been reported alot :). What you need to also fix is the division 5 of every league. they jsut dont want to win they dont care about a win they are happy to stay there while some people want to improve :)).\n\nAlso you need to allow for some kind of deal to happen in champion select, half the time matches are lost jsut in that screen due to the team being dysfunctional. if someone doesnt get their role they threaten to feed ( Im not saying everyone but half the time this happens ).  I like the idea of sighing up for a role before you go into champ select that way it works out for everyone :)).\n\nI know tribunal is a long way and you guys want it to be perfect but we would all love something to compensate for its absence. we all love this game and will continue to play it we just want it to be full of people who are happy ( not asking you to ban toxic people, but treat the toxicity ).\n\nI dont mind people making mistakes at all, but if someone makes a mistakes and starts feeding because he has given up thats just sad :(","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-05-01T00:18:12.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love for you to watch this and hear your feedback: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n\nThis video discusses how Riot leverages machine learning to \"learn\" at massive scale what players believe is OK or not OK in the community and deliver feedback to players, and how these cutting-edge techniques can be applied to curate any online community.","replies":[{"poster":"Bootiesweat","date":"2015-05-01T09:57:47.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Enjoyed that video. Its great that riot is trying to get the the very core of toxicity.\nThe part about perception was great :). But as you people have found out changing someones perception is very tricky as you have to remove the barrier formed by their ego. Admitting that you are wrong and apologizing for it is a quality that should be in everyone either in real life or Online. However as the video said due to the people being anonymous they tend to do things without any repercussions.\n\nYou guys have some very nice ideas i can see how it will take a long time :). Ideas such as One size does not fit all are very good. Aiming to change the perceptions of people is nice :) . Achieving it will be hard :)\n\nI had a game where someone was actually going out of his way to bronze 5 so he could win against new players. Someone called him out and said \" you re reported \". and he said \" HAHAHAHA do u really think riots looks at this shit \" . This kind of comment was made in front of 9 other people in the end game lobby. out of those 9 people 5 would be happy to vs him because it was a free win, but the 4 who lost feel cheated and feel like it isnt fair and now they are more likely to believe riot does not look at these reports. I suggest you publicize bans to show people that action is being taken rather than just send them an email :P. \n\nPermanent ban delete the person they dont change the behaviours. People should be trying to become a better person rather than do it because they dont wanna get banned. Awards do help but then you are just bribing good behaviour ( Becomes like a thing wher eu give a dog a biscuit and they do a trick ). Rather I believe restrictions should be applied for people who continue bad behaviour for example : Reduced LP gain on wins, Reduced Ip gain, longer que times.\n\nThere are so many factors to look at that to create a perfect system it is going to take a long time :) but it makes me happy that you looked at this post and went through the trouble to link me a video :).\n\nLike you said we need to get to the core of this toxicity so lets start with this.\n\nJust going to state some obvious facts before I go ahead.\n\nThere are 2 teams in this game. one is going to win, one is going to lose. The one that is going to win will have a pleasurable experience and the one who is going to lose is more likely to be affected negatively. Now people play this game to win because it gives a sense of achievement, so everybody wants to win :). Now say there is a person in the losing team, lets call him Person A. Say player A did well in his lane but lost tha match. When you lose in a team game you have a chance to use an excuse. The excuse can be \" Jungler didn't gank \", \" Enemy champion is OP \", \"My teamates fed \" , No one but me wants to get objectives \". It will be very rare for a person to say omg It was my fault i am so sorry. like in the video you sent to me Toxic joes will believe they are not at fault and they are better than their team. as mentioned in the video, everyones perception is different, however everyone thinks they are right. however in this world the right is determined by the majority. In league you we have a ranked system where it shows you the players rank. It is normal for everyone to strive and increase ranks because again it is a sense of achievement. Now unless you are a challenger lvling a bronze account to diamond its not going to be a straight line, its going to be a roller coaster. But people want to win all the time, so when someone loses their promos they will be very depressed and because the win meant alot to them they will lash out and blame everyone else on their team and will never reflect upon himself. now after losing the person is what everyone calls tilt, This tilt is actually desperation to win so they will try make risky plays and be more kill hungry in games to win which ends being bad leads to more loses. after a few loses and actually being demoted the person goes into a \" I dont care\" attitude, this is more of an anger thing where they are set on revenge against the community. when someone plays with this kind of attitude they are bound to create negative experience for another players whoa re now at risk of becoming toxic. Like we all know toxicity is an infectious disease.\n\nNow if player A had just stopped to think what he could have done better. Could he have communicated with he team a plan to win the game? Could he have gone to other lanes and helped? Could he have peeled?.  Could he have warded more , Could he have called mias?. Looking back at every decision to improve performance and giving players advice in your team in a very non aggressive manner. They could have won. Communicating with your team and asking for help or helping others can go along way to increase chance of victory. \n\nNo one is perfect. I have done poorly in so many games. And in most of them i have been called a \"fuking feeder\" and so on. Bringing someone down while they are doing poorly is never going to improve their game play infact. the moment someone tells someone on their team that they are very bad and should uninstall, any chance of victory is lost becuase chances are you ahve hurt their ego and they are bound to feed. It takes 2 to tango. Just because you did well in ur lane doesnt mean ur not part of the reason your team lost. Its a team game and if you dont work as a team against a team who is working as one, you are bound to lose. Its about team work and riot should emphasize that!!!!. No one ever carries a game alone. If it was possible to carry a game alone you could jsut ask ur team to afk at base lvl 1 and then try win. Riot should emphasize treating each others with respect. Loses will happen and win will happen. Treat ur team members with respect and try and understand others rather than just blame them.\n\nAnyway Maraudaur. thanks for all the relies i Hope the new tribunal system you guys are working on comes out soon :)). and make sure u keep us updated on any new ideas you guys are working on so that we dont lose hope.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bootiesweat","date":"2015-04-30T15:12:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-30T15:27:36.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Machine would be nice because they don't get tired or have to eat.
