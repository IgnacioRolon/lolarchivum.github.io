Yet when I go to the forums and search about the people who got it, it seems as everyone got to level 3 at about the same time, which was a pretty long while after the honor system came out. Does that mean that new players like me won&#039;t reach honor level 3 by the end of the season?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-03T14:17:29.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's safe to say that a large bulk of the players who've already hit Honour 3 are the ones who were \"ahead\" in progression, such as those who play and get Honoured a lot. There's still plenty of people who haven't quite hit it yet. As for reaching Honour 3 by the end of the season, it *should* be attainable as a new player. There's still 2-3 months until then and it seems, based on how it's gone so far, that it takes 1-2 months to hit level 3, depending on how often you play and get Honoured.","replies":[]}]}
