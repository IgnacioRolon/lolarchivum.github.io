But there are 2 things I cant really understand. First is how do I see how many wins I have in normal pvp and ARAM. The only thing I could see was my mastery points and how many wins in ranked, which I hardly play. And second, one more thing that is quite frustrating for me is that you cant check what the champ is( tank, mage, and so on). When you play aram you don&#039;t know all the champs so well and to choose the right runes and masteries have to check first what that champ is but unfortunately cant see that. Maybe I m doing something wrong and I confuse myself. But if anyone knows how to find all these maybe can share with me. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-10-26T03:50:22.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is this will be fixed later seeing that it is in Alpha. At the moment if you play with a friend who is on the Legacy Client (LC) and you are on the Alpha Client (AC), your friend will be viewing your name in the lobby on the LC when your on AC showing you have 0 wins. However if you go back on the LC and go in the lobby it will show how many wins you really have. \n\nSo I think they will fix this when it comes to the beta, or it will only be viewed on your profile which I think is a better option. It will give people a better habit of looking up the people they are playing with.","replies":[]}]}
