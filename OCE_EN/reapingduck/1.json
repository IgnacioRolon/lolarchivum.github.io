I think I have over 1400 hours on my new account, and lost my account from S1. I love this game to bits. It&#039;s a great game to play with friends at night, and just chill out. Recently I&#039;ve been playing games where me and my friends are just left absolutely speechless. It is unbelieve how toxic some people are. Yes we have fallen into the category of toxic, but who hasn&#039;t. My best example is from the last game I played. I&#039;ve only just started playing ranked because me and my friends thought we might as well since we&#039;ve played the game enough. Me and my friend were in a game and I was playing adc. All was well and I was pretty far ahead. When my blitz says &quot;Why get boots on Draven are you retarded??&quot; &quot;Go full lethality&quot;. I said &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Tyler1 build&quot;. He proceeded to say something along the lines of Fuck you, and ran it down boy lane. I was pissed. He then decided to just sit under our tower and only do anything if he could pull them under tower. It was impossible to play with. Then after a while he decided to start just not helping me or my team. So I fukn flipped and abused him. He kept telling me how I&#039;m retarded and if I apologise and say I&#039;ve got a small willy he&#039;all start playing again. I tell him to kys and I was done. My team started to fall behind because I lost my lead and couldn&#039;t help the team. So after he abused me one more time, I ran it right down the mid lane. I don&#039;t often do it, but boy I was pissed. It came to me at the end of the game when blitz only got reported by like me and 2-3 others that this game needs more consequences. Like, I&#039;m not gonna get banned or anything for inting, blitz isn&#039;t going to get banned for abuse or inting. There isn&#039;t enough punishment in this game, which is something I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d ever have to say. Riot pls. His name was &quot;name removed&quot;\n~ReapingDuck ;-;7\n(Butthurt retard)","replies":[]}
