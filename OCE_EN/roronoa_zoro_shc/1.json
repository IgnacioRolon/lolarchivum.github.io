So I'll list the changes below.\n\nViktor's \"Q\" Siphon Power: So with the first part of siphon power i thought it would suit the skin if he shot like a reverse tazer so it sucks power from them. As for the second part of siphon power with damage boost to the basic attack, I had a thought of viktor just shooting either high velocity round or large caliber round out of his handgun.\n\nViktor's Augmented Siphon Power: For the augmented version i couldnt think of anything besides jet boots for mobility effects.\n\nViktor's \"W\" Gravity Field: Ok with gravity field it already looks like viktor throws it so i thort it could be made to look like he throws a gravity grenade instead, so it still has the gravity field look but instead of the frame folding out and activating, when the grenade hits it could just bounce once or twice and then generate the gravity area\n\nViktor's Augmented Gravity Field: As for the augmented version it can have the same look and effect as the gravity grenade does but when it stuns an enemy it could do a reverse pulse effect sorta like an implosion to drag the enemy to the center\n\nViktor's \"E\" Death Ray: With the death ray ability I thought instead of the robotic arm and chaos beam that it fire it could be replaced with a shoulder mounted minigun or turret (like the M134 Vulcan Minigun)that fires bullets.\n\nViktor's Augmented Death Ray: And just as normal there will be the secondary explosion but this needs to look like a miniature carpet bomb to give the effect that the minigun/turret is firing explosive rounds that have a delay on the explosions.\n\nViktor's \"R\" Chaos Storm: For chaos storm i had the idea of a little helicopter drone with tiny propulsion jets at the back that uses a flame thrower and incinerates the area below it.\n\nViktor's Augmented Chaos Storm: But for the augmented version to show the faster movement speed of the drone it could have bigger jet flames coming out of the jets.\n\nI WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS SKIN AS AN EVOLVING MODEL IF POSSIBLE VIKTOR CAN START OFF LOOKING AND SOUNDING HUMAN WITH MINOR CYBERNETIC ATTACHMENTS BUT AS YOU LEVEL UP, UNLOCK AND AUGMENT ABILITIES VIKTOR COULD START TO SOUND AND LOOK MORE LIKE A CYBERNETIC HEXTECH COMMANDO.\n\n\nBut that's me done for now hope yous enjoy this idea and comment with any good idea changes for it oh and don't forget vote it up and give it a thumbs up so riot may see it and hopefully have a look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Roronoa Zoro SHC","date":"2016-03-11T05:22:34.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
