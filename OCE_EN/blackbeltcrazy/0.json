Though as progression is an important aspect of improving continual gameplay, i feel as if my ideology will provide a nice fundamental.\r\nI will be using top lane as an example rather than every lane just to convey basic concepts I wish to be discussed, approved or clarified to help me and others improve our games.\r\n\r\n**1**\r\nLaning. Personally I&#039;m a fan of evaluating each game individually. Given if you play top as say {{champion:17}}  for the good old haters, you would play differently vs an {{champion:84}}  as you would a {{champion:44}} , just for some exaggerated examples. \r\n\r\n1.1 - Know your strengths, know your weaknesses, know your opponents strengths, know your opponents weaknesses. If you are vsing the {{champion:84}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}} {{item:3146}} , it seems reasonable to play safe, whereas {{champion:44}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:12}} , you may feel you can zone the lane or atleast get a nice death-less lead at the very least in lower tiers, I can&#039;t speak for anything above Plat as I haven&#039;t recently been in any games of said caliber.\r\n\r\n1.2 - circumstantially building. Most of us have the core idea of a champions main build, though sometimes the enemy team will have 5 AD champions, with minimal magic scaling. This would seem reasonable to incorporate some armor into your build and avoid magic resistance items\r\n {{champion:122}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:59}} ===== {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3110}} ?\r\n\r\n1.3 - awareness. I believe there are 3 types of awareness. \r\nYour auditory awareness, for pings and warnings from turret strikes (if you listen and are on the border range, generally you can duck back and avoid the hit - the outer turrets seem to have a 0.5 delay or channel to hit if you will. I could be wrong however, just a sheer observation justified over repeated games. \r\nSecondly is your broader awareness. Now this may not be the appropriate terminology, though it seems suiting for expressions sake; broader awareness being your ability to swap between your minimap and your own champion - i personally hold spacebar to keep my champion centered. As jungle has cemented itself as a core role in current meta, you also need to be wary of what your jungler is doing and what presence he is providing for the team. (If you see him invade a red at 2:15 and force the enemy jungler back on low health with no flash, with the enemy mid laner contained inside the lane, then you can be rest assured you have 30 seconds grace to work your magic and flourish your talent in your top lane). \r\nLastly is simple awareness. This is the general lane specific events, such as how/when/why laning minions aggress, what their movement patterns are, what their gold values are, their damage, their cannon/double cannon spawn rate etc. This also includes your enemy and your own information as mentioned in my point &quot;1.1&quot;, so i won&#039;t repeat any redundant data. I like to place manipulation of your lane in this category too, though many may disagree; example being a fed {{champion:8}}  poxying top. Say he is 6/0/0 from a FB top, followed by a failed jungle/top dive to go 3-0, proceeded by a {{summoner:12}}  bot lane to pick up mid/bot by 10 mins and he is now well farmed and financially on his way to bill gates status. He is going to be strong, especially if chosen to use the many self healing aids with masteries and items {{item:3152}} , he is quite well able to poxy top lane deep into say {{champion:64}} who will be now severely outscaled. {{champion:8}}  could do this to further assure he gains maximum profit, whilst still drawing attention from the opposing teams mid/jg as well as top. If you know you can handle yourself nicely solo, whilst outnumbered, and you see 3 or 4 bot, relieve the team&#039;s pressure and push down the turret or make some severe damage. Punish them for their lack of numbers across the board. And force them to retreat and come pay you the attention you deserve, you ARE pretty enough for their attention!!!!! {{champion:21}} \r\n\r\n2. Punishing and winning games\r\nI would like to continue where ^ stopped.\r\nA simple fact is, you can&#039;t win a game if your team doesn&#039;t kill a turret (assuming surrendering is out of the question). However you can win a game with no kills if for some ungodly reason your team has become turret hungry and turns a blind eye to kills, however it is very unlikely and the chance of this happening could be best thought of as near impossible. \r\n^ paragraph will cause a lot of haste on the post, I know. But let me explain this further.\r\nKills gain you direct benefits, no-one can deny. Though these benfits only apply to participated killers. I&#039;m not saying don&#039;t emphasise kills, hell there are certain periods in the game where they are crucial, such as the 60minute mark where spawn timers are lengthy. \r\nTurrets provide a global benefit. Using 150g a turret x 5 allies is 750g gain for the team. If 2 lanes take their turrets worth 150g, then 5x(150x2) would resemble a kill for every player on your team in terms of gold.\r\nObjectives have also become increasingly important, and Riot has stated itself that they intended to make objectives a key component in the game. \r\nKnowing when to balance your strategies regarding turrets/kills/objectives is an absolute must. I often see 5 players alive, having killed 4 enemies on a team, then proceed to all run back to get a dragon or split off to get red/blue buffs. Using this scenario, if you have 2 lanes pushing close to an enemy turret, I would recommend taking those and splitting into 2/2 and using the jungler to focus on the dragon and attain buffs (given they should be capable of soloing and clearing in a sturdy fashion). This way you should ideally get a couple of them valuable turrets which ultimately free&#039;s up inhibitors) - alternatively, you may need the pressure of super minions in your favor and you may choose to push as 5 to take an inhibitor. Remember to assess the pressure super minions will apply, generally they will keep a constant damage character back to hold the fort, especially if there are 2 inhibitors down. Use this time to move as a group and take objectives, you will be out in the rift with a 5v4 advantage ideally, even if the defending enemy has {{summoner:12}} , it will still take a channel and the right moment for them to use {{summoner:12}} into position.\r\nFurthermore, if you have the chance to win the game, put simply you should. The aim of the game is to win, you shouldn&#039;t ever &quot;free farm&quot; to KDA boost. Not only is it disrespectful, but it can absolutely lose you games, especially if the enemy team has a very good late scaling into your teams poor late scaling.\r\n\r\nThere are so many more things I would like to include, and so many minor details I feel I could have explained much better. Though I don&#039;t want to make this a rookie novel, produced by a rookie. Please do comment and discuss!!!! Lets get our OCE comrades the elite status of those  referred to by the EU and KOR (just as examples I have seen used).","replies":[]}
