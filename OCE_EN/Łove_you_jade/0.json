Chances are it's your internet provider or you... Have a look around on your PC, there may be something downloading or sending every now and then that is giving you these lag spikes.\n\nBetter yet, why not have a break from league for awhile since you seem stressed. There's much more to do other than league.\n\nAlso, you encounter 5 people every game with this same issue??? Wtf? Wouldnt it end up as a 3v2 or something most of the time then?
