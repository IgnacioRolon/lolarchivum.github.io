Ranked teams in AGC play regularly with their ability to schedule practice sessions with their very own private text/voice channels and the option to scrim in-house against our other teams either in the same division or above for a real test of skill and co-ordination. If improvement is what you&#039;re after, in a competitive team environment, we also offer higher ELO coaches who can give you tips on your game. We are currently on the lookout to recruit players specifically for our ranked teams, solo, duo or even an entire five man, it doesn&#039;t matter. Just head on over to the google doc and fill out the signup sheet!\n\nhttps://discord.gg/k5twXBA come and say hi.","replies":[{"poster":"LoLBaIanceTeam","date":"2017-04-17T10:32:35.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very cool, I'll get my mates involved.
