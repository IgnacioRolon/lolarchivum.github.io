Then I took a break for 4 hours. Thinking by then the player would be one of two things. \n\nBAN and not playing because of what they said or not logged in. 4 hours later... I get the same player that made me leave the game for 4 hours to cool off in another game and once again said \" I said to go kill your self loser. Why are you even playing \" at which point because I was { To quote Riot here } Negitive.\nThen I got a 14 day ban for it.\n\nWant to know what is even better then that? The same player yesturday in one of my game... said \" Just kill your self fuck head. \" \n\nFunny how it works. Telling someone KYS is now allowed but when someone calls you a kid. You reply with.. \" Why must I be a kid. Do you like to play with kids? Damn sicko. Get some help and stop thinking about you playing with kids \" gets you prema.\n\nNothing will happen brah. You are prema. Meaning if you want to play. Make a new account. Riot is killing there own game right now. I guess that is why players are saying KYS again. Riot cannot ban anyone now since they went ape shit on banning people and now they killed the population of the game to hard.\n\nNew season normally brings old / new people back to the game. I guess this season it didnt happen as they wanted.\nI have been in que for over 20 mins right now while I typed this waitting for a ARAM...\nNice job Riot.

What happened here is likely because of 9x report, this is definitely not fair. You've been trying to reform so riot should definitely look into your other chat histories. Everyone has bad games I am sure this is one of them, riot should not have banned you for this, there may be other reasons but a permanent ban seems too harsh.\n\nThis is a mistake, someone please review this, this person has been trying to reform throughout this entire game, he has definitely shown that despite everyone flaming he was responsible enough to show self-restraint and not use pejoratives or discriminatory speech. Under no circumstances does someone like this deserve to be permanently banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Xivilai Anaxes","date":"2018-12-31T23:19:06.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"9x reports aren't a thing.","replies":[{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2019-01-01T14:23:08.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xivilai Anaxes,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=J3olH0HW,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-12-31T23:19:06.312+0000)\n>\n> 9x reports aren&#x27;t a thing.\n\nCool.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ill Creampie You","date":"2018-12-20T01:01:57.943+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot is a cruel company, the people who are running the company  don't care about being fair.\n\nall they care about is making money and letting loose to these horrible players play the game \n\nan advice to all who plays this game.  move on to another game, its far rewarding playing street fighter or COD than play this dreadful game","replies":[]}]}
