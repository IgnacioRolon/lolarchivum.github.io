I've wasted SO much of my limited bandwidth on this terrible copper internet connection I have living out here in the bush downloading files from having to\"Repair\" the game client so often (even though it doesn't actually work, more like a placebo button if anything). I climbed from Bronze 1 to Gold 3 in the previous patch and now that you have rolled out this new garbage one, I keep getting bug splats at the most CONVENIENT times (for the enemy team) in my ranked games and it's just ridiculous.  Even now it's taken since the RELEASE OF BOARDS for me to actually be able to log in to the forums thanks to your game servers thinking my 4 year old account doesn't exist so I can actually write this to you.\n\nI don't know if you've taken the EA Games/Ubishaft stance on your company in that you just release unfinished \"updates\" and shaft your loyal customers by completely breaking the integrity of the game, but I really should't have to drive 2.5 hours to my parents place to PATCH the game, thinking \"It's worth it, surely, this will surely fix the bugs right?\" to then find out it's completely broken my install and I then have to deal with both the incompetence of Telstra AND a completely borked install. If you're legit going to pull nonsense like this, give us the ability to play offline over LAN and/or Hamachi so I can at least play some games with my buddies and have fun along with the ability to roll back the game to a WORKING version.\n\nI thought the idea of a \"patch\" was to FIX things, not make them inherently WORSE. I literally cannot play ranked or even normals now due to how buggy this mess of a game is which really sucks as due to starting a new job, I have extremely limited time to play. Just yesterday I remember a mid lane ahri game I had in which every time I press Q or E,I would bugsplat. Every time I looked at the enemy top lane Riven, I would bug splat. Hell, in half the games I play I can't even reconnect because your game seems to think I'm not even connected to the internet whilst my room mates stream movies to the TV and I get emails on my phone from work.\n\nRiot, let us just chill on WORKING PATCHES INSTEAD OF ROLLING NEW, BROKEN ONES OUT EVERY FEW WEEKS. Deadset, you're absolutely doing my head in.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-14T08:36:11.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As time moves on, technology changes, for better or for worse, and the old becomes incompatible, the new becomes more complicated. It's inevitable; nothing can be done about it. We can only set up a system and hope that it's not completely worthless in three years time.\n\nLeague of Legends has changed drastically since its release, code wise and how it's set up. They claim to not even be using Adobe Air anymore (though I think that's a lie). They state in their patch notes when you should need to upgrade your graphics card (though not so obviously of late) and more or less, Riot is just going with the flow of most major game companies.\n\nIt's sad that they're neglecting their true, hardcore fans that have stood by them for what seems like millennia, but that's the way it is. No matter how many people plea for such things as offline editions (excluding sponsors) or properly tested patches, we will not get them.\n\nWe're too quite against the noise of the new players and big corporations.\n\nThey won't listen anymore.\n\n>inb4 a red shows up and stomps me","replies":[]}]}
