It&#039;s Lovely love,\r\n\r\ndoes anyone else has obtained the Grey Warwick skin through HONOR CAPSULE? I just got it when I opened my first honor capsule that dropped when you arrive honor lv. 3 ~~~ I can&#039;t even imagine that kind of probability, it seems like a compensation for me after I lost a series of solo/duo rank game(about 6 matches) just now. Hopefully, I trust there is a large chance for me to get the Medieval Twitch skin from the second honor capsule~Oh, just kidding, Riot won&#039;t do that for me, that&#039;s the point. At least, I got the Warwick skin already, it&#039;s a good beginning, isn&#039;t it :)[](http://file:///C:/Users/HE/Pictures/Grey%20Warwick.png)","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-09T00:07:03.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first honour capsule dropped Ashe champion shard, I guess that's the 'boobie prize'.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-09T03:50:24.013+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah it's the ultimate prize for only the most honourable of players.
