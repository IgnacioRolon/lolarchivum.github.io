However, the big increase in RP price made me really disappointed. I spent NZ$100 that give me 13800 RP two months ago, but we can only get 10500 for every 100 bucks. What it means here is a 31.4% price increase of RP. OMG! I really don't know when the priced changed like this, it just lowers my incentives to give my money to RIOT. What you guys think actually?\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RFq3gMh.png\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/CtXELFg.png","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-25T01:55:40.005+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/store-update/rp-update-cost-and-refunds\n\n>Starting on March 6th at 5:30 a.m. AEDT, RP prices will be increasing in many regions.

The taxation applies to things like online music, streaming services and games purchases, you may have heard of this digital taxation referred to as the 'Netflix Tax'.","replies":[]}]}
