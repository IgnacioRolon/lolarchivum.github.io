They reworked Darius to be the single most broken champion in this game.  If the Darius gets the upper hand in a game (which can be as little as a single kill in lane), he is guaranteed to towerdive 1v5 becuase he&#039;s fucking retarded.  I saw you change his Q to try and fool us into thinking you had nerfed him, but you fucking didn&#039;t, he is just as fucked as he was before.  I recently played a game where the enemy darius fed our yasuo in lane, then proceeded to 1v3 towerdive us on more than one occasion.  His farm was not even high in comparison to his lane partner.  He doesn&#039;t even have to build damage items to fucking murder anyone within the range of his Q.\r\n\r\nCan you please fucking fix him, and if you don&#039;t want to, disable him until you&#039;re ready.\r\n\r\nFuck you Riot,\r\nAngry player.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-17T15:44:21.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not really he's just really strong with heavy engage.\n\nRiot buffed Assassins so there are a lot of AD assassin engagers taking the frontline (Talon, Zed, maybe even Yasuo) and this allows the team following the AD Assassin engage to follow up - namely, their tanks (If they have a tank support or a tank Jungler like Jungle Gragas, support Shen or maybe Thresh Kalista combo - so the tanks can do their job more effectively - however because they were nerfed a lot (Blade of the Ruined King, increased cost and reduced effect of armor items) - the enemies Assassins can counter engage which favors Assassins with CC (Talon and Yasuo are probably stronger than Zed right now - Yasuo is like a #1 pick in Diamond-Challenger for mid or top) so the enemy team has to counter engage and CC the enemy Assassin which leaves their slow clunky Juggernaut top laners, Mordekaisers or whoever tank/Bruiser Champ (Jarvan etc) to wander up and the enemy team has to decide whether to CC the top lane Jarvan or the Jungle Gragas as they usually engage from either side of the mid lane in a b-line to either side of their team before their engage (massive CC lockdowns etc) so supports have to exhaust the bruisers and blow ulti's on them which allows back-liners to focus the tanks and when it comes to tanks - the really tanky ones or the ones with strong sustain (Garen, Volibear, Darius) perform best because of their insane tankiness and resilience and CC and AOE setup and gap closers/grabs or w/e - which has made supports with CC a bit more favourable (Thresh, Leona, Nami, Annie, Janna) etc (Mainly the AOE CC'ers) and after the counter engages and fights the Ridiculously tanky low damage dealers and Tanks with sustain (Gragas, Darius, maybe even mordekaiser's from bot lane, Threshes to some extent, Volibears and Garen's) usually end up being the dominant force and because most AD carries lack synergy with blade of the ruined king and don't have a strong ability to chunk them down - the team with the strongest tanky engagers (sustainers and innately hugely tanky champs) are always the ones carrying the games and the only real counter to this is strong pick compositions, semi poke related compositions, high assassination potential - when you aren't simply the team trying to be the most tank/CC based and it allows for a lot of combos however the Juggernauts have synergy in all these comps and come through as the defining force when the only tanky one on the team (of the poke comp, pick composition or whatever) and while Riot is slowly and unsteadily giving us anti-tank options - they'll make it a bit easier eventually through their slow but assured balancing of the game and while they nerfed tank items, then nerfed them again - the other changes to the game (weakening of AD carries, nerfing of bruisers, reduced Gold in lane, stronger junglers and better supports with free wards coupled with a reduction to snowballers) left tanks near the top - seeing as being CC'd twice you are basically dead and Tanks get free CC - Riot knows this is how games go and it has made the game more fast paced and made games far more balanced however - because being CC'd twice you are basically instantly dead because you got caught out and it's more frustrating and less interesting than having a Talon and Akali jump you after you cop an Ashe Arrow - it annoys you because unlike an Akali and a Talon killing you - the tanks have basically expended no energy in CC'ing you for the team to kill after a Thresh hook, Gragas ult or whatever and because a Talon and Akali are more skill based and risky and a tank team of like Gragas Jungle and Shen top is a safe pick with relatively no counterplay than to poke the crap out of them or flank people and try to gank and make picks and control wards - they're the more popular pick, have few natural counters other than other tank based teams; are the forte of Pro Play (Tank CC meta) and the only counter is teams that try ganking and flanking and picks and ward control (mixed teams of Tank, Bruiser, AP, AD and Support) which also hybridise damage and a lot of the time resistances and resistance necessities which are less cost effective items than their heavy single resistance based alternatives) which is the other Forte of Pro Play - and in both these team compositions it will always be the tanks that shine and they are the safest pick hence the strongest pick unless you go in with a game plan (which is another Forte of Pro play) and this leads to Champs like Darius, Grags, Volibear etc being hugely popular in solo queue ranked where you can't come up with plans or even communicate that well in game) and while Pro play has a lot of interesting ideas and plays, these Champs are spammed in solo queue and really hard to beat without snowball etc - or lead to games where both teams take this tanky/sustained tank setup for their top lane and  most likely their Jungler or support as well and both teams end up being a poke/pick fest followed up with one team completely land-sliding the other and then it's round two - which is a really frustrating mechanic - and Riot has headed in the right direction to countering this by adding blade of the ruined king, the updated black cleaver, % based Dmg champs and by nerfing armor but seem to be doing so - and in doing so are still giving the tanks/tanky bruisers/bruisers options - creating more style based building etc and seem to be stamping out the tank meta slowly.\n\nMaybe not quick enough, but if you just went and Chucked Deathfire Grasp back in the game now - all the tank mainers (they are people too and some people love this playstyle and these Champs) all the tanks mains would cry because they get smashed so they've donw things like add Blade of the ruined King and slowly add more % based champs etc whilst giving the tanks their own opportunity to make picks etc and while it might be frustrating (Darius penta'd me today and it's basically demoralizing just to see that pop up on your screen) - Champions like Yi and Jax etc can be just as frustrating and strong and good at cleaning up entire teams in the blink of an eye (Just like a Kat can quite easily - mainly in solo queue) or a well played carry can destroy your whole team after on flash CC from an ally) so I don't think calling him out as OP will help because in my honest opinion - he didn't even need the nerf - Champs like Yi need nerfs - and Riot has admitted in the last patch rundown that their balancing is focused on worlds right now and they may slowly balance out other champs afterwards - but in a co-ordinated team Darius is not really a strong pick as he is now when compared to Champs like Shen for their counter-engages, Maokai for his damage amp and strong CC engages with a gap close or Champs like Hecarim too (these champs with a TF mid and your bot lane is done for and Darius aint gonna be countering that gank lol) so even though he's strong in solo queue - Riot has left him as is to maybe make for some more interesting ranked plays (they want it to be less of an \"always pick these ten champs or this team\" setup and I the Juggernaut update have made for more aggressive plays (Garen vs Darius top for example is some hectic battling out lol with a lot of action and trading and fighting and commits etc) and I think they want more of this and less of the Tank CC meta - so while the Juggernauts (Skarner, Morde, Garen and Darius) might be really strong right now with the balance changes not changing much for solo queue but making competitive play a bit more fair - They buffed the crap out of assassins (Gunblade, nerf to ADC's and nerf to armor) so if you play these Champs in solo queue (even Yi and Jax or the bruiser or sorta DPS oriented junglers) I guarantee you you'll have fun - and if you really want to take on the Juggernauts - Elise and Ekko are really good against them too - as well as even non traditional junglers in pro play (Rengar, Diana etc) - and all these Champs can do their jobs, do well ignoring Juggernauts or can be making plays while the juggernauts try to get buff - and also makes for some really fun games despite the occasional \"GG OP\" team compositions that highlight their juggernaut in solo queue, well co-ordinated teams with simple champs in solo queue that slowly but surely destroy you or the occasional fed Juggernauts walking from top to bot - killing everything on their way and then walking down mid with 5K HP and being like the equivalent of the Juggernaut from X-Men with Cyclops's Laser eyes and Wolverine's healing capabilities.","replies":[{"poster":"WadeyPie","date":"2015-09-17T21:55:01.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was quite a novel and most of it had nothing to do with anything at hand.\n\nLet me extrapolate on my experiences.  \n\nFirst off: I know no one cares about scrubs but we probably make up the majority of lol players so just calm down, ok, I play mostly scrub tier normals so your experiences may vary.\n\n In 5v5 he's manageable.  He's still broken since I've seen him go 0/4 in lane with bad farm and still be able to out trade anyone and almost bring his team back from a certain loss just because he's so strong somehow. But he's at least manageable if the rest of the team does ok.  The real issue is in 3v3  I play a lot of 3v3 and he's basically in every single game and it's just not fun anymore.  It's basically whichever team has a Darius wins, it doesn't matter how poorly he does or if no one feeds him, he almost always gets to the point where if you see him you're dead unless you're playing someone really slippery or with a good get away.\n\nI know Riot doesn't balance the game around normal 3V3s, but it's so sad playing right now.  It reminds me of when I first started playing years ago and every game would have a Tryndamere just stomping faces until they nerfed the stupid fucker into the ground. I remember people back then saying Tryndamere was balanced as well and you just had to learn to play against him.  {{champion:23}} {{champion:23}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-18T04:14:40.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know I was just stating why I think he's sort of strong in the current meta and why Riot is happy with the current meta post juggernaut to a certain extent because it brings a few new champs to be highly diverse possible strong picks in pro play for this years Championships.\n\nThey got sick of the Maokai top lane every game and keeping a bit of power in the Juggernauts instead of possibly over-nerfing them keeps them as a possible priority in pro play -\n\nI see where you'r coming from though.\n\nHe is my 1st and only serious ban in ranked when I don't feel like picking on Shyvana, Yi and Elise - and I will usually ban Garen and Skarner with him although I tend to just leave Garen open because I think it's mean to shut him out and he provides a challenger being such a strong simple Champion and Skarner is a bit imbalanced in my opinion an can snowball out of control with his ganks and snowball others like Vayne which makes for a GG if your support fails or mid lane fails too and the reasoning behind bannind Darius is he is frustrating to play against because he will kill you from 60% HP in one combo if you make a mistake or underestimate him and there's nothing you can do once you've made that mistake - much like Garen but at least Garen isn't CC heavy so he can't snowball off other lanes as hard as Darius can but most games I don't bother banning him because I'm happy to let people juke it out with their own champs because there are plenty that can turn the tides on him and make him bleed and he is a relatively stale laner  and I'd prefer Darius than a Hecarim homeguard porting on me and there are plenty of champs in team comps that can make bigger and better team plays in my opinion and just being a strong duellist doesn't make you OP - when there are some pretty hectic engagers and DPS'ers that can easily compete with him and easily outdo his game presence.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-21T01:12:56.681+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You both have way too much time on your hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-21T00:06:29.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"STILL TL;DR.

I used darius in the top lane recently and struggled immensely during lane , as i was against a vayne.  All my damage was useless , as i simply couldnt get near her to land anything. With the mobility of her Q , and her E to knock me back i was constantly pushed and punished for even trying to approach her. There are many champions that could achieve the same results. Darius may be an issue late game once he has built more items , and can be a big threat earlier if he has an easy lane , but unless he is fed he is going to suffer from his weaknesses . Lack of range and being very kiteable. Either counter pick him , or do something as a team to shut him down. He is a very strong close combat with great natural scaling and bonuses , allowing him to build tanky rather then having to build damage , but he is extremely predictable and one dimensional , all he can do is run straight at you and attempt to land his skills. He has plenty of weaknesses too . If you simply nerf him then he will become completely worthless.","replies":[]}]}
