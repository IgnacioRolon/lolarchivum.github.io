But if you are behind, its not worth buying, because it takes so long to buy, and all that time you are without a full item, so you are putting yourself at even more of a disadvantage.\n\nIf you are doing well, and/or your champion synergises really well with it, then go for it! \nBut if you are in a lane that you cant do much against, its better to buy cheaper safer items, and you can always swap items out for it once you are full build if you want.","replies":[{"poster":"joshbrahh2013","date":"2017-05-03T05:00:31.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there certain types of Champions i should buy the trinity force on","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-03T05:19:21.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tri force is an item that does a lot of damage, but its utility requires that champion to be alive long enough to make use of it\n\nSo mainly build it on fighters like: Irelia, Nasus, Camille, Gangplank, Poppy, Olaf, Shyvana etc etc. would use it.\n\nCertainly don't buy it on Mages or assassins, becasue mages have no use for any of its stats, and Assassins _(in theory)_ don't live long enough to use it properly.\n\nBut Tri force is an offensive item, there are defensive options that do similar things if you want to be tankier, for example:\n\n{{item:3078}} = {{item:3057}} + {{item:3044}} + {{item:3101}} \n\nBut \n\n{{item:3057}}  can also become {{item:3025}} \nand  {{item:3044}} can also turn into {{item:3071}}\n\nBoth {{item:3025}} and {{item:3071}} together, gives you most of Tri-force's utility, but also boosts your defences more.\n\nSo someone like Nasus who already does a lot of damage anyway, and wants to live longer could build {{item:3025}} and {{item:3071}} instead of {{item:3078}}. \n\nMeanwhile someone like Poppy who is naturally tanky, might build {{item:3078}} instead of {{item:3025}} and {{item:3071}} so she can do more damage.\n\nWho are you thinking of buying it on?","replies":[{"poster":"joshbrahh2013","date":"2017-05-03T06:58:29.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I added you i will talk to you on there :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-03T09:41:15.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This account is one I only use for the boards.\nBut feel free to add me on my main if you want \nItachi Uchiha\n\nBut tbh theres not really much more I can tell you about Tri force xD\nYou just have to try it out and see how it feels on your champions \nThats how most people decide what to build, trial and error :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-05-05T03:45:40.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, Trinity Force is a very good item.\nChampions like Irelia, Xin Zhao, Udyr will benefit from Trinity Force.","replies":[]}]}
