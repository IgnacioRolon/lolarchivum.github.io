CONSISTENTLY I am getting placed in games where the team is hundreds and hundreds of MMR points above me. I am a legitimately bad player and shouldn&#039;t even be in bronze 1 tbh. I constantly get flamed because for WHATEVER DAMN reason I&#039;m getting placed against players of a much higher skill level then me and therefore always lose. No matter Flex or normal ranked, normal games, special gamemodes and everything in-between, i get high silver/low gold and more often than not 1 of the players on my team is not even ranked. I play at a 1160mmr roughly and my other teams mmr is always 1400+.\r\n\r\nThis is infuriating as all hell because my games are constantly bad due to me being a worse player than everyone else and i get flamed and just generally don&#039;t enjoy the damn game. I rarely duo, and when I do it&#039;s with someone silver 5 and I&#039;m bronze 1. \r\n\r\nI can&#039;t even properly practice new champs or even old ones because basically I get shit on every game. refer to op.gg for reference, you&#039;ll see my history. I never get a chance to play decent because this matchmaking system is backwards as shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2018-08-23T12:05:26.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this problem SOMETIMES, but not as bad as you (rip).\n\nI keep thinking that when this does happen it's because I had a great game prior to the game that I am in right now (if you understand what I mean).\n\nAnother factor could be because of how long you have played, and the system keeps putting you up against players you should be vsing (which is pretty weird and stupid at the same time if you are still following me).\n\nBut yeah still, the system should still match you up with people at your skill level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slam H2017","date":"2018-08-22T22:46:58.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me and I have heard of it happening to a lot of other people, for my first time playing ranked I was placed in a high silver low gold game and played horrible but got carried. I played a few more games and and the same thing was happening I was getting placed with Gold and Platinum players who were all way better than me. OP.GG was saying I was likely to be placed in Gold III and I think I am barley ready for Bronze. After about 4 games I stopped playing ranked because it was just too humiliating. I would like to start playing ranked again at the start of season 9 so I am hoping that the matchmaking system is fixed by then.\n\nTL;DR I am new to ranked and I want to play against other people who are new to ranked","replies":[{"poster":"JuicyJay","date":"2018-08-23T07:08:31.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not new to ranked however, I've been playing since 2013.
