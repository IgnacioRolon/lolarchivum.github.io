(it&#039;s why there is a mute button in my opinion; mute chat but not pings).I use pings and minimal chat (drag, group/push mid, baron, recall, care in jg etc). I main Jungle but also ADC/Support (sometimes fill top if asked). I&#039;m Bronze 1, [My op.gg stats](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=JuicyJay), and never had a smurf account). I main jungle Noc/Vi/Jax/Kha-Zix/Darius. And practicing Kindred as new main. I play Solo-Duo more often than any other game-mode. Otherwise it&#039;s featured mode or Twisted Treeline (Flex ranked) when it&#039;s up. I don&#039;t play normals unfortunately (Bronze league is toxic enough as it is).\r\n\r\nI use only discord for league gaming.\r\n\r\n**MMR hovers around 1180-1250** for matchmaking (Bronze 1 - Silver 4) (I regularly queue with a friend who is Silver 3, see in op.gg &quot;Grow A Pair&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nocturne is main, but he doesn&#039;t seem to do well unless I snowball or get first blood + first tower or even keep an unpredictable clear. (Blue, Gromp, Scuttle, Wolves, Red, Birds, golems)_\r\n\r\nBest champ/s in order is \r\n1. Nocturne (Jungle only)\r\n2. Jinx (ADC)\r\n3. Kha-Zix\r\n4. Vi\r\n5. Fizz (don&#039;t play as much anymore because I&#039;m just not that good in mid-lane honestly, but am a good Fizz if I get to roam somewhat freely, never really played it past 2015)\r\n6. Jax\r\n7. Kindred\r\n8. Darius \r\n\r\nBack-up champs are Ryze and Vayne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Don&#039;t be a flamer,** don&#039;t be that guy who yells and throws insults when a team mate plays bad (you are the bane of this servers existence if that&#039;s you), don&#039;t drop your bundle and give up when you have a bad game. Everyone does have terrible games every now and again, you flaming won&#039;t fix it. Be half respectable in terms of manners. Seriously, I play for actual enjoyment and I enjoy playing this game regardless of winning or losing, but again, of course I play with the intention of winning (because who doesn&#039;t like winning?!).","replies":[{"poster":"Plays With Balls","date":"2018-08-13T04:31:03.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate! My friends and I are looking for players to jam with, we vary of all kinds of ranks and roles. We are very easy going and laid back, I’d suggest if you are looking for a real competitive squad to perhaps look at other posts,\n\nDiscord use would be preferred as were always up for talking a bit of shit and it’ll be easier to get to know you!\n\nOnly thing I’ll preface by saying is that we are very easy going. We don’t flame nor get angry at each other so the same back would be appreciated!\n\nThanks!\nSummoner name: Plays with Balls","replies":[]},{"poster":"JuicyJay","date":"2018-08-11T11:12:11.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still looking :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-08-09T16:22:25.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey buddy, mid laner here, most proficient champs are {{champion:142}}, {{champion:103}}, {{champion:133}}, {{champion:497}}, {{champion:61}} in that order, if you wanna play at all, free free to add this account and/or Meatwardsprite.
