I deserve an un-ban because this is ridiculous, how could i even prevent such a thing since it can go unnoticed. Now i have to wait 20 mins before each game because of my stupid internet company.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-31T03:04:07.803+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because your disconnects still affect other players. You don't get a 20 minute LPQ for one dc, you get 5 minutes for multiple, then 10 for some more, *then* 20.\n\nEither you knew you were having connection trouble and chose to play anyway, at which point you have to accept the consequences, or you have a history of leaves prior to these issues, at which point you have used up your dc protection.\n\nWe can't really comment on what options you have for North American ISPs here since they are run differently, but I imagine some of the general advice sticks. Call your ISP, threaten to leave (if at all possible) unless they get their shit together. They will usually go above and beyond to keep a customer, those they screw over the most are those who don't bother to complain about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fl√∫ffy","date":"2018-10-30T10:45:11.941+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"you aint banned","replies":[]}]}
