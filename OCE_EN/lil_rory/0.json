It doesn't just happen before games for me either it happens after them too. I now have to wait 15 minutes to play another game because I have had to close so many games! The screen just goes blurry and I cant do anything but close league :( This has only just happened after I updated the client this morning. I'm using windows 10 but I have heard others from windows 7 and 8 having the same problem.","replies":[]}]}
