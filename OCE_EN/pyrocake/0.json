Here&rsquo;s a special insight on what it might be like.\n\n_&ldquo;Alright Khada, you know what you are here for.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Eggs.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Milk&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Bread. Toast? Never mind, that has 5.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Dumplings. Er&hellip;\nDump,\nLing.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;My shopping list is perfect. As all my work should be._&rdquo; Khada thought to himself. \n\nHe had recently finished all of his necessary ingredients for his breakfast, lunch and dinner. He required 4 eggs with 400 milliliters of milk for a perfect start to a beautiful day. It was the only way he could gather the required sustenance for his works. He never knew when he would be asked to perform by a client. And he needed to make sure he was always at his best performance standard. So, 4 eggs, two boiled, two fried.\n\nHe approached his stage. &lsquo;Draven&rsquo;s super awesome and cool grocery store, endorsed by Draven. Or just Draven&rsquo;s Store for short&rsquo;. Although he could not appreciate the endorser&rsquo;s treatment of his killing (or store titles), he could appreciate the finest eggs in Runeterra. At least, the finest eggs he&rsquo;d ever tried in Noxus. It wasn&rsquo;t safe to walk around anywhere else. Noxus was the only place he felt appreciated his work. And with those drab ninjas always chasing after him, he knew he had to stay on his toes no matter where he was. But he felt safer in Noxus, as everything in it was so bland, and boring, despite their best efforts.  He entered the store, and breathed in the atmosphere. It smelt horrible, of course, as Draven felt the need to make every single one of his stores smell just like his sweat. The Noxians seemed to love it though. Or at least, they could manage the stench. He prepared his reusable shopping bags, hand crafted by him to beautifully represent his more -violent- compositions. One had a lotus blooming, another had a woman decorated in small roses, and his 3rd was a lone, white rose glowing in the light of a dawning sun. And his 4th masterpiece was simply a replica of his mask, perfectly woven into the bag. Perhaps too obvious? It didn&rsquo;t matter, they were merely reusable, eco-friendly shopping bags.\n\n&ldquo;_Now, where are the eggs again?&rdquo; Khada tried to remember. &ldquo;Isle&hellip; 1, 2, 3, 4&hellip;. 4! Of course it&rsquo;s in isle 4! It&rsquo;s another reason I come here! Not JUST the best eggs!_&rdquo;\n\nHe made his way to isle 4, found his eggs, in a pack of 24. Perfect. That&rsquo;s 6 meals. \n&ldquo;Maybe, for safe measure, I should get 4 packs. Yes, I&rsquo;m going to buy 4. 96 eggs. 24 meals. Much better.&rdquo; Jhin Muttered to himself, as he placed them into his lotus bag. \n\nWith the eggs now claimed his, he could scavenge for the milk. He could never remember where the milk was. Draven&rsquo;s store never really had a chilled area to keep it. Unlike Ionia&rsquo;s more refined stores, however he could not return, he knew well he was being hunted outside of his performances. And, what better than to keep those pesky ninjas looking in Ionia rather than the rest of Runeterra? Not much news comes into Ionia, but perhaps one of his performances may just breach into the ears of the Ionian people. At some point.\nAs he approached the milk, after minutes of searching the store, he saw there was only 3 cartons left. At least, of the 4 Liter size. He saw a huge man in front of him, muttering something.\n\n&ldquo;With the first pick in the draft, Noxus selects&hellip; Dunkmaster Darius!&rdquo;\n\nThe Ruthless Noxian general turned in front of him from the isle to Khada&rsquo;s right. \n\n&ldquo;No surprise there. 6 feet 5 inches. 266 lbs. 34 &frac12; inch arms. His signature dunk, the Guillotine, cleaves through defenders &ndash; one guy actually died, ha ha!&rdquo;\n\nKhada lost himself in thought again. &ldquo;_Funny, how such a brute man can look so silly carrying one of those crude Noxian shopping baskets._&rdquo; he accidentally laughed a little.\nDarius stopped muttering to himself, turned slowly, revealing his fluorescent pink &lsquo;Kiss the Cook&rsquo; apron. Khada giggled at the fact that Darius, the Hand of Noxus, was wearing something so&hellip; indescribably ugly. He glared at Khada, and was about to say something. His jaw was unhinged, finger poised upward, almost looking intelligent for a moment. Then his mouth shut, back into his usual scowl, and his hands returned to his waist, as he turned around, and continued towards the milk cartons. Perhaps he felt less intimidating than usual because of his apron. Quite the fashion statement. When Darius left the Milk section, Khada lost himself in laughter. The laughter stopped when he realized Darius had taken all 3 cartons of milk. Perhaps he was smarter than he looked, as he knew exactly what would annoy Khada. Instead of his 4 Liter cartons, he would now be drinking from 4 3 liter cartons, just to fit his serving sizes. He placed them into his white rose bag. They just barely managed to fit.\n\nKhada only had 2 more things left to purchase, Dump, and Ling. Of course, if you were to combine these two entirely separate, 4 lettered words, it would interestingly create the word &lsquo;Dumpling&rsquo;. Khada&rsquo;s favorite meal was a bowl of dumplings, and the readymade packages at Noxus were shipped from Shurima, which were shipped straight from Ionia. How could anyone expect Ionia to have trades with Noxus? In fact, he was surprised Noxus had any trading lines with any nation.\n\nHe reached the frozen section, and picked out the Ionian brand, which contained 20 dumplings. He noticed a flashy speech bubble that read, &lsquo;now with a bonus dumpling in each pack!&rsquo;\n\n&hellip;\n\n&hellip;\n\n&lsquo;THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! HOW CAN I BE EXPECTED TO WORK UNDER CONDITIONS LIKE THIS?&rsquo; Khada yelled to anyone in the store that could hear him. Draven, who was visiting his own store, to make sure it was appropriately Draven-y. Hearing his cries, Draven ran to the scene. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong there buddy? Something at Draven&rsquo;s super awesome and cool grocery store, endorsed by Draven, or just Draven&rsquo;s store for short?&rsquo; Draven asked. &lsquo;YES. WHY ARE THE IONIAN DUMPLINGS, WHICH PREVIOUSLY CAME IN PACKS OF 20, NOW IN PACKS OF 21? THAT DOESN&rsquo;T MAKE ANY SENSE, I CAN&rsquo;T BELIEVE THOSE IDIOTIC IONIANS WOULD DO SUCH A THING&rsquo; Khada was screaming now, this really annoyed him. Draven replied nervously, for once, &lsquo;well, because&hellip; more dumplings&hellip; means more food? And more food&hellip; is-gooder?&rsquo; He couldn&rsquo;t even speak properly, it appeared Draven, for once, was at a loss for words. Darius however, could be heard in the background laughing more than ever before, possibly watching his brother fail to please his customers was quite amusing to him. &ldquo;WHAT, YOU EXPECT ME TO EAT 11 MEALS OF DUMPLINGS? IVE ALREADY SACRIFICED IN ODDITY IN MY SHOPPING LIST, THUS MY EATING PLANS, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, I SWEAR, I&rsquo;LL HAVE A MISTAKE IN MY PERFORMANCES BECAUSE OF THIS&hellip; THIS&hellip; STUPID &lsquo;EXTRA FOOD&rsquo; SHOPPING GIMMICK!&rdquo; Khada continued to throw his tantrum. He couldn&rsquo;t handle this anymore, he just piled the dumplings into the remaining bags, and took them to counter, steam almost visibly fuming from him. He purchased the unknown amount of dumplings, and as he returned to his hideaway, he threw away the unnecessary packs, that would result in an even more complications in his serving method.\n\nWhen he returned, Khada calmed himself over a bowl of fried eggs, dumplings, and milk. As he does before and after a performance.\n\nMy god this is so bad im sorry you wasted your time reading this. But I had fun writing it I guess. {{summoner:3}} \n\nWord Count: 1246","replies":[]}
