I wanted to make a post discussing all the toxic people you have played with on the OCE server. I totally am all for name dropping. Perhaps they will see this post themselves and might start to reform after seeing that the community hates they way they act. \n\nMy recent player goes by the name of _Name Removed_.\nHe was playing Riven on the enemy team. From the get go, my team could tell this was going to be the typical toxic, trash talking Riven player that im sure everyone has seen in the past. At about 10mins he was 0-5 in lane and what do you know, the trolling begins. &quot;I dont care about this game anymore&quot; &quot;Just end, im plat, all you guys will be stuck in silver/gold&quot; &quot;1v1 me, ill **** you up.&quot;\n\nHawwmahhgawwd it was just pathetic. A real child. Then instead of actually helping his team he was just coming at us 5v1 etc, intent feeding. {{item:3070}} \n\nHow are people really this salty? Instead of brushing the loss off and getting ready for the next game, he then starts calling out people to 1v1 him in post game lobby. I watched the chat for a bit then i decided to accept the challenge. Maybe he did have a bad game and was actually a really good player? I like a challenge anyhow. So he lists off the rules etc calls me a pussy a few times and then makes the game. He picks viktor into my Syndra. (I have quite a bit of experience at Syndra and i wasnt going to let this punk win.)  It was over as soon as the level 3 poped. I already had his flash by that point, so it was a simple QEW Ignite combo to finish him off. \n\nHe then leaves the game and what do you know, the trash talking begins AGAIN! &quot;Can only play op champs? Youre so shit.&quot;\n\nAnyway! Please leave your story! Dont forget to _not_ name drop.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T04:25:01.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Feel free to talk about any experiences here, but **don't name any summoner names**. \n\nRemember that _\"Naming and Shaming\"_ is against the [board rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) and can land you a temporary ban from the boards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-14T04:43:18.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quick return the name they took away","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T05:18:36.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Plot twist... it was Talon12!","replies":[{"poster":"Jesus had GA","date":"2016-12-14T05:33:46.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why are we unable to name and shame?

If you want them to be stopped REPORT THEM, three clicks after the game and it goes to the system.

Essentially players try to take punishment into their own hands, when they don't have a complete view of all the evidence like Riot does.\n\n It's gets pretty ugly when players go too far on a toxic player, but it's even worse when someone who isn't even guilty gets caught up the mess.\n\n\n+ **To stop rewarding trolls**\n\n When Riot released [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/8a75KeUR-the-indefinite-banning-of-tyler1), I thought they made a really stupid and hypocritical decision. And it looks like I was right. **Tyler1** just got even more popular and the \"most toxic player NA\" became part of his brand. \n\n I'd hate for trolls to see the OCE boards as a place where they can check to see how many people they've managed to trigger. Just excluding names from posts can pretty much shutdown anything like this entirely.\n\nI've got to admit though, the way you want to name and shame is actually pretty cool. It's more like a therapy session vibe, rather than the things I outlined above. \n\nUnfortunately, if the mods gave you a free pass, it would be massively unfair on everyone else who got punished for naming and shaming. \n\nWe really do appreciate your intentions here though ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-14T09:39:34.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tele,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=PAE2g7zi,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-12-14T05:18:36.203+0000)\n>\n> Plot twist... it was Talon12!\n\nplot twist... i don't play riven or the game\n\nI'm a third person justification of statistics.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T10:30:14.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I never actually noticed you stopped playing League ahah It's still nice to have you around though :D\n\nIf you don't mind me asking BTW, what was it that made you stop?
