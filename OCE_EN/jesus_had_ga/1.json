The police won't turn up at your door.\nSo no, you don't HAVE to play.\n\nIt all just comes down to how much you respect the game.\n\nIf you belong to a sports team and you respect your team. You'll turn up to practice even if you don't quite feel like it, because you feel like you have a responsibility and a commitment to them.\n\nThis game is the same, if you enjoy the game, and feel like it is a part of your life, you wouldn't want others leaving while you were enjoying it! So you feel like it is your responsibility to see it through to the end, even if you aren't enjoying it, because that is what you'd expect of others.\n\nBut if you don't really care about the game, then sure just leave. You don't respect it and abandon it, it'll not respect you and will leave you with a penalty.\n\nIt's like a Dog, Kick it whenever you want, but you can't expect it to not bite you in your sleep! Feed it and cuddle it however, and it'll curl up nice and warm on your bed, _(even if it walked mud all through the house and you had to spend the day cleaning it up.)_\n\nSo you have to look at your personality and think \"Do I kick the dog for walking mud in. Or do I put up with it because I enjoy those night-time cuddles.\"\n\nand you'll have your answer to your question.\n\nYou cant Kick the dog AND have cuddles. Just like you cant leave the game whenever you want AND expect it to still be here for you whenever you want to play.\n\nWe all have to do things we don't enjoy sometimes for the benefit of others. If everyone left whenever they stopped having fun, there would literally be no game here for us to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-11T06:23:54.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should definitely not rage quit due to a flaming teammate(s). \n\nMute them all including the enemy team as well.\n\nFocus on doing well yourself and winning the game, don't get sucked into the ingame chat argument it won't help.\n\nYou leaving the game would mean you let some people in your game 'win' by forcing you to leave the game.

Not just because that other person is flaming and generally (I assume) being a dick, but because suddenly it's a 4v5 and tbh I don't think either team really enjoys that.\n\nLook at it this way - if you're tilted, and instead of enjoying the game you're just getting angrier at yourself, should you be able to leave? Would it be OK to ragequit? Absolutely not. \n\nIt's part of the reason the surrender function is a good thing - and yes, I know he can just vote no - but it gives you a chance to end the game early without ruining the experience for anyone else.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-11T17:27:59.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"News flash, Riot hasn't cared for 5 years!
