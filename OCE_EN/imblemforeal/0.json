But i reckon its not so bad if you think of it like this; since you start below level 2 you will get 1 more key for leveling up from dishonorable to level 1 :) progressing and getting level 5 is depended on how you behave and act in every game and getting honor for that.\nWish you luck to get that level 5 :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-16T01:51:35.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/honor\n\nIt isn't explicitly stated what honour 0 will reset to, but given that level 2 simply resets to level 2, I imagine anything below will do the same. So more than likely you will be starting the season at level 0.\n\nThis from the honour FAQ would also seem to support that:\n\n>Unless you were below Honor level 2 before the new season, everyone starts between Honor levels 2 and 3.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148","replies":[]}]}
