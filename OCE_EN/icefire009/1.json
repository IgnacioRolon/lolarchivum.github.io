After no one would swap with him, he turned to be very crazy, and picked jax support with {{summoner:13}} and{{summoner:1}} \r\n\r\nIn the game, he did nothing in the lane and made our adc Lucian afk after 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do to make this player get his punishment? The behaviour is awful and basically made everyone upset","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-17T23:33:34.330+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What can we do?\n\nQuite simply, ignore their behaviour in-game and report in the post game. These kinds of players are looking for a reaction and by giving them a hard time for doing what they do you're basically just encouraging them. The best thing to do is ignore them, play the game to the best of your abilities and report them in the post-game to notify Riot of their behaviour.\n\n> What can Riot do?\n\nQuite simply, punish them. As long as Riot are receiving reports about these kinds of players, they can assess the situation(s) and dish out punishments to deserving players. It *might* not happen for the match you report them, but it will happen should they continue with their negative behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-12-18T23:05:14.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Quite simply, punish them.

Not because I do \"tons of damage\" or get any sort of \"killing spree\", but because I can be the little bird in the shadows doing my work, and when pulling off a \"save\" or an \"outplay\" really well, it surprises my team and I get something better than text on my screen; I get team recognition, and usually a new friend (the adc most times).\n\nI'm not saying its a role for everyone, but you can learn A LOT of skills and knowledge of others, being free from focusing too hard on cs and trying to do maximum damage to your enemies. You have the opportunity to learn how to read your map, become more aware of your situational environment, learn your enemies movement patterns and your adc's, and learn how to get your team in and out of fights with minimal loss.\nYou wont pick these skills up straight away, but it's worth having support as your 2nd or 3rd preferred role just to build up these skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-18T23:10:13.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I know it&#x27;s a hard role for anyone to get used to, but support should never seem as a &quot;punishable&quot; role.\n\nIt's not about \"making support a punishable role\", it's about \"refusing to participate in play\" being punishable.
