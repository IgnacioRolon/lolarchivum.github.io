I would like to know when the skins i paid for will be restored to the way they were prior to April 1 2016. This addition you have chosen to add without my consent has clearly violated my rights as a consumer. If there was an option to remove the addition at my own free will, i would not have an issue. i bought skins from you and they are not working as advertised. I&#039;m extremely unhappy as they are all affecting the way the product i bought and not working they way that your company advertised them.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-04-02T07:20:51.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, but Riot's refund policy covers this.
