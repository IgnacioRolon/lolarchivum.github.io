I have climbed my way from over 4 years to get to plat 4, Like all of you have climb and been wrongfully banned for no reason. it might no seem like much but when you have spent the last 2 years climbing to achieve one goal and getting banned for no reason other then scripting when its wrongfully done, anyone who has played against &quot; TCA Beausen &quot;  or has played with, please comment and tell them that I have not. I have not been banned once other then being banned from chat 2 years ago when I was in bronze for flaming at other players. \r\nI wish to see the matter resolved with my account unbanned or at least shown proof of this accusation you claim to be true....\r\n\r\nIf I was doing the wrong thing I would own up to it and take it on the chin and walk away but I have done nothing wrong, go look at my match history / Kda and what not even back in season 5. I am taking a stand for something I didn&#039;t do and being falsely accused of something.  I want riot to look into this case and see that I haven&#039;t done the wrong thing. I have stated in my ticket everything i have said hear, \r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment on this and take a stand for the people that have been banned for no reason.","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-11T11:59:45.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you play on your own PC?\ndo you play on a freinds pc?\ndo you play on an internet cafe?public pc?\ndo you play on a mac? if so then yes, be banned!
