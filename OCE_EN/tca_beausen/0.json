Confident shotcalling. I'm contactable easily through Steam/LoL/FB nearly always and due to my uni student lifestyle I'll be nearly always down to play.\nWeakness: It's very specific but Fizz and Yasuo always give me terrible strife on most of my mid laners. If I don't get to counter pick them I'm usually in a bit of a pickle. If we want me going into a game with a set goal in mind (eg objective control, picks etc.) I usually would request to at least ban Yasuo \n\nCheers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tayro117","date":"2016-01-08T21:25:30.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Tayro117\nPosition: Top\nRank Solo: Plat 4\n5's: -\nChamp pool: Malphite, Garen(easy I know), jax, irelia.
