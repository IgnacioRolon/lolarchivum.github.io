He began swearing later in the game, and abused the whole team for no reason, even though he took mid off syndra. He told everyone to &#039;report&#039; me and ashe for no apparant reason, even though he was the one to instalock mid, abuse us, and swear at us. He then calls me a psychotic a**hole after the game.\n\n_Name Removed_ (Syndra): The lobby began with syndra going mid, then kassadin decides to go and instalock mid. She then says &#039;enjoy the game&#039; to us, and runs down mid and feeds first kill to talon. This continues on slowly through the game, as she keeps giving them free kills. She then eventually afks at a certain point and returns.\n\n_Name Removed_ (Blitzcrack): Same with blitzcrank as well, he calls ashe an idiot and some other profanity words because she didn&#039;t go adc, because she called top apparantly. 10 minutes into the game, he started saying words in chinese, and one of them according to kassadin was &#039;f**k your mum&#039;. He afks for the rest of the game at certain point as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-01-18T14:45:16.997+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol lovely game.
