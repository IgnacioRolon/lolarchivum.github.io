I don't necessarily believe that we will never have the community to sustain our boards, and it's also not like we have to pick or choose.\n\nI much prefer OCE boards for most things over the NA boards (they are more receptive to skin suggestions/discussions, I'll give you that), and I feel like there's a better chance on discussing things with Riot through our boards, rather than the ones on NA (bigger population, more threads, more difficult to be seen).","replies":[{"poster":"MurderByVortex1","date":"2017-10-16T05:15:22.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree deeply {{champion:33}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-04T10:16:45.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why you can't access NA but I have to say when it comes to OCE boards as well","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daxenxia","date":"2017-11-11T10:01:14.861+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat ok","replies":[{"poster":"Daxenxia","date":"2017-11-11T10:06:28.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i can post on NA boards too problem idunno","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-02-04T10:01:02.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rekt","replies":[]}]}
