He's strong, that's clear, and I feel he did need some nerds a while ago. But now I feel like he's good where he is. \n\nWhenever I play against him, I always win, not trying to sound modest. This nerf isn't a lot, and isn't going to affect him much, but I think there has been enough nerds for the time being. Just my opinion  {{champion:236}}","replies":[{"poster":"DÃ¨athClaw","date":"2014-12-02T02:23:44.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't feel as though Lucian is game breaking strong, this nerf will actually weaken him quite a bit, since a lot of his strength comes from him being able to win every single trade up until level 6 simply because of how his passive works. What the nerf directly works to do is reduce that early game bully, but keep his late game just as strong, which I am really happy to see.\n\nEdit: it also means he can't do that weird bs where he Q's a minion, then like 5 seconds later he double hits you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jozza123","date":"2014-12-02T00:44:17.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you racist????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-02T00:09:46.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People actually still ban Lucian?
