We believe that all players should play on equal footing in an effort to promote competitive sportsmanship. You should be aware that modifying your League of Legends client is against the Terms of Use: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse. We hope you can see that it is unsatisfying to play against other players who are using a tool to gain an advantage over others.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to dispute the actions taken against your account, you may contact us via this link: http://support.riotgames.com&quot;\r\n\r\nI have contacted the support which the majority of it was automatic messages, I want to apologise for being rude but I hope you understand as I have had that account for years and spent a lot of money on it. I haven&#039;t used third party programs or modified anything. I built my computer earlier this year and the only thing I downloaded for league is the client itself on the League of Legends website. Along with a few voice chat programs like skype, teamspeak3 and curse voice (Haven&#039;t actually used curse voice yet so far)\r\n\r\nI want to know why i got permanently suspended specifically. If it&#039;s actually legitimately something that I&#039;ve unknowingly done I can accept that. But I swear I&#039;ve done nothing wrong. 150% sure. No-one has played on my account (boosting), I shun people who do, I don&#039;t use anything to gain an edge over other players. Just the game itself in its purity.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care about the process made to get to whatever thing your detection stuff has found, I just want to know what you&#039;ve found. Maybe it&#039;s something to do with Windows 10 or something like that, I don&#039;t know unless you cooperate.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played league for years and spent plenty of money on it, if I was going to be banned, why didn&#039;t it happen years ago? Nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nI hope that riot can look into this again as I truly believe there has been a mistake.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t really played LoL in the last 3 months. I played a couple of games one being an Ahri ranked game if I remember correctly during that three months but that&#039;s it.\r\n\r\n(Accidentally posted this on the NA side)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSpeedyBus","replies":[{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2016-06-26T06:30:08.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're just trying to help and i know you're not an actual Riot employee but to be honest, it does not look good when you appear to be sympathetic to these people. They're cheaters and deserve the punishment they receive. No second chances. \n\nThese people are worse than \"toxic\" people. I don't see any sympathy shown towards people banned for toxicity though.\n\nThis person is a classic example of someone frustrated about being stuck in low elo, who then initiates a google search and easily find scripts. They're so frustrated that they're blinded by it and choose to cheat on their main. They quickly realise any small elo gains were not worth it when they receive the ban. They then come to the forums in a desperate attempt to get their account back because they realise how dumb it was to cheat on their main that they're attached to.\n\nWhy are you taking this person's word for it when he says he's never downloaded ANYTHING? \n\nHow are you not noticing tell tale signs of guilt? (eg. \"I wouldn't know how to script\")\n\nWorst of all, once you find out from Riot that he is indeed a confirmed cheater. why do you say \"bad news :(\" like you feel sorry for him?","replies":[{"poster":"SpeedyBus","date":"2016-08-18T09:55:55.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the fact that I don't.\n\nI wouldn't even know how dude.

There might be hope still though... Maybe.\n\n__*\n\nUsually the \"top dogs\" over at player support are able to reverse bans on their own, without consulting anyone. In the past **Lyte** would do this in very special cases, and usually only for behavioral permabans.\n\nYour's might be a special case, but it's not a behavioral ban. Either way, we're at the end of the line here, so it's best we give it a shot anyway.\n\n_**Here's what I'd advise you to do:**_\n\n+ **Lyte** left the company recently, but there's still a few people like him around, such as [**Riot Tantram**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Riot%20Tantram) over on NA.\n\n The [NA boards](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/) is your best shot at finding one of these people.\n\n+ Tell them your story over on the NA boards. Make sure you put **@Riot** in the post title to increase the chances of someone seeing it.\n\n Publish your post at around 1 - 2 pm (California time) because that's most **Rioters** are online. Also make sure to put it in Player Behaviour section as the right people are more likely to see it there as well.\n\nIf that doesn't work then I'm not sure anything can be done. The best thing you can do is learn from this experience and move on. Don't let something as trivial as a league account weigh you down.

I don't use any language packs or anything to change the client or anything in it. I have logged into computers elsewhere including interstate as I have visited gaming friends and used LoL on their computers, I have visited them this year and used their computers for league, she's studying a course for something to do in IT, maybe they are using software that they are using or something that Riot detected from me logging in there?. I've never let anyone else use my account or know the password to my account. The closest I've ever done to letting someone use my account (without knowledge of password or anything) would be in person when I've created a custom bot's match with only myself in it to show a real life friend league and see if they'd be interested. As I said previously, the only things I run with league is Teamspeak3, skype or curse voice (but i haven't used curse voice in probably over a year)\n\n3. My account wasn't hacked or used by anyone else to boost or anything, I've had friends check my match history and I remember all my previous games on it. I've never scripted, heck i wouldn't even know how to script. I can 100% say that all I've downloaded for League of Legends was the installer from the league of legends website, nothing more; nothing less. If there is anything else that would help I'm happy to provide.","replies":[{"poster":"SpeedyBus","date":"2016-06-23T07:08:21.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou so much for doing this for me. If riot support had tried this route rather than being a broken record and refused to look further into the issue it would've been a lot easier to find out if it's something I've unknowingly done.

There was a period of time I didn't play, like 3 months worth. I jumped on once in that 3 months to try that new champ, played two games and that was it.
