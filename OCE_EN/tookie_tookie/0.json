I attempted to reconnect the entire ~8 minutes the game lasted, got server errors the first two times i tried to login and blank screens for 2 or so minutes when I did get to click the reconnect button. The game ended and the post match came up before i could even reconnect, labeling me as a leaver and it seemed another player on my team had the same issue. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind having connectivity issues occasionally, however in this instance I was given a leaver penalty of 20 minute waits before joining queue for 5 games. This has happened before because of the Telstra outages and ongoing problems. I hardly played for weeks because I didnt have the patience to stare at the timer in case I missed it while doing something else. Please can this situation be looked into and the low priority queue removed? I am not someone who leaves games on a regular basis and CERTAINLY not someone who starts a game I know I might be unable to finish.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n     {{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-10T00:25:38.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nUnfortunately leaverbuster penalties are unable to be lowered and/or removed, the system is designed in such a way to prevent any potential taint.","replies":[]}]}
