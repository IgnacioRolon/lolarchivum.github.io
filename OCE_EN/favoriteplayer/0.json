If the effect is taken directly from Guardian Angel (which it seems to be based on some quick research) then why not just call it \"Guardian Angel\"?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-17T05:46:41.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess is cause the theme they're going with is champion blessings. Soraka's is healing (and more ocean drake than Soraka effect wise), Janna's is a shield, Blitz's is his hook and so on. I mean Zilean's ultimate is basically a scaling GA, so I have no real issue whichever name they choose personally.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-17T06:10:08.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I wouldn't mind so much if the effect weren't just taken directly from GA. Like, maybe change is a bit so that it's more resemblant of Zilean's ult (like some minor \"max/current health\" and/or \"AD/AP adaptive\" scaling or something), make it it's own \"unique\" version of the effect, and not just an item effect named around a champion ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-17T06:31:58.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
