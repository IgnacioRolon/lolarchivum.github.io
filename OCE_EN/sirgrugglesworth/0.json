He has a solid G5 ranking (50%~ winrate over 400+ games, he's not going anywhere anytime soon) so if your MMR is high Silver (which is perfectly reasonable for a fresh ranked player it's no surprise you'd be matched against him. He also doesn't play TF much at all and has a pretty abysmal 2.3 KDA and 33% win rate with him. \n\nThis makes me think that more likely than him being god tier, the Morgana simply doesn't know how to vs/follow a TF and there wasn't enough pressure on him as he got ahead, which likely allowed him free rein to roam and kill with his ulti.\n\n>**tl;dr Seems like more of a bad matchup/counter to your team than the player himself being above your level.**\n\n___\n\nFirst note about the Ezreal is that he is premade with the Lulu, and that they have played the Ez/Lulu combo before. He has a negative winrate atm (45%) and that coupled with a slew of recent losses means he's likely tanked his mmr quite a bit. This coupled with the same happening to the Lulu (who's mmr was likely near yours to begin with) is more than likely what balanced them out to be matched against your team mmr wise. Remember that 3rd party sites like op.gg use their own calculations for mmr as Riot's are not public, so you will only ever get an approximation of your mmr, and it will never be truly accurate.\n\nEz has a pretty good winrate on Ez but also a pretty average KDA, Lulu has a pretty bad winrate on Lulu and an even less impressive KDA. That said, Lulu is a powerful support even when behind.\n\n>**tl;dr The Lulu is a perfectly acceptable match to have. The Ezreal is a bit of an outlier, but given his recent games and the premade status not totally unreasonable.**\n\n___\nThe Cait, Rumble and Morgana are all premade, and with two of them being unranked it's going to skew things. Automatically they are placed at S2-3 ranking, and with only a few ranked games the system doesn't really know where they're at, suffice to say you drew an unlucky card. \n\nThe Cait has had some strong placement games so far which would have upped her mmr quite a bit, but those games were played on Riv and Lee. It seems they have been maining ADC lately and decided to try it out in a ranked game which probably want's the best idea.\n\nThe Morg has only played 3 ranked games and they were all real hit and miss so it's anyone's best guess what their true skill is, and the system has no idea either.\n\n>**tl;dr Suffice to say based on numbers alone the match up was fairly even, but in practice you drew very unlucky cards, it happens from time to time unfortunately, and S2-4 will always be that weird zone with the fresh ranked players coming in to skew things.**\n\n___\n\n> All that said, the biggest thing I'm noticing about this game isn't so much the players but is more the team comps. Obviously, all of this was out of your hands, but until you reach at least high gold, most players aren't goign to consider team comp (at the very least not until after the fact), but it's something that will still have a significant impact on games. \n\nStraight up, **Rumble support is not a good choice**, especially against a versatile and powerful support like Lulu, he simply doesn't have the tools to be an effective support in most situations, nevermind against a solid comp like the enemy had. **Cait is a perfectly alright pick against their comp**, but with an unreliable support and a countered jungler she was never going to have it easy.\n\nThe second thing I notice is that you have **no true tank**. Nunu was trying to be, but he was so far behind, and **Nunu doesn't have the natural tanking tools that a Jungler like Maokai or Nautilus has.** The Nunu likely picked as a comfort pick, as they do pretty well with him, and he also seems to be their only jungler. It seems jng is at least his second, probably his third pref role (looks like ADC > Mid > Jng) so he was already at a severe disadvantage, especially with only the one comfort pick. Lee Sin is also a fast clearer and a strong counter jungler so he negates pretty much all the strength Nunu has in the jungle if the Lee is played well.\n\n**TF is a tricky one** in your approximate rank because while he isn't exactly considered OP, countering him post 6 if he gets a bit ahead involves quite a bit more than just the basic game knowledge, meaning the inexperience of fresh or low ranked players is a pretty big disadvantage. His ult means you have to understand roaming and when to follow if you're vsing him, need good map awareness and know how to play defensively against a tp when you're in top/bot, and need to know how to put keep pressure on an opponent with big map presence as a jungler. **Morgana isn't a terrible pick against a TF, but with the inexperience and the lack of jungler presence from the Nunu, it was going to be another bad lane.**\n\n___\n\nLast but not least is your lane. **I would not recommend taking Zilean top.** Even if you main him, and are most comfortable on him, **the matchups are too unreliable**. Unfortunately your first pick for top lane appears to be Nasus, and you're having success with him, but he also has a lot of counters and is difficult to match. \n\nSquishy as Zilean is, Darius is going to be a bad lane for you. Darius has the tools to pretty much destroy you early on when you aren't doing much damage _especially_ since **you were lacking any defensive masteries**, having taken a 12/18/0 page. Your runes were also not good for the matchup, having a lot of CDR and AD where you would have been better off with something more defensive, or at least some armour pen (this is of course assuming you haven't changed the page since you played that game which is entirely possible).\n\n_**On numbers alone, this was not an unwinnable game for you, but your team had the odds stacked against you from champion select, and not by matchmaking, but rather by your collective inexperience.**_\n\n___\n\nMy first advice for you as a fresh ranked player would be to **pick up another top laner you have success with and practice with them in normals**. You're perfectly entitled to play who you want, but Nasus has a lot of bad matchups in top, and Zilean has even more (you seemed to have decent success with him in support though). If you want to be successful in ranked then **you want at the very least three comfortable champions in your main role** and two in your off role (and preferably two in a third role as well).\n\nMy second piece of advice would be to **take a look at your runes and masteries**. It's expected you'd have very limited rune pages as a fresh ranked player, but now that Tier 2 runes are 1IP I'd be saving up for the pages then using those to fill up a few more diverse pages. Having only 2 pages is not a good way to go into ranked, they make much more of a difference than you think. \n\nThe same can be said for your masteries, you only have 4 pages which is not enough to cover the variety of matchups you'll face in top, nevermind if you end up in another role and find yourself lacking a page entirely. For both runes and masteries this is where champion guides and the like come in to help you get started.\n___\n\n>**tl;dr You had some real bad luck with matchmaking, but the numbers themselves mostly added up. If nothing else, you don't gain anything from blaming the system for a loss, rather you'd be better off examining your gameplay and team composition to work out what went wrong so you can improve int he future. Even if a game is unwinnable there is still a lot that can be learned from it if you have the desire to.**","replies":[{"poster":"SirGrugglesworth","date":"2016-10-23T13:15:39.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey thanks for the reply.

My biggest advice with that is to ask yourself \"if you aren't having fun, is it really still worth it?\".\n\nPersonally I'll play ranked to satisfy passing curiosity or because a friend of around the same rank wants to, but for the most part I just stick to having fun in normals. I can be a pretty competitive person, but at the end of the day, if I'm not having fun I'm not gonna keep playing.\n\nLooking at the games you've played I'd say it's unlikely you'd drop to bronze 5 unless you really let yourself get tilted by losses and keep playing regardless. You'll only play worse when you play like this so best to just take a break from ranked if you're struggling to stay positive.\n\nSome people really thrive on the challenge of having a team they'd need to carry or just on the pressure of ranked itself, but if you aren't one of those people then it's better to take it slow and play ranked at your own pace. Rather than smashing ranked and trying to climb you should simply be taking the (theoretically) purer competitive environment of ranked and playing to improve. \n\nIf you focus on fixing your mistakes instead of the wins/losses then the climbing will come naturally.","replies":[{"poster":"SirGrugglesworth","date":"2016-10-23T15:36:37.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my mistakes are superseded by my teammates mistakes against a larger backdrop of co-ordinated dynamic queue (which is present in every game i have thus far played), I pale in comparison to them.\n\nyes i am aware I am severely lacking in runes, pages and champions (only have the minimum 16) however it is my personal belief that good understanding and farming can subvert their need as they are mostly to overcome the early game then play styles can all be adapted to win. \n\nRanked is the only game mode I enjoy and have fun playing but I am not trying hard to win anymore, if the team plays to win then they will win.

All I can really say is that regardless of who's fault the loss is, focusing on your teams mistakes won't help you improve. Focusing on your own will, and the more you improve the easier it's going to be to carry those games/win/climb as your skill increases.\n\n>i am aware I am severely lacking in runes, pages and champions\n\nI say to take a look at your runes and masteries simply because, while you can overcome their need with good CS and mechanical skill, you want every advantage you can get. I'm a support main and have been since very early on, so my CSing is honestly trash tier, so I'm hyper aware of just how big a difference those runes make for CS alone, nevermind early trading.\n\nThe early game is so very important, even for late game champions like Kog'Maw, because at the very least you have to survive the early game. It's very easy to get far behind in the early game, when even half an item can make a massive difference in trades, so having those runes and masteries becomes ever more important.\n\n>Ranked is the only game mode I enjoy and have fun playing but I am not trying hard to win anymore\n\nI am genuinely curious as to why you feel this way. As a \"hardly ever plays ranked\" kinda person myself, I'm curious as to why \"I am not trying hard to win \" and \"Ranked is the only game mode I enjoy\" coincide. My perspective would be if it's just about playing the game and not about winning why would I bother with ranked, where typically there is more frustration related negative behaviour. But I also know that those who play ranked exclusively typically prefer the more serious atmosphere that ranked generates.\n\nI'm just not really sure what help I can offer if I don't know why you want to play ranked over normals despite the frustration involved :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-10-22T22:57:53.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh why you complaining? if you're matched with golds and silvers that means you're not doing bad in normals, which has pushed your mmr up to silver/gold level.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-30T20:44:10.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EzeBlood,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=mHqc6xiI,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-10-22T22:57:53.490+0000)\n>\n> bruh why you complaining? if you&#x27;re matched with golds and silvers that means you&#x27;re not doing bad in normals, which has pushed your mmr up to silver/gold level.\n\nOr conversely the golds have a terrible mmr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-23T14:57:21.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked and normal mmr are completely separate and don't influence each other at all.
