I think it would be a great idea if Riot could create a ping meter on the UI somewhere before we join up for queues. I find it so inconvenient that I have no idea how my ping is until i&#039;m already in a game. At the moment the only way that i know of to test this is to create a bot game first and that is a huge hassle. therefore i rarely do it.\r\nThis ping meter can improve the quality of our games and save us from a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\nTwo. i recently have been really into playing lulu and fiddle but i&#039;ve noticed lulu&#039;s hex and fiddle&#039;s fear doesn&#039;t always completely CC champions.\r\nI&#039;ve played in many games where I run in and hex an enemy then a giant rocket still flies out while they are in cupcake form. Same thing with fiddle&#039;s fear.\r\nIs this a bug or am i missing something?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-29T14:47:56.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.pingtest.net/","replies":[]}]}
