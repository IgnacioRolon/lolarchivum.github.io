(e.g feeder mid demands blue and then purposely lets jungler die by standing still in a fight)\r\ni understand the internet is a place without rules and you need to be thick skinned or have some sort of expectation on the people you will come across BUT for a game that has a report system and &#039;tribunal&#039; and people complaining about toxic players/trolls everyday, league of legends oce is an absolute shit hole.\r\ni use to play dota which is a similar MOBA and reports and bans are much more serious. just for not accepting q you can get banned up to 24 hours which i use to think was excessive but after playing LoL for a while ive come to realize that if people don&#039;t want to play properly to rank up or play with each other then they shouldn&#039;t get to play the game with other people and should stick with bots.\r\ni propose people should come together and protest against how shitty riot is handling this situation.\r\ninstead of focusing on skins and hextech boxes which just make them more money they should make the gaming experience more enjoyable for the players, somethinng that should be the most important thing about games.\r\n\r\nsorry if its poorly worded but this issue should not be ignored","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-04T08:57:43.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI'm sorry you've had some unsportsmanlike experiences recently.
