After being forced to dodge because i am unable to even pick a champion my first promos game counts as a loss. I play my second promos game and secure an easy win, making me 1-1 in promos, and then the same bug that happened the first time comes up AGAIN and makes me lose my promos??? I have never encountered this bug ever before and now i am down LP with my tilt level through the roof.\r\n\r\nFIx this bug and gimme back my LP pls.\r\n\r\nAnd nerf AP malphite again.
