Riot hasn't done anything illegal (even here in OCE where consumer laws are stricter on companies), so you'd be wasting yourself a lot in legal fees.\n\n>riot removed the tribunal now likeminded league players cant help you out just\n\nTribunal was removed because it didn't work. It required almost complete oversight (defeating the purpose) and resulted in a lot of over punishment and false punishment, the very thing you express you don't want.\n\n> riot unsuspendrd tyler1 but states they dont or wont unsuspend anybody\n\nTyler1 NEVER had any accounts unbanned, and neither will you or anyone else unless the punishment is issued in error. Tyler1 had his *player* ban removed, meaning he was allowed to create new accounts, but *never* had any account bans removed. Everyone else is entitled to the same.\n\n>mark zuckerberg (facebook ceo)was taken to congress ,congress stated this user agreement legal covers ur rear not the user\n\nI'm not really sure what argument you are trying to make here. There are *very* different agreements in place.\n\n>so where is a summoners rights where are we protected stepping into a lions den exposed and clearly with no protection\n\nYou will never be permanently suspended for behaviour (excepting cheating) without warning. That is your protection. Don't break the rules and ruin the game for other players, and you will never run foul of the punishment system.\n\n>riot stated they removed urf as they lost players >loss of players loss of cash?\n\nLoss of active players hurts everyone in multiplayer environments, not just Riot, and especially on small serves like OCE. Not sure how this is relevant to your punishment though.\n\n>riot doesnt give in game reform cards a full chat history of what the other players said just you>_>\n\nBecause it isn't your responsibility to punish other players, nor does the behaviour of other players excuse your own. For the sake of reflecting on your behaviour and the reason you were punished, only your behaviour is relevant.\n\n>this is clearly adding up into a marketing strat\n\nWhat is? Why does it matter? How is any marketing relevant to you being punished for your actions against other players?\n\n>dangles esport money lol world pot in front the masses\n\nAgain, not sure what your point is here or how it is relevant to your punishment. I don't think anyone without the phenomenal time to commit to becoming pro has any realistic expectation of earning money in the esports scene.\n\n>yet as for user agreement you own nothing not even your account not your skins your just renting\n\nYes. That is how most free to play games function, and many that aren't free to play (Overwatch for example). It allows companies to protect other players.\n\n>legaly this is serious issue\n\nHow? The 14 day ban reform card explicitly states that any further violations will result in your account being permanently suspended. You chose to ignore that warning.\n\n>guys we need to adress this post your comments lets get riot a community shout that says hey your not playing fair\n\nIf one person is ruining the experience of hundreds of other players, how is it not fair to remove them from the community? Why should that one player get special treatment over those hundreds?\n\nI'm gonna leave it there I think.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-30T06:04:35.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got permanently banned correct? Then you must be ready for them to roll out your complete chat history of all your games to the judge/s pointing out the toxic/hate speech. The judge cannot order them to compensate/review every permanently banned player, but what she will do is look at what you said, then probably convict you for being a public nuisance/indecency, discriminatory misendeavors, or technological and social/gaming network misuse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-10T07:24:48.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid bait, from someone who has probably never picked up a legal textbook in their life, also, if you're gonna flame riot, at least do it in a way that's not several random sentences that have poor grammar","replies":[]}]}
