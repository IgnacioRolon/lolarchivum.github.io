Why would you even have this option, obviously everyone in this community will be at different skill levels, but honestly why is this even an option. It just causes more problems and arguments. My next question is can you please take this off the selection, i could end up say being in a game with someone who has never played with before and if i were a mean person (By the way i'm not), if they died alot in the game after i could report them for being unskilled and then they would get into trouble with the tribunal. How is this fair? I understand this was an intial feature but it's morally wrong for me, how can i ever say someone else is unskilled when i may play the same way they do and suck but in my own way i play i dont. This come down ever so well when it come to champion selection, I know there are roles and lanes but sometimes i get attacked for using a certain support made character for support e.g. Soraka which i think is a solid pick for most ranked games since the rework.\r\n\r\nJust food for thought\r\n\r\nA good Samaratian","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-20T00:51:22.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mouser over says that it isn't a punishable offence, but that you can report them so you will be less likely to be paired with them in the future. So I usually report people when they have a bad attitude with this so I (hopefully) won't have to play with them again.","replies":[{"poster":"PussiCat","date":"2015-08-03T23:18:57.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for clarifying this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-03-19T11:03:03.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's contributed as feedback to Riot that helps them improve their matchmaking system.","replies":[{"poster":"PussiCat","date":"2015-08-03T23:18:16.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok Thankyou for clarifying this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-16T11:00:50.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gives people a way to vent without actually having any punishments available for them, i use it on the odd occasion where someone has done nothing wrong but i'm mad at them for whatever reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snowdr0ppings","date":"2015-03-16T10:35:06.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"getting reported for unskilled players gets them pared with people of lower skill (less wins, lvl, etc) making it stupid for all the people who want to go smurf...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-03-16T06:41:21.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you read it it actually says this isnt a punishable offense all it does is (presumably) puts them in games with other people who have been \"reported\" for the same thing they dont get punished for it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-16T01:23:51.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I understand it the \"unskilled\" report option will \"adjust\" the persons MMR slightly to be lower so they're less likely to be matched above their skill level.
