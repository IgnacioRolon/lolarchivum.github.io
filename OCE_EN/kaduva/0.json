Funky blue hair and clothing needs to be changed to his current splash or completely changed. The &quot;skirt&quot; theme is the a big problem and would be more appropriate if it was more like Bilgwater/Nothern Front where the legs are partially shown. This is also somewhat present in the Tyrant swain but i think the long royal dress suits him (i think it should be cut in the middle so that it covers the back and legs which should be partially visible.)\n\n2)  Skill set can reflect his title as the &quot;Master Tactician&quot; as right now he is a very immobile drain tank. Perhaps mobility or long range cc/abilities to impact the map somehow \n\n3)  Lastly Dragon Master Swain. I&#039;ll give u an idea to start, how about its an ultimate skin, he can change into different elemental dragons and combine other elements to produce more advanced elemental dragons :DDD -  its been a few years since its been confirmed  (5 years)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"FIREballSHYV","date":"2017-07-21T08:59:54.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"deffinatly keep demon  transformation. make it more demon like tho","replies":[{"poster":"Kaduva","date":"2017-07-22T01:50:50.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the base model looks like a parrot now","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-07-20T06:15:02.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He got reworked already.
