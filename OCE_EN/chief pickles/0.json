I don&#039;t mind people who try and lose. but im talking about players that just spectate. they literally don&#039;t do anything there still online but just roaming. theres no ban for roaming people. you should make up a way to spectate their performances so you know that&#039;s why we get pissed off and swear and go toxic. cause people are just not playing the game. ive reported many players because of that. but it doesn&#039;t seem to have a punishment.  please do something","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-18T08:19:10.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-12-18T08:22:05.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=eEOXonpQ,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-12-18T08:19:10.476+0000)\n>\n>in a comprehensible manor?\n\nA Comprehensible House?
