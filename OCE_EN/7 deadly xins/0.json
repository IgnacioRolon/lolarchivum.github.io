Not to mention, people are always asking for URF (even permanently) and Riot just wants to give it to them (occasionally) without it being as \"repetitive\" and \"stagnant\" as the original.\n\nIn the [most recent announcement regarding URF](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/arurf-extended-4-more-weeks), Riot announced that the mode would be around until the end of patch 9.6 (current patch), and modes/events typically end a day or two *before* the next patch goes live, so you should expect URF to end on the 1st or 2nd of April (Monday/Tuesday next week).","replies":[]}]}
