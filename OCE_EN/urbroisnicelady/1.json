Riot cant do anything about that but they recommended (since i told them this idea) i put this up on the boards.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great to have a new gift swapping mechanism so people cant get ripped off by trolls.\r\nRiot should make a way for people to do a swap with RP gifts so you know what they&#039;re sending and you know what you&#039;re sending. A bit like the steam store and some other games where there is a window with pictures like the one in link... \r\nPlease put any criticism and your views in the comments :)\r\n\r\nShout out to SwainRen who treated me like a human while helping me with his replies to my ticket.  He deserves a promotion.\r\nAlso guys bee careful who you mystery gift! Only send them to people you know irl and can trust{{summoner:30}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-08T04:50:19.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i hate it when people take my gift and block me, so I just made it, if its a stranger, either they go first and i do it immediately after, or it doesn't happen, and if they are that skeptical, but want to do it, i just tell them to add people who have done it with me before to verify it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-08T05:49:07.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't feel this is necessary, if you don't know and trust the person you're exchanging gifts with then you simply shouldn't be exchanging gifts with that person.\n\nIf someone walked up to you in the street and asked you for money and then promised they'd give you that money back, would you trust them? No, at least I wouldn't, I've never met this person, I don't know if they're trustworthy or not.\n\n\nEdit: A trading system like steams wouldn't work well anyway in league as there aren't any real economy items to trade with.\nIf something like this were to be implemented it would be easier and better to implement a form of escrow, one person initiates an escrow based gift with another user and that gift isn't released until they initiate a gift on their end.","replies":[{"poster":"URBROISNICELADY","date":"2016-01-08T21:33:12.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your reference to a stranger in te street is to my point. Thats how the system is now with sending a gift one at a time. Noone wants to go first and whoever goes first gets ripped off and riot cant do anything about it. This is why we need this new system/ idea to come to life. Safer and user friendly gift swapping","replies":[]}]}]}
