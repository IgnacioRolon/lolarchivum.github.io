I dont dodge and the only excuse for dodging should be if you have a troll on your team.\r\nWhat do you guys think about this?

The current system allows for strategic dodging such as this, but doesn't let it go overboard without punishment (which is great IMO, despite the wait times).","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-25T12:05:29.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially when there is a lee sin, leblanc or zed on my team.
