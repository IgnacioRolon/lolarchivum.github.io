Im merely curious why the timer is so long. Obviously you can see I am new to LoL via my account level. So there is no need for the overly sarcastic and rude comment of How high is my IQ. It is also fairly offensive how you assume that I am unemployed (pointing that I am lazy)","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-15T02:46:50.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never said that. You are over analysing the points. What i stated is a logical view of the situation. \n\nBut honestly, cant you use your head to think a few reasons why people are not ingame on the weekdays? This isnt a global server, we have a timezone, and you are on a period where activity is low due to reasons above.","replies":[{"poster":"HushNowGregory","date":"2018-05-15T02:47:42.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Than my apologies mate.\nBut I too can edit my comment.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-05-15T02:53:04.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt edit it to protect your feeling.
