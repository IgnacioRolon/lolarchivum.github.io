In fact, she/he sorta reminds me of riven. Keep up with the idea though, your halfway there!","replies":[{"poster":"WoodenSoldier","date":"2015-07-06T09:11:18.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the comment man, it's a guy btw :P. and i guess you have a point. i reckon the thing that makes him special/unique is his passive, and the ability to focus on ad/health items to get an edge on most other tank champions out there, also how his E when his ult is active is pretty much an unavoidable engage that stuns them, which will help in team fights.  i was having an idea that when his ult is active, the Q does something else as well, like the E, but then i thought it was probably unnecessary.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-07-06T11:55:05.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion has no respect ability that you can call theirs. His W is just a better version of a Volibear remake, the E is pretty much a Nautilus Q but instead, he pulls himself to the target. Though your numbers isn't the best and the idea isn't that great, it's better than so many other champion concepts.","replies":[]}]}
