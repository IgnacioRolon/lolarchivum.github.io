Chances are they are still trying their hardest, but are having a tough time. Maybe because they are learning a new champ/role, maybe because they are playing while tired/sick, maybe for 10000 different reasons. Usually once someone has mentioned something about the way they are playing/ dying a lot, players will go into a defensive mode, trying to justify their actions.\n\n Sometimes they will answer truthfully explaining the situation- \n\"learning x champ\", \"hardly ever play x role\", \"don't know how to x\"\n\nSometimes they will respond agressively-\n\"Shut up noob\", \"idgaf\", \"you know nothing you wood v pleb\"\n\n_And of course... \"Its just normals\"._\n\nBest thing to do is just to talk positively to your teammates every step of the way. Don't point out they're feeding, don't backseat game them. If you see something they could be doing a bit better, tell them nicely.\n\"Building x would be really good on y :D\"\n\"Don't overextend too much, I'll come help as soon as I can\"\n\"Play safely under tower, it will be fine\"","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-07T02:49:29.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **In my experience, people don't usually type \"its just a normal\" unless provoked. **\n\n\"I'm gonna go sorakka jungle because it's normals so who cares\" - champion select chat","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-08T02:27:00.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So?

As overused as the phrase is, it is just normals, all you're losing is time.\nHowever, I draw the line when people aren't at least attempting to win. That's an attitude I don't get. You can say \"it's just normals\" all you like, but losing still feels worse than winning, and \"normals\" isn't a blanket excuse to ruin everyone else's experience.\n\nI don't care if you go attack speed lifesteal Soraka top, all I ask is you actually give it a go and do your best to help your team pull of the win.\n\nOn that note, people, you need to understand what trolling actually is. Specifically, if somebody picks a champion or build that you don't like, that's not trolling. I've been in gmaes where I'm just having fun with a friend with stupid bot lane comps, with our entire team keyboard crusading all chat about how we need to be reported and trolls ruin games, meanwhile we're the only people actually doing well and playing the game.\n\ntl,dr: Normals are for having fun, but at least try. And as long as you're trying, you're not a troll.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-07T01:16:52.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"which is why we need normal draft pick for \"ranked practice\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-04-07T01:12:21.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it is **just a normal** , people do \"try\" but not like they would in a ranked game.
