I get that e-sports is a big focus but lets also remember all the people who made this game as big as it is.\r\nMaybe lets at least try fixing things for players of all levels before we make new drakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2016-06-04T12:14:30.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you ever think they might be doing some on the fly testing?\n\nKeep in mind the same people who work on ranked matchmaking system and those who are working on new content are separate from each others work output.\n\nOne team works on new content while another team tries to find new ways of sorting out ranked queue times.\n\nThe fact that you did end up with big queue times can either mean coincidence or testing, both of which is not a negative on Riot's part.","replies":[]}]}
