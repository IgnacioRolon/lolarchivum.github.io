I quit the game for a year and a half and recently returned. SInce returning I&#039;ve been playing on my Elo decayed main account and honestly I&#039;ve been bouncing around high gold. \n\nI only play fill and I&#039;m looking for a duo partner. The only thing I can promise you is that I&#039;ll play fill every game and I don&#039;t tilt in game. Not promising free wins. If you&#039;re interested please add me in game or leave a comment. \n\nIf your interested in me for a team I&#039;d be best in mid or support but I can play adc and top well enough. I can&#039;t promise any availability at the moment, however I do play daily. \n\nIGN : ESC Static\n\nEdit: Honor 5 riot stamp official support for #niceguy.

So answer if I can if not alg I understand you might not wanna play with someone as inexperienced as me. But yea man hmu if I can play with you and I sent you a fq so yea :D\nEdit: Oh yeah and I mostly play Mid/Top Talon always if I can","replies":[]}]}
