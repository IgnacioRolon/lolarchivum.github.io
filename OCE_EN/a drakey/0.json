I understand you can do this in shops but it does not show legacy skins, and it also shows all the ones you don&#039;t own so you have to scroll through all of them!\r\n\r\n{{champion:34}} {{champion:34}} {{champion:34}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pelican2013","date":"2017-01-22T03:54:53.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes.

They're the ones that don't have a padlock on the bottom of them.\n\nYou can go in to the store, go to the skins, and list them by champ and have an alphabetical list that tells you which skins you own for what champ.\n\nYou can even do this whilst you're queueing for a game, and the best part is, unlike the old  client that ditched you back to the main screen if queue popped but didn't happen, you can keep looking through on the page you're on.\n\nThere are a couple suggestions to help you find champs to ruin team compositions with because they have a skin you haven't seen in a while.","replies":[]}]}
