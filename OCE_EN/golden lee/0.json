I just wanted to try get my point out and see what everyone else thinks on this...\r\n\r\n|| The people who might have a problem is the people who sell accounts, you can see why. ||\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nHope to see what you think\r\nLee","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-10-18T02:12:41.659+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why should there be any more requirements? The point of a ranked ladder is to rank people according to their skill, if someone goes into it not knowing what they're doing they will lose alot and drop to a low rank pretty fast, where they can play with similarly skilled players until they improve, there's nothing wrong with that. Having some arbitrary skill requirement beyond knowing the most basic concepts of the game is pointless in my opinion. The barrier to entry is already more than enough (I can't remember how long it took me but I'd say its a couple hundred hours of playtime at least to get level 30).","replies":[{"poster":"Golden Lee","date":"2015-10-18T23:39:55.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the rest suffer along the way?","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-10-19T00:20:37.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

But ain't about how hard you hit, It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward, how much you can take, and keep moving forward. That´s how winning is done. Now, if you know what you worth, go out and get what you worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits.
