Duos seem to being matched with duos, both pairs are trying to ensure that they both play these champions, usually in bot lane. This is making blind pick games a nightmare with toxicity and resentment between players and duo pairs. Please can RIOT reduce the chances of duos being matched with duos on the same time at least in the short term? Are there not enough solo players to make each lobby only have a duo on each team????","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-04-29T06:38:41.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duos have an inherent adv in a team game, so by making one on each team that kinda balances it dont you think?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-20T23:02:47.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then watch people cry about queue times or something else... ðŸ™ƒ","replies":[{"poster":"RING of FIRE","date":"2017-04-21T02:42:10.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the Q times are pretty low, maybe a resurgence of interest thanks to this new champion type. But this is pretty toxic with people instalocking all over the place then fighting...... Just making a choice not to put pairs together to try and stop that would be good. I'd be fine taking another minute in Q to avoid all the fighting......","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-04-20T13:29:24.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"News flash, Riot only cares about $$$$$$$$$$$$$\n\nI'd love to be proven wrong with facts!","replies":[]}]}
