And I found that pretty much the last five lobbies I went into had only the free champs for all players on our team. Although I own about 15 to 20 champs on each account I never ever got an owned one just free ones along with all players in my team. OK they might be scripts and so not own any champs but why am *I* always getting one of the 10 free champs when 4 are already taken by my team and so I&#039;d expect a maybe 1 in 2 chance of that happening each time and it happened 6 times in a row! Hmm smells fishy!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-11T05:34:25.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**There's two theories on why that is:**_\n\nThe first theory is that ARAM is actually random, but humans are weird. \n\nSupposedly you're just being misguided by your brain's tendency to see patterns where there are actually none.\n\n\n  + It happened to Apple when they released the [iPod shuffle](https://whywereason.com/tag/random-ipod-shuffle/). People complained that it wasn't random because the same song appeared too many times. \n\n     In reality the shuffle was random, but Apple changed it anyway to be pseudo-random and stop the same song from appearing too may times.\n\n**What people don't understand is that truely random events happen in clusters.** Not to get too complex, but it's heavily based on the Poisson process/distribution. [This](http://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/2012/02/07/why-randomness-doesnt-always-look-random/) is a great article on that if you want to learn more.\n\n__*\n\nThe other theory is that the ARAM algorithm is not actually random.\n\nYou and [many others](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/208atk/is_champion_select_in_arams_really_random/) have noticed that ARAM seems to favour Free to Play champions, over your own champions.\n\nThe _supposed_ reasoning behind this is that favouring Free to Play champions means that \"ARAM only accounts\" aren't as OP.","replies":[{"poster":"RING of FIRE","date":"2016-09-12T11:43:12.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with the last one.
