I know of a guy who has been scamming a heap of people recently and getting away with it, and he just laughs in my face when I say he'll get banned. Please give me a link or can a rioter contact me some how so we can catch this guy?!","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-10T03:57:43.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, for reports like this please [submit a support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new).
