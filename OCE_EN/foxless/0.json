Though garen is a juggernaut, a juggernaut is supposed to be able to take hits, but have low utility **_(cough failed darius with low utility. Pulls and infinite slows and ad steroid and heals, what fun, broken on paper, and according to 80% of youtubers broken in practice. They should really lower the damage on his passive bleed and make him need 1 more stack to achieve that bonus)_**, juggernauts sacrifice that utility for high amounts of damage instead, their drawback though is they are easily peeled.\n\nMorde, garen and skarner work in that retrospect, they are easily peeled and do decent damage while taking a hit, darius on the other hand takes hit, does damage and has a tonne of utility.\n\nTDLR (must be really lazy to skip to the tdlr) Garen has damage instead of utility because of his subclass, making him closer to a fighter than a true tank, which utilises utility (cc etc, eg naut.) while being tanky, while garen trades the utility for damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Foxless","date":"2017-02-13T08:31:50.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Foxless,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ggpWhKEp,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-02-13T08:24:23.710+0000)\n>\n> Hey, thanks for clarification.\n> \n> I&#x27;m not saying Garen isn&#x27;t a fighter, i&#x27;m saying his a tank.\n> \n> Shouldn&#x27;t champions have a secondary focus?

Multiple forms of CC, this covers almost everyone in the tank list (outside of some of the older champs since the definition of tank has changed since the early days a bit, due to \"juggernaut's\" being a riot side definition that comes under fighters.)\n2. In fight stats (shield's/heals/Armor/MR, the only one that doesn't fit here is Amumu everyone else in the tank tab has some form of this.)","replies":[{"poster":"Foxless","date":"2017-02-13T08:16:38.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thanks for answering.\n\nIn cases such as these couldn't riot clarify champions as more then one role? Like Garen as a Fighter-Tank, Amumu as a Tank-Mage, Urgot as a Marksman-Tank (quite weird and hope they update him) etc. \n\nI'm sure back in the old client they did have multi-roles, and i'm not quite sure why they were removed as it provides more of a exact short description of the champion. \n\n~Foxless","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-13T08:43:52.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few reasons, and i just went to find the dev blog about this.\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses\n\nBasically a lot of champions fit into multiple classes to the point it's not realistic to list, and realistically the current \"roles\" are limiting in their description (i mean it's a joke, but graves can be described as a Tank, Assassin, Fighter, Marksman dependant on how you build him)\n\nSubclasses have the same issues, in that realistically either champions fit into multiple (going with the graves example, he is Marksman, assassin, skirmisher, Vanguard again dependant on how you build him.) or fit into none (the 2 riot list are fiddle and singed.)\n\nThat's mostly why riot doesn't clarify champions, because honestly, most champions can do whatever you need them to, and it's easier to just leave it at the basics for finding champions that suit the playstyle they are listed as easily enough, because it does cater slightly to the casual player who would probably just build Garen as a fighter and Poppy as a tank.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-13T07:32:08.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because he's more primarily focused on damage rather than being a traditional tank. He lacks hard crowd control and is focused more on disrupting or killing the enemy rather than peeling for his own backline. \n\nMoakai is a tank, Nautilus is a tank, Malphite is a diving tank with his atkspeed debuff and AoE initiation, Sion is a tank, Trundle is a tank. These champions all have ways to utilise defensive stats and ways to peel or provide some form of cc to protect the backline or hold a target in place. Garen lacks any of this.\n\nGaren is tanky, yes, but he's a bruiser, not a tank. Garen cannot provide any peel outside of damage and a single target silence. Therefore Garen is not a tank. He is a tanky fighter or bruiser, but not a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Foxless","date":"2017-02-13T08:24:23.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for clarification.\n\nI'm not saying Garen isn't a fighter, i'm saying his a tank.\n\nShouldn't champions have a secondary focus?
