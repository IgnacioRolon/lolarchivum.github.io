I joined only a couple of months ago, have been maining Corki, and have been playing a little bit of Shyvana as well {{champion:42}} {{champion:102}} . I&#039;ve tried a few other characters, with not much success, and i&#039;m REALLY looking forward to the practice tool. It will give us new players a chance to try new characters, learn how their abilities work and get a better feel for the different play styles before going into a match! I can already see myself trying new roles and characters over the next couple of months, and then hopefully giving solo que a try once i&#039;m more comfortable with a few characters and roles! if anyone has any other tips on how to get a better feel for this game, hit me up :-)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-31T22:07:46.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"celebrating this great news http://media.lolusercontent.com/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https%3A%2F%2F2.bp.blogspot.com%2F-XkMc1x1EnUk%2FWBSLbljD06I%2FAAAAAAAAXD4%2F1_LA9NwQBk8Ub4biCpHAPKMCZ8w8b-4kwCEw%2Fs1600%2F17.gif&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=150","replies":[]}]}
