I&#039;m super new to this game, and am only starting to wrap my head around the different types of champs, roles, and lanes. I want to purchase a few champions to add to my collection until i find my favorite role and lane and go from there. I currently own Ashe and Garen and Tristana, and i&#039;m thinking of getting Shyvana and Corki as i had a lot of fun playing them.  Are there any other recommendations, for fun champions, that will also provide diversity so i can learn about the game more?","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-24T06:47:12.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People have already recommended a bunch of champs so I just want to say find what's fun!

Great way to learn how to peel and be a team player without needing to do all the damage.\nJax is a good starter champion. He was the champion I first used when I was learning top. He half damage, half tanky.\n\nJG:\nWarwick and Xin Zhao\n{{champion:19}} {{champion:5}} \n\nThese champions can not die in the jungle. its almost impossible. They are super great for when you want to learn to jungle and not get embarrassed by dying the the monsters.\n\nMID:\nZiggs and Annie\n{{champion:115}} {{champion:1}} \n\nEasy champions to learn about mana management, wave control and burst.\n\nADC:\nAshe, Lucian and Caitlyn\n{{champion:22}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:51}} \n\nVery simple champions. Ashe and Cait are very auto attack focused to simply right clicking and you are doing 90% of the work. Lucian is just fun and pretty simple.\n\nSupport:\nJanna, Soraka, Leona and Braum\n{{champion:40}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:201}} \n\nJanna and Soraka will teach you how to be a \"real support\". Your job is simply keep your ADC alive. Thats it. Keep them alive and let them farm.\nLeona and Braum are very simple tanky supports. You can use their abilities to keep your ADC alive or try to help your team kill the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"ChreasyBear","date":"2016-08-24T01:05:13.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome :-) Cheers","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-08-23T05:49:54.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For beginners, I would recommend\n\nTop lane\n\nCho'Gath\n\nJungle\n\nWarwick, Nocturne\n\nADC\nSivir\n\nMid lane\nAnnie, Ryze\n\nSupport\nSoraka, Sona\n\nYou do not have to take all of my recommendations, and I do not expect you to purchase all these champions straightaway, you may want to wait until one of these champions are in the free rotation, and try them out.\nCho'Gath is free this week, try him out.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-23T08:59:39.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might add a few more to that list to diversify it in terms of roles and also include some picks that are fairly easy to play but help develop key skills to be good with more mechanically complex champions as well, compared to say trying to start off with warwick.\n **Top**\n{{champion:31}} teaches zoning, strong laning phase, good against mechanically difficult champions, rush a RoA and then build tanky\n{{champion:36}} teaches skillshots, weak early but strong midgame and is very fun, let's you learn how to dive\n{{champion:54}} teaches engage and teamfight with a massive ult, good defensive laning phase\n\n **Jungle**\n{{champion:5}}  teaches engage and ganking and has got good clear and sustain and strong dueling prowess\n{{champion:32}} teaches initiation and teamfighting and is a great pick in low elo, easy to learn, easily becomes very tanky with high base damages, good cc and a nice skillshot to master and very strong teamfighting\n{{champion:29}} requires you to learn kiting but offers a great teamfight, scales really well, does great damage, is a good assassin but also an adc so you could be forgiven for not ganking enough, is a great champion to learn and master and you'll have alot of fun if you get ahead since you can then carry without much difficulty, he's also alot easier to play in the jungle than as an adc\n\n **Mid**\n{{champion:105}} a strong champ in a beginners hands and much stronger once mastered, fizz is great at assassination, very slippery and not overly mechanically complex though he can juke out a ridiculous number of things once you get the hang of it. Great roam and can be played full ap or tank which is still viable and is less punishing if you mess up.\n{{champion:45}}  helps you learn skillshots and farming and has a strong earlymidgame and then scales into a monster the longer the game goes. you'll be wanting to go half tank with a RoA, Frozen heart, Abyssal Sceptre and Spirit Visage. Not only easy to play but once you become tanky with 400+ ap from your passive and then get a rabadons you will both be tanky and also able to 100-0 someone like a regular midlane mage, very rewarding once you master stacking your evil.\n{{champion:1}} easy to play, good teamfight and damage, strong throughout the entire game, teaches roaming and how to manage abilities in a fight\n\n **ADC**\n{{champion:15}}  teaches kiting and mana conservation, strong lategame but has decent trading power if you have enough mana\n{{champion:22}} her ult is a big skillshot and she also teaches kiting, positioning and farming, average early game which becomes great lategame, even from behind her slow and stun make her useful\n{{champion:21}} be careful when ulting since you can't move when doing so, read her tooltips, manage her lovetap and don't try to use make it rain as poke, is a lanebully, fairly easy to play and is almost an ad caster making kiting alot easier, is very strong and isn't too complicated\n\n **Support**\n{{champion:53}}  teaches skillshots and when not to pick a fight, strong throughout the game and his grabs aren't too hard to learn how to land, very solid support\n{{champion:37}} teaches positioning, poking and is pretty easy to play\n{{champion:16}} easy to play but should be played aggressively to actually be very strong, good poking, utility, healing and decent cc if you can use it right, she teaches resource management and poking and is very reliable as a support\n\nI hope these help and I tried to keep the choices as cheap as possible whilst suggesting champions that were easy to learn but also worth mastering, very strong, teaches you core skills about how to play the game and have a good teamfight, fitting into various teamcomps. I tried to have 3 for each role so I might have missed out a few or I excluded them because even though they're mechanically simple the logic behind playing them can get complex which is also why I didn't include a tanky engage support though if you do want to learn one my suggestion would be {{champion:201}}  since his disengage can save you if you screw up.\n\nI hope this helps, I'm also learning and out of the champion pool and playing most of the 120 champions, I feel these are probably the best champions for a beginner to start with.","replies":[{"poster":"ChreasyBear","date":"2016-08-23T09:08:32.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome :-D thanks heaps","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChreasyBear","date":"2016-08-23T09:07:52.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, will definitely take it slow on buying champions.\nProbably going to look at getting Annie, and will try out Cho'gath and Darius whilst i can","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-08-23T08:39:27.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Besides, there are other champions that you should try out as you progress, such as Fiora, Irelia, Akali, Darius, etc.\nDarius is pretty easy to use and pretty OP.\nJax is also worth trying out, although I didn't find him that OP at first.\n\nLux and Ziggs are definitely midlaners that are worth trying out, they can also be played as support champions.\n\nMiss Fortune is also worth trying out, she's ADC by the way.\n\nAgain, I don't expect you to buy all these champions in one go, it is best to try them out when they are in the free rotation, so you will know whether to buy them sooner or later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-24T09:03:42.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For example, I only play ARAM these days, so am unranked, and have never been ranked, despite playing since season 2. I have nearly 2500 ARAM wins, and am normally matched with high gold/plat/diamond players. My first account (on NA server) was perma-banned (well, 256 years), because I used to respond to trolls, which I believe are (or were, idk now) far worse on NA. I think I just hate Americans... xD. I have since improved my behaviour, and have never been 'in trouble' on OCE. If you are nice to me in game (and by that I mean you do nothing to offend me, like be all \"your mother is a whore\", etc, which I do often encounter), I will be nice to you. I never bitch about ppl feeding, I just say \"hey bro, their team is 5 AP champs, get some magic res\", or something like that.\n\nI unlocked Gnar because I got a free skin from hextech crafting, and played him for first time against solid competition (their team was cancer) and I went 0/15. Shame on me, and I did apologise to everyone. I know I should have probably made a bot game and learned how he works, as he seems a complex champ from my initial experience. But like I said, I only play ARAM.\n\nRegrets to be had, maybe I shouldn't have disenchanted that Super Galaxy Kindred shard for the essence to unlock the Gnar skin.\nI'm just sharing experience, so that you can learn from my mistakes.\n\nI recommend, for a beginner, Warwick jungle/Sivir ADC/Jax top because you can learn a lot about the game from playing him, etc. All cheap champs. Fiddlesticks can be a lot of fun, but can be countered easily by heavy CC teams.","replies":[]}]}
