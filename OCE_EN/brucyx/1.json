How I coach and how I run practice changes all the time, sometimes drastically. One thing I am very willing to do as a coach is to consistently question if what we are doing is working, take feedback, and adapt our practice. This can be very stressful as I'm always being insanely critical of myself and our process', and it can lead to a really tense environment if we don't have any answers to our issues, but it shows results.\n\nSince I'm a new coach I've improved in every single facet of this job: Game knowledge, practice systems/process', handling players outside of the game. I think the most stark difference from me 1 year ago to now would be my understanding of the best way to use scrims. I'm still looking to improve everywhere but one focal point for my own improvement at the moment is general leadership and authority.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucyx","date":"2017-08-11T10:13:51.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes ok see you tomorrow {{champion:75}} {{champion:75}}","replies":[]}]}]}
