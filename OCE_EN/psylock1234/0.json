You might be right, you might not be. Either way, if you expect to be heard, you have to offer the same courtesy to everyone, even those you don't agree with.\n\nI personally agree with you, people should just be nice to each other, thats just common sense.\n\nBut if we both agree with each other, and refuse to listen to anyone else, then all we are doing is further convincing ourselves of how right we are. Which helps nothing! We pat eachother on the back, and the problem persists.  If you really want to instigate change, you have to make your argument heard by those who don't agree with you, but that in turn means you must also listen to their side of the story.\n\nMore often than not, there is an element of right and wrong in both sides of the argument.\nAnd both parties can walk away with a new outlook on their ideology.\n\n_______\n\nIn my primary school there was a unit for people with bad autism and other mental conditions, so they could be part of regular school life with other kids, instead of being shunned and treated badly. One day, one of the older kids with more violent tendencies got his hands on a baseball bat during lunch time and smashed another kids head while he was happily playing on the field.\n\nnow id say that qualifies as being pretty \"Shit\", and, and less \"unique\" and \"special\"\nShould that kid _(who may well suffer from a disability of his own now)_ not have the right to express his feelings, even if they are negative ones. Just incase it makes _you_ feel uncomfortable?\n\nOn the other hand, one of the greatest friends I could ever have, has aspergers syndrome, and the creativity and philosophy that comes pouring out when we are together is quite incredible, and is one of thing things I would hold most \"special\" to me in the world. And the mere thought of his condition being used in negative context makes me feel horrible.\n\nThere are always two sides to every story, and to understand the full picture you have to listen to both.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-07T12:53:34.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all I'm just saying to people who say things like that to stop because it's really annoying, and I'm sure your friend who has Aspergers was most likely socially awkward and didn't have too many friends as I do and some people may have been mean to him/her and he/she I assume gets/would get annoyed and I believe they would do the same thing if it was annoying them.\nalso, this post isn't just to stop people calling other people autistic but also for words like fuglie, %%%got, retard and plenty more.\n\nbut I don't see how there can be 2 sides to the story:\n(a person finds out what autism is, and sees a kid with it) \nguy: haha this kid is a retard I'm going to play lol and start calling people autistic.\nme: **** you people have feelings.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T16:07:15.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Gay\" as a casual swear word hasn't referred to homosexuality since the 90's.\n\nWhen most people say \"omg, that's so gay\", they aren't belittling homosexuals, they are just expressing dislike for something.\nThe word gay has been around for hundreds of years, had a dozen meanings, and only referred to homosexuals for like ~20 years. \nHomosexuals don't own that word, just like how retarded actually means the opposite of advanced.
