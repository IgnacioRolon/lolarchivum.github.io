A lot of players at this level are very inconsistent.  You will find some players go absolutely godlike in some games and can pass for smurfs, and then the next game they are 3/9. A lot of people focus on pure mechanics and don't really know where they should be on the map at different parts of the game and this is what sets them apart from people higher up. \n\nJunglers that don't gank sure are annoying, but you should be confident enough in your own gameplay to be able to play your lane without the need for ganks and without the need for buffs. They are helpful, but don't expect them and start whining when they don't come. If the enemy jungler is ganking, you just need to learn to adjust your playstyle to accommodate this. \n\nPersonally I think you are where you need to be right now. Your CS is all over the place and averaging 9+ deaths on literally all but two of your champs you have played  is pretty bad, especially since you are ADC. That would be weighing down your team significantly and provides the enemy team a chance to snowball (something bronze and silver players generally don't deal well with and just end up tilting and flaming).","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-12-27T11:04:33.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually hvae good scores I am confident in my skills as an ADC and can push through most match ups as long as my support knows how to sup but I get bot tower and im ahead and then I realise before I roam mid the enemy mid laner has a score of 9/0/3 and our mis laner is shit and is like 0/10/0 and out top both on enemy and ours r like 4/4 so I decide to roam top and see if I can get my say riven ahead and maybe carry us (along with me of course) and thats when the enemy mid who might be a zed comes up and 1 shots me and there goes my decent kda from 5/1/2 all the way to 7/13/6 or some thing and I lose cos of a shit player. and that's what pretty much always happens in my ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-27T20:18:23.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop blaming teammates :)","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-12-27T21:09:21.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is no point blaming myself because whenever I feed there is most often someone else on my team who fed worse than me and that person who got fed is carrying the enemy team, not the adc I fed, but sometimes I feed or get camped and my jungler doesn't help so there I can blame someone on my team who should be helping me when I need help to get ahead, but sometimes I do feed a bit even though I try not to by staying at tower after ive died a few times but end up getting carried but as all low elo players do they learn...eventually.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-27T23:13:55.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"amount of goodness\"\nI'm outa here, because I get banned for being a grammar Nazi.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-12-28T01:49:23.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i just forgot the word ill change it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-12-27T18:16:26.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you're thinking your Bronze teammates were better than your Silver teammates could be that Silver is the default \"Placement\" rank. There is a high chance to get a player who has only just levelled to 30 and has no proper experience in the game, whereas those you played with in Bronze probably have a solid 100 or so games in Ranked. \n\nTo an overall argument of ranks determining a player's skill: generally, yes, but it's that simple. There are Bronze players with amazing mechanics that rival that of Diamond, but then have no idea what they're doing. I had a Riven OTP in my team in Bronze V. Their mechanics were so clean that I was amazed that they were in Bronze. Come late game, however, they were just running around dying and having no idea what to do. \n\nThe Rank you get is basically an average of your skills. You can have great mechanics, but if you have no game knowledge whatsoever you'll be Bronze V.  Or you may have great game knowledge, but then not have the mechanics to implement them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-27T08:33:16.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, if you're in bronze/silver/gold you get mixed up with bronzies silvers and goldies in this server, as this server is quite small.
