But you are a social justice provocateur; You're playing a guilt game against the wrong person. \n\nWhat do you think is going to happen if you make someone angry; Then use guilt to put them in a bad spot?. Heated moments such as arguement, most people dont have guilt toward their source of anger. \n\nWhat you are doing, is fishing for troubles and playing to the crowd. You were pretty much asking for bad responds the way you were going. If riot can post your chat log, ill bet that it is full of accusations and commiserations.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-06-28T14:00:32.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m not one of those people who leave out bits and pieces to make me sound like a victim I’m not a feminist. Most of the game was the people being offensive and telling me to kms and that I should live becuase I have ASD and I said that nazis killed people with mental illnesses and experimented on them and this was near the end of the game and those 2 players were legit saying that hitler was right and that people with Autism should die and don’t deseve to live all I was doing was telling them that you shouldn’t say that and that’s offensive and that I’d report them.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-06-30T13:12:57.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are trying to bring out your version of of pls pity me because i have this \"ASD\" as a crutch to lean on \"Have more self respect man\", to appeal to an angry audience that show signs of uncaring nature. \n\nWhen dealing with those kind of people dont expect pity. Only ruthness of the truth in the form of personal observation, and mockery will pierce through those animal's hide. When people dont like you it is already a given what you says will be meet with resistance and hate; And at times, total deaf's ears to your words. Especially words that promote righteousness and condeming nature. Which obviously didnt work on the type of personality those 2 posses, and it demean yourself because you revealed your ailment in a way similar to asking for alms. \n\nThe crowd love to defend the poor, the weak and the unfortunate. Is that what you are going for? and is that how you see yourself as? Am not saying what they did was right, but you shouldnt bring yourself down by evoking your illness's title in order to called for sympathy. That is just damming to your state of well being. There is a saying in buddhism \"The mind is everything. What you think, you become\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-06-28T23:06:20.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mistake was even interacting with the abusive summoner.
