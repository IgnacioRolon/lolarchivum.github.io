Im over losing games because an adc has lethality and just 2 hits people. Please help me understand how I can either counter or beat this, or help me understand why its as strong as it is? please, it feels unbalanced but this could be because I may not understand it completely, I don&#039;t know??????????","replies":[{"poster":"Korossal","date":"2017-03-17T14:34:09.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1029}} {{item:1031}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3068}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-18T00:39:22.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3110}} {{item:3047}} {{item:3109}}  {{item:3082}}  as well. \nNinja tabi especially though since 12% damage reduction is worth a huge amount of armour for a very low cost. \n\nLethality or even straight out last-whisper adc, if an enemy tank has a randuins,frozen heart, sunfire, knightsvow and ninjatabi; don't even bother trying to attack this guy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-18T00:00:35.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it was lethality because they already nerfed it quite a bit, either you were a ranged champ which had no bonus armour whatsoever, or they had % armor pen items. The only adc champ who is strong (stands out, way out, lethality varus died with the nerf) with lethality atm is mf, and thats just because she stacks a black cleaver more often than not, meaning the lethality is acting on armour thats been reduced by 30% already.","replies":[]}]}
