We would love to fill the team ASAP so we can start to practice and build synergy as a cohesive unit. We have a mid laner (Frogglun), a preferred support (Burnout) and myself as preferred top, so it would be awesome if these players were jungle and ADC mains but beggars can&#039;t be choosers - ultimately personality and a strong team commitment will suffice. If this is you, please contact me on here or add Burnout, Frogglun and/or freshmattie in game.\n\nEdit: ADC role filled, desperately seeking a Jungler!","replies":[{"poster":"Pyromania","date":"2017-12-24T11:39:16.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can play jg if you guys will have me.
