With the new team-based competitive mode, Clash, coming in 2018, 4 friends and their clan, Boosted Animals, are looking to recruit friendly and mature players to join us on the Rift. We would love to fill the team ASAP so we can start to practice and build synergy as a cohesive unit. Mid and Bot lanes are filled already but I can play either top or jungle so I&#039;ll fill whatever role is left. Skill level is not the be all and end all, ultimately a good personality and a strong team commitment will suffice. If this is you, please contact me on here or add Burnout, Frogglun, WhoYouSellingFor and/or phatmattie on OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Yamanji","date":"2018-04-20T12:36:43.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC Main \nIGN: Yamanji\nRank: Gold","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ooftman","date":"2018-03-22T23:40:55.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im keen \n\nign - therowdy3","replies":[]},{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-03-22T20:32:13.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya! if you guys need a top laner or mid laner I'm pretty good at both and jg :)","replies":[{"poster":"phatmattie","date":"2018-03-22T20:51:59.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome to join us for some banters and If you'd prefer to top, I am happy to jangle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fed or veigar","date":"2018-03-22T17:55:30.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmu xXxMoonxXx","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhoYouSellingFor","date":"2018-03-22T14:45:06.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be awesome if there's another girl that fits the role, so I'm not the only one ;) not a necessity though!","replies":[]}]}
