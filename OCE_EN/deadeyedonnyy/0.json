I know I&#039;m not lagging because there are no ping spikes in game and my discord works fine. This happens for minutes at a time and around ten times a game, and has been happening much more frequently recently. Nothing like this happens on other games. When I quit to try to fix the problem, it doesn&#039;t let me connect back to the game either so I get a penalty.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-22T14:00:08.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These sorts of issues are usually caused by some sort of overlay basically hijacking your top layer (so your game is basically running fine, but there's something over the top that's preventing you from interacting with it). If you have any overlays like discord, overwolf etc turn them off and see if that fixes your issue. If not, have a look through your task manager and see if there's any new programs running that might have a similar effect. Updating your graphics card drivers is also a pretty good catch-most. \n\nFailing all that submit a ticket to player support and hopefully they can help you further, or at least point you in the right direction: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
