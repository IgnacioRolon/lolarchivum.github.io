Did you know that it is entirely possible to take an enemy's effective armour from 350 to 75. That is reducing an enemy's effective health from ~ 3 Times listed flat health to 1.4 times listed flat health. Or more simply HALVING the effective health of your opponent. This is allowing for ridiculous situations like champions such as zed, talon, yasuo, pantheon, lee sin etc etc out right ASSASSINATING tanks with 4k+ health and 350 armour. \r\n\r\nNow before anyone points out that getting that much armour pen is a ridiculous investment and would gimp them against squishy targets, I would like to counter that point by re-iterating the fact that these champions can out right assassinate tanks with 4k+ health and 300+ armour (ttk (time to kill) < 3 seconds) Squishy targets with between 2k and 3k health with very little armour will also experience these low ttk assassinations thus failing to punish their investment at all. \r\n\r\nNow if I could make just one request about this, it would be to make the brutalizer and EVERYTHING that builds out of it, have the same unique named passive. I miss being able to play tanks somewhat competitively and I also miss seeing the real need for magic damage. Please rito do something about this before season 5 starts in earnest.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-11T11:31:04.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*tldr at the bottom*\nIf I'm not mistaken the maximum armour pen/reduction you can have (not affected by champion stats) is:\n- 69 flat armour pen (69.2 to be specific, but that 0.2 may as well not exist)\n- ~40% armour pen (I calculated it at 38.9%, may be slightly off though)\n- up to 25% armour reduction\n\nFor that you would need:\n- Brutaliser (10 armour pen)\n- The Black Cleaver (10 armour pen, up to 25% armour reduction)\n- Youmuu's Ghostblade (20 armour pen)\n- Last Whisper (35% armour pen)\n- Hunter's Machete Enchantment (10 armour pen)\n- 9 armour pen marks (11.52 armour)\n- 3 armour pen quints (7.68 armour)\n- Devastating Strikes mastery (6% armour pen)\n\nYou say it's possible to reduce a champions effective armour from 350 to 75, lets see.\n\n350 reduced by 25%, assuming 5 stacks on Black Cleaver (requires that physical damage be dealt 5 times on the one champion) = 262.5 armour\n262.5 affected by 38.9% armour pen = 160.3875 armour\n160.3875 reduced by 69 = 91.3875 armour, shown as 91 armour\n\nWhile that is without being affected by champion abilities it's not exactly 75 and it means the person using that build has less item slots for things that would most likely be more useful for assassin's, after all bursting 3-4 abilities to kill someone wont make Black Cleaver passive too useful and I don't know too many assassin's using smite. Aside from that, Brutaliser isn't even full potential for an item slot.\n\nBut it still seems you haven't considered the maximum potential, there are several champions you could use with the armour pen/reduction listed above that would effectively reduce a champions armour well below 75 if they had 350.\n\nDid you know it's possible to reduce a champions armour by 100% if you and your team mates use specific champs? And I'm not talking armour penetration, I'm talking armour reduction (which is worse for the person targeted). But you don't exactly see that used all the time, do you? And there's a reason, it's not exactly viable.\n\ntldr possible to reduce a persons armour by 100% but, like reducing 350 armour to 75, it's not too viable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2015-01-11T10:24:35.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody abuses it, do you have any idea how tricky it can be to last hit with 3 arpen quints 9 arpen reds? \nalso lee sin? assassin?
