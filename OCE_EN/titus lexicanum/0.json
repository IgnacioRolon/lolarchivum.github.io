Rank for Aram. I am pretty sure the title is clickbait asf till the point you think I will be fking with you, but hear me out. So the match making system will be the same as summoner&#039;s rift rank system, each player chooses the role they play instead of the lane, so like Summoner&#039;s chooses the role and for example is the summoner chose the ADC role they game will choose 1 marksmen out of all the marksmen in the game and this goes for the other roles. If you&#039;re reading till this point I am pretty sure you will be like &quot;wtf are you thinking what about bans and the champion each summoner have&quot;. The rule to play rank aram matches will be the summoner has to own at least 5 champion of that role and the summoner has to be level 30, and if the summoner wants to play another role this applies as well. Finally banning should go up to 5 champs, each summoner gets to ban one champion of a role for the opposing team. Finally just my thoughts, the game will have 1 support, 1 adc, 1 ap damage dealer or can be ad ( mid laner) and then 2 tankers ( cannot be fighters, tank champs (tank category champs can be ad or ap) only, but they have the option to go ad or ap).","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-04T02:53:15.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have already said Ranked ARAM would never be a thing, because the champions and items are balanced around Summoners Rift.\n\nAlso the fact that \"luck\" is involved with the Random Champ part, it would never be \"reliably competitive\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-03T19:13:33.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does any body else still get that bug where damage dealt to you  doesn't even add up to your full hp in damage but kills you any way in just half hp taken or more but still notably far from total hp??? :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-11-03T16:35:18.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is no skill in aram, whoever gets the better champs/ comps win the game. its a silly idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-03T18:59:48.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dragon poo,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=EA9Rq8Fb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-03T16:35:18.525+0000)\n>\n> there is no skill in aram, whoever gets the better champs/ comps win the game. its a silly idea.\n\nScrub'a'dub dub.

I reckon just leave ARAM as it is but slap on rank  and the 3 champ ban on it before the random champ picker kicks in. Unless that mode was like in a map that forced certain play styles and objectives, what you mentioned is a bit constrictive but very fair I guess. But still removes the nature of what ARAM is. I seriously wish rank had like a 200 normal wins requirement or something right now, after people reached lvl 30. ARAM's all about  being straight into the fray...almost, thinking about trades hard and knowing how to build no matter how out of meta-synch you'll be. IF your team's good, otherwise I just build to get ready for noobs and toxic players. Rank would be lovely. I love ARAM it almost filters farmers from skill-shotters/skill-blockers good.","replies":[]}]}]}
