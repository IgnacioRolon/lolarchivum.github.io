I am with Internode and the servers constantly drop me and are unable to reconnect. My node connection never disconnects and remains connected. The constant drops have resulted in leave buster being activated and has just cost me a series. This issue IS NOT on my end and a ticket has been submitted. Has anyone else experienced this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T04:11:48.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Others are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buddhist","date":"2015-01-18T02:28:29.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is beyond a %%%%ing joke now, %%%% this game until they have sorted out their sever issues.
