One of them is you. That leaves four unknown quantities on your team and five on the other. So, statistically speaking, there's more chance of the other team having an afk or \"tilt\" whatever that is. Neck up, parrot.\n\nI might be a chimp but at least I'm not stuck in silver after almost 1000 games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-17T08:12:08.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronzie here,ive always found within low elo theres no middle ground,you either get stomped in every lane or your team stomps,sometimes you get that rare evenly matched game but its few and far between..... i barely even play ranked anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-16T10:51:42.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"OH MY FUCKING HELL! Some real evidence, shall we call it? A Platinum 2 player who at low rank cannot climb, love it.\n\nI have only been stating since THE START OF THIS FUCKING SEASON, IT, SUCKS, BALLS!\n\nYou can't climb, period. Riot are listening to the top 1% or less of players and making changes to their queue system to allow them to have better games, what about the rest of us? What about everyone else who cannot get that high? You are catering for no one, the majority of your players cannot get to where you are putting all your efforts.\n\nGo check out my last ranked game from last night I played, not my last game I just played, the last game for the night of 15th June AEST, I had to pull out a game of legend status just for a win that we almost lost, and for what? Just so I can have 3 more losses and stay at Silver 5?\n\nGet your shit together Riot and do something to allow those who actually know how to play to get out of this shit ELO.\n\nI note again, and will keep noting again and again, this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_OnJYBr6JuiY0dPOG5QUjRXQ1k/view?usp=sharing\n\nA nice little spreadsheet I put together that will allow players who know how to play, who get good stats to gain LP regardless if they win or lose.\n\nMy game last night, where I had most kills, towers, CS, the lot and TRIPLE DAMAGE of 7 other players, I get a player on the enemy team after 48 minutes at level 17 by the time the game ends. Who the fuck can't get to level 18 in 48 minutes? And he nearly got a win for that game thanks to my retarded team.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-16T11:52:39.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3.9 hp heals dayum thats alot... whats that 3.9 hp out of 100? out of 1000?","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-16T12:04:11.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"That is 3.9K, like all the stats on that page, it is thousand dropped down to a more easily to input number.

I had the same kills as Bard, less deaths, more damage, a higher level and more CS, but Bard still got a positive score and I got a negative one, showing that team work and playing how it matters will give you what you deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-17T01:52:09.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just a prank bro","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-06-17T00:26:48.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game is less about skill and more about luck. I feel like their RNG from loot boxes has drifted into matchmaking code. Some games I can have teams of equal skill and others I get teams who go 0-9-0 and blame everyone else. People need to understand that not dying is more important than getting kills. When you're alive you can defend and siege objectives which surprisingly is what wins you the game.

The game at the moment is broken for everyone except assassin mains and tank ekko/fizz players. I cant drag myself out of bronze. You know why? Every time i manage to drag myself to silver I get a streak of teams who give up, afk or fight between eachother. 4-1 votes to give up should not count as a loss for the person who wanted to stay and fight on. Afker's should be punished harder than people who actually leave, but even then a 4v5 game shouldn't count to LP loss. I know it's open to abuse for people boosting, but really.. when was the last time you won a 4v5 when your mid laner just leaves 10 minutes into the game after being fed all your teams kills. \n\nOn top of all that shit is the fact that no matter how much you destroy some champions in lane pre-6.. as soon as they get that ulti.. you have literally no way to counter them. Here's looking you you zed. You too ekko you asshat. And i dare ANY of you to buy a f***ing zhonyas on your kallista or other AD champ to counter that s***.
