In saying that I&#039;m usually placed against many Plats and the occasional Diamond.\r\n\r\nI play mostly ADC (Sivir, Varus, Corki are my best) but I can play other roles and have played specific champions in those roles. I can be slightly unconventional with my picks, but recently these have come into the meta (eg. Viktor has been my favourite mage since early Season 3).\r\n\r\nComment below if you&#039;re looking for an extra player or wanting to start a team up and we can go from there. If this doesn&#039;t interest you then that&#039;s cool and I wish you luck on the Rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Meteoric","date":"2015-06-21T04:22:52.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold 4 and climbing prefer anywhere but jungle add me in game if interested","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azreal P","date":"2015-06-16T14:52:39.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat IV here, mainly plays mid support adc, available on Friday to Sunday, add me if you're interested in creating a ranked team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Ekko Jamal","date":"2015-06-16T08:47:30.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dude, Plat 5 here.
