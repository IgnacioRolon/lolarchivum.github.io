I know it's a massive cop-out but for an experienced player, 8/9 summoner levels is nothing. It's the equivalent to a  maximum ~600 gold deficit at starting, and you're playing at a level where players don't understand how to maximise (or even use) that advantage.\n\nIn terms of fixing the problem, the system is matching you with the closest players possible. It's literally them or nothing, as the vast majority of active players are level 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-10-09T05:15:10.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you hear that the game was \"fun and enjoyable\"?
