I was Silver 4 when I started and now I am bronze 2.\r\n\r\nMy last game I had my top go 2/22 and just left his lane most of the game.  But I am not going to go on about all my games.\r\n\r\nCan you please let me know how I went from Silver 4 to Bronze 2?  I just made it to silver 4 before I had to play the 10 promo games (from bronze 2)\r\n\r\nIn other words,  after the finish of the season I went from Bronze 2 to Silver 4.  Then I play the 10 promo games and I get put back into Bronze 2.  I spent soo long getting to Silver 2.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can shed some light on this or someone from Riot respond that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-02T07:28:44.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The Promo series where you play 10 games\n\nIn promotional series you usually play three games, and it's to decide whether or not you should rank up. I believe you mean placement matches.\n\nSilver 4 to bronze 2 isn't that much really, just three divisions apart.\n\nThe way it works is that you're placed slightly below what the game actually thinks you are at, so that you can start climbing. And if you got to silver once before, getting there again will be no sweat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FinalHeaven","date":"2015-02-01T12:45:42.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver 4 MMR\n> Soft Reset\n>> Somewhere below Silver 4\n>>> 10 Games depends on people you played against (Including anyone you duo'ed with)\n>>>> MMR after 10 Games is around Bronze 2\n>>>>> Gets put into Bronze 2\n>>>>>> You may now start climbing \n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]}
