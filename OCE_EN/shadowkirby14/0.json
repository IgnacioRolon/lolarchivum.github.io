I know he just had a Risen skin, but it didn&#039;t appeal that much to me, not to mention he hasn&#039;t received a VU since forever (but that&#039;s a rant for another time).\r\n\r\nSo imagine Fiddlesticks as a skeleton, holding a skeletal leg for a weapon, and his abilities accompany with the skin:\r\n\r\nTerrify: The terrify icon will change into a shaking skull icon.\r\nDrain: A tunnel of bones\r\nDark Wind: Randomly throwing bones or a skull.\r\nCrowstorm: BOOOOONESTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORM!!! (Guess that reference)\r\n\r\nSo yeah, that&#039;s my idea for a Fiddlesticks skin. Just hope Riot gives Fiddlesticks a Visual Update soon because his classic skin and lore are so outdated.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-17T11:26:11.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wont happen. EVER.\n\nCan't have skeletons in the game because the Chinese find it offensive. Thus why Karthus' rework removed his skull face in some skins.","replies":[]}]}
