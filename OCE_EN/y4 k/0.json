Thing is my internet is the same, speed is still the same. I&#039;m looking in the resource monitor on my pc and nothing is chewing the bandwith..\r\n\r\nThis has to be on Telstra&#039;s end right? They&#039;ve become pretty bad lately between internet and phone service tbh.\r\n\r\nCan anyone with Telstra for their isp confirm the same?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-31T21:23:30.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nTelstra customer here, no issues to be reported on my end.\n\nCould you do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
