After the first 3 deaths Akali said that he was done and is opening top. Even after I offered to help him, he said no and that is when Jhin told him that he will report. The akali said that he will give a reason to report and intentionally started feeding.\r\n\r\nI want to know how can this be prevented in future and why a level 27 and that Shaco level 30 were together in the first place. \r\n\r\nI mean this ruined the experience for me completely and these were probably bought accounts...","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-12T21:42:25.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is level 30... the third party site just hasn't updated to his current status.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T07:05:17.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It must be painful to have feeders up in gold, in bronze nobody really cares because tbh we're all going to be here forever. I see ap garen mid and I'm like ok well I'm still bronze so why do I care about a few lp. \n\nalso for a 20min game is that really all the cs the adc got? 90? seriously? I see better csing in bronze (I am bronze I know this) and while I won't comment on not rushing cdr on zilean (imo morellos>RoA for damage since for supports cdr>ap and grevious wounds for countering sona); why are you playing zilean in gold? Part of why he works at low elo is nobody knows how to outplay him so I'd imagine he's not as strong at higher elo.\n\nAlso upgrade your gold income item the extra hp regen helps. This is confusing me because I'm bronze; I'm the terrible one but I see soo many things wrong on that sheet. Also report that blue feed build shaco and that akali if she was feeding (even though Akali has a better score than your adc still report her).\n\nAlso try to play safer as zilean you scale really well into lategame and and you have some really strong counterengage in your kit. Although as I'm saying this, I guess it's not viable if 2 of your teammates are feeding and generally being assholes.\n\nSorry you had to go through that, and I hope you have better games in future.","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2016-08-16T16:38:43.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"another example why riots match making fails, someone stuck in bronze who knows how to build, hmmm bandaids again riot.","replies":[]}]}]}
