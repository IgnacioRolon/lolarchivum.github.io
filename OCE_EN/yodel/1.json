I used to main toplane, and have recently switched to jungle. \r\n\r\nI have been a regular follower of competitive play since season 2, and am keen to play the game on a higher level than soloqueue has to offer. \r\n\r\nI am therefore recruiting an ADC, SUP (or botlane premade), and a mid/toplaner to grind dynamic queue together. \r\n\r\nMust have a deep champion-pool in your chosen role, and a good understanding of matchups and macro play. \r\n\r\nAdd &#039;Yodel&#039; ingame.","replies":[]}
