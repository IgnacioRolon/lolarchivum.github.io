Every time I play a ranked game I am with some new ADC and half the time we don't click.  Would be good to find an ADC that I can play regularly with, ranked and non ranked.\r\n\r\nI am also looking for a club too. \r\n\r\nAdd me in game:   StonedAdvantage\r\n\r\nI really like stones....have about 420 of them.","replies":[{"poster":"GeocheMystery","date":"2019-04-04T08:55:21.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you collect rocks?
