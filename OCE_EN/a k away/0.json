For context, I plan the majority of our live events like this (Origin included) and work with our team here to try and make these events the best experience for everyone involved. \n\nWhen we made this decision to scale our grand final back in order to bring pros into a studio - it was about more than moving some money around. We really had to think through what we felt would provide the best experience for viewers and players and prioritise our resources accordingly. Last year, we identified that our grand final was taking up an incredible amount of our resources (people and budget) and the value that players got out of it was pretty short lived for the vast majority of people. So we spent some time thinking about what we could likely accomplish if we decided to not have our grand final to the same level. The result was us identifying that we'd be able to get all of the players centralised into one area, and have them appear on camera every week. There a lot of benefits to this (both for pros and viewers) but it's going to take some time to really see the results from it.\n\nI absolutely love events like this and I go to as many of them as I possible can, but for the moment we want to focus on building up a really good foundation around our regular season, and slowly scale our grand final up in a way that allows for both to be possible. \n\nWe're still working out the details for what our grand final will look like this year and once we do, we'll share them (sometime quite soon I hope). I'd imagine it will be similar scale to League of Origin though. \n\nFeel free to DM me on twitter @RiotLoote if you want to chat about event stuff specifically. I might be able to point you towards a few places that are hiring  or use volunteers for events and what kind of skillsets are good to learn!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-05-24T06:21:33.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was information regarding the 2017 season in a post called [Early insight into the OPL in 2017.\n](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/esports/p4jbyckE-early-insight-into-the-opl-in-2017)\n\n>TL;DR: Starting next year all OPL matches will be played at the Riot Games Oceania studio in Sydney, weâ€™re increasing the pro player payments per match and introducing a co-payment model to give clubs access to more funding for things like gaming houses and coaches. To fund that, we had to scale down our Grand Final presence.\n\nIt's not much to go on so here's hoping we will hear more about it soon.","replies":[]}]}
