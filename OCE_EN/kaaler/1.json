I would like to ask that my account be permanently banned rather than his, since it was my actions that led to the banning of the account and not his. I would like to add that he stopped playing and I started playing around February 2016, if his logs were to be viewed past February, one would see the change in personalities. I will not name him in this post, but rather wait until a RIOT employee contacts me personally. I have since given up the game and wish to right my wrongs. \n\nCheers,\nKaaler","replies":[{"poster":"VIBE","date":"2017-05-06T12:18:06.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really do hope riot takes things like this seriously instead of just blowing it off saying its your own fault yada yada cause they don't want to use their resources to salvage a relationship.\n\nrito pls.

(From personal experience takes about 2-5 days). Riot's usually pretty cool with helping you out if you ask nicely!\n\nAlthough...why were you an someone else account without their permission?????  Does the original owner even want his account back? Putting aside the toxicity ban wouldn't Riot freeze the account for this violation alone? \n\n........Seems like you really messed up. You want Riot to unfreeze an account you've been abusing for 6 months....so you can abuse it more?

I saw his password when he entered it at my house one time. Also your accusation about me wanting to get the account unfreeze to abuse it more is wrong. As I said, I quit League and could not care less to play again, but I do care that a friend of mine (who has spent quite a bit on this game) has lost his account because of me. Yes he does really want his account back as well, I wouldn't be here posting this if he didn't. \"Yehhh Good luck mate xD Not sure anyone would lift a finger for you.\" I can see where you're coming from. Looks like a typical salt lord who is asking for his account to be unbanned so he can go back to salting. Well jokes on me, cause I ain't a salt lord asking for his account to be unbanned. Im a salt lord asking for his friends account to get unbanned and for his account to receive the rightful punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Qrow Branwen","date":"2017-10-29T11:07:45.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats really quite bad lol.
