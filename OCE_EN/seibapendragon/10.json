People don't lose 10 games in a row one day and then win 10 games in a row the next just because their skill level changed dramatically over those 2 days.\n\nI find that in low elo, a few things are prevalent:\n\n1) Players have no balls, they can't control their emotions. This makes them less objective in game. For example one game i went 2/10/10 as a rammus jungle. The game was totally winnable, despite the team flaming me for \"feeding\". But their attitude was simply to meme and flame, they didn't wanna win the game. For example, three enemies showed in the bot lane at their tier 2 tower, including their jungler. Many times I pinged baron and said \"let's go!\" and the team refused to come, even though they were close by. They would rather say \"noob feeder!\" than win the game. Need I mention that the whole enemy team was AD? :) They put weight on your KDA score as to if you can shotcall. Rather than the objectiveness of the call, its all about reputation, which is stupid. Like WHO CARES WHO IS FEEDING, DO YOU WANT TO WIN THE GAME OR BE A MEME-ING DICKHEAD?\n\n2) Players in low elo have no idea what their champions do for their team. They can play their champions and push buttons, but they don't know where to be, where to position, when to fight, how to fight, or what to build for games. Mid lane mages especially. Players only know how to ram into other champions and coinflip fights. And that's why you hear the classic oce low elo call in champ select \"pick a tank!\" \"we have no tanks\" \"we need a tank\" as they proceed to lock in some squishy jungler or top laner. \"support, can you pick a tank?\". LUL.\n\n3) Players in low elo have very poor grasp of the **timing of the game**. An example is point #1 above. One of my teammates said \"sure, we will do baron and they will take our bot lane tower!\". Despite the fact that it would take the enemies 30 seconds to push to the bot lane inhibitor tower, and we have empowered recall from Baron buff, they refused to do it. Or the classic ping spam ??????????????? like \"where were you?\" when some idiot got caught out of position. \"You could have helped me!\" ahhh, no, it takes me 30 seconds to walk there. Or the classic (and this happens in all elos below about diamond 2 - i watch high elo games) a top laner is split pushing just past the halfway point of the river in one of the side lanes. His teammates are grouped in the middle of the map. Four enemies collapse on the split pusher, who is a fed champion. The splitpusher goes 1 for 1. Their teammates flame them for getting \"caught out\". The real issue with this is not what the splitpusher is doing, but WHAT ARE THEIR TEAM DOING WHILE THEY ARE DYING? They could have been doing baron, they could have pushed a tower. Most of the time you will see a bunch of monkeys rush to the splitpushers lane and try to collapse on the fight. And they get there 10 seconds later when the enemies have left. Another example on this is **recall timings**. In gold and platinum games are thrown away because players greeded for one inhibitor, or tower, got aced, and the enemies ran it mid and ended. Or.... tried to, when they greeded for the last nexus tower, and got aced themselves, and the first team ended the game after all.\n\nSo I can understand the OP's frustration, its the end of the season, and there are winning streaks as well as losing streaks. There are monkeys, boosted monkeys, and smurfs. And there is matchmaking which cannot handle it all.","replies":[{"poster":"SeibaPendragon","date":"2018-10-01T01:06:48.276+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks I know, its good to see its not just me but others who get this also.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-09-30T02:21:48.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You do know this concept applied to both side?

This can demote someone from gold to silver. From an mmr point of view, the demotion is not that large, but psychologically the player thinks it is, because then they have to win promos again to get back to their skill ceiling level.\n\nEveryone sucks, its all relative.

It's silver and gold that we are talking about for god's sake. Players don't understand itemisation. Look at every gold 5 and under game and you will see incorrect itemisation. ALMOST EVERY GAME. Also if his teammates are monkeys maybe HE IS TRYING TO CARRY even with the limited resources that he has. Why support a monkey adc? \n\n[Have a look at the Karma game](https://imgur.com/a/heREZVo) closely. How much cc does the enemy team have? Lux only, really. The game is a clown fiesta (look at the number of kills). But the Ashe he is with is the lowest level in the game? Both teams or adcs are low elo so they don't farm much. Towers have obviously gone down quickly, and if the Ashe is a monkey they will not get the side lane farm near tier twos or idiot teammates will take it instead of giving it to the adc.\n\nYou try to support, but when they are useless af, or are so far behind, or do the same stupid players everytime (e.g. overextending in a side lane because they are underlevelled and dying to Quinn), it's time to move on and build some damage instead. At least he has his wards item. He has a 53% winrate and was bronze the past two seasons, I think he's playing better than in the past.\n\nI'm done talking about this topic.

I think Riot should put a cap on ranked, like you cannot play ranked until you own 10 champions with at least level 6 mastery. And like Locodoco agreed with me on stream yesterday, the Tutorial needs to explain what experience and csing actually does. People rush into ranked without having a clue that this is important. They play like its call of duty.\nIt was an interesting discussion because one guy said \"but league has so many resources online LUL, you just go to youtube LUL\" and Locodoco disagreed stating that if a complete newbie youtubed \"How to play adc\" he comes up with a lot of stuff thats simply out of date (Graves ADC) but also the clickbait titles (in one video he clicked on we saw QTPie trolling with Yasuo bot lane). Plus the fact that newbies don't want to go out of the game to a completely different site to learn stuff - they want to get playing as soon as possible!\n\nThe skill in this game is so trash right now. In fact I would say that skill level in BRONZE at the start of season 5 was higher than the skill level this season a whole division more (so if Bronze 1 we talk about Silver 1 etc). \n\nS5 ADC: Let's freeze, they cannot walk up. S8 ADC: What is freezing?\nS5 ADC: Go roam, I'll shove and then get a pickaxe. S8 ADC: I need a BF sword, I'll stay while we have no vision and you are roaming.\nS8 Support: Just back together and get a pickaxe. S8 ADC: No I need a BF sword even though the opposition only have a longsword.\nS5 Support: push for level 2! S8 ADC: Stop hitting my minions!\nS5 Mid Lane Lux: I'll push wave into tower to bounce it. S8 Mid Lane Lux: I can do anything vs Fizz, he's weak.\nS5 Jungler: Its mid game I should be near my team while they group near baron. S8 Jungler: Meh, we are behind, I'll take a tower and show these laners how its done.\nS5 Top Laner: OK enemy bot got to lane with less mana. That means enemy jungler will be here around 2:45-3:00, I'll push now and ward at about 2:30.

Not just talking about OPL here. NALCS was at an all time skill low for me. Fnatic in EU look reasonable (if their support doesn't int while warding) and maybe Vitality can go ok on occasion, but the rest will be absolutely demolished. Team Liquid think they are good, but they don't communicate well enough or quickly enough. C9 is hyped up but their jungle will be exposed. And 100 Thieves? Haha. How they got to worlds is kinda like very lucky. They will be absolutely trounced. And why is this? Not enough practice. 1 month of soloqueue in Korea cannot make up for a year's zookeeping with the monkeys on the NA server. They scraped through on championship points and that's it. Their bot lane will be absolutely violated, and Ssumday will have to think about putting money before a chance at a real team in Korea.\n\nDire Wolves?

They sell accounts to people that are Diamond, they then let them play for a month before reclaiming the account by saying they were hacked and recover it. This kind of does ruin the experience, especially when you have idiots on your team and they don't. Ranked is the luck of a draw which makes it bullshit to climb because you gain like 15lp and lose 20. Even with my friends high mmr, he was gaining 25mmr and lost 20 per game (100 wins, 30 losses @ Diamond rank).  \n\nNot only that but it's a stressful game when it counts towards something.
