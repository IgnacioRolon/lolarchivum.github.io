Very few players queue up solo in flex, so 4-mans would be waiting ages for queue pops, and the longer the wait the lower the matchmaking quality as well.\n\nThere is also the hostage consideration as Jon Sn0w0 mentions. 4-mans have a lot of power, and in ranked especially that can lead to some pretty gross interactions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Choupinette","date":"2019-03-31T18:50:16.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to consider potential negative situations where 4 man parties would be a negative impact on the game For example, surrender votes. It only takes 4 yes votes to create a surrender. So in the event where the 5th solo player doesn't want a surrender, regardless the 4 man party can still force a surrender (it happens a lot in norms). This is especially toxic when say you are winning and then last minute before you win, the 4 man forces or trolls a surrender losing you a game. Also, they can turn a surrender vote in the way of not allowing a surrender. Say your team is losing badly and you are stuck with a team of 4 other extremely toxic team mates who make your life hell. You try to surrender but you can't because the vote is 1-4. This leaves you stuck in a negative situation for a lot longer than necessary ending up leaving you tilted and angry.  It is hard enough to get solo players to play in Flex queue tho who is going to take the final position when there's solo/duo rank? 4-Mans also tend to pick on solo players and the whole chat will be pretty biased. When a solo is partied with 2 or 3, that may still happen, but to a lesser extent.","replies":[]}]}
