Hence more account selling/buying.\n4) Banned players come back into ranked with new accounts and get placed higher than they should be. Now with the extra tier, some players are two tiers higher than their actual skill.\n5) The new cs bounty system has made the game different, and so there are many coinflips and a lot of games won by who got the baron and steamrolled through base carrying monkeys on their back.\n6) Catch-up gimmicks in game are at an all time high, meaning that at lower elos, the game is a coinflip. The worst player/afker/troller on a team decides the game in favour of the opposition, whether they are good or not.\n7) I've noticed a lot more afkers in game. And it's not just because of ragequitting (fix the client please!). When Riot updates the front page, lag happens in game.\n8) Since dynamic queue days in Season 6, many monkeys are placed higher than they should be. The fallout is still real.\n9) Riot don't punish trolls, they only punish \"toxic\" players.\n10) Because of all of this stuff, a lot of players don't actually care too much anymore about trying in ranked, they just treat it casually.\n\nConsider any new players introduced to the game. With this sort of system in place, do you think they will ever learn the basics?
