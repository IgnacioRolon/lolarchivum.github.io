Every time i finish the chat restrictions and play a game without it i do not say a word. I don&#039;t type at all and after the game the chat restrictions come again. This has happened 5 times and i have made sure not to type a single word to make sure it&#039;s not actually me being rude and getting banned. Please Riot fix my account?","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2015-06-29T14:15:27.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"suck shiet you lying sack of shiet! \n\nYou probably one of those guys that rages at people during champ select and says GG before the game even begins","replies":[]}]}
