If the \"original mid\" got banned then it's obviously not the first time they got reported, and even though a few of the systems related to reports are automatic they rarely ban the wrong people. I think it's safe to say the \"original mid\" has been doing some sh!t in their games to get themselves banned, even if it didn't occur in this particular game (which I honestly doubt).","replies":[]}]}
