Instead she is very weak when fallen behind because her low defenses but maxing her shields doesn't cover up all other burst damage. Her early game was to poke champions as much as possible but if champions that has heals and shields that is lower than her cd are neglated her dmg and i don't think she will be picked in the future. She most likely be stayed in the shadows for fun than playing as her.\r\n\r\n{{champion:37}} is a champion to poke on enemies as much in the early than receiving high cc on others that causes her death so quickly. For example, {{champion:111}} can throw a full combo on Sona if you aren't standing behind minions or being pushed back because adc is close up. At this point, she will be dead in 3 seconds and falls behind on exp so quickly and lead enemy bot lane ahead. Sona players are aggressive than passive if they can play their Qs correctly. However in mid if she is not ahead consider her damage to enemy is about not even close to 20 to enemy's who are mages, adcs and ad champions.\r\n\r\nI assure you won't be surprise if this is playable until you counter hard cc against bot lane but rune that can help her isn't efficient on pokes like Aery but work on Shielding.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-08-08T22:49:18.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say this but Sona has the highest winrate of any support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-08T14:40:49.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The trick to supports like Sona is that the best defense against an engage support like Nautilus or Thresh or Blitz or Leona, is actually to go on the offensive.\nHigh elo Sona mains go with the Q-W-Q-E and focus on maxing q first, and take double AP rune with armour. You want to maximise how often you're utilising aery, scorch runes, and spellthiefs. You also want to be abusing your auto range and harassing whenever they try to cs, and make sure to land your empowered auto as often as possible. Try to focus your damage on 1 target when possible, so that it's harder to engage and pick fights. Your summoner spells can vary, in high elo, flash/barrier is popular since it allows sona to play more aggressively, but in lower elo, you may find flash/ignite more useful for the extra fighting pressure in lane, or flash/exhaust if you need more peel for an adc who regularly mispositions against enemy bruisers and duelists.\nPlayed well, your poke should hurt quite alot, which allows you to transition into the more defensive midgame where you stand back.\n\nAnother popular option in high elo right now if that aggression is not your style, is klepto sona. Taking the ancient coin line instead, and playing more defensively, going q-w-w-e-w and maxing w first. This built utilises either scorch again, shield bash or taste of blood, for lighter poke and better sustain. The build simply tries to whether the lane and sustain through bad trades, and if the enemy team doesn't have a good botlane combo, is very hard to kill or force out of lane.","replies":[]}]}
