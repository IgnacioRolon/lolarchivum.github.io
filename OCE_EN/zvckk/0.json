I am basing the story off of:\nAce of spades Ezreal, King of Clubs Mordekaiser, Queen of hearts Syndra, Wild Card Shaco\nRogue Admiral Garen, Corsair Quin, Sea hunter Aatrox, Ironside Malphite\nCaptain Fortune\n\n-----\nAn ersatz assembly was gathered in the royal throne room. A towering king sat, unmoving on his throne, his golden armour glinting with the reflected faces of four unimpressed pirates. As a richly dressed youth, stepped forward from the king's side to address them, his voice echoed, bouncing off of the marble floor and up towards the elaborately decorated ceiling. Wooden beams intersected the high walls, a platform from which to spy.\n\nShaco sighed as he shifted his position on the hard wood. The negotiations had been going for only a half hour, but the observer was already bored. He let his arms dangle either side of him, his back balancing on the narrow beam as he continued to eavesdrop on the unsuspecting group.\n\"I won't ask again. We performed our services with precision despite the...incident, and are willing to keep our lips sealed. We deserve an increase in our payment.\"\nThe pirate captain's voice was authoritative, yet it carried an attractive melody despite her harsh tone, as though she was coaxing rather than demanding. Shaco expected nothing less than for the king to dismiss her via his son, who even now was preparing to counter he statement.\n\"Lord Mordekaiser has heard your arguments and has decided against raising your reward. The previously agreed upon sum.\"\nEzreal smiled, believing to have spoken with confidence and poise, then glancing back to the throne, nodded to his father, whose expressionless helmet provided no response. The captain was unimpressed however, and rolled her eyes before raising her voice to the point of yelling, her volume commanding the room's attention.\n\"You will give us what we deserve or we will take the money by force!\"\nShe spat in the direction of the king, the audacity of the action enthralling Shaco. Such behavior was intolerable in Mordekaiser's presence, and Ezreal would kill for the king as readily as speak for him. The pirate entourage departed, as if surrendering the life of their leader over to the prince. Shaco's mind buzzed with anticipation as he sprung from rafter to rafter, seeking to better his view of the inevitable bloodshed. Ezreal dusted his hands on his dark blue robes, energy flickering between his fingers with a turquoise sheen. Taking a few steps forward, he gave the captain a chance for apology.\n\"You would do well to act with more dignity in the presence of the king. Repent, or face judgement for your disrespect.\"\nThe lone pirate smirked, her countenance unwavering and the echoing footsteps of her crew signalling her return. At a closer distance Shaco could make out their features. They were a motley bunch, one of them bore the anatomy of a human, but with the warped addition of a shark. The other two were visibly normal, each representing opposing halves of brutality and grace. The addition of a large bird was a little surprising. It followed the trio on foot from a distance, it's head flicking periodically as it vigilantly scanned it's surroundings. As they reached the positions they previously vacated, a distant cracking could be heard. The sound reminded Shaco of wood breaking against stone. He swung himself under his perch, risking his concealment for the sake of glimpsing the noise's source. As it entered his vision he lost his breath and chuckled inwardly.\n\nIt was a being of iron and wood, its movements whirring and creaking, creating an industrial ambiance that left an unsettling taste in Shaco's mouth. The prince's hands drained of magic and he stumbled back to the right hand side of the throne, his expression changing from sinister to worried. Steel cannons could be seen protruding from the behemoth's back and it's maw glowed like a stoked furnace. All sins of impoliteness had been unspokenly forgiven, but the pirates were not stopping at forgiveness.\n\"I will leave it to the king to reconsider his decision, although I recommend acknowledging the trouble his stubbornness has caused me and my crew.\"\nThe captain was clearly flaunting the negotiation power she now held, winking at the prince who was looking uncertainly towards his father. The prince, after receiving naught but the blurry image of his own anxious face, remained on track with his teachings, and with the plan.\n\"Lord Mordekaiser has decided that no raise will be given.\"\nEzreal knew what his words meant, energy again flowing within his grasp, available to command. The behemoth readied its aim, its gears ground to a halt as the cannons locked their positions. The king tilted his head, the movement breaking his statue-like appearance. His hands, resting on the arms of his throne, grew strained as he hefted his massive bulk upright before raising his gigantic mace. His towering presence would have awed spectators if not for the equally titanic being before him. Mordekaiser moved forward, his size shielding Ezreal from death's eyes and a magical barrier slowly forming around him as his own protection. Shaco was extatic; years of shadowing would finally pay off if he could distract the king's focus and lower his defenses. The crown would finally fall. Shaco slipped a shiv out from within his garments, drawing upon his connection with the shadows to conceal himself in bent light. With grace he dropped to the ground, rolling to break the impact of such a height. He crept upon Ezreal's oblivious form, laughter on the edge of his lips.\n\"Just a little bit closer...\"\nThe prince's gaze was set watchfully on the monster before his father, his knuckles white as his clenched fists prepared to unleash his contained magic. Meanwhile the giants were in a standoff, unaware of the meddling third party whose blade was poised to strike.\n\nldquo;Aaarrrghhh!&rdquo; A song of agony tore through the silence, it's heart pinching tones feeding the joy of the murderous clown. With a bellow the king span his emotionless guise melting before the sight of his lifeless son amidst fountains of blood that erupted from his back. Mordekaiser groaned, the fading crackle of magic empathizing with the deepening void in his soul.\n&ldquo;Death would be too good for the likes of you, murderer.&rdquo;\nHis voice was shaken, his demeanor, destroyed. The words were barely audible. To bring such a ruler to a point as low as this, Shaco burst out laughing, his dancing figure incongruous in the macabre setting. His joy was heard, even as two almighty shots rang out, cracking into the back of the king as a wisp of smoke trailed out the barrels of some empty cannons. His giant form jolted forward, careening towards Shaco with a propellant force. An unearthly howl sounded, shattering the windows. Inches from the face of the assasin the titan halted, the corpse suspended on a bed of purple energy. As a shower of glass fell upon the speechless pirates, the frail form of the queen could be seen descending. Silhouetted by the flames of her magic as she floated towards the ground. Her face was streaked with tears but her expression was firm. lowered a hand she released her husband, his armor clanging as it collided with the floor. She bit her lip, a drop of blood moistening it as she spoke, her voice low with malice. \nldquo;You will all pay for this with your lives.&rdquo;\n\nA dull hum buzzed underneath the noise of the room, an irritating tone that was believably imaginary until focused upon. The humming grew louder as dark spheres warped into the room, controlled by the gestures of the stricken queen. Syndra pulled in her arm at the elbow, before thrusting it outwards, the obs obeying her command as the barraged the pirates with an explosive force. Shaco stopped dancing. His laughing stopped too, giving way to the cackles of Syndra as she demolished her prey with unnecessary persistence. They were destroyed, but Sydra refused to cease, her face again wet with tears as she poured the loss of her family into the onslaught. The entering archway was painted with blood, and the marble flooring was becoming like leaves under a pestle. Shaco stood transfixed by a display of violence even he could not conceive, his shiv loosening in his grip, the prince's blood still dripping from its edge. At last he summoned the will to move, to escape the wrath of the widowed witch. His decision was reached all to late. With a gasp the assasin fell forwards, tripped up by an invisible force. He fell sprawling against the painted tiles, their colours bathed in a purple light. He turned himself over, looking up in fear at the sorceress who was again aloft, riding the power of her mind. All jest had been drained from him, there was no sparkle in his eyes or smile upon his lips. He tried to rise but found himself pinned, his limbs obeying the will of their new queen. He saw his arm rise, a purple shimmer gracing its surface as it reclaimed his fallen shiv, the blood on it webbing like mucus as it left the ground. The blade's edge was brought to his face, his ghosted expression crimson red in the liquid mirror of his kill.\n\"Say something fool!\"\nSyndra demanded, her eyes flashing as she pointing accusingly at her new puppet.\n\"You have robbed my son of life. But you will not meet him in heaven, no. Your fate will see you longing for the void you thrust him into.\"","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-13T12:06:41.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have majorly edited the text. Most of the humour has been removed and the ending is a lot darker. It feels like it needs one more line at the end to kind of tie it up but im not sure what. I will probably go back and change the beginning a third time, removing shaco's inner monologue; while his personality is fun to play with im not sure it fits the current atmosphere of the story. The current word count is also now 1629 which is a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-21T09:50:10.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have completed another large edit, the word count is still over at 1590.\nEzreal has been made bolder, no longer cowering behind the throne but rather standing there while mord steps in front. This is still disempowering but for the plot i need mord in front of ez and looking away, so shaco can be sneaky","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saben","date":"2017-03-16T19:32:06.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is almost perfect really nice story. Of course you have the 1629 word count which is difficult but I also noticed a basic spelling mistake with Ezreal's initial decline of the extra gold coins. \"your line or work\" would make sense if line described being a pirate. I suspect you meant for that to be \"your line of work.\"One other thing which is probably not important but might need some clarification is Shaco's role as a jester. Jester's are generally entertainers in the court, and it's not made clear whether Shaco is that, or just a murderous freak stalking the king. Also would like to know if the king knew of Shaco's presence. \n\nI suspect this will be in top 3, maybe even first. Wish mine was this good.","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-16T23:12:34.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thanks. Your high opinion of the story means a lot to me.\n\nIn this story Shaco is not actually an entertainer for the court, I just describe him as jester to involve his appearance and personality.\n\n\"your line or work\" is supposed to be of, thank you\n\nThe king does not notice Shaco until Ezreal is assassinated, I will work on making this clearer in the early paragraphs.\n\nMmh. My main problem **is** the word count. My current thoughts are to summaries the earlier negotiations, leaving less of an introduction to how it got heated, and have the viewer enter in with Shaco observing an already tense argument.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThunderWielder","date":"2017-03-15T13:05:01.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice piece but I think Ezreal should be a bit bolder. Sure he is a child but he's the prodigal explorer and isn't afraid to challenge foes. I would also be interested in how the piece was before you removed the humour.
