Warwick takes away half of my HP and I'm left unable to do enough in team fights if not die from the half a second I'm silenced.\r\n\r\nIs it my positioning? No, because he saves his flash just to flash ulti me, and me only. Which is around every fight or every second fight.\r\n\r\nHe gets assists by giving his teammates the buff from his W which gives him devour stacks....
