Admittedly she&#039;d used it more as a private weapons store than for anything so profligate as sleeping - but it had been her home since the age of fourteen. \r\n \r\nTwo, her place among her people, where she was honoured for both her martial prowess and religious fervour. \r\n \r\nThree, the Ra-Horak. \r\n \r\nIt&#039;s the last one that she stops and looks back for. The Ra-Horak, her twelve shield-brothers. They have fought together in countless battles. Their bonds were formed in blood and tied them closer than any family, and now? She is stealing away from them in the night like a coward. She wonders what they&#039;ll feel when they read the note she left. Betrayal. Anger. What other reaction could they have to her words? _The heretic was right. The Solari believe lies. I can no longer live this way. I am going to seek the truth. \r\n _\r\nAs she follows the shimmer of Diana&#039;s footprints away from the place she called home, she only hopes she can find the girl before the Ra-Horak do. \r\n \r\n--\r\n \r\nWhen she does finally track the footprints to their source, she&#039;s in the middle of a fetid grey marsh, and it&#039;s fortunate that she&#039;s being led by supernatural powers, because no trail would last an hour in these slimy, stinking lowlands. The source in question is sitting on a toppled, rough-hewn monument, as comfortable as a lady in a sitting-room. If ladies in sitting-rooms lounged around sharpening _seven-foot scythe blades_ in the cold hours before sunrise, that is. \r\n \r\nHere is what Leona planned to say when she finally met Diana again: _They were wrong. I was wrong, and I want to know the truth, like you do._ Then Diana would come forward and say _Of course I forgive you,_ or maybe even _There&#039;s no need to apologise, please_, and she would clasp Leona&#039;s forearms as a sister, and the sun and moon would be reunited once again, and all enemies of the light would cower, knowing their doom was at hand.\r\n \r\nHere is what actually happens:\r\n \r\nDiana looks up from her blade, her pale eyes glinting uncannily in the half-dark, one eyebrow insolently raised, and drawls, &quot;What. No band of merry men this time?&quot; \r\n \r\nThis wasn&#039;t a part of Leona&#039;s script. She gives it a go anyway, starting &quot;They were...&quot; and fumbles &quot;- what? I mean - I...&quot; then gives up and says &quot;_Merry men?_&quot; \r\n \r\nDiana stands, the movement as clean and economical as a switchblade unfolding. Her grip on her weapon is deceptively easy, loose. Her face is a clay-white mask of indifference. &quot;The Ra-Horak?&quot; Diana asks, all counterfeit sincerity. &quot;You know, your little posse that&#039;s been hunting me like an animal? Sweaty? Bumbling? Ring any bells?&quot;\r\n \r\nLeona tamps down on the surge of heat that&rsquo;s turning the edges of her vision red. Finally she grits out, &quot;The Ra-Horak are no longer mine.&quot; It&rsquo;s the first time she&rsquo;s admitted that out loud, and it drains the anger away, leaving her feeling burned hollow. She forces herself to unclench her hands, one finger, then two, then she slowly relaxes with the rest. She looks up and meets Diana&#039;s eyes bleakly. &quot;By now, I have no doubt that they consider me as much of a traitor to the Solari as you.&quot; More so, probably. Diana had always been an outsider, but Leona had called herself their leader, sister, friend.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Diana smirks, cutting neatly into Leona&rsquo;s moment of acute guilt and homesickness. She seems to have assessed Leona and decided that she&rsquo;s not a threat, because she&rsquo;s no longer standing on her waystone. Instead she perches on it with her blade cradled in her lap like a mother with a sickly child. She licks her thumb and smudges an invisible speck off it, then says, without even looking up, &ldquo;Much as I would _love_ to hear your no doubt _riveting_ story of apostasy and abject disgrace-&ldquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;I was led to the summit,&rdquo; Leona interrupted. &ldquo;Like you. I saw something there, something beyond my scope to understand, or even fully recall. The truth &ndash; the truth you spoke of, back when you-&ldquo; she pauses. Is there a sensitive way to say incinerated the entire council of elders? Changing tack, she goes with, &ldquo;The sun god entered me.&rdquo; \r\n \r\nDiana snorts indelicately. \r\n \r\n&ldquo;I speak truly!&rdquo; Leona growls in frustration. Diana&rsquo;s eyes are going kind of slitty, so Leona whips out her sword. It doesn&rsquo;t really reflect the rays of the rising sun so much as absorb them, and glow a deadly burnished gold. &ldquo;Look! My weapons burned away and in their place I was given this sword, and this shield, and abilities beyond those of mortal men!&rdquo;\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Woah, woah,&rdquo; Diana waves her hands placatingly. &ldquo;You can put that blade away, I&rsquo;m&hellip; prepared to believe you. In fact, now that you mention it, I _do_ recall. The lowlanders have been buzzing recently about some horrible mountain harpy raining sunfire down on hapless men, and then feasting on their par-broiled hearts.&rdquo; She leans back and eyes Leona speculatively. &ldquo;Should&rsquo;ve known it was you.&rdquo;\r\n \r\nThat does it. Leona has closed the gap between them in one furious stride and is half lifting Diana off the rock with one gauntleted fist when several things happen in quick succession. \r\n \r\nThe first is that the dormant entity within her abruptly roars to life at the contact between herself and Diana, and she is filled with a sudden joyous, blazing rush of _at last, at last_ that feels distinctly foreign. Distantly she registers Diana&rsquo;s bitten-off gasp and knows she must be experiencing &ndash; whatever this is - too. Leona sways on her feet as the world tips around, and by the time she steadies herself again she&rsquo;s not really dragging Diana off the rock so much as one-handedly leaning on/supporting her.\r\n \r\nThe second thing happens almost simultaneously with the first, but Leona can&rsquo;t really say she&rsquo;s paying attention, what with the god-screeching, and the trying-to-stay-upright, and just, general swooning all around. \r\n \r\nShe only notices when her teeth feel suddenly numb, and all the little hairs on the back of her neck prickle. She realises, as if in slow motion, that the quality of the light around them has taken on a strange and sickly tint; the very air itself seems to billow and bulge.\r\n \r\nDiana recovers enough to jerk herself out of Leona&rsquo;s grip. She staggers slightly as her feet hit the ground, and she snarls out &ldquo;You really have the most perfect timing, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; even as she swings her scythe blade to the ready. \r\n \r\nLeona is just opening her mouth to retort when her ears pop &ndash;\r\n \r\n \r\n And the ground erupts beneath them.\r\n \r\n \r\nDiana is clearly expecting the pallid, eyeless - things - that come snaking out of the ground in horrible boneless waves. Her blade flashes a silver crescent through the air and one of the terrors lets out a horrible screech with a fang-filled mouth Leona could have sworn it didn&rsquo;t have before.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; Diana yells. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let them evolve!&rdquo; and that snaps Leona into action.\r\n \r\nThe battle is a blur, a series of stuttered sensations: beheading a terror as it leaps for the back of Diana&rsquo;s neck, the crunch of darkening purple exoskeleton beneath her shield, the poisonous burn of acid, and the bite of her sword through the creature that spat it. \r\n\r\nAnd throughout it all, a savage golden rage singing through her veins, pounding red behind her eyes. Every time she kills another darkening terror, the entity within her surges with an arrogant, predatory triumph. At her back, Diana fights with a thrilling, terrifying fervour; leaned into it, ruthless, yearning, violent. \r\n \r\nLeona feels her teeth bare in a savage grin.\r\n\r\nWhen the final voidspawn dies (with a shriek that she feels in her teeth), and she lowers her blade slowly, and plants it tip-first in the ground. &ldquo;Praise the sun,&rdquo; she pants out, still grinning, and she knows she&rsquo;s never uttered that short Rakkor battle-prayer with such devotion.\r\n\r\nDiana wipes bubbling ichor off her blade and says, very seriously, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a psychotic religious freak.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s perfect,&rdquo; Leona replies, and Diana barks out a laugh. \r\n\r\nWith the sealing of the void, the bruised tint to the sky is gone. In the soft golden light Diana looks a little less cold, a little more human.\r\n\r\nLeona smiles, sheathes her sword and slings her shield onto her back. \r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s going to be a good day. \r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nmy last minute entry ayyy. Actually I&#039;m an artist not a writer, but I was too busy ~~wanking~~ when that lunar revel art comp was going on. Originally this story contained Zoe, about 3000 additional words of spicy banter, and a subplot involving the sun and moon gods doing the cosmic equivalent of forcing the girls&#039; faces together and going &quot;KISS! KISS! KISS!&quot; the whole time, but alas, it was rated S, for sin. Now the world will never know the pure romance of Diana saying &quot;oh a _thrust groove_, is that what they&#039;re calling it these days?&quot; and Leona choking on her soggy sandwich","replies":[]}
