I started to notice as newer champions were released that Riot was making the lore shorter. It didn&#039;t bother me too much because it isn&#039;t a big gameplay feature. Although after looking over Amumu&#039;s lore, I found that he had been reduced and altered into something that doesn&#039;t really explain anything significant about him.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m wondering why Riot continues to include a Lore section if they have no interest in developing the Lore behind champions.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoy the lore, it&#039;s a disappointment. For those with no interest in the lore, it doesn&#039;t affect them. So why continue to disappoint the people who read the lore when it could just be removed.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I feel that including a lore section is unnecessary if they do not want to write quality lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2016-04-14T07:56:21.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Extended lore is usually on the website now.","replies":[{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-04-14T07:57:42.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't realise that.

They should also consider the items' lore before changing them. For example the magic damage on-hit from Wits End was changed from 42 to 40..... as if that will make a big difference in the game, but it sure makes a difference to the lore.","replies":[]}]}
