You've only played a handful of ranked games in your life. Set some targets... learn a champion, play them and aim to get at least an average KDA on that champion of over 3:1 after 100 games. \nAlso watch youtube videos on people who play that champion (preferably LCS players). You'll improve a lot more than relying on someone to carry you.","replies":[{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-01-12T17:03:30.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Bookbash said, learning about the game and what champion works into what match up (even just team comps) is a definite way of solo carrying your war to what ever rank you want to achieve. Back when I was in bronze, I was determined to get to silver, I watched countless youtube videos, livestreams of anyone whom was a higher rank than I... After about half the year, I started playing more, seeing how what match ups were good or not... I managed to get from Bronze 4 to Silver 3 Just by playing support, and solo carried my team as Janna (when she was strong as hell).\n\nIt takes time, but eventually you can make it into what ever rank you want to be with your own skill, you do not need someone else to 'carry' you to a point on the ladder.\n\nAlso there is a general fact of people whom are carried to a ranking (Example: Platinum) will fall back to where they began, wasting all the effort of the other person. And most likely, the person wouldn't be bothered doing it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Caeli Pluvia","date":"2016-01-13T02:44:24.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-13T02:52:42.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Caeli Pluvia,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=AAFfzW0x,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-01-13T02:44:24.308+0000)\n>\n> how does one solo carry as janna?\n\nUse Forecast Janna.

It's one of the worst skins in my opinion (next to Blade Craft Orianna).\n\nBut what I did was focus on myself, protecting my team, getting them ahead of the enemy, made sure no assassin got on my Marksman, no matter who they were. Once I got to mid game, wards were all over the map (before vision limits) and kept pinging people whom were in danger from a gank.\n\nI would sometimes flash ult to either save someone or get the enemy separated so my team can easily clean them up. You're able to carry from any position, as any champion, you need to know the core mechanics of the champion to do well, that is why it takes time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miamza","date":"2016-01-12T18:53:35.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah just spam rank.  get a duo, easiest way to climb.","replies":[]}]}
