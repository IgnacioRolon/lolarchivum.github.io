This isn&#039;t uncommon I usually get most damage on my team when I play Malphite.","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyBurgerMan","date":"2016-02-20T01:26:00.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"salt","replies":[]},{"poster":"dudes0r0awesome","date":"2016-06-25T19:19:24.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why doesnt this have more attention?
