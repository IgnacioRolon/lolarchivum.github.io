It just seems like Riot couldn&#039;t be fked, simple as that. It would shorten queue times in all elos in all servers, and if you only want to queue for two and tank the queue time you can, but why not allow people who are happy to play 3 or 4 roles specifically pick 3 or 4 roles, it&#039;s just logical...","replies":[]}
