The reason we don't have as many game modes is because the servers want us to focus more on normal and ranked so that que times won't take that long. It is to balance out the times for the ques if we had all the game modes that NA has then our que wait times could be 3-5 mins which could be annoying. We still have really less so when have a lot more players then we can have more modes.
