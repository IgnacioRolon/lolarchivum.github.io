However, we did not receive the promised Cosmic Queen Ashe skin that was supposedly given if we were to order a ticket online. I found this was the same with everyone else who watched Worlds as well. I have pictures of me and my friends tickets if it were to help in redeeming the skin.\n\nPlease help!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-04T10:07:14.166+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Hey guys!
