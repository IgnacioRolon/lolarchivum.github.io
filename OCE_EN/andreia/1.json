Why is it everytime someone is flaming or intentionally feeding, the same person halfway through the game starts spamming in some asian dialect or broken english. It&#039;s got to be dealt with. I&#039;ve been playing this game since season 1. NA was fine, but these last two years on OCE has been hell. These same people have no regard for rules or respect. They elo boost, they script, they flame, they int, they are the most toxic players in the game. It&#039;s such a high percentage. Why is there such a large influx all of a sudden?  \r\n\r\nGuys here who understand said foreign language of &quot;cao ni ma&quot; and &quot;sb&quot;. These people are making you look bad and I am just one of many who are getting a terrible impression of your country. The amount of disrespect is incredible. It&#039;s fine when you speak another language even though this is an english speaking server. But please try to have respect for your teammates and ping and not flame us. We are usually doing better than you anyway....... \r\n\r\nWhat seems to be amazing is all these players have the exact same champion pool. Yasuo, Zed, Vayne, Riven, Rengar, Katarina, Lee Sin. The shit %%%% starter pack.","replies":[{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-10-19T00:40:04.353+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, being a troll & so on is international.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-10-19T00:13:37.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vote Trump.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-10-20T04:56:44.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know what OP is saying, it's not all Asian player obviously, we aren't racist here, but many of these (asian) players on OCE are very detrimental to teamplay.\n\nThey are arrogant as hell, and all want to be the hero. I find that when I play late in the night/morning, all these guys come through. They never work with the team, and only ever try to KS, rather than poke.\n\nI'm not racist, not in the slightest, but dicks are dicks, be it asian or white, etc.\n\nYou get queued with a team of 4 Asians, and sometimes they are complete asses to you, this isn't a judgement on them being Asian, it's a judgement on them being assholes, assholes come in all colours and creeds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2016-11-06T01:33:30.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vote Trump only fix \n\nhttp://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=14165\n\nI am Asian myself and I would say there's no need to cover your eyes from facts because you are afraid of being labelled a 'racist' 'bigot'. There's difference between fact based analysis and ad hominem attacks.\n\nHaving said that, OCE population is already lowest of low, most likely why they aren't region blocking the toxic onflow of Garena (Asian league provider)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-20T04:27:16.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#: HSPMovement","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-19T00:03:25.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hehehe.
