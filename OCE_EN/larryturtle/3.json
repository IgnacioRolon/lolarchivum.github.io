He is a very aggressive champion and there are very few champions that can deal with the sheer aggression that Talon provides.\n\nYour goal is to rush a Tiamat, push the wave, and then roam. Staying in lane, unless the enemy is feeding you, is pretty pointless.\n\nTalonâ€™s counter is Aatrox, so ban him if you can.\n\nKatarina is still viable, but a lot of champs have CC now. This is no longer season 2 where there were a select few champs that could deal with her. Everyone and their dad have hard CC.\n\nI say do both if you can.","replies":[]}]}
