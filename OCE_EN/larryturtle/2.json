Give tips, not poops, look for mia before chasing (missing allies too), always report in case of fake troll accounts feeding, and treat the team like kids you're babysitting (try adapt to them the best you can, e.g mass skillshots ad/ap caster because you can't trust them due to them purposely being toxic and waiting for you to die)","replies":[]}]}
