Thanks for the share, very neat and funny, I wanna try something like that now xP I've tried with other obstacle spells and just pathing but I think noobs are less nooby nowadays","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-11T20:41:14.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoulSmithPhoenix,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vI8tQmcF,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2019-08-11T03:22:19.524+0000)\n>\n> You used to be able to herd with heimerdinger turrets.\n> \n> Link related.\n> \n> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvugzSQwaso\n\nuse to???","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SoulSmithPhoenix","date":"2019-08-10T10:31:03.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted, last match Shaco decided to do the Shuffle for 5 seconds instead of Pathing correctly.\nDoesn't sound too bad unless you were there and noticed only 2 minions were actually blocking him...","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-15T03:34:16.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoulSmithPhoenix,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=vI8tQmcF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-10T10:31:03.139+0000)\n>\n> Upvoted, last match Shaco decided to do the Shuffle for 5 seconds instead of Pathing correctly.\n> Doesn't sound too bad unless you were there and noticed only 2 minions were actually blocking him...\n\nyou should try pin people still with obstacle spells that aren't supposed to (unless you is skilled with aim) e.g Trundle rock pinching somebody against a wall or pocketing them in a big enough curve, I still haven't seen much or any teams that are all obstacle champs sadly","replies":[]}]}]}
