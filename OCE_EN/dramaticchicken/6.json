I am a Support main (currently Silver 2, in promos for Silver 1) and can play any support. I have discord, don't tilt very easily and am willing to learn as I play. I leave a link to my OP.GG below as well as my Mastery points on champions so you may see who I play. I am in high school so I may be busy at times but I am on if not at school or doing homework, as well as I live in NZ so I would need times that work around that. \n\nThanks for considering,\nDramaticChicken\n\nOP.GG: https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=DramaticChicken\nChampion Mastery Points: https://championmasterylookup.derpthemeus.com/summoner?summoner=DramaticChicken&amp;region=OCE","replies":[{"poster":"whosupsmewin","date":"2019-02-25T21:32:38.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me: whosupsmewin\nFriendly player:)\nMain AD","replies":[{"poster":"DramaticChicken","date":"2019-02-26T03:28:42.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok :)","replies":[]}]}]}
