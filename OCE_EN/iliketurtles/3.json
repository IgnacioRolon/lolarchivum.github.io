Ignoring it I went adc vayne. Before minions spawned I said to our jgler rengar, where is jarvan going, is he my supp?. Jarvan answered with nope so after the leash I went to laning phase. That was when jarvan started taking my minions. I wrote &quot;dude&quot; in the chat but he ignored me and continued on. he used his abilities and autos to take as much farm as possible (he also had ad runes and went atk dmg). After a hellish laning phase, somewhere around the 15-20 minute mark, I said in all chat to report jarvan as the experience I was having was very unpleasant. Jarvan told me to stop feeding(2/5 at the time). I said he was the one that got me behind. Our top laner nasus told us to just play. After another teamfight lost, I escaped alive (not much I could do without a botrk completed at 20 minutes). Nasus said he agreed with jarvan and told me to stop feeding and to stop being completely useless. I said jarvan got me behind and he said that if I wasn&#039;t so bad, I could easily take the cs. Jarvan joined in saying that I sucked at csing and that was the reason he was not supporting me (but mate if u wanted to support u wouldn&#039;t have locked in jarvan and went full ad anyways). I told him from the first cs he was already stealing it. Nasus said that I had true damage and I was a noob if I couldn&#039;t out cs jarvan. I told him true damage doesn&#039;t nessecarily mean that it has high damage. After we lost the game, jarvan and nasus said they&#039;ll report me for my uselessness and told me to enjoy my ban. To that I replied that jarvan got me behind and he was going full ad (vayne isn&#039;t full ad, she needs atk speed as well). Nasus then said I did so little damage and I said that&#039;s to be expected for a vayne who completes a botrk at 23 minutes. Then came a barrage of verbal harassments and then they left. I am 99 percent sure they were a duo\r\n\r\nFrom champ select jarvan has never intended to play a proper game (nor notified anyone) and his duo nasus also helped him to verbally harass me. If it was a troll game once in a while, I would let it go but I just think this behaviour is unacceptable. Ruins the fun in a game. Is there any way to get riot to notice this kind of behaviour?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-30T06:49:50.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets face it the top mid adc calls at the start of game is bs yer I joined the room first ad typed mid the fastest there is no rule starting this is how you get your lane if you wont to insta lock go for it \nas for the cs its cs no rule saying that the adc gets the cs \nand before you come and say some shit like well theses are community rules community rules are not rules \ndon't misunderstand me I hate the insta locking as much as the next player but riot cant do shit about it \nand as for cs yep well the jg just stole 1 cs im reporting him \nso stop posting stuff like this on the boards as riot cant do anything about it no one can your just here so you get attention \nso mark me down I don't care as lets face it your post is worthless to the boards","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2015-09-30T11:19:25.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I never said I had a nunu in my game. If you could read then you'd notice that truegolddigger mentioned about a nunu in his games. Sorry to break it to ya pal, but I am not him. Second of all, I didn't write this post because he only just took my cs. He took my cs and left me in a 1v2 lane and started harassing me for not doing much in fights.
