I suddenly spike and lag (at random points of the game, usually only once each per game) up to 13000 ping and from the point of which it starts lagging, I can move or use anything, if im auto atking a minion it continues to auto atk like I am not controlling my champion. The game disconnects frequently when the spikes occur even though the characters still move for a little while after the disconnect (like 30 seconds people are still battling but the spells animations dont cast) Every game some guy takes advantage of me and that&#039;s how I lost my most recent game and all of my recent losses. How do I win a game if im 0/3 with 10 cs and I disconnect and walk back to base whenever there are minions at my tower. This is stupid cause after I finish lagging it goes back to my original and usual ping WHICH IS 26. Last time I posted of a champion select lag/bug and one the help and support people told me to turn off my firewall of which I did. Really frustrated and waiting for a reply, not playing until I do\n\nedit: And this is ranked btw riot, I already went from one win in my promotion to 3lp because of the lag tilted me off the face of the earth, went on a winning streak and got promoted later but even in 70 percent of my winning games I was disconnecting and lagging for long periods of time although I get lucky as it was in the jg","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-25T10:42:31.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis sounds like packet loss to me, could you do the following.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.

When I started spiking this game, it immediately stopped all movement, abilities and resistance and the attempting to reconnect thingy was shown for a few seconds. Then after I died, respawned and continued to rek their mid laner, I started spiking in the mid game (started around 18 minutes or so. The spiking usually ranged from 200-700 with it occasionally going up to 1400 and going down to 110 for a brief moment. This continued on (wrote desperately in chat before when it spiked to not fight) until my team set up a good teamfight and I cleaned up the enemies. The spiking has gotten consistent whereas before it only spiked to 10000-14000 once and disconnected before leaving me in peace the whole game (sometimes at bad moments destroying my game).\n\nJust to clarify, I have no other programs running whenever I play league and always turn the wifi off my other devices whenever I start the game","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-26T08:59:06.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">and always turn the wifi off my other devices whenever I start the game\n\nDoes that mean you're playing from a wireless connection yourself?\n\nCould you try switching to a wired connection for me and letting me know if that helps at all.\n\nFrom your MTR results I also see you're experiencing some packet loss on the way to the Riot servers, this appears to be originating from your ISP as such you'll need to contact them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-26T02:22:29.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://pastebin.com/TGfDm6Yj\nThis is my WinMTR results\nhttp://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=43ca253f-32394-40300cc2-2c28-4d1a-83e9\nI think this is how u link the ICSI results not sure","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-26T01:23:20.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K I got it again, this time to 14000 (14302 to be exact) ping.
