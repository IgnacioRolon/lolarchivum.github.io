At first I was astounded as he kinda sucked (no offense to him) and he stayed bronze the whole time (as far as I can remember). His summoner name is Naruto78k and I would like it if riot gave responded with proof that he was scripting not just an email saying &quot;you did use scripts&quot;. And for all the people in the comments who are gunna reply that im just trying to relieve the ban, I smurfed in bronze and although some players said I was using scripts, (happened when I was playing kat against a yasuo one time) nothing happened (and I played a decent, good amount on my smurf). The problem is, I know he isn&#039;t really good and its kinda stupid you rioters banned a bronzie like him instead of focusing on people who actually use scripts (you should check more reports in bronze as refer to scripts of anyone who outplays or beats them). I don&#039;t know much concerning this topic but I do know that he isn&#039;t scripting.

It gives you no sense of achievement.

Even programs that people use to say apply map skins or the like can contain disallowed features, and thus will trigger an immediate ban, regardless of whether said feature was being used or not. The email with the reason for the ban usually says something along the lines of \"Banned for using scripts, hacks, cheats or third party programs\" or something to that effect.\n\nThere are also some things that can cause false positives, but if Support has gotten back to him confirming it then it means they have seen he is using a modified client/3rd party program/script/hack/cheat etc of some kind. If he still wishes to appeal he can send support a log of all programs running while he is playing League and they can check for false positives.","replies":[{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-03-11T09:29:43.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well yeh, any modifying (public) to the game is not allowed in league, I know that.
