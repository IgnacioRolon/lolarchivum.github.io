I think the ingame colours don&#039;t suit kassadin (much too light). Don&#039;t get me wrong, I think the animations look incredible but I think riot should change the colours of the skin to look more like the splash art (ya know, purply and stuff unlike the light blue on the skin atm). The animations may fit the light blue colour but at least change the colour of the body (like leave the thingy on his arm and waist down the way it is) to make it look at bit more like the splash art (and when u compare the gold from the splash to the ingame skin the ingame gold colour looks way ugly). Just a suggestion, I don&#039;t want any hate comments","replies":[{"poster":"Kieshwa","date":"2015-10-01T11:56:39.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not even Oce themed, they just picked one they were already doing and threw it at us.
