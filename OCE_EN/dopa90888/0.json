( However I'm getting the players in flex que instead of soloque )\n\nEssentially I'm plat 3 solo/Duoq\n\nI got placed in Gold 5 flex que , Climbed to gold 2 ( Prior to the \"Potential fix \") , Now i'm stuck with bronze /silvers/and low golds vsing golds /plats /diamonds .\n\nQuite frankly i feel as if this isn't fair , I'd like for my current flex que ranked to be completely reset so i can use the \"potential fix \" you guys have popping up every time i log into client as i haven't been included in that\n\nI'll gladly redo my placement games , or your 11'th one that i never got ? because i climbed to 3 division before your \"potential fix \" was implemented. So when all the plats that didn't use the new que system got their average starting plat rank i was stuck with the bottom %\n\nI understand where you're coming from , Oh look another player that thinks they belong somewhere if you're good climb bla bla bla ... if possible I'd greatly appreciate it if i can get my current flex rank reset so i can play my placements again . because by the looks of things if preseason comes ima be thrown in silver ?? Now from a developmental standpoint it\ndoesn't look right if a mid plat in solo/duo que is in gold/silver ?\n\nJust had a rioter send me this from a ticket i put up ;\nhttp://imgur.com/7bnZIYJ\n\n\nQuite frankly they need to be fired or removed from their job because anyone who's actually played league for more then a year knows that ranked only soft resets and you'll be placed in a division 1-2 lower then where you're currently at .\n\n\"Focus on winning games \" however is a punch in the throat however , is this person under the impression that I'm quing up to play ranked and spend 20-60 minutes of my life to lose or something ? Having BRONZE, SILVER ,GOLD players against Gold /Platinum /Diamonds is a fucking JOKE i mean sure if i was vsing people who where in the same elo bracket i'd be fine , but with matchups that i've been given the past 10 games it's near fucking impossible to climb it's literally luck at this point , Whoever gets the lower elo players tends to lose because at 40 minutes in they're gonna do something stupid to get caught and throw the game which annoys me even more because i've wasted nearly an HOUR just to lose due to one autistic person being qued into a game he/she shouldn't even be in.","replies":[{"poster":"DOPA90888","date":"2016-11-26T06:05:37.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea they need to merge it back together and bring back Dynamic Que for OCE as an exception.","replies":[{"poster":"Griefing Account","date":"2016-11-26T06:29:33.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah , we simply don't have the population to accommodate this .
