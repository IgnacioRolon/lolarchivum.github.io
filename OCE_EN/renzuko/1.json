After that game, I got a &quot;thank you for your report and helping the league of legends community&quot; Ect. Straight after that, I got perma banned. I have been punished before however I was unaware that I would get such a punishment considering that I&#039;m a high paying customer to league. Just three days ago or so I just spent $40 for skins.. and I&#039;ve easily spent way over $1000 on my account. I am willing to accept punishment, 3 month ban or longer would be fine. \r\n\r\nHowever I&#039;ve spent money on this account every week for the past 2 and a half years, This is totally not cool.\r\nPlease just review my account, You can see in my chat logs that I did not say a lot that was offensive, I didn&#039;t even swear really. \r\nthanks, Ed....","replies":[{"poster":"God Bhunivelze","date":"2016-02-08T22:42:55.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can report riot games to The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that they blocked you from your product.

Except in extreme cases you will face a 10 game chat restriction, then a 25 game chat restriction, then a 14 day ban before receiving a perma. This should have been ample warning of the possibility of a perma ban. If this was not the case, then you should sumbit a support ticket and they will look into it for you.\n\nRiot will not remove a ban unless it was made in error. If the punishment was dealt legitimately you will not get your account back. You are however free to make a new one if you so wish, with the same conditions in place.\n\nIf you believe the ban was made in error then submit a support ticket and the support team will look into it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Renzuko","date":"2016-02-08T00:54:58.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Negativity is all around OCE, its normal for one too react to others. I don't believe in this permanent ban solution would be a fix when one is simply standing up for themselves. Therefore I don't agree with the league of legends system and neither do my friends. As Wuks said, its highly unlikely that I will be getting my account back. So I'm not going to waste my time here, Thanks for your reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-08T01:57:31.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is unfortunate, I can only really give you context on the decision. Basically it comes down to, whether it's in response to something or not, toxic is still toxic. In all likelihood the instigator was punished as well. It's not trying to stop you from standing up for yourself, but abusing someone in return doesn't really qualify. However I don't know exactly what you did so I'm not going to assume.\n\nUnfortunately that's the way it is, and the way it will stay.
