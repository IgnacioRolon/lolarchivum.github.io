My entire account that I&#039;ve spent so much time and money in, all gone because I reply to other peoples negativity too. So harsh..\r\nI do believe that I have been negative at some degree, however when you get people in your game saying. &quot;I&#039;m just gonna feed I don&#039;t care ill just go on my main&quot; and your trying to win, of course its going too upset you.

The player you are retaliating against probably *wants* to see you get upset. When you get into an argument you are just creating new problems for the other players, and the trolls will just egg you on even more. The best thing to do is just mute them and report their behavior.\n\nRiot doesn't do infinitely stacking (permanent) chat restrictions anymore. The players that get them almost always used their limited chat to continue harassing people, or moved their abuse to griefing through gameplay. It simply wasn't effective for player reform. http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/cIfEodbz/d/45xUUKxk?comment=000400000001\n\nPunishment also has 4 tiers, and are typically administered in order;\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nExcept in extreme cases such as hate speech and death threats, you'll get them one at a time in order.

That's a quick way to skip punishment tiers during a manual audit of your logs. As for what the *other* person did, they will be treated the same way you were; they will have to go through the punishment tiers and be evaluated with no liberties and leniency that you didn't get.\n\nI suggest reading this material for more information on how you are expected to behave, and how reports work;\n\nhttp://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Renzuko","date":"2016-02-08T12:05:38.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"•10 game chat restriction\n•25 game chat restriction\n•14 day account ban\n•Permanent account ban\n\nThat seems harsh to me.

I've never seen a game go from 14 day ban too a permanent ban, It got me so off guard. Its weird, the game that I was banned from, I got the chat log saying \"Thank you for helping the league community ect\" then straight after that I got the ban.\n\nNow that I know of these harsh punishments.

This to me seems like it has a negative effect! Its going to show newer players, hey this game is so toxic. I won't be playing this again type of situation and therefore making the community smaller than what it could be. That's just my thoughts though.\n\nI would like an Admin to reply too me, telling me that I won't be getting my account unlocked.

At the very least other people should take the initiative to simply mute you.

Then after the chat probation period you can be released with full chat allowances. \n\nIt's like going to prison to become a better person instead of straight to death row but of course you'll still have a record for the rest of your life. At which point if you receive a certain amount of reports again you get banned for a certain period harsher then previous times but not permanently. \n\nIt's rehabilitation!

It's like telling someone to \"get good\" or \"stop hitting yourself\". They don't want to feed, so telling them not to just adds to their frustration, and makes you sound like an ass.

It's playing smart. Something that seems to be coming off as condemned. \n\nGet good: someones terrible and should learn to play\nstop hitting yourself: someone forcing someone to hit themselves\n\n\"Get good\" is the only relative(ish) thing to this topic.

If you sound like an ass to someone they're immediately going to dismiss everything you have to say. You are better off giving advice or not saying anything at all. Again, it matters how it comes across, not what the intention was.\n\nNot grasping the dynamic of the games and limits of their champion does not = intentionally feeding. Intentionally feeding is INTENTIONAL. Playing smart isn't being condemned. Telling people in no polite terms that they are useless (which is what they hear when you say stop feeding) is not good behaviour, and comes under \"Unsportsmanlike\" if not under Verbal abuse depending on how the person has take in.\n\nIt's the feeders 'fault' for feeding sure, as much as an unintentional mistake can be, but it is the commenter's fault for being an ass about it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-09T13:40:08.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"permanently banned\" \n*closes eyes, makes guess*\n*reads chat logs*\nknew it\n\nim sure some of the really bad ones are left out arent they\nyou want a 3 month ban after a 2 week ban? yeah and after that you want a 4 month ban before perma'd right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-08T07:26:31.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You accepted the conditions of riot's eula,you broke said conditions probably more than once and are now banned.\n\nWhere is the harshness?","replies":[{"poster":"Renzuko","date":"2016-02-08T11:47:52.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Play for 3 years, Spend countless hours.

The answer of \"but they were wrong first so it's ok\" doesn't work. If the toxic behaviour was coming from the other team, then switch off your all chat yourself while in the game so you don't have the temptation to respond.
