These guys could be one team (A FIXED, unchangable team - headhunter skins given temporarily like in Nemesis Draft - but without the RP cost)\n\nWe also have a number of &#039;operative&#039; type skins on other champions - Commando skins, Special Ops, Omega Squad, etc.\n\nWell, my idea isnt just listing skins - my idea is to have a &#039;Hunt&#039; game mode where the Headhunters face off against a random selection of 5 champs with these operative skins. It would become something like the movie Predators where a bunch of specialist people from around the world are dropped into a predator hunting ground.\n\nIn my opinion - people are too familiar with Summoners Rift - and so for the sake of Hunting and such, i propose making Twisted Tree line the Hunting Ground for this mode.\n\nThe &#039;Hunters&#039; i.e the Head Hunters Team could get a slight advantage (Maybe level advantage or Hunting Ground Buffs?) - especially as they would have a handicap of 1-2 less players as opposed to the team they VS. Towers would (if possible) be removed and the aim is to play an &#039;elimination&#039; style or &#039;juggernaut&#039; style game.\n\nWell - there you have it, its nothing fancy, just a little idea i had while at work.\n\nI dont expect anything will come of it, but i just wanted to voice my idea!\n\nWho knows, maybe the experience and opinionated community could flash it out more fully if they so desired - or smash it to pieces too - i dont mind :)\n\nTake care!\n\nPotential List of 'Hunted' Champions/Skins\nCommando Galio {{champion:3}} \nCommando Jarvan {{champion:59}} \nSpecial Forces Gangplank {{champion:41}} \nCommando Garen {{champion:86}} \nHired Gun/Mafia Graves {{champion:104}} \nInfiltrator Irelia (?) {{champion:39}} \nMafia Jinx {{champion:222}} \nMercenary Katarina {{champion:55}} \nArctic Ops Kennen {{champion:85}} \nHired Gun Lucian {{champion:236}} \nCommando Lux {{champion:99}} \nSecret Agent/Mafia Miss Fortune {{champion:21}} \nRecon/Omega Squad Teemo {{champion:17}} \nGuerilla Tristana {{champion:18}} \nGangster Twitch {{champion:29}} \nArctic Ops Varus {{champion:110}} \nCommando/Secret Agent Xin Shao {{champion:5}} \n","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-27T04:55:54.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, Nemesis Draft gave you skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-27T05:05:12.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could purchase a battle boost using RP to get a bonus of 200IP (100IP for team mates) and unlock all skins (for entire team) for the champ you got for one game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-27T05:40:18.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea what you're talking about lol.

Just take a look at what happened with Hexakill: TT, it was overcrowded.
