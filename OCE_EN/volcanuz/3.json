Just one freaking change. Give him a better passive. Right there BANG you have a better champion. \r\n\r\nHis passive is absolutly useless. You rely on killing a minion in a trade to actually get something out of his passive. Once you kill a champion you get a speed buff sure, but compare it to Jinx who has a similar passive,  she gets MOVE SPEED AND ATTACK SPEED. We get a little bit of attack speed  and thats it. And the attack speed after killing a minion is so quickly fading by the time you get in range for a trade its gone. Sure you can walk up to the low minion then auto in for the trade but that gives your positioning away and they can see a  trade coming from a mile away (unless stupid, blind or a moron.)\r\n\r\nGive us something better than this passive, anything, some thing new at least! You perfected the passive with jinx, now give us a new one for Varus. \r\n\r\n/rantover\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry it just annoys me that a champion i love so much is so lackluster due to his passive, just one change and he becomes viable again. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-12-07T01:14:44.611+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito should make his passive like a 3 hit Armour penetration kind of thing it would have great synergy with his w and give him the penetration he needs for his q","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-07T17:45:26.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pen would be good i guess.

But AP would be better for him. The hybrid build he has now is just godlike with these new changes.\n\nAlso i agree that on his passive would make him so much better. I am all for armor pen inbuilt on him. The problem is when he also builds pen items with it. I guess they would just be worried to make such a strong change on him.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-06T16:24:15.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yawn, its late at night (3pm)...we have a patch coming up in a couple of hours.\n\nAlright, just for you, how about we change Varus's passive to also scale with bonus attack speed?

So if anything it is a VERY VERY minor change which should of been done on his fucking release but were to lazy to actually give him anything on his release years ago.\n\nHis passive is still a stinking carcass of what Jinx's passive is, and will still not be relevant until they give him a new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-07T12:52:28.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You lose one second of the passive proc on champions in return for a 2 second increase time in proc on minion kills and also gain bonus attack speed on each proc and its a nerf?

Tried it on live. Still isn't enough to make him relevant. Trust me man i LOVE varus he was the first ADC after release of Kog and twitch that made me happy kit wise and playstyle wise. \n\nThis change does affect him sure, but it only helps with his clear in mid and late as you said. Though getting a kill does really change the whole fight dynamic i have to agree for late. But his late was always good enough really, when you can hit a Q and do more than half health on a ADC who has a GA your late is already perfectly fine. I just think, and im not the only one when it comes to varus, that his passive should be either swapped around with his W or he just needs a new passive from word go. It just doesn't match his personality as a champion to have this attack speed boost on kill only.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-07T20:47:51.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that would be awesome if his passive was his W, and give him a different W.
