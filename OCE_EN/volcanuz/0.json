His also good at keeping supp and ADC out of lane as his dots and damage hurt a lot after first item.

Before 6 you won't be able to stop a good Lee Sin gank. His kit is just too selfish, to be considered a real alternative for other supports, in higher elo play.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-27T12:19:34.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't care what role teemo is in...\nteemo must die\nLOL\n\nJking\nas long as u can win the game, don't worry about what other's say\nsome people are too constrained by the standard formation, as in who should do what\ni was playing with AD Soraka once (still supporting at the same time tho\nand people freak the fk out lol\nbut during that match i did more dmg over all then the jger who started calling me noob\nand me and my ADC had most kill over all, ofcoz we won the game\nso yah, good fun slap faces some time\nnot saying AD Soraka is a good build to play with\nbut it sure is a interesting change to the standard formation\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-27T07:17:00.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I would like to see a Teemo stop get Darius off of his adc.

His shrooms if used right can win you so many fights it isn't even funny.

You won the team fight just with that.\n\nOk so dealing with a bronzy, so ill spell it out for you.  Ready? Here is the super secret reason Teemo sucks as a support.\n\n\nHe has 0 peel, no sustain and no way to lock down the enemy. Lets use Leona, Braum and Soraka as our standard support and compare them to teemo.\n\n\nLeona has the ability to lock down a whole team ( but much more likely 2-3 people), has relatively high damage at low levels on low Cd, her W gives her free tank stats and her E lets her get to the back line with relative ease and her passive means that each time at opponent is hit after an ability is used on them they take extra damage. For simplicity sake lets say its flat 100 true damage at all levels. That means shes dealing at least 300 extra damage to 4 opponents if she got them in a full spell rotation  as he Q is a single stun.\n\nBraum's passive means that as long as he can land an AA or Q his team can get a stun off, while not as reliable as Leona for stuns its still nice to have. His W is free tanks stats for him and an ally and his E makes the First projectile used against it useless and everything after that dealing only 1/2 damage to him alone, effectively shutting down an adc and  most  AP casters . His Ult Is also great for either engage or disengage depending on what you need it for.\n\nWhile my knowledge on Soraka is less then Braum and Leona as i prefer tanks I still know enough about her for this. Her passive lets he get to allies with a 70% ms boost when they are below 40% hp and her passive also lets her cast all her abilities, despite having a cast time without interrupting her moment. Her Q is an amazing Heal that almost requires you to take ignite if your in a lane against her and her W is a AOE silence that shuts down AP casters, assassin and adc's like Lucian who rely on spells to do most of their damage and her ult is a team heal.\n\nNow that we have the standard supports out of the way lets look at teemo.\nTeemos attack range is 500, that puts him on the same AA range as Lucian, kog and sivir. His Q is only 580 meaning that if the opponet is playing a support like Leona or an adc like Ashe or Cait you have to expose your self. At max rank his Q has a 2.5 sec blind duration and is on a 8 second cool down but unlike Quinns blind you can still see, only your AA don't hit your vision is not reduced. His E does give him but if your not laning against a Lucian, Sivir( who can spell shield blinding dart) or Kog with Bio arcane down then your not getting any damage for free and ill most likely come out negative. As for his Ult it does good damage to squishy targets and have a decent slow however they take 1 second to prime so its no guaranteed it will even pop as that's more then enough time to move away from it, especially if they are playing a high mobility ADC. He also doesn't really bring that much if he or the team is behind as he is Item dependent for his damage and his Q only works on one person so what do you do if the enemy has a Zed and a Yi. \n\nIs that enough for you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Servant Rider","date":"2016-02-18T16:47:36.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Volcanuz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=igzE6AjE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-14T17:49:39.857+0000)\n>\n> So blinds stop working in a team fight.
