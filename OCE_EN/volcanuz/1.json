Because from that position you can&#039;t carry. Flat out. This is why people hate the role.\r\n\r\nAll you can do with a support based champion in the role is hope someone on your team have enough skill to carry so that you can aid in their ability to carry and make it easier. So if you don&#039;t have someone on your team who can be even a little over average in that department you become useless. \r\n\r\nThis is why we are seeing so many mages/damage supports lately as now even  the ADC role lacks early damage more than ever which makes it even worse for the support role. People play damage because at least they can DO something or carry if the team is brain dead. \r\n\r\nI would LOVE to play lulu, Sona, Soraka or others in games but unless i know someone on my team can carry i know its a lost cause so i have to pick brand or lux. The only way you can make support more fun is if you some how don&#039;t need a certain type of support champ to be played. Making more champs that fit the support role would help too. ATM there are only a select few which are viable even in mid/high ELO.\r\n\r\n/rant over","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-27T20:45:46.700+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk.

Then his effectiveness goes down massively. So if your team is losing early you will definitely lose as thresh and be unable to carry.\n\nBlitz relies heavily on the enemy team not understanding his pull mechanics or just being plain dumb. He can also be shut down in the early game by correct champion picks. \n\nJanna can certainly help a bad team. But she has limits as to how bad your team can be. A smart enemy will just poke your lane down or out number you, as she has no abilities to stop you pushing a tower down or help wave clear(unless you max Q over E). Janna works more with an aggressive ADC also and doesn't exactly carry. \n\nCarrying in this game isn't just \"helping a little\" it is flat out being the MVP of the team. Unless you can flat out shut down 2 or more champions over and over to the point they are no longer valid in the match you aren't carrying. If you can't push towers or initiate winning fights you aren't carrying. \n\nI think you and others here have got the whole term carrying mixed up with \"helping someone carry\". \n\n\nI was never saying Support is useless.

If your team don't do that how can you carry as support with 4 people against you and 1 horrible ADC who can't even CS with ezreal while under tower. \n\nMy whole argument is that the perceived supports which heal or only tank can't really CARRY the team and by that i mean do the damage and push the lanes which are needed. Support isn't built to push towers (or at least most aren't) and can't exactly get a quad or penta. Unless your team are some what awake it is HORRIBLE to be in the shoes of a support.\n\nMy issue with support isn't that they CAN'T carry it is that they can't 100% carry the game which makes a loss as support even more tilting than any other role. \n\nA support alone can't hold off the tide of fed champs, you can't just appear top and support him because he is losing lane, you can kind of roam to mid if he needs help. If jungle is getting counter jungled you can only hope your ward is enough to help him see the invade. \n\nOverall a support can only boost one or two players or maybe initiate a fight but if your team are already in /ff mode or just are apes when working together you CAN'T carry the game as support unless you are a damage based support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-01-27T23:40:06.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I think Lulu, Sona, and Soraka don't feel very satisfying when you do well. \n\nBut if you're looking for a \"carry\" experience on those champions, you're not doing it right.

The only who does impact other lanes with their carrying is jungle. \n\nSupport can't exactly carry, but in some form apply a boost to allow another to carry. So unless your team or at least one person in your team can use the kit and help you apply to the game to become a carry, you aren't exactly carrying.\n\nCase in point, you play Alister or naut, you roam to mid because you might see potential for them to carry. You do your combo and stun lock the enemy, your mid laner doesn't act or act well enough on your boon. You in that moment are trying to carry but aren't as you can't 100% finish that target.\n\nMy major gripe with support is the fact you are looked at as someone who can HELP. But not confirm or kill on your HELP. If you go full power on someone you are yelled at for kill stealing, if you miss a skillshot you are trashed by your team. If you ask for help  they tell you that you are the help. Overall you are a position who has a lot on your shoulders yet people act like you do little or nothing until they are losing then you are everything to blame. And as someone who went from Support to main ADC last season i fully understand the attitude of low ELO supports towards their team and adc. Jumping on this account has shown me how stressful it is to be a support main bronze-low gold, it is the life of living on the edge of pure madness and i can't understand in the current meta how even high ELO supports can maintain their cool. \n\nI just think they need to make more satisfying support champions which aren't pure damage or more tied to another role (for instance teemo, which i love playing as support but people scream at me for doing it even if it am giving the kills to my team). Give me more supports with cool abilities or quirky playstyles. Give me more items that make me feel like i am making an impact on the fight or my team! \n\nRight now i feel like i can't carry and all i am is a designated totem pole trying to affect the match and majority looked at as a moving trinket to ward or deward for my team.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-29T01:10:52.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might I suggest, {{champion:26}} Support, build him full ap going frostqueens, getting lost chapter then sightstone and the morrellos and boots.
