Or just south of it a little. Good twitches like my self will start stealth around there if the lane is half way pushed, or ward his bush closest to tower, most will run back and start stealth, so it looks like they are backing or running back for something but they are actually stealthing so you best back and prepare. Most twitch players don't put more than one point into Q so if you just move back for a tick it will fade by the time he gets close or past his minions then you just grab him and mess his day up. \n\nAlso just knowing that he can appear at any time is smart to remember.. After all he is an assassin ADC. TBH i would actually mark him as an assassin before ADC though they consider primary assassins melee over range.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
