It started with lag spikes eventually into the game just NOT wanting to load at all once we get out of character select and into load.\n\nI have no clue how or why this is happening and every other game and program on my computer seems unaffected. \n\nFrame drop: I get this one a lot, running around 300fps-100fps then all a sudden the whole game freezes when nothing is happening and when things are happening.\n\nLag spikes: So random it isn&#039;t funny. But happens more when  i play in the AM from 11pm - 10am. NO one elses computers are on, only mine, only program running is LoL client so nothing downloading.\n\nLoad screen crash/not loading: Some times i will be in load with everyone else, i load first most the time to 100% and someone isn&#039;t loading at all 0% then once they reach 100% my game doesnt load in. I then have to close the game and reload, this is where it gets real annoying, either i get a black screen or grey and it says not responding, or when i click it makes a dong sound. I then have to close and reconnect again SEVERAL times before it finally registers. Some times this process can take up to FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.  \nI&#039;ve also had it happen after crashes normally made in the game which make it ten times harder to get in game before it counts me as an AFK.\n\nFreezes: Game will just freeze and not let me even Ctrl + Alt + Delete. Or Alt +F4. It just crashes. TS or other VOIPS still work but nothing else responds forcing me to reset my whole computer. This happens a lot randomly after just pressing a ability so it can get me killed and of course cause me to seem AFK. \n\nThis is really pissing me off as it happens a lot in my ranked games making me/the team lose the game and it has now put me into the low priority que for 5 games due to this stupid problem. \n\nPLEASE HELP BEFORE I QUIT THE GAME AGAIN!\n\n\nEDIT: Repaired game and it did nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"SqueakierEel","date":"2016-03-05T17:57:02.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Volcanuz\n\nFrom the sounds of things there is a good chance this isnt a LoL related problem, have you tried or experienced this in any other games if not i suggest you give it a shot.\n\n* Make sure your antivirus is up to date and run a full system scan.\n\n* Make sure your graphics card drivers are up to date and that it is getting enough ventilation.\n\n* If you are using wireless, try using a Ethernet cable and see how it goes, also make sure to keep your wireless/Ethernet port drivers up to date.\n\n* If all else fails and you are still having difficulties the best thing to do is back up your documents and do a full format and a fresh install of windows.\n\nHope this helps, GL on the rift","replies":[]}]}
