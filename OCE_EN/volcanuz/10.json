Sure of course what is not to hate, you put in your favorite roles you get excited, get in a game and WHAM you are support. Or you get your role, someone leaves lobby then you get Support next pop. \r\n\r\nWell i have some ideas i think would help make this a lot less irritating. As i understand why we get it and that its to lower que times.\r\n\r\n1. Make it so if this game is the last one before getting deranked, you aren&#039;t forced any roles you haven&#039;t selected- Much like with promo matches you aren&#039;t forced to play a role you have zero clue how to play. This would also help decrease the level of tilt when you actually do lose the game.\r\n\r\n2. Add a selection method where you don&#039;t ever get auto but you have a longer que time to find your role. \r\n\r\n3. Make auto-filled games impact your LP loss by half or 3/4 as long as it can tell you are trying (maybe tie it into the mastery score system? A and higher = less for a loss?).\r\n\r\nThere are many other ideas others have said over the time its been in the game. I just think some times it is silly getting auto when its important you play a role you know. Like my first example.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-01-29T07:06:25.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could just deal with it. pick order used to be a thing and if you were last unless there was a dedicated support main on the team, you would get support if you were last pick. Playing different roles helps you learnt he game more as well.","replies":[]}]}
