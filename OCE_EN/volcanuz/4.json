Bronze and silver mentality is to just all out fight constantly and this dynamic he has need to either be explained to them or just avoided at all cost.\r\n\r\nI very rarely see people win when Nasus is picked on their side or even my own. And as much as i love the champ i know for a fact it is due to peoples expectation and thoughts on how the game is meant to work in their small brains. \r\n\r\nAlso please... PLEASE don&#039;t use your Wither BEFORE the jungler/mid ganker gets to your lane, for crying out loud bait them don&#039;t initiate the fight. You lose so much by poping this early. Just don&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-11-02T08:50:54.204+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Volcanuz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=FthNy0nT,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-02T07:13:38.395+0000)\n>\n> I am putting this here as it has to do with the behavior of players in silver and below. \n> \n> Please just don&amp;#039;t pick Nasus, people don&amp;#039;t understand how it works as a top laner and expect him to join  team fights early.

People in bronze and silver think you have to constantly team fight from 15mins on. \n\nI understand how to play nasus i mained him in season 4 on my top account. \n\nThe real issue is people at the rank this account is at expect him to come down instantly to join and that isn't how he works. The best way to utilize him is let him push while you distract or defend as 4 in mid or bot, wait for them to split up then take advantage. \n\nThough i agree nasus players in lower elo should come down, he is a potent team fighter at times even with just 180 stacks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-03T05:05:54.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People still play Nasus? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-11-15T11:36:40.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly yes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-11-03T04:56:56.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I don't think Nasus has to join every single fight. There is nothing more frustrating than having a Nasus afk farm in top lane while the enemy team uses there 5v4 advantage to clean up every other objective on the map. \n\nIt's fine if you spend time farming and building up stacks but you need to use those to affect the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-11-15T11:38:36.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much what i was saying really. \n\nMost people JUST farm stack. I even had a nasus TP bot to help.. well so we though, first thing he did was Q a minion then drop E on minons... Then ran back top after 4 more Q's on minion.. didnt even W a enemy.\n\nIm all good for you getting stacks but for crying out loud come down and use your 400 SS stacks.","replies":[]}]}]}
