Or if they do, they always change their mind after I carry them with a 20/3 score.\n\nSometimes these instalockers are one-tricks. Trust me, if you get a one-trick playing their champion (even if it is {{champion:266}}  Support) on your team, chances are they know how to play that champion better than you can yours (unless you're a one-trick as well - in which case don't complain about instalockers).","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-01T03:10:52.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:157}} \"dw im m7, ill carry\" http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/925/494/218.png_large","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-31T12:25:35.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there \n\nWhile no one likes an instalocker and it's generally thought to be a dick move, quickly selecting a champion and locking in your decision isn't explicitly against the summoners code.

So interrupting that, is actually disturbing the game.\n\nSo to put in plainly: instalocking doesn't affect the game's ability to be played, (you can still have an ADC, a Supp, a Tank, a Fighter and a Mage, all in their correct lanes with correct spells) it just means that not all of you will be happy about it.\nWhile dodging does affect the game's ability to be played, essentially no-one can play the game that is dodged, and all the strategy contrived in champ-select is lost.

I am 5/22. But this is fine, right, because Yasuo got his lane and is now 4/7.\n\nFlawed logic is flawed.\n\nIf we're allowed to just instalock, who cares calling a lane now. idc about my teammates.\n\nJust gonna instalock every game. Thanks for the advice!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-01T10:56:43.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. There shouldn't BE a role you cannot play, you should have a main role or two, and then be at least capable of not feeding in the rest.\nSo that situation (being forced into a role you cannot play) cant happen if you're playing the game properly.\n\n2. Even if you do feed, youre only ruining the game for 5 people, if you dodge you're ruining it for 9.\n\n3. You're assuming this happens every champ-select, which it blatantly doesn't. Sometimes you can get unlucky and have instalockers for a few games in a row, but that rarely happens, and if it does, bad luck. \n\n4. You're assuming everyone would instalock if given the chance. Most people are actually quite considerate in champ select, and many non-instalockers will happily switch lanes with you if you ask them nicely.\n\n5. Thats true, Theres nothing stopping you from instalocking, but theres also nothing stopping you from smearing jam all over your face and running around the street yelling insults in Klingon at birds. So if you do something just because theres no rule stopping you... then i guess you've got a long list of stupid things to be doing...\n\n6. Theres basically no difference between 'instalocking' and 'dodging every time you don't get your role', both is a show of terrible sportsmanship. \n\n______\n\nSo if you want some real advice: Stop looking at others, start looking inward, the problem isn't that other people are instalocking. The problem is that you cant play properly unless you get your specific role. So eliminate the problem and start learning other roles.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-31T12:55:52.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"yeah .... its riot games what do you expect....","replies":[]}]}
