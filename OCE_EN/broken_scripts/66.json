He gets free damage from stacks, but is still more of a bruiser like darius or garen since he doesn't actually have much 'tank' synergy compared to someone like malphite, sion, nautilus, rammus, moakai, trundle or sej, so compared to true tanks he's rather easy to cut down so long as he can't get close. Secondly he lacks much cc aside from wither and bopping enemies with his q, so he cannot peel nor engage a teamfight, which makes him quite a selfish pick and useless whilst behind.\n\nSimilarly, with the correct picks and the right amount of peel, against a semi competent team, even the most stacked nasus in history will struggle. Nasus is very weak to ranged lockdown, having a notable but rare weakness in the form of Zilean. Zilean's sheer amount of cc, 2 ranged 5s 99% slows (the longest and strongest slow in the game), 1s stun, and a rotation that only leaves 0.5s without some form of debilitating movement impairment. Nasus's wither ramps up from a 40-99% slow over 4.5s, but Zilean will have you slowed by 99% or stunned for a total of 11s, more than enough time for an adc to standstill and easily Bork your ass.\n\nNasus is definitely strong right now, since Riot has implemented many options to allow nasus to play more passively, earning gold through methods such as klepto or support items and keeping him in lane with sustain options such as revitalise and bone plating so that he may rush his cdr and mana so that he can resume stacking and make up for lost time. Nasus isn't innately strong though, it's just riot has made a nice little bubble which makes him infuriating to face, since it's much harder to punish nasus due to runes and toplaner bruisers who are supposed to counter him are in such a bad state atm.\n\nThe issue isn't nasus, the issue is the state of toplane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-27T18:15:16.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Early game","replies":[]}]}
