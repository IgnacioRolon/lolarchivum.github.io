It is my third most played role &ndash; mid &gt; ADC &gt; top &ndash; and I think that makes me somewhat knowledgeable. I desired to learn every role, as everyone should, as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAt first, I assumed the problem as myself. I am an aggressive player. I like to be aggressive and playing defensive unnerves me for some odd reason. So, I assumed that this issue was my own fault, but watching countless games, observing the players in my games when I am not playing top, and watching pro players, I have come to the conclusion that top lane is nothing but a farming simulator that only spikes in interest when the jungler comes around.\r\nThere is no aggression in the lane where aggression makes sense.\r\n\r\nDespite it all, if you do start trading, champions have some kind of innate heal or healing ability to heal it all back. Nasus, Garen, Vlad&hellip; The list goes on and on and on and on.\r\n\r\nWhy bother queueing for top lane? You make zero impact on the game and the jungler coming to gank you is a waste of time, really. After that gank, the lane will, once again, revert to a farming simulator where no one does anything.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-07T11:43:32.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah top lane is horrid, and the balance team doesn't know how to deal with it, which is why they keep putting off trying to balance it (we've been due a top lane change for like 2 years or something stupid, and juggernaut's was like 3+ years ago.)","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-08T02:11:52.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They don't know how to deal with it because they don't play top. All they have to do is to allow split push meta to come back. No one cares about this juggernaut bullcrap no one plays them competitively because they just get kited to no end by broken ass marksmen who can pretty much melt them in 3 seconds. If they're gonna make top laners useless in fights (literally just fodder for the adc) then let them split push and have a chance to shine. But splitpushing has been hard since the mobility creep and tanks pretty much shitting on anyone top lane 1v1 if their name isn't fiora or gangplank.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T03:24:56.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, the reason they don't know how to deal with top lane is because they have the game knowledge of bronze players, and you can tell that easily by the fact that nearly every High ELO player (and even a lot of low elo players) call out the shitty changes before they come out, yet these designers can never see the flaws in what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-08T03:31:07.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yup, pretty much every yi main predicted the 0.1 ad increase on q and base damage buff on e which adresses none of the real issues yi mains have with yi.

Even Hashinshin whines about it. Top lane is on an island right now. And in general games are decided by what happens in the bot lane. Even if you are a fed top laner, you will lose to the fed enemy adc when your bot lane ints. Life was much better back in season 4, when a lot of champions had moments of \"brokeness\". LS likes to call it , \"the meta is balanced by having many unbalanced champions.\" Skill was more of a factor back then, and outplays more common. The current meta of farming simulator just doesn't cut it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-07T12:51:10.595+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Exactly why I'm not playing this game anymore, ruin my lane, ruin my game.","replies":[]}]}
