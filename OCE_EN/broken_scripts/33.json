I mean, this is a rediculous passive for an infinite scaling champ that hits like a truck and can tank like one as well.\n\nThen his Q. Bonus range, 20 mana, and it can take 60% of an ADC/APC&#039;s HP in one hit. Forget poor Sona, Nasus one shots her. Not to mention this is an infinitely scaling ability, meaning it gets ridiculously powerful late game. It&#039;s also an AA resetter. How fun.\n\nAnd then we have his W, the bane of his issues. Why the hell does he have an AS slow? Nasus is almost impossible for 99% of the ADC roster to fight, add in that slow and almost no ADC can touch him if he has flash and his ult. This is a 5 second MS and AS slow that has an 11s cd, no cdr, which most Nasus&#039;s buy. That&#039;s a 6CD, essentially. Hello?\n\nHis E shreds armour, as well.

But I'll still try my best to explain the buffs nonetheless.\n\nYour first mistake is calling Nasus a \"tank\". Nasus is **not** a tank, he is a Juggernaut. Quoting Riot straight from the Juggernauts Update page:\n>\"They’re League’s hulking titans who, come late game, turn into super tanky carries who’ll _pretty much_ destroy **anyone** foolish enough to get in their way.\"\n\nI bolded \"anyone\" to emphasise the fact that as a Juggernaut, Nasus is expected to be able to deal a high amount of damage to anything and everything within his range, **whether it's a carry or a tank**. Now this is where you see a problem with Nasus before the latest patch; he had no reliable way of actually dealing with frontliners. He was actually _weaker_ late game than he was mid game solely because by the time that late game came around, the enemy tanks would be able to shrug his damage like it meant nothing. When was the last time another Juggernaut like Darius failed to do damage to a tank? ~~Except when he's behind because even a blind horse could tell you that.~~ The new % shred on E means that Nasus is no longer focusing the enemy tanks like a moron while their ADC whacks him from behind, but instead does meaningful damage to them if he can't reach the backline. I know that everyone loves to quote his W when someone else mentions that he has no way of getting to his targets, but they must realise that the slow is single-target and it doesn't grant Nasus any special power to stop himself from being CCed. Unless the carry is trying to 1v1 Nasus, then in that case, they deserve to lose for trying to 1v1 a Juggernaut.\n\nAlso, I'd like to mention that you said this in another reply:\n> Nasus has no trade off for everything he gets. The only saving grace is that Nasus is a bronze stomper and anywhere above gold will hardly suffer. I feel sorry for those in bronze. Pretty much ban Nasus at this point.\n\nRiot doesn't balance the game around low elo. In fact, I don't think they could care less about Bronze-Gold, or even up to Platinum, so comparing these buffs to an elo that they weren't designed for is a little...moot? And the bit about having no trade-offs isn't right, but I think I've blabbed on enough for now.\n\nIn my _personal opinion_, the R Q buff is probably a little much, but Nasus desperately needed some % shred on his E to make sure that he functions like the late game carry he's meant to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-31T23:05:48.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Your first mistake is calling Nasus a \"tank\".\n\nIf something has over 4000 HP with enough resistances provided from deadmans and spirit visage _(among other items)_ to never be killed.\nIt pretty safely classifies as a tank! Regardless of whatever else it's supposed to be.\n\nSaying _\"oh yea, but juggernauts are supposed to kill **anyone**\"_, doesn't help the argument. That just shows how retarded the balance team at riot is, if they think its okay to have an entire class who is allowed to _\"destroy anyone in their way\"_.\n\nAlso, no one ever has shrugged late game Nasus damage off like it was nothing. Thats like saying late game Veigar is weak because Leona gets 3 hit instead of 1 hit. If a Nasus isn't doing well late game, its purely because they didn't farm Q enough.\n\nAlso comparing someone's balance to Darius is a hollow argument, seeming Darius is probably the single most fucked top laner in the game.\nRemember that Skarner is a juggernaut as well, and I don't see Skarner 3-hitting towers like Nasus, or healing to full HP with a single axe swing like Darius.\n\n> they deserve to lose for trying to 1v1 a Juggernaut.\n\nAre you saying that it's okay to have champions in the game that literally no one can kill in a fair fight?\nSeems op to me.\n\nYou say that Nasus has trouble getting to the back liners and is easy to kite?\nWith Ghost, Stormraiders and a slow that is basically a snare. a great many back line champions would disagree with you there! Especially the ones without dashes. Not to mention when he does get to the back line, he genuinely 1-2 hits them. So it **SHOULD** be hard for him to get to them.\nYes Nasus's slow is only a single target, so is Veigar's ult, but that doesn't make Veigar balanced. It means he can utterly fuck one person, instead of mildly annoy a lot of people.\n\nYes the game is not balanced around low elo.\nBut seeming [90% of players ARE low elo.](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution) \nIt causes a **lot** of problems when they make changes like this, so there are restrictions on how just much they can ignore us _(and boy do they go out of their way to push those bounds...)_\n\n\nIs Nasus the most OP champ in the game?

Because what you're asking is essentially tilting the objective balance, and replace it with arbitrary and intentional imbalance.\n\nThat's not how balance works.\n\nWhen someone gets rekt by low elo pubstompers, they need to know it's because they do not know how to deal with low elo pubstompers, and not because they're dealing with someone who's overpowered and need some check-up. There is a stark contrast between the 2.\n\nMany of the low elo pubstompers like Nasus, Garen, Yi and whatnot has been left completely unplayable in high elos because of low elo players' QQ, when they themselves are the source of the problem by being incapable of dealing with pubstompers as low elos tend to be (or more likely to be), but they blame it onto the champ, and Riot in all their wisdom catered to the QQ rather than heeding the actual balance of the game. \n\nRiot is just compensating some of that back now, in fact, we should be celebrating it. Any champ, pubstomper or not, all deserve to be competitive for who they are, that's why balance means; everyone is equal.\n\nIn this case, most Juggernauts are all victims to kiting/poking if you can't duel them, on a team level when they get fed. Just because they require strategy and/or teamplay to deal with, it doesn't make a champ OP. If a Juggernaut has actually gotten so fed he can just run into your team and start actually scoring kills, or run across 2 turrets and don't give a shit, it means you've fucked up so much beforehand so now he's able to pull this; he's allowed to win the game that he's played right in, this is called win-condition.\n\n>  If a Nasus isn't doing well late game, its purely because they didn't farm Q enough.\n\nIf a Nasus is doing well late game, it's purely because you didn't do enough to stop him from farming Q either. At least Nasus has need to farm to get to his late game and has a quota in which he must achieve to even be relevant for once in a match; all you need to do is stop or delay that from happening by merely picking a poke/mobile/ranged etc champ and he is boned. Do you think Nasus is the one having it easy here? And even if it is, do you think \"easy-ness\" has anything to do with game balance itself, ie \"easy\" champs should be balanced weak and \"hard\" champs should be balanced strong? The answer is NO for both of them.\n\n..............\n\nThere is no need to balance around low elo just because the majority of people are there. Hell, most people are there not because of that they all suck balls, but because of gating, ie there are only so many people the system allows above Gold; THAT is why most of the players are in low elo. \n\nBecause of the gigantic playerbase the low elo is, there obviously are tons of low elo players who have no issues with dealing with pubstompers, at least not to the extent of QQ'ing about them; not everyone is that guy who gets rekt by say Master Yi and writes a 3000 words angry posts about how Yi is overpowred, not even close, so why are we balancing the game around the angry vocal people who are bad at the game _even by low elo standards_ again?\n\nIt's one thing to get salty over a champ, I do that as well when I get pwned. But then some people extend it onto silly logic such as \"I think their champ is easy so they do not deserve to be good\" or some silly things like that. What about we all strive to accept our shortcomings and think \"hey even though I hate this fucking champ and all what they stand for because I just tilt and get owned by them no matter what I try, but I still think they deserve to be competitive and actually good because balance above all\". \n\nIt's not wrong to criticise a champ for being batshit crazy, or any broken aspects in the game, because obviously those exist and in great quantities, but one MUST include as many simulation, practical experience, implications and/or theorising etc before coming to that conclusion and debate with it, otherwise it's just raging. **Something has to only be QQ'ed because IT'S ACTUALLY BROKEN OP, not because you're just salty because YOU, yourself, don't know any better.** And ofc, most of the QQ'ed low elo stompers are NOT OP, which you also agree, so what makes them not deserving to be competitive?

It's not even different \"game modes\" or anything, they are flat out different \"games\" just sitting in the same genre of driving. So to use the correct analogy, you have to consult EITHER racing speed limits or domestic speed limits. And we will use the former because that's the only comparable \"game\" in this \"subgenre\", and the latter is completely invalid because that'd be like comparing completely social games like Club Penguin with League or something.\n\nAnd Yes, if you're too slow in an actual race, it's your problem. Because clearly, the speeds are opened and regulated on the racetrack as they are because someone is clearly doing better than you are which they set the bar, not you. You can't just slow the entire race to your pace just because you're slow yourself.\n\nSo yes, even going with your car speed analogy, my logic is still sound.\n\nAnd no, unless Riot is introducing different balancing policies to Normal Blinds or something (not Draft, because it's practically the same as Ranked just without season rewards and the promos) which may be debatable, maybe, otherwise if we are talking about Ranked which is the main draw of this game's competitiveness, it should and shall be balanced at an objective level, ie the high level scene. Ranked, as competitive as it is, should not be hindered by or even catered to whoever that is last on a racetrack in a competition; it just means the last guy needs to try harder next time, something everybody including the guy themselves would agree with.\n\n> _Also if someone could tell me how to actually stop Nasus from farming instead of just telling me to, that&#x27;d be great!

So he ends up getting CS anyway, and I lose out because I&#x27;m spending all my time smacking him with spells._\n\nI told you how didn't I?\n\nPoking, constant harass, ganking, lane freezing, mobility etc all makes disrupt his farming pattern, by forcing him to deal with you thus missing Q on CS, force him to panic and miss Q, or you just kill him/run him out of lane so his CS are wasted.\n\nYou also can just use someone with blinds and he won't even be able to land his Q due to missing/fumbling the attack as Q is an AA mod. Teemo and Quinn are pretty good hard counterpicks for Nasus for this reason alone, not even considering other factors.\n\nEven more easier, you can literally just out-check him early with strong lane bullies like Darius, Panth or Olaf and Nasus just never gets to play at all.\n\nThere are tons of ways to stop Nasus from getting to late game. HE HAS TO FARM MADLY TO GET THERE, all you need is use some early game strategy and stop him. Why is it Nasus's problem if you can't end the game early just because YOU don't know the know-how and able to set up a couple ganks for him?\n\nNot to mention, even if Nasus is actually fed, he's still prone to all kinds of %HP damage that's everywhere these days, not to mention the amount of CC there are in this game. He even being fed, at best runs into the team with R and Ghost on and kill 1 guy who's slowed to hell with W, ONE, and then he will be kited to oblivion and dies a dog's death. That's after all those farming and actually get into his late game, **THIS is his late game as a hypercarry, being able to guarantee a single kill in a teamfight with _maybe_ more kills, after all that farming and getting here relatively unscathed**.

It's to make an OBJECTIVE STANDARD, something a COMPETITIVE game needs.\n\nI mean, who the hell wants to be good at game competitively where it's dominated/decided by favourtism, skewed balancing, catering and fotms, and you pray to Jesus everyday to ask for your champs to not get nerfed and become a troll pick in high elo, and hoping that maybe pro scene can see more than 30 champs out of 140 this year?\n\nA competitive game needs to be BALANCED. That's why Riot needs to make it BALANCED.\n\n**I have no idea why making it intentionally unbalanced is gonna help the competitive scene, it won't. It will just make people more readily to take the blame on the game for being imbalanced as it is, than actually realising that they may be bad at the game.**\n\n**OH FUCKING WAIT**\n\nCan't you see your approach is only making a vicious cycle and down swirl into the worst? Bad player culture, AND bad game balance?\n\nBalancing the game means making it actually balanced. No one is gonna just make laws where the first rule is that people are not equal, this ain't Animal Farm \"Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others\". Many low elo pubstompers were intentionally kept weak for no reasons other than because lower elo's QQ, and Riot is finally making a move against that, GOOD!\n\nIdk about you, but a more balanced game when it comes to the competitive genre, is a better game in my eyes. I see nothing but joy in any competitive game knowing that it's at least made efforts to actually be balanced. Again, this is not to say \"fuck all lowbies\", I'm Silver 5 10LP ffs, all I'm saying is that for a competitive game to even work, it HAS TO be balanced. **There is nothing wrong with balancing at the highest standard, or try to, because that means the balance is as objective as it can get; what's wrong with that?**\n\nOnce more, I am NOT talking about that we can't voice if a champ is OP or anything. What I'm saying is that it has to be actually justified rather than just QQ it because you got pwned or that you personally find it cancerous or something. It doesn't matter, deal with it and git gud; I mean, why are you playing the game if not to enjoy for what it is and learn its intricacies? Real criticisms of aspects in the game and its balance state as I've said, must be backed up with actually valid arguments from theory, practical experience, simulation and other analysis, and not just \"fk this champ pwns noobs, NERF NERF\". We should NEVER balance aspects in a competitive game to cater to people who are not proficient in it, we need to remind them where the counterplay is, and how to deal with them and let them learn the actual game than simply call for nerfs to shape the game THEIR way.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-02T00:10:31.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't talking about racing at all.\n\nIm saying we don't tailor the road rules to suit the better drivers _(I used race car drivers as an example of a highly skilled driver, even if they aren't racing at the time)_\n\nIf we tailor the road rules to the lowest denominator; slow grannies so forth _(bronze 5)_, it is incredibly frustrating for everyone else.

I can't help but notice that neither you nor I haven't been called into Riot HQ to ask for advice on balancing, even though we represent a far greater portion of players than the pros. So if Faker gets called in and the average player doesn't how is that anything other than favouritism?\nThey also favour champs, they don't nerf Lee Sin despite him being obviously overloaded, because he's fun to play and watch, so they have more to gain by keeping him in the games.\n\nBalacing is skewed.

It's rules are designed to allow the greatest majority of people to play it. Those who are better then others win more, and if by winning more the game becomes less interesting for you, well time to find a new game.\n\nThey didn't change the rules of Rugby for Jonah Lomu. If they did, then it'd screw over all the school kids who play it in lunch time.

But you down change to rules to make them less good.\n\n\n> Balancing the game means making it actually balanced.\n\nOkay, define 'balance' for me.\nLast I checked, balance meant that things were even on both sides. So if champions are too strong for 90% of players, but just right for the pro players. How exactly is that balanced?

Why not balance the game exclusively around Faker?\nIf he loses against Azir, nerf Azir, if he wins against Braum, buff Braum.\nThen you have your utopian view of balance.\n\nThe problem with it, is that 99% of players will never be as good as Faker, most people will never even get out of silver.\nSo why balance for a game that most people will never be able to play? It's stupid.\n\nIt's great to have an objective, but the objective shouldn't be _\"Fight your way though an unbalanced game to reach the highest level, and then once you reach that, the balancing is fair.\"_ If you are good enough to reach the highest level of play, it means youre good enough to play around unbalanced champs.\nYou know who isnt good enough to play around unbalanced champs? **90% of all players!**\n\nThe _objective_ should be reaching the highest rank.\nYou do so, by playing through a game that is balanced around the majority of people, to allow the majority a chance at striving for the objective.\n\nAs it is, if you are a bronze player, you'll find it much harder to reach your objectives, because the game is so completely unbalanced for your level.

There is a big difference between the 2 notions. This is just the simple reality of pyramid hierarchy/ranking.\n\nLow elo players are not automatically trash, being the worst players and thinkers. Low elo players are merely more _**likely**_ to be be bad due to simple statistical reasons, but is by no means defined and restrained by that characteristic.\n\nLook at them stats, from lolalytics if you must, and navigate to Bronze section and check out each champ's performance?

And I've also demonstrated by there is no issue to balance the match according to the speed record of the fastest racers rather than the slowest (which they DO), because that's just how it works. And thus by the same token, competitive environments like League should be balanced at the top performers and not the worst performers.\n\n**We can have different kinds of car races, some are fast, others are faster, but 1 thing is consistent across all kinds of races: the balance, rules or the limits, as it were, are set by top performers, not the worst performers.**\n\nLogical reason for doing so?\n\nAs I've said before, because it's the most rational and logical attempt to achieve an objective standard. It's not a \"fuck you\" to the Bronzies or anything, it's just that people actually want a fair match. A fair match, fair game, objective balance, universal standards, everybody is included (yes, otherwise you will be alienating people for being good at what they do, which outside of how utterly contradictory it is to the purpose of competition, it's also just awful; and no the reverse won't be true unless you're really digging the newbie hostile environment like EVE Online which this game is nowhere near by). It's just you know, a competitive environment.\n\n..................\n..................\n..................\n\nI mean sure, the game isn't that balanced, we have a history to back this claim up, no surprises there. But Riot is trying to get some of that back now, because thank god it's not filled to the brim with money machines. And that's okay.\n\n> Not sure if this is sarcasm.. That is the game currently? (refering the favourtism in balancing)\n\nAnd you wonder why for the longest time, everybody thinks the game's balance is so atrocious, and has been a laughing stock balance-wise in all of MOBA/ARTS industry. It seem you've literally answered your own questions already.\n\nWhat's this called? **CATERING**. Riot has a track record of buffing for the worlds as you've said. But the thing is that it's no different to you promoting to balance for the low elos in ways they think the low elos need, it's both catering at its finest. **You can't reject 1 form of catering and promote the other, reject both.**\n\n> Shouldn't be _\"Fight your way though an unbalanced game to reach the highest level, and then once you reach that, the balancing is fair.\"_\n\nThis is a fallacy, because if a game is actually balanced fairly, then THERE IS NO UNBALANCE. Why would it be balanced when it isn't in the first place? On the flip side, why would a game be balanced when it isn't?\n\n..................\n..................\n..................\n\nYou may have been completely confusing game balance theory with social balancing theory. You might be purely pushing for your stance solely because you were drawing connections between balancing the game for the bronzies with setting up shelters and minimum wage for the homeless and poor. The problem is that those 2 are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT contexts.\n\nWhy, you ask? Because nobody is going hungry and shivering on the side of the road for being in the Bronze. There is no need for \"humanitarian aid\". This is why, in the context of competition in games, physical and virtual, it's entirely okay to be jungle-rules-survival-of-the-fittest-best-man-goes-last, because that's the point of sports and games, a harmless environment for good o' competition.\n\nOr you might be thinking about freebie balancing, where you might think a certain grinding mechanics is way too much for the casual players such as IP or whatever. But again, this is a completely different context, because the root of the system is not to be a race, but to be a carrot on a stick and keep the players active on the game via \"things to do\".\n\nYou can't just merge all kinds of different contexts into 1 and decide that 1 thing is not okay because it doesn't work in a completely different context. It doesn't work like that.\n\n..................\n..................\n..................\n..................\n..................\n..................\n..................\n\nI think you ultimately is just confusing \"Balancing for the highest level of play\" with \"balancing for the pro scene spectacle.\"  The former is what I preach, the latter is what Riot did and still do and I despise but is not anywhere the same as the former.\n\nSome of the recent pubstomper buffs were directed at the fact they over-nerfed many of them because of low elo QQ and is just giving some of their deserved strength back, or that many of the pubstompers have been left behind and is now receiving some love for higher elo range where they have become unplayable. I see all of this as good signs that Riot still thinks for balancing at highest level of play, ie the objective standards of the game.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with balancing the game with objective standards derived from the highest level of skill and its environment, as theory and simulation can only do so much without practicality, and obviously high elos play better and explore further into the game than lower elos so they are taken reference for the balance choices. Again, I'm not talking about the shrewd balance nerfbats they did in the past and present just because the pro scene doesn't go a certain \"visual direction\" as they'd anticipated; I'm talking about actually balancing the game, and not to be driven by some preexisting agenda, be it either \"muh pro scene\" or \"muh b5 QQ\". Riot does this sometimes, and all I'm saying is that it's a damn good thing that they do.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-02T23:52:30.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that not everyone in the 90% has a problem with Nasus, but they certainly have more problems with him than they do with champs such as Aatrox or Malphite.\n\nI personally don't even think Nasus is a big problem, I do think these changes were unwarranted, but if I had to delete a champ it certainly wouldn't be Nasus!\n\nI struggle with him in lane, but I'm usually fine in the rest of the game. \nThere are others that are the opposite.\n\n> the sole reason why low elo has the most players is not because everybody is frigging bad at the game\n\n^ This is where where our ideologies clash.\n\nThere is no golden standard, no set bar that states _\"above this is good, below this is bad\"_, which means that how good/bad you are is set by where you fall in terms of the 'average'. and the average is determined by number of players, and looking at the number spread, the average would be around mid silver, which means if you are playing at a mid silver level, you are playing as expected, you're not good or bad. If you are higher than that then you are good at the game, if you are below that, then you're not doing so well.\n\nThats how an average works.\nYou wouldn't say \"I have a bag of red balls, but 90% of them are blue.\" because you wouldn't have a bag of red balls... you'd have a bag of **blue** balls with a couple of red ones.\n\nTo reiterate: it isn't that 90% of players are bad, and 10% are where they are supposed to be. Its that 90% of players are normal and 10% are doing very well.\n\nBecause what is **normal** is determined by the majority, and the majority is certainly not in high elo.\n\n________\n\nI don't think you're seeing the point of my analogy, you're focusing on the subject (cars) and not the actual point.\nThe point is: 5% of the people are really talented, 5% are retards, 90% are average.\n\nIt's not sensible to make something for the talented players, excluding everyone else, nor is it sensible to make it for the retards, so no one else can enjoy it. The only logical option is to maximise its enjoyment by creating it to be suitable for the majority of people who will be using it.\n\nLike an aeroplane seat, an aeroplane seat fits what we see to be a 'normal' person. It is probably extremely uncomfortable for mortally obese people, likewise it is probably very uncomfortable for dwarfs. But if you made all aeroplane seats to be comfortable for dwarfs, you would sell a hell of a lot less tickets because the vast majority of the population wouldn't be satisfied with sitting on a tiny seat for 14 hours.\n\n\n> There is nothing wrong with balancing the game with objective standards derived from the highest level of skill and its environment\n\nThere** is** a problem, and the problem is; 90% of people will never ever be good enough to enjoy those standards.\nWhat the hell is the point of making something for people to enjoy if the vast majority will never enjoy it!?\n\nIts like saying _\"lets make the basketball hoop twice as high, because Kobe Bryant would be able to get those shots.\"_ Sure you're balancing it around an objective standard derived from the highest skill. But it'd be very un-enjoyable for every other basketball player on the planet, and kids who enjoy throwing a basketball around would have to give up the sport.\n\n\n________\n\nBut we may have to agree to disagree on this.\n\nI definitely believe the enjoyment of the maximum amount of players is most important, you clearly believe that the elite competitive scene is more important.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2017-08-01T15:25:42.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> If something has over 4000 HP with enough resistances provided from deadmans and spirit visage _(among other items)_ to never be killed.\n> It pretty safely classifies as a tank! Regardless of whatever else it&#x27;s supposed to be.\n\nNasus is tanky, but he's not a 'tank', not in the true sense of the word that is. Tanks are specifically meant to soak up damage and disrupt the enemy team through their CC. Nasus just deals a tonne of damage and builds tanky items to ensure that he can keep dealing his damage for longer. [This nice URL here leads to a Rioter post that explains the difference better than I ever could.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/0LLAKMum-what-separates-a-tank-from-a-juggernaut)\n\n\n> Saying _&quot;oh yea, but juggernauts are supposed to kill **anyone**&quot;_, doesn&#x27;t help the argument. That just shows how retarded the balance team at riot is, if they think its okay to have an entire class who is allowed to _&quot;destroy anyone in their way&quot;_.\n\nAs someone who absolutely loathes fighting Darius or any of his ~~goons~~ relevant Juggernaut buddies, I agree. But unfortunately, it _is_ a class in the game, and Nasus is explicitly stated to be in said class. \n\n\n> Also, no one ever has shrugged late game Nasus damage off like it was nothing. Thats like saying late game Veigar is weak because Leona gets 3 hit instead of 1 hit. If a Nasus isn&#x27;t doing well late game, its purely because they didn&#x27;t farm Q enough.\n\nThe only similarity between Veigar and Nasus is a stacking mechanic. Veigar gets bonus AP, not extra damage on a single ability (i.e. his stacks make _all_ of his abilities stronger). It's very easy to itemize against Nasus because every tank worth their salt builds HP and armour, whereas MR is a little less important as the enemy may only have one or two sources of magic damage. That being said, a Nasus with 600 stacks and TF can deal about 1000 damage pre-mitigation at level 16. That's...a little unsettling, but this is BEST CASE scenario. A tank should be able to survive about 5 seconds, not including the time in which Nasus is CCed, which is more than enough time to kill him in. And this is not even including items that the tank themselves might have like Randuins, Locket and Knight's Vow...\n\n> Also comparing someone&#x27;s balance to Darius is a hollow argument, seeming Darius is probably the single most fucked top laner in the game.\n> Remember that Skarner is a juggernaut as well, and I don&#x27;t see Skarner 3-hitting towers like Nasus, or healing to full HP with a single axe swing like Darius.\n\nTrue, but Darius does pretty much fulfil the Juggernaut fantasy, so another Juggernaut being able to compare themselves to Darius means that at least their thematic is right... And shredding towers is part of Nasus' speciality as a split-pusher/late-game damage machine. If he's specifically 3-hitting your towers, you've probably already lost the game for dragging it on too long anyway.\n\n\n> Are you saying that it&#x27;s okay to have champions in the game that literally no one can kill in a fair fight?\n> Seems op to me.\n\nYou're taking my sentence out of context. I never said \"can't be killed\", I said a _carry_ should always lose to a Juggernaut in a 1v1, even more so in a _fair_ fight. And it's not OP because the game is ~~supposed to be~~ designed around a rock-paper-scissors dynamic. Consider this: If an Assassin and an ADC of equal skill face off, shouldn't the Assassin come out on top every time? Now pretend I said \"Juggernaut\" instead of \"Assassin\" and \"some poor carry who's most likely immobile\" inste- Oh wait... (Plus, some champions are designed to thrive in 1v1s. It's not 'OP', it's their role.)\n\n\n> You say that Nasus has trouble getting to the back liners and is easy to kite?\n> With Ghost, Stormraiders and a slow that is basically a snare. a great many back line champions would disagree with you there! Especially the ones without dashes. Not to mention when he does get to the back line, he genuinely 1-2 hits them. So it **SHOULD** be hard for him to get to them.\n\nIf Nasus ever does indeed reach the backline, then it means that he either flashed, or someone was out of position. Ghost has a moderately high cooldown, so it's not fair to include it as a reliable way to get to the backline, and he needs to hit someone to actually proc Stormraiders. This is why he's not played in higher elo, because, to the pros at least, it's fairly obvious when someone like Nasus is about to Flash, and a good carry will never let themselves be caught out of position for Ghost/Wither to even matter. This new buff, I think, was meant to give Nasus a way to get to the back by brute-forcing his way. Not necessarily healthy for the game, but it's an important buff to help him stay relevant nonetheless, considering that most of the time he'd be left hitting the tanks without any reliable tools to do so. And if the % shred bothers you? _Walk outside of his Spirit Fire._\n Boom, counter-play.\n\n> Yes Nasus&#x27;s slow is only a single target, so is Veigar&#x27;s ult, but that doesn&#x27;t make Veigar balanced. It means he can utterly fuck one person, instead of mildly annoy a lot of people.\n\nA game like League of Legends will never be balanced. There will _always_ be a case where one champion is stronger than the other. As painful as Nasus' W is, he really can't do without it. He has nothing else to let him get to his target, or even stay there if he manages to walk up to them. Making it weaker will completely kill Nasus. Changing it to a gapcloser/short stun will only make him more overbearing. At least you can still Flash or use your abilities when you're slowed.\n\n\n> Is Nasus the most OP champ in the game? No, far from it.\n> Did he need these changes? No, not at all.\n\nI think that the E change was necessary. Flat armour penetration makes no sense at all for a champion who's meant to shine late game. 1.1 second Q, while gated by his ult, is probably still really powerful. I think even if it was just 2 seconds, it'd be more than generous.\n\n\n> No champion _(or class *coughjuggernautcough)_ in the game should be balanced around the premise of being &#x27;unstoppable&#x27;.\n\nI think if it's done right, it's a really cool idea. 'Unstoppable' is also a pretty subjective term. For example, I think that Zed can be quite 'unstoppable' when he appears out of nowhere, ults your carry and disappears just as quickly as you count down to your carry's death. I guess if they make the Juggernauts' weakness of being kited more prominent, then they'd be somewhat easier to deal with. ~~And honestly, why the hell does Darius have a pull AND a movement speed boost?
