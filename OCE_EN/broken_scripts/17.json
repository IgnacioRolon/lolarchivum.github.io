It&rsquo;s filled with players that will start drama and then run from it like they&rsquo;re as blond-haired woman running from a black man she had just stumbled across in the street.\r\n\r\nThey start everything and when people fight back they then hide behind their friends and promptly ask for x9 reports. Out of everything in this game, it&rsquo;s this attitude and pathetic, cowardly act that tilts me beyond all measure.\r\n\r\nFor a country that&rsquo;s meant to be tough, the online community sure do hide behind that report feature a lot. I don&rsquo;t report anyone unless they&rsquo;re sooks that beg others for reports, twisting your words so you actually get punished. This is how these cockroaches work. They bait you into frustration and you say something in retaliation and they beg for reports, crying behind their three friends in their crap pre-made group to get you banned.\r\n\r\nThese cockroaches so pathetic it has me laughing.\r\n\r\nIt has me laughing that people act so tough and well-rounded on a game, but in the end, they&rsquo;re scared little kids that talk mad trash but flee before anything really goes down.\r\n\r\nSame kids that won&rsquo;t 1v1 because it&rsquo;s a team game. Oooh, these kids make me so annoyed that Riot adheres to them and punishes the people they rile up.\r\n\r\nThese kids have no lives so they try to police an online game. These degenerates will most likely spend their entire lives flipping burgers at McDonald&rsquo;s because they have no backbone. Can&rsquo;t take any criticism.\r\n\r\nThese kids trying to get in other people&rsquo;s heads because their own is filled with nothing but sawdust because they ain&rsquo;t going to ever amount to anything besides be some useless internet police on a video game.\r\n\r\nNone of these cockroaches will catch me in a 1v1 because they scared that I will destroy them. I&rsquo;d be in the LCS but you couldn&rsquo;t pay me enough to play with such trash players.\r\n\r\nAll these kids talk tough but when you invite to a 1v1 they nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nAll that tough talk, hm, where you at now.\r\n\r\nFilthy cockroaches.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2017-02-14T08:45:49.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How good is for honor but","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-14T09:48:07.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eIdtN71o,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2017-02-14T08:45:49.252+0000)\n>\n> How good is for honor but\n\nit's alright tbh. it's good for a ubisoft game though.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-14T09:53:44.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A steezy Scizor,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eIdtN71o,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2017-02-14T09:48:07.113+0000)\n>\n> it&#x27;s alright tbh. it&#x27;s good for a ubisoft game though.\n\nYeah most of the complaints in that game seems to be about Uplay, the best online gaming platform there is.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-14T10:05:07.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eIdtN71o,comment-id=000600000000,timestamp=2017-02-14T09:53:44.659+0000)\n>\n> Yeah most of the complaints in that game seems to be about Uplay, the best online gaming platform there is.\n\nsekai m8 stick to plusposting, not shitposting. it doesn't suit you.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-14T16:44:02.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, he has a point.

And no, the system is not designed to look for players to ban but instead, it's designed more towards pardoning players and the leeway for misconduct is rather big unless 1) the offences is severe or 2) the offences are repeated constantly across many matches over some period of time.\n\n**2) **Frustration does not net you bans. People get frustrated all the time, but most of them do not get bans. For a personal anecdotes, I do not have the best senses when it comes to competitive games, and I can go into a rage in a middle of a match and just start spamming shit (usually from dealing with hostile teammates or just that I got my ass handed to me by champs I personally hate). Have I been banned? Not to my knowledge. The only punishment I've ever got/remembered from my years of on-off playing was me getting put into low priority queue once for dodging and that's about it. It's pretty clear that when one does get banned, chances are they must have done some very questionable accounts or that they are simply way too easily \"frustrated\" and also goes overboard with their \"frustration\". And if you're the latter, doesn't that make you just the same as those kids you have so many issues with, considering it's only the kids who have that much trouble staying cool and not get triggered all the god damn time? It's not like you don't have hard options to deal with them, why not just mute and/or report them later if things are really going out of hand, or you know, keep some semblance of cool even when you're raging?\n\n**3)** It's a right thing that people refuse to 1v1, because this game is NOT balanced that way. Champs are intentionally made not equal in a sense that they have different specialities and perks, and thus they contribute differently to their teams, and team vs team is how the game is balanced around, NOT player vs player. There are duelist champs that are specifically designed to win most 1v1 situations, barring being countered or getting matched up with another one of those champs, otherwise other champs outright stand no chance against them in a 1v1, however the downside is that they may have very limited team-scale presence; similarly there are champions that are just powerless against most 1v1 situations and their default response when caught within it is to flee, but they may have large presence across the map and provide much and guaranteed utility within a team vs team scenario. Do you not get it, that asking for 1v1 is just dumb?\n\n**4)** Putting up a tough act such as yourself does NOT make you tough, it only present yourself as the \"scared little kids\" you so despise. Using insults upon insults to justify your stance is even more laughable. Just no, it doesn't work and it never will.\n\n.................\n\nSure change your game, no one is out to stop you. For Honor is more 1v1 focused, yeah, but remember it's also a team game, so people will still flee from 1v1s and come around to gang up on your a lot, so have fun playing that with your current attitude. Why not just play fighting games if 1v1 is all you're looking for?\n\nBut before all of this, fix your attitude, for what's shown in the OP it's incredibly immature and childish. I'm not even an elitist when it comes to attitudes, but yours is really just bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-17T06:03:06.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember once I humoured an ezreal who was being super toxic and kept saying how sh*t we all were and how nobody on our team could 1v1 him. The game had gone on for way longer than it should have, so I had more than enough gold to sell and rebuy 6 items, even as support janna. I sold my items and built full ap burst janna, I put a tornado in the the river bush, he came I proc'd lichbane, tornado, e, lichbane, auto, auto, w and finished him off with a few more autos. He just completely lost it in chat after that, calling me a cheater. I was like 'if you can build full damage, why can't I?' and then he asked everyone to report for not 1v1ing him properly. These people who get all angry and challenge you to a 1v1 are so funny... unfortunately the enemy team probably will be looking for a kill on you and so as you can guess I died shortly after to the khazix.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-02-14T03:15:08.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't play solo?","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-14T03:16:26.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gesteppie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eIdtN71o,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-14T03:15:08.500+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t play at all\n\nftfy","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-02-14T22:46:33.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stand corrected.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-14T04:41:31.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kek gave me a few chuckles op","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-02-14T01:55:16.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\\>not preloading it like 4 days beforehand\nwhat a pleb you are.","replies":[]}]}
