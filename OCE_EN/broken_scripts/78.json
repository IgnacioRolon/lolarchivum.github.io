But, I agree. missions are personal and treating them as if they aren't is actually _really_ annoying. I mean, this isn't 2009 - 2011 when everyone had 30+ friends online at once. I no longer add people because a) they get annoying b) they ask to be carried or c) they're actually awful.\n\nThat's not even going into those that have jobs, families, or other commitments that chew time for grouping. It's hard to find groups that want to do this. It's even worse that the mission requires you to play an off-meta teamcomp that most people won't do. No ADC will turn most people off instantly.\n\nThat's not even adding onto the fact that it's in a PvP mode and means it needs to be done in normals or ranked. I wouldn't be upset if it could be done in a co-op vs ai. Better yet, let's not make premade events.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-03T10:47:35.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah what if you don't have any friends?
