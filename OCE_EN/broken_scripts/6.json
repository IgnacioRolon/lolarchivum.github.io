Her kit has so much potential to be something good, but Riot always keeps her back for some unknown reason. Maybe it&#039;s because she has the most power spikes as an assassin or because her roaming and damage are uncontested due to three dashes.\r\n\r\nHer early game is horrendous. Her damage is insanely low. No matter what, every other assassin will beat you in trades. Speaking of trades, she&#039;s pretty much gimped from when she lost the ability to proc her Q with her E. Most, if not all, champions she&#039;ll verse in the middle lane are ranged and will not just let her throw out a Q and then allow her to proc it for free.\r\n\r\n&quot;_But her W! Why won&#039;t you use your W_!&quot;\r\n\r\nPointless. Her W has an artificial delay that hinders her other abilities. You cannot W &gt; R instantly because there&#039;s some kind of ridiculous cooldown. Not only this, but it is a huge waste of energy and it removes her ability to use it defensively.\r\n\r\nThis also brings me to her R and why it has some stupid two-second cooldown after each use. This makes her late game so clunky to the point that you need to incorporate CDR into your build/runes/masteries so you&#039;re not just standing there for two seconds while you wait for your next charge. This is my biggest gripe. It works well during the early-mid game, but it fails late game and her damage suffers due to it.\r\n\r\n**How to fix her**\r\n\r\n1. Allow us to proc her Q with her R or, maybe, her E.\r\n2. Make her Q travel at the same speed as her R. This is another clunky mechanic that should have been fixed ages ago. Throwing out a Q and then using R is pointless because you hit two autos before the Q actually lands.\r\n3. Cut the movement speed from her W and make her regain energy faster while shrouded.\r\n4. This is more of a rant, but Katarina should not be able to hit stealthed targets with her ultimate. This removed any counterplay Akali has versus Katarina. The two were often equally matched, but now Katarina just destroys Akali. Shunpo &gt; Dagger &gt; Ultimate = dead stealthed Akali.\r\n5. Give her a visual makeover, please. Also, some new lines would be nice.\r\n\r\n**Assassins that beat Akali**\r\n\r\nEkko: early game, mid game, late game.\r\nEvelynn: early game, mid game.\r\nFizz: early game, mid game, late game.\r\nKassadin: early game, late game.\r\nKatarina: early game, mid game, late game.\r\nKha&#039;Zix: early game, late game.\r\nLeBlanc: early game, mid game, late game.\r\nMaster Yi: late game.\r\nNocturne*: mid game, late game.\r\nRengar: early game, late game.\r\nShaco: early game, mid game.\r\nTalon: early game, mid game, late game.\r\nZed: early game, mid game, late game.\r\n\r\n*Why is he listed as an assassin?\r\n\r\nAkali has her strengths, but other champs have them as well.\r\n\r\nEkko: better trading, damage, escape.\r\nEvelynn: bigger burst damage due to no clunky cooldowns.\r\nFizz: better trading, higher burst, better escape.\r\nKassadin: better poke, better mobility, better burst.\r\nKatarina: better trading, better mobility, resourceless, AoE damage that shuts down Akali&#039;s kit, better resets.\r\nKha&#039;Zix: better burst, better mobility.\r\nLeBlanc: better trading, higher nuke damage, better mobility.\r\nMaster Yi: lmao R + auto = everyone dead.\r\nNocturne*: -\r\nRengar: cancerous burst damage.\r\nShaco: better stealth, better burst, traps ruin her shroud.\r\nTalon: better mobility, better burst, better stealth, better roaming.\r\nZed: broken beyond all rational explanations.\r\n\r\nFix her, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-10T05:06:48.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}}  is actually really good if you know how to play her.

I agree.\n\nThe problem with Akali is the same problem Riot have had with several other champions. Buff them slightly, OP pick ban, nerf them a little, shit tier why play them.\nThe big nerf hammer from Riot came when \"Tank Akali\" was running rampant early last year.\n\nThey need to simply change her so she's not a lifesteal assassin.\nMaybe do what you say, and add regen to the shroud (while in combat) otherwise she could easily take bad trades sit under tower in shroud and heal back up.\nLet her Heal of her Q proc, but only when she busts it with her E. So she can heal for a bunch but not 3-4 times.\n\nI dunno. Like i said, if you buff her shes becomes easily broken, leave her as is, and she is in the category of \"you can play her but why\". Which i honestly think Riot consider acceptable.","replies":[]}]}
