Right before that happens he manages to get Irelia to max bleed stacks which activates his passive _and_ ensures that the very same decimate will also apply max stacks to anyone hit - the Lux. This of course is immediately chained with the max stack dunk onto Lux that gives way for a pretty crucial level up heal and the split second he needs to land the second kill. Had the Decimate missed he wouldn't have healed for as much or had an easy opening on Lux.\n\nRegardless, I can't help but wonder if Darius would have ever left the cc lock if Veig shot out his W before heading off to clear minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-15T02:02:30.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it's so bad.\n\nand in lane his bleed just makes sure that any trades are completely in his favour.\n\nStill not as broken as Lee though.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-15T03:18:46.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah unlike Lee sin, Darius's biggest flaw is being kitted easily, Lee sin on the other hand has pretty much everything in his kit so finding a way to outplay a good lee is pretty difficult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-15T03:01:14.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont let him stack passive\n\nEz pz","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-05-15T02:40:04.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean by the looks of it, he had 4 levels on you all and was extremely fed.
