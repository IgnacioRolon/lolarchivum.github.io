Who does not gank at all, takes half your jungle, one-shots people at level 11, and has like 8 assists without ever ganking a lane and 20 dark harvest stacks, as well as a 60+ cs lead on the enemy jungler.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-02-09T02:52:08.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Scripts,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=YFQyfF10,comment-id=,timestamp=2019-02-09T02:41:16.093+0000)\n\n> Where are the Urgot nerfs?

Urgot's statistically worst matchup atm is actually Yasou and Olaf.\n\nYasou because Yasou does alot of damage and can be super sticky but also hard to stick to (seems to be the trend of Urgot's bad matchups, sticky mobile champions) and that Yasou can windwall Urgot's poke or ult, and Olaf because Olaf is sticky as hell and doesn't really mind getting into a stand and fight duel with urgot, and post6, Urgot can't really do much about the angry viking.","replies":[]}]}]}
