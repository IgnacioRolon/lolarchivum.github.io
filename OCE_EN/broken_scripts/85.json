There&rsquo;ll be a link somewhere on this post that links towards the blog post as I cannot, for some odd reason, comment on the blog post.\n\nBefore I dive headfirst into this highly controversial topic, I just wanted to mention that I am an aspiring writer who has spent the past few years writing, editing, and beta reading fanfiction, as embarrassing as that is to admit. I recently moved onto writing a character for a small, unknown game and it&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air writing up lines of dialogue rather than a setting.\n\nThis is not relevant now, but it may be later on.\n\nI just wanted to give my piece on what I believe to be a sexy male, which I subjective as everyone has different opinions on what turns them on and/or off. It is rather hard for me to answer a question pertaining to this as I do not find any pixelated characters sexy, no matter what.\n\nSo, what do I find sexy or appealing?\n\nIf I was ever to sit down and design a character for League of Legends with that line in mind, I would want something unique that hasn&rsquo;t been seen before.\n\nLeague has strong men already, such as Darius, Garen, et cetera. I would focus primarily on creating someone that&rsquo;s younger and more delicate. The character would be soft-spoken, charming, open-minded, and charismatic. He wouldn&rsquo;t have a hostile personality, but he wouldn&rsquo;t be a pushover, either.\n\nIt&rsquo;s impossible to design a character without making the beginnings of a backstory to shape their personality. Where to begin, though? Where should I begin with this character? I need a name &ndash; a name that sets his personality.\n\nHow about Alaricus? Alaricus is a Latinized form of Visigothic Alaric, meaning &lsquo;all-powerful; ruler of all.&rsquo;\n\nWhile it&rsquo;s a good name, it doesn&rsquo;t fit with the theme that I mentioned before, but I never mentioned that he should be meek. Being all-powerful does not mean you have to be evil. But, and I mean this, what if we do make this charming boy evil?\n\nOr we could go with Acteon. Acteon is a Latin-based name that is a variant spelling of Actaeon, meaning &lsquo;effulgence.&rsquo;\n\nIf we push at what &lsquo;effulgence&rsquo; means, we get the following:\n\n&ldquo;Really, it&#039;s giving off blinding, radiant rays of light &mdash; what some people would call effulgence. Effulgence is brightness taken to the extreme. You may be dazzled by it, stunned by it, or even overcome by it. Usually used to refer to the sun or some other mega-star, effulgence can also be used more figuratively.&rdquo; &ndash; Google.\n\nIf we go for the latter of the names, he could be a mid-lane mage like Lux. He could be a mix of Rakan with his charm in the sense that he enthrals you with his dazzling light.\n\nWhat about the former name? Well, that could give him a ruthless streak and raw damage, like Syndra. He could be ruthless but caring. A young boy twisted by a desire to free his land from the people who killed his family.\n\nI can imagine him leading a lonely life full of tragedy. Watching his family be slain for being on the wrong &lsquo;side&rsquo;. I can watch him be bullied as a child and forced to submit to those older and stronger. I can see myself watching as he pushes himself into the unknown to become stronger so he can protect his people.\n\nA prince dethroned, but not for long.\n\nAnd then we watch silently as this young man slowly rises up and obliterates the enemy forces single-handily with power that he himself fears. We watch as he lifts up his crown and gently puts it back on his head and vows to never allow his people enslaved again.\n\nAnother faction enters the fray and Demacia and Noxus both watch with curious eyes.\n\nI have set out a groundwork for the character and now I can work on how he acts. At this stage, nothing is set in stone as his personality could change and thus so would his backstory.\n\nMaybe he did something so stupid that he regrets it. Maybe he did something horrid to amass such a large amount of power and now he has conflicting personalities, making him charming one second and ruthless the next. Who knows?\n\nWhile I enjoy sitting here writing up a character that will never exist, I must stop and go eat dinner. This was my answer to the blog post. Maybe, I can figure out how to reply and somehow get Mr Reav3 to come along and comment.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-12T11:50:15.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"charming young boy? so you mean ezreal?\n\nHes not actually a tough guy character, hell hes an explorer keen to see the world.\n\nHell his lore literally states that he is EMBARRASSED to be called a hero.\n\nClearly not some up himself dickweed.\n\nLike not even kidding you have described ezreal if you ignore your whole character creation thing underneath.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-05-14T23:13:21.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sgJ9PL6P,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-12T11:50:15.533+0000)\n>\n> charming young boy? so you mean ezreal?\n> \n> Hes not actually a tough guy character, hell hes an explorer keen to see the world.\n> \n> Hell his lore literally states that he is EMBARRASSED to be called a hero.\n> \n> Clearly not some up himself dickweed.\n> \n> Like not even kidding you have described ezreal if you ignore your whole character creation thing underneath.\n\nI do not consider Ezreal to be charming.
