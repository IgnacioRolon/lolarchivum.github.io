Combine that with the 450BE champs I get in the level up rewards. Oh my, watch the hell out.\r\n\r\nOne of my accounts is 46 and still can&#039;t play ranked because I can&#039;t afford 20 champs.\r\n\r\nThe Hell!? I know you want money and forcing people to buy chests for free BE is your gameplan, but Jesus Christ this is asinine. I have been farming BE for a WEEK to buy Jax.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-06T12:19:29.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Try being 6 blue essence off buying your 20th champion and needing to grind out 10 games, which is basically 10 hours just to level up, and that's if you win atleast two.

The blue essence shop sold a gemstone for 150,000 blue essence. if i earn this much BE by the time the store comes back ill get one gemstone. which equates to one chest and key, which equates to one champion shard. All this team playing league and i get one champion shard. What is the point of BE if you have all champs. pointless. New BE shop better have some goodies. Also please release what is there early so you can save up. or keep BE shop up always.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-07T11:50:31.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The point of gemstones being rare is because you can redeem them into Mythic skins. The option to convert them to Chest+Key is really just for people who don't care about the mythic skins and/or have all of them.\n\nIt's like how the event tokens always have an option to convert to BE, it only exists as an option to use up those last few tokens or for people who don't want any of the other stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"ZedHotChiliPeprs","date":"2018-03-07T12:27:09.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if i did use a gemstone for key/chest thats 150,000 BE on a skin shard. this is the worst trade deal in history.

If you don't want the Mythic skins then you can't expect to get the best trade for the gemstones because that's the trade they're designed for. Being able to convert them to key+chest is essentially housekeeping for people who don't want random stuff floating around in their loot that they aren't going to use. It's not _meant _ to be a worthwhile trade.\n\nJust wait for the next BE shop to roll around and buy URFwick and all the chromas and anything else that happens to be in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sister meow","date":"2018-03-06T14:43:20.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to mention they lowered the xp per first win (by like 150-300?) and added 50 BE instead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-03-07T07:22:45.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree that we don't get enough Blue Essence at the moment, and your idea is good.\nMy only advice for you now is to take missions seriously, there has been missions in League of Legends that grants you Blue Essence if you complete them.\nAt the moment I don't think there are missions, but if there are missions available in near future that grants you Blue Essence if you complete them, take advantage of this opportunity to complete them and you will get more Blue Essence.\nSome missions may even grant you more experience, helps you to level up faster, so take advantage of those missions too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-06T22:59:01.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed, the currency that allows you to unlock playing the game shouldn't be so rare.\n\nPlus its a incentive to win games.\nPersonally I don't care wether I win or lose as long as I know I played well. The only bonus winning has for me is the extra champion mastery points you get. So getting BE for wins makes people focus a little harder on the overall objective.","replies":[]}]}
