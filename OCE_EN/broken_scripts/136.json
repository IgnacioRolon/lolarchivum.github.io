Like, thanks for just coming into my lane, despite the fact I'm a damn mid laner, then griefing me because, \"muh client\" so, I have to afk and get slammed with this crap so my team can remake and I have a fun experience in the next game.\r\n\r\nI'm malding.

I have to log in 3/4 times before I can actually see everything on the opening screen. I mostly play arams so when I get my champ and go to do up a rune page for it all I get is the x at the top right to close the rune page but no actual display of any runes. While ingame I could be walking around and suddenly hear an error message pop up and the client just freezes, if I didn't know how to open up a 2nd desktop screen I would of had to do force shutdowns to get out of it then there is not connecting to the lobby chat pregame and after game the friends chat doesn't update either so one time it was showing my friend was ingame for an entire day so I couldn't invite him he would have to join my lobby(not a big problem because of the allow people to join your lobby but more of the I can't invite) Not a very fun experience at all","replies":[]}]}
