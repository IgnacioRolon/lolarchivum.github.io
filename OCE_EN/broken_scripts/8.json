It has been replaced with *better nerf Akali*.\r\n\r\nNow, I am not saying that Akali is *weak* by any standards, but I do believe that constantly hitting her with a nerf every balance patch is the wrong thing to do. Akali has always been seen as a strong champion, even back in the day when she had three dashes that reset on a takedown. The only time she was seen as weak was after Riot butchered her, led to almost no one playing her, and then having her being reworked.\r\n\r\nThat same cycle is starting again and no one seems to be surprised.\r\n\r\nAkali has an insane skill floor, skill ceiling, and skill gap. The differences between bronze and silver with her speak volumes. The differences between bronze and masters is at a whole different level. The differences between masters and competitive is a whole different ball game because she is *strong* in competitive yet has a lacklustre win rate everywhere else.\r\n\r\nIt would be idiotic of me to use winrates as a viable source for strength and viability.\r\n\r\nThe most recent nerf on the PBE is close to killing Akali. You are getting there.\r\n\r\nRemoving the microstun on her R1 is the first issue. A lot of her combos and initiation were based around that microstun as it allowed a guaranteed E after you landed it, which was quite cool and allowed for some great plays.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue, and the issue I have as a whole, is that her rank 1 ultimate will share a similar cooldown with global ultimates. We are talking a three minute cooldown for an assassin.\r\n\r\nAssassins require an early lead and then spike at the mid-game before slowly falling off towards lategame. If she is essentially still for three minutes, her chance to get a lead is hindered and it means she will transition worse than before.\r\n\r\nI feel like the people balancing her are silver and just got stomped by her for not playing right. I give it five more nerfs before she is at Kassadin level and no one will play her and midlane will be, once more, Zed, Diana, Talon, Yasuo, Ahri, and Azir.","replies":[{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2019-09-04T14:12:56.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, let us not nerf an AP Assassin that can one shot in less than a second. With MR items being so pricy, mages and AP champions already have a huge advantage due to the insane cost of those 'big' 45-50 MR items. Why do you think Irelia was nerfed? Because she abused conqueror easily and heals a lot even if you stack plenty of armor. Look at the opponents perspective instead of being the player and see for yourself why the decision is made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Code XER0","date":"2019-09-04T08:53:39.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree this shit is getting out of control.
