Enjoy. I see mistakes that somehow got through three proofreads, a text-to-speech program, and a beta reader. Classic.\r\n--\r\nKatarina leant against the stone wall with an agitated expression appearing on her face as she watched her target weave through people, a pathetic attempt to act incognito. She had spent far too long observing rather than throwing daggers, as she was accustomed. She could hit the man from here without anyone knowing who had thrown it.\r\n\r\nSadly, the kill had to be clean and look like a natural death.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Best get a move on, Miss Couteau,&rdquo; hissed a voice from somewhere around her. &ldquo;If you continue to waste time, the kill will be mine.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as she spun around. &ldquo;Still hiding in shadows, Talon?&rdquo; she replied bitterly. &ldquo;I had no idea that you were taking part in this little game. I already have my plan of attack set out, do you?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It has to be clean,&rdquo; said Katarina, smiling. &ldquo;You always leave your blades everywhere as you are nothing short of careless. You claim this kill as your own but you are just standing around watching me? That is rather humorous, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe waited for a reply but all she heard was silence. That was typical of Talon, honestly. She scoffed and dropped from the balcony soundlessly. She had perfected the art of being silent a long time ago.\r\n\r\nShe easily slipped by the guards that had been posted at the large arch doors that were usually closed to the public and carefully trailed a small crowd of gossiping women. She wasn&rsquo;t sure what she hated more at the moment, the gossiping women or the gaudy design on the makeshift ballroom.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Noxians and Demacians in the same place without any bloodshed,&rdquo; said a rotund woman with a chuckle. &ldquo;Never thought I would see the day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina rolled her eyes and slipped up the stairs, her hand on her concealed dagger.\r\n\r\nSomething was amiss. This was far too easy, no matter how talented and qualified she was for such a simple task. She had only seen around four guards so far, each of them clueless to their surroundings.\r\n\r\nShe paused at the top of the stairs, her instincts screamed to turn around and leave it to Talon. She could always trust her instincts, but she had never given up a job before and she would never disappoint her father now.\r\n\r\nThe mere thought that Talon could do something that she couldn&rsquo;t was enough to spur her back into action.\r\n\r\nShe edged along the walls, her ears perked for any distinct sounds that could help her locate her target. She heard something to the right, but that wasn&rsquo;t the direction of her target.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;May as well,&rdquo; she muttered to herself as she made her way towards the door, her eyes looking for any signs of a trap.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This will not work!&rdquo; hissed a familiar voice. &ldquo;They are smarter than you are giving them credit for. Do you really think they will fall for a simple doppelg&auml;nger? Katarina Du Couteau has been assigned to this task, to eliminate you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I am not afraid of any member of the Du Couteau House.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You should be,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;The men outside are all putting their lives on the line for you and only you!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I may be the High Commander, but I am not a coward,&rdquo; said the High Commander. &ldquo;Those men willingly put their lives on the line, not me! I made sure the bare minimum was met. They wanted at least fifty but that would have agitated the masses and caused conflict.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This meeting of peace is a farce! A fallacy!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; said the High Commander, &ldquo;but who are we to judge what the upper echelons desire. If they would like a fa&ccedil;ade of a peace treaty to draw out the assassins and strike them down as they flee, what right do I have to complain?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This was bait!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No need to sound so distressed, darling,&rdquo; said the High Commander with a laugh. &ldquo;I do not fear Katarina Du Couteau because she will, just like the others, be cut down the moment she leaves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You &ndash; you could be killed!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;Your family! Your people!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I can be replaced,&rdquo; said the High Commander. &ldquo;My wife can move on and a new high commander will be appointed, that is, of course, assuming my killer would be slain.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina frowned at the silence and pushed her ear against the door.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;&ndash; you could kill me right now and take the title for yourself,&rdquo; continued the High Commander. &ldquo;That is how the title works. The title can, and will be, usurped and passed along by death. I knew what my outcome would be when I accepted the position, as did my wife.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;House Du Couteau would send their daughter to get their hands on your position,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;You knew this!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I would be lying if I said different &ndash;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina forced open the unlocked door and hurled a dagger towards the long-haired woman.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You came later than I had expected,&rdquo; said the High Commander. &ldquo;I guess you decided to eavesdrop longer than I had originally planned.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I was planning on rushing in,&rdquo; said Katarina, a sinister smile appearing on her lips, &ldquo;but, as you know, I like to take my time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You already know that you have been baited,&rdquo; said the High Commander. &ldquo;Do you really think killing me will get you out alive? You could leave now &ndash; she has no family, nor is she in any position to be missed. You could leave as a citizen, not an assassin.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You wish for me to be a coward!&rdquo; shouted Katarina. &ldquo;You think that I would willingly roll over and allow you to live? You believe I would turn my back on my father?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You have once before, have you not?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina screamed in rage and cartwheeled towards the dead body, her eyes burning with anger. She yanked the dagger out of the body and swiped wildly at the High Commander, who took a small step backwards and survived with a shredded top.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I wish I could praise your handiwork,&rdquo; said the High Commander, a frown slowly appearing on his face. &ldquo;Your speed and control are unmatched. You deserve better. You should be more than a mindless killing machine.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina swung her arm again, intent on ending this now, and gasped when her arm was caught in a grip.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sloppy,&rdquo; said the High Commander as he twisted the arm in his grip, causing a dagger to drop to the floor. &ldquo;I should already be dead by now. Katarina Du Couteau, the Sinister Blade, someone everyone fears and yet you are nothing but a little girl filled with blinding rage.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you blinding rage!&rdquo; said Katarina with her teeth clenched. She bent down with inhuman speed and stabbed the High Commander in the ankle. She dashed back and laughed. &ldquo;No matter how angry I may be, I can still exploit your weaknesses. Do not doubt me.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I never doubted it,&rdquo; said the High Commander, coughing. &ldquo;Go on, Katarina Du Couteau, finish me and crown yourself High Commander. It is what your father has always wanted.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My father has never wanted this position.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, he did,&rdquo; said the High Commander, laughing. &ldquo;He just never had the tool to achieve it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina clenched her hands into fists.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; shouted the High Commander, rage filling his tone. &ldquo;Finish it and crown yourself as High Commander.&rdquo;\r\n--\r\n&ldquo;Congratulations,&rdquo; said Talon, bowing. &ldquo;I never doubted you for a second. I knew you would achieve what none of us could.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My beautiful girl,&rdquo; said Katarina&rsquo;s father, a wide and genuine smile appearing on his face. &ldquo;I am so proud that you achieved what no one else in our family could. You did it without aid from Talon. You did it without the need of money. You did it with your own talent and intuition.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The High Commander said something,&rdquo; said Katarina in a whisper. &ldquo;He said that &ndash;&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I know what he said,&rdquo; said Katarina&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;I would be proud of you if you were a scullery maid. If you do not want the position, you are free to turn it down and retire to your room for the evening.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKatarina nodded with a small smile. She turned to the cheering crowd with ambition filling her eyes. The screams, cheers, and chants piercing her ears. Her name being revered was something she would never think possible.\r\n\r\nKatarina&rsquo;s father silenced the crowd with a simple gesture. &ldquo;Please welcome your new High Commander, Katarina Du Couteau!&rdquo;\r\n--\r\nChampion: Katarina\r\nSkin: High Command Katarina\r\nWord Count: 1452\r\nTranslation (Latin -&gt; English): Malus Peior Pessimus -&gt; bad, wicked, evil\r\nWriter: Broken Scripts\r\nDate: 16/03/2017","replies":[{"poster":"Saben","date":"2017-03-16T09:04:46.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very good narrative with very few flaws.

It took a lot of effort and time to cut this below 1500. I am used to writing chapters that are around 6000 - 9000 in length. I knew the limit would cause narrative and setting to fall behind, so I focused more on dialogue. Everything is explained via words. Because I cannot show you, I had to _tell_ you, which is a bad writing overall.\n\nThe fight had to be short because I neared the end and couldn't make it as showy as I originally had it. The exchange was rather important as it explained your questions. one, the title of High Commander is passed down by death. The killer usurps the rank, as is Noxian tradition. Katarina's father is a public figure and would lose face holding it. Katarina is not.\n\nThe former High Commander mocked her because Katarina is easy to distract and that was his attempt to flee. In the end, he realises he cannot and spurs her to end him. She reacts in anger, as he expected, and he is killed. Once again proving she's hot-headed and rash to act. Also, many people are arrogant before death. Call it a burst of stupidity or courage.\n\nTalon vanished in his own attempt. It was assassin versus assassin and the story is focused on Katarina, so Talon got no screentime besides his initial presence.\n\nYou need to know Kat's lore for this story to make sense. Katarina and Talon are Noxian. The High Commander is Noxian. The Demacians were mentioned but never seen.\n\nAs the woman said before the High Commander was killed. The entire meeting was a farce. It was made to lure assassins out and kill them as they fled the city. Again, was explained in the original. The man's arrogance saved Katarina as she took an alternate way out of the city, avoiding all the traps and soldiers. She then reentered as a civilian and waited to claim her title.\n\nThank you for the comment, but do have a re-read and you'll see what I mean. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
