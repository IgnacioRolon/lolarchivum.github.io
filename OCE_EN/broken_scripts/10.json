If my MMR is higher than where I am, why is a shitty, flawed system holding me hostage?\n\nI have hit my promos 6 times. In each of those games, I have had morons who couldn't count to 6 if they had some wooden blocks in front of them. Yet out of my promos, I have people who understand how the game works.\n\nThe second you hit promos, a switch is flicked and you suddenly need to 1v9.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-07T13:00:47.526+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Last promos I had a solid 50/50. One was a very positive game and we dominated. One was positive but the enemy was just better. One had two toxics who just went off at each other.\n\nIt was the game after my promos that was a real shitshow. *When* those type of games happen is ultimately just luck, there will always be assholes either intentionally or lacking in self-control. \n\nMy recommendation is to play promos in the morning or middle of the day-ish.

No more and no less. He made an *absolute* claim, so from that perspective yes, the inherent idea is that the absolute at least is false, if not the general claim, but again, no more and no less than that.\n\nSharing the experience wasn't about being 'correct', it was about sharing a different one.\n\nYou're free to believe of me what you wish, I can't change that and have no particular desire to try, but you seem to be reading far more into my comment than what was present.\n\nI share differing experiences in this manner often, and primarily because I want to understand *why* my or anyone else's experience differs. Is it different because of the rank difference, the time the games are played, is it the duo factor, the ranked factor, the flex factor? Etc. I *try* to make this clear when making such comments whether implicitly or otherwise, I'll be the first to admit I don't always nail that one.\n\nI don't disregard all negativity against Riot, far from it, but if I feel something is being judged unduly I will dispute it, and that wasn't even the case here I was just sharing an experience. On boards, there is *a lot* of anecdotal evidence, in fact, such is the majority. It has its value, but it should always be taken with a grain of salt, especially when the claims being made are often in direct conflict with one another.\n\nIf player A makes x claim, and player B makes y claim that directly opposes x, who do you believe? The answer is neither, you do more research, you gather more data.\n\nRiot isn't perfect, no company is. In case you haven't noticed, I'm not all that happy with how slow gameplay offences are punished for one. The other negativity that crops up often, like balance, quite frankly isn't my area. I don't know enough about the processes to feel comfortable commenting as I would be airing opinions based on incomplete information.\n\nAs for my suggestion being worthless, I think you're still missing the point. Promos are your most valuable games, so you want every advantage you can get. That was the whole point of suggesting to play *promos specifically* earlier in the day.\n\nI can't comment on data I don't have, and to be honest, that's a topic for your own post, not a comment in someone else's thread but again, you are reading *way* more into my original comment than was there to be read. The original claim was \"all promos are like this\", and literally all I said in response was \"that is not what happened to me, this is\".\n\nThere was no broad spectrum, no generalisation, no deep dive or large data sets, literally just a single experience that countered an absolute claim.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-03-15T12:10:50.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Today is not going to be a good day for you. Mr Tea time is about to be cut short.\n\n>He is talking about his promos specifically not his games in general.\n\nAnd what compeling evidence has he presented that convinced you so? Simply because he typed about reaching promo 6 times and lost each one of them; Due to being set up, is enough?\n\nAtleast post some proof to support the claim. Dont just read some text and take it so willingly without questions. \n\n> My conclusion **after thousands of games across 3 different tiers** of lp (and presumably mmr as a result) and different MONTHS (to add school holidays and in turn age into the results) was this.\n\nThen please. POST your finding. Come on this forum on each of those accounts; That you've claimed to have data compiled accross thoundsands of games. They had better be across 3 different tiers, and come with graphs showing the time of months when school holidays start and end. \n\nWords are cheap. Show me proof.\n\n> The more likely you are to play with younger players the more likely you are to lose.\n\nAge gap have no colleration to win/lost. There are players of all ages with different ranking across dissimilar tiers. Why are you making such a conclusive statement without concrete evidence??\n\n> So to achieve a good winrate playing at ungodly hours when children wont be awake And or not playing during school holidays so that said children will be physically removed from their computers will drastically help in that cause.\n\nWhat a baseless fallacy. If those kids can play with each other and climb rank, why cant you?? What is the problem?\n\n>Further more after roughly 5 games of wins in a row you will see a gradual decrease in player performance, and i dont mean how you perceive the players around you as that is subject to bias, i mean in their stats, i find that after around 5 wins you will see a drop in average winrate of your team of about 4%, this number increases as you win more games till you eventually cannot carry anymore, and it takes roughly the same amount of time for the winrate to increase back to 50% as it did to devolve to the 30-20% mark.\n\nThat is a statement.
