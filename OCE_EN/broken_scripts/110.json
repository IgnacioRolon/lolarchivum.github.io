Now, I could sit here for hours plotting and revaluating the system, but I&rsquo;m not going to waste my time on something that most people don&rsquo;t care about &ndash; the hundreds of threads on this very thing that Riot have ignored just proves my point.\n\n1.\tThe system should inform the player how many times in the previous x games they have been reported and the reasons why they have been reported. This should be a thing you can view at any time. Open up a tab in your games and see what you&rsquo;ve been reported for is a great way to start understanding why you&rsquo;re being reported.\n2.\tYour very first punishment should be a warning, not an instant ten game chat restriction. You should acknowledge the warning and then read the Summoner&rsquo;s code before you can continue. Add a timed menu/scroll lock before people can continue on.\n3.\tIf you have been punished, you are then able to see the entirety of the logs from the game (except the chat of the enemy team (your teams and /all). The system highlights phrases and/or words you used that are considered problematic.\n4.\tAt any point, you should be able to contest the punishment and an in-client ticket is created so you can speak to a Riot employee. If the punishment is wrong, you are compensated.\n\nThese are basic things that should be in the game. This is a competitive game and you should expect banter. Instead of permanently banning people for being abusive, just permanently mute them. Why are you forcing toxic people to create new accounts with new players? Oh, right, more money because the smurfs will buy the &lsquo;good&rsquo; champs and just decimate the poor people stuck using your idiotic &lsquo;new player&rsquo; champions until level ten.\n\nNow, I&rsquo;m going to provide my most recent punishment and then I&rsquo;m going to break it down and explain the things what happened. This account has never been punished and I managed to get it to honour level 3. An achievement for me, let me tell you. This chat restriction came from one game. Amazing.\n\nAs per usual, I blocked my name and neatened the logs. Nothing was removed and nothing was changed aside from spelling. This is more for you guys than trying to protect myself or lie.\n\nGame 1\nBrokenScriptsLul: No.\nBrokenScriptsLul: This new swain is my husband.\nBrokenScriptsLul: No matter how awful his kit is, he&#039;s my new main.\nBrokenScriptsLul: Another game with no jungler. Perfect.\nBrokenScriptsLul: Just end it.\nBrokenScriptsLul: 0 ganks\nBrokenScriptsLul: No point playing with an afk jungler\nBrokenScriptsLul: Nothing to do with babysat\nBrokenScriptsLul: and more to the point of counterganking\nBrokenScriptsLul: getting ganked by a better jungler\nBrokenScriptsLul: isn&rsquo;t against the rules\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m building tank\nBrokenScriptsLul: totally\nBrokenScriptsLul: I should stop expecting junglers on oce to know the basics of jungling\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m not trolling\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m building tank\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m not mad\nBrokenScriptsLul: I am bored.\nBrokenScriptsLul: To be honest\nBrokenScriptsLul: I am more angry with myself for expect a jungler capable of basics\nBrokenScriptsLul: My fault\nBrokenScriptsLul: I take the blame.\nBrokenScriptsLul: 0 ganks\nBrokenScriptsLul: 0 countergankjs\nBrokenScriptsLul: 0 invades\nBrokenScriptsLul: why call jungle?\nBrokenScriptsLul: And yet you rag on me\nBrokenScriptsLul: I am trying tank swain\nBrokenScriptsLul: it&#039;s only norms\nBrokenScriptsLul: lag\nBrokenScriptsLul: why don&#039;t I get counterganks?\nBrokenScriptsLul: question for the ages\nBrokenScriptsLul: thats 40 ping too high\nBrokenScriptsLul: game is unplayable\nBrokenScriptsLul: I will\nBrokenScriptsLul: just watch, 100% winrate jungle\nBrokenScriptsLul: because I understand how to jungle\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m tank\nBrokenScriptsLul: don&#039;t need farm\nBrokenScriptsLul: report this jungler\nBrokenScriptsLul: toxic, abuse, trolling, 0 ganks.\nBrokenScriptsLul: Why? That&rsquo;s troll build\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m trying tank swain\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m not raging\nBrokenScriptsLul: I was simply wondering why you lacked the ability to countergank\nBrokenScriptsLul: you&#039;re obviously good at the game\nBrokenScriptsLul: :)\nBrokenScriptsLul: this j4 diamond and 1/3\nBrokenScriptsLul: yikes\nBrokenScriptsLul: I&#039;m tank\nBrokenScriptsLul: yeah, I die for this team to get kills\nBrokenScriptsLul: please report j4\nBrokenScriptsLul: afk\nBrokenScriptsLul: he&#039;s watching videos on how to jungle\nBrokenScriptsLul: yikes\nBrokenScriptsLul: he lied\nBrokenScriptsLul: on the internet\nBrokenScriptsLul: gasp\nBrokenScriptsLul: tank swain isn&#039;t too good\nBrokenScriptsLul: maybe a few ganks would have got me rolling\nBrokenScriptsLul: cho couldn&#039;t hit anything, so it would have been an easy lane. tbh\nBrokenScriptsLul: ggwp\n\nNow, I do admit I was rather passive-aggressive, but that is hardly worthy of being punished. I could understand if told people to commit suicide, called them autistic (which seems to be okay in Riot&rsquo;s book &ndash; let&rsquo;s all make light of a serious condition that effects people daily. I mean, the populace of LoL has it all wrong, but it&rsquo;s fine), and I didn&rsquo;t swear. Is giving someone advice on how to jungle really punishable?\n\nEverything I said was a response to someone else. I did not flame bait or start anything. I started the game friendly and aided in a leash I should not have. I even saved J4, costing me a wave of farm, but I never held it against him.\n\nNow, the kicker is this J4 was x20 worse than me and he has not been punished. He was toxic, abusive, he even AFK&rsquo;d for 15 minutes. At that point, I just went tank swain because the game was over. He sat there, trash talking in fountain, stepping out every few minutes to die and then he would repeat it.\n\nI await your responses.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-08T14:53:43.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry, he was totally banned, because the system is perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-08T14:43:40.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
