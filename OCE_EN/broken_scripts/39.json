I haven't played other games for a month, and I still had to purchase a token bundle to reach the goal.

Not that League was ever really a \"collect everything\" type of game, but they've pretty much focused on the \"larger and flashier collections for specific champions\" people rather than the \"collect a bit of everything\" crowd.\n\nThe decision I can respect, even if I prefer the \"collect a bit of everything\" model. It's more reliable both for player expectation and for Riot. The method of doing so...well, let's just say it leaves something to be desired in my books.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-08-03T00:14:26.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I see what you mean.\n\nMy main issue with it is the \"right place, right time\" aspect.\nI'd be fine with the grinds if next year you got a chance to pick up the things you didn't get this time around.\n\nBut that isn't the case, theres so much limited edition crap that if you think you might ever show an interest in that particular champion, you have to pick it up now, or else you could fall in love with that champion in the future, and NEVER have the cool extras for them.\n\nImagine a new player starting league in October, they pick up Akali, absolutely love her, she's the best character in any game for them, they get 1,000,000 mastery points on her.  But they always encounter people in game with the PROJECT: Border and chroma, or Prestige KDA Akali with the border, and they know they can NEVER, EVER, have those things, for the champ they love. Just because they started playing league at the wrong time (or for some reason couldn't play during the event).\n\nThat saddens me.\n\nI'd hate for there to be an Aurelion Sol skin or border etc that I could never obtain, because I just so happened to be on holiday when it popped up.\n\nLike you mentioned, It's also really biased towards 1-tricks.\nIf you're a Pyke 1-trick, you do one event, and spend like $60 and you're set for life.\nBut if you're someone like me who has a wide selection of champs that I play relatively evenly. _(and then on top of that, a few very special ones like Azir/Sol/Swain/Tal etc.)_ It's just too much, almost every event has something.\n\nWhy should people be punished for playing more of the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-03T06:37:38.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, the methods leave something to be desired in my books, but ultimately, particularly when it comes to private businesses, we speak with our wallets. The prestige skins would not have continued if they were not profitable. It's all well and good for people to say \"a skin in a video game isn't worth $x\" but if they then still buy that skin, obviously it was worth that much to them.\n\nAnd let's be honest, you could argue the same of pretty much any successful collectible. Take Pop! Vinyls for example. They aren't designed for people to be collecting every single one. Every figure is limited run and if they are popular enough will sometimes see re-releases. Some arbitrarily cost more money because they are part of an event like SDCC or PAX and you can buy a big exciting one for 4x the price of a normal one.\n\nI'm sure you're seeing the trend here. Pops are hugely successful and bring in a lot of money. Probably much more so than skins at this point, as I would imagine designing and printing Pops is cheaper than the development costs for skins.\n\nFunko has made the choice to push more content more often so people get more variety and sometimes special content, just as Riot has. The end result is that any customers who are trying to collect multiple sets simply may not be able too, especially when you consider things like Chase pops which is a practice that Riot does not follow, but we also get more options and more diversity out of the deal.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
