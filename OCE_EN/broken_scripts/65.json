You can always check with Riot Support, where despite the infamous copy-paste responses, generally if you can drag out the conversation to more than 2 or 3 back-and-forth conversation, you'd find yourself be talking to a human, and they do get things done most of the time from my experience. Anyway the point is, they can look into your account history and find out what's going on, if you've missed too many chests or that you just forgot many.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-07T02:22:50.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only earn a maximum of 5 chests a month I'm fairly sure, so you can't earn any more even if you get an S on a champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-06T10:22:41.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU HAVE NO PROOF!
