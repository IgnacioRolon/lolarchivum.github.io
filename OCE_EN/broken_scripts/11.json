I thought about it on and off all day and it finally hit me that the system is meant to be flawed on purpose. There cannot be a good reason this was not fixed ages ago if it was not intentional.\r\n\r\nI am currently sitting on 44,902 mastery points for Xayah. A decent amount. I have learned all her mechanics, her spikes, her weaknesses, her builds, masteries, runes, and the supports that work for her but despite that knowledge &ndash; that mastery &ndash; I cannot get an &lsquo;S&rsquo; in-game for mastery rank 7.\r\n\r\nDespite all this knowledge, this skill, this ability to play the champion, it is for nought. Why even bother when I know the instant I hit 3 deaths, the &lsquo;S&rsquo; is gone. Why bother farming when having 400CS compared to the enemy ADC&rsquo;s 170. That is a 130CS difference, which is an amazing feat, but only A+ worthy. Why bother doing objectives when I do not need them; I need kills. I need to be 20/0 to get an &lsquo;S&rsquo; and this. Is. Wrong!\r\n\r\nThe fact you can be 6/4/9, have 90% kill participation, wards placed at key locations all throughout the game, control wards bought in bundles, dragons, barons, and 250+CS and not get an &lsquo;S&rsquo; or an &lsquo;S+&rsquo; is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nNone of those matter besides kills, deaths, assists, and CS.\r\n\r\nWhy is something that&rsquo;s meant to reflect my personal skill at a champ based on what others have done and not what I have done? If I am going 20/0 frequently, that should be my average. It should be based on my stats, my averages, not someone else&rsquo;s.\r\n\r\nWhy is whether I get my &lsquo;S&rsquo; or not decided whether my team feeds or the enemy surrenders at 15 minutes, denying my &lsquo;S&rsquo; because my stats are not 20/0?\r\n\r\nWhy, Riot? Why are you forcing this flawed system down my throat? I want to progress, not fume because my score was not good enough or I died. Why is a system that is personal so heavily dictated by other people?","replies":[{"poster":"CRIMSONBO4R","date":"2017-04-26T00:39:56.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AND, AND I GOT LIKE 400,000 MASTERY POINTS{{champion:22}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CRIMSONBO4R","date":"2017-04-26T00:39:20.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"400 DOES NOT EQUAL TO 170 PLUS 130, MEMES 4 LIFE BULY{{champion:131}}  44,000 AINT EVEN MUCH BEING PLAYING HER FOR A WEEK GOT MASTERY 6","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-24T03:43:17.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The systems bad cause i cant git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-24T00:03:05.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system should be hard, otherwise it wouldn't be an achievement having a lvl 7 mastery. \nIf it was easy for every joe to get S's then lvl 6/7 would mean nothing.\n\nThe system ranks you against the average score of that champion, this poses a problem for you atm, because like you everyone else is also trying to main Xayah. But this means that people as a whole are getting much much better with her, pushing her average score up.\nYou have a nice amount of mastery points on her! (congrats btw), but there will probably be people with 100,000+ already who consistently get much higher scores. and because she is so new, there are more of those people than usually would be for a champion. So this drastically pushes up the average for her scores.\n\nI think that you will find that in a few weeks, when only the die-hard Xayah players keep playing her, and everyone else has got bored with her novelty. It'll be much more achievable to get S's.\n\nAlso ADC is the hardest position to get S's with, because not dying is crucial to them, so deaths push back their score a lot more than deaths for other classes. AND they are expected to get lots of kills _(because they are the damage class)_\n\n_________\n\nThe only times I think the system fails us, is 1. when champions are on the far ends of the spectrum, and 2. in the case of really short or really long games.\n\nWhen champions are either extremely overpowered, or extremely underpowered, or extremely popular or extremely unpopular, this causes problems with the ranking system. Vayne for example, she is extremely OP AND extremely popular, meaning she consistently gets crazy scores, and gets them very often. This makes it extremely hard for just the average Vayne player to even have a chance at an S, even though they do well most games (by other champion's standards). \n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, we have champions like say Karthus, who isn't very popular, so only the die-hard karthus mains actually play him. Which means a greater % of Karthus players are good with him, which drives his S scores way up. Then we have people like Azir, who is unpopular and very difficult, this means lots of people try him out, bomb miserably, and never play him again. This pulls down the average of his scores to a level where S's become commonplace. _(I can sometimes go negative with Azir and still get S, providing I have good farm)_. None of these are very nice for the players, Vayne players want to have a nice blue banner on their main, and Azir players don't want their actual good games to feel meaningless because even average games can get S's.\n\n\nIn the case of extremely short games (15-20 mins) or extremely long ones (50+ mins) the scores required for S become warped. For example in this game, they surrendered at 15 mins.\nhttp://imgur.com/a/tP8Is\nWe all got S's except for Irelia and Rakan. Irelia is understandable. But Rakan did everything perfectly, he had the same kill participation as both the carries, he didn't steal a single kill from lucian, and didn't die once. he only took 2 CS from lucian, and rushes sightstone first. There is no reason why his score should be any less meaningful than Azir or Lucian's. But we both got S's and he didn't, just because of how the system calculates it for these very short games.\n\nThe same is true for long games, CS is one of (if not THE) most important factor for scores, and as the game time increases so does the number of CS you are expected to get. However, once the game has reached 40ish mins, everyone is full build. and no one is worrying about CS anymore, it's all team fights and objectives, meaning everyone lets their CS score slip because they don't need it for the game anymore. However the S score system still expects the CS number to grow with game time. So once everyone is full build, unless you're consciously trying to keep your CS high, your chances of getting S decreases with every minute the game goes on. Which is hardly fair seeming thats how the game is supposed to be played.\n\nSo in all, i think the system is good, getting lvl 5 mastery shows that you have put time into that champ, lvl 6 shows that you can sometimes play well with that champ, and lvl 7 means that you can _consistently_ play well with them.\nIt should have to be a challenge to get lvl 7. But there are situations (lire long and short games) where the grading system could be tweaked for better representation of what is actually achievable while playing properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-23T21:23:26.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get an S with more than 3 deaths (i.e. 21/7 got me an S- on Eve, same with 33/4). I'm guessing if the deaths happen far enough apart and don't happen to quickly within each other, then it's better????\n\nAlso, playing the champion more will help. 44K is a lot, but if you're properly good at a champion, you should get A's and S's with no problem (again, most of my Eve and Annie games are A+ or higher).\n\nTake AnnieBot: he has over 3mill points on his main (nearly 2mill on his second), and frequently gets S ranks even in Challenger.\n\nIt's not just about playing the champion properly, but also knowing the champion's limits. Once you understand that, you should stop diving into fights you can't win, resulting in less deaths and a better KDA.\n\nThis is just my perspective. Hope this help :)","replies":[]}]}
