I both agree and disagree with your points here.\n\nFirst, Pantheon's shield is far more akin to Xin's ult, than Yasuo's windwall.  It doesn't actually _block_ anything, it makes him damage immune.  So any abilities that would pass through him and hit multiple targets still do so, unlike the windwall.  Also he can still be CCed.\n\nThe problem I have with the shield is how it treats what direction the damage is coming from.  It reads the direction of the _source_ of the damage, rather than the direction of the damage itself.  For example, if Ahri is facing the shield and throws her ball out, the damage of the ball will of course be negated on the way out, **BUT** will also be negated on its return as well, even though the damage is striking Pantheon from behind.  Meanwhile a Heimerdinger turret attacking Pantheon from behind will damage him, _(because the turret is the source)_.  This leads to strange interactions like Karthus's ult being negated, _(assuming the shield is facing towards wherever Karthus is on the map)_, when that damage doesn't come from any particular direction.\n\nMy other problem with the shield, is that he can cancel it.  This is a big no no in my books.\nAny champion _(not just Pantheon)_ should have to commit when they use an ability.  If you have an ability like this that is very very strong for defence, you should have some trade-off when you use it, and the trade off here should be that once cast, you have to wait out the whole duration before you can return to pumping out damage again.  You shouldn't be able to cancel the ability imo.\n\n_________________________\n\nIn lane, I think he is a bit oppressive, but in the game at large his Damage/CD/Mana is moderately balanced _(compared to some)_.\nThe main problem in lane, is the safety of his all-in engages.  When at full passive stacks he can jump on you, stab you with Q while you're stunned, then switch to shield and take no retaliation damage from you, which puts his stacks to full again, so he can back off as soon as the shield finishes, and stab you with an empowered Q while retreating.  So he is only vulnerable in the split second it takes him to dash, and in the moment it takes him to stab you with the empowered Q as he backs off.  That isn't enough time to employ any meaningful counterplay.\n\nBut he does have to focus, he doesn't have enough 'bonus AoE damage' like Zed does, that just happens to kill people around the target as well as the target itself.  He has to choose a target, and direct all his abilities towards that target.  So if pantheon isn't attacking you specifically, you are usually relatively safe.  The same cannot be said of the champs like Zed or Twitch or Illaoi etc.  Who do enough passive damage around the target, that you get caught up in it.\n\nWhich means that while powerful, Pantheon doesn't impact the game as a whole as much as these champs that go in and pick up 'accidental' triple kills.\nHe's a good 1v1 duelist, but cant wade into fights cleaving people left right and centre, as he is forced to prioritise.\n\n\n__________________________\n\nIs he a bit stronger than he needs to be?  Yes, personally I think so.\nIs he as bad as some of the champs that already exist and have done so in their current form for a long time?  No.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-23T05:23:01.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only versed him a couple of times, but from my limited experience, he definitely feels over-tuned.

I mean that in the sense that they should be strong. List me one champion who released and was not insanely obnoxious. I mean, Mordekaiser is still over-tuned all these weeks/months later.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-23T09:55:09.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"EDIT: IIRC Syndra was extremely weak on release. In more personal memory Lucian, Azir and Aurelion come to mind. One of whom now thrives, one had his time to shine then fell back down again, and the other...\n\nOh and Taliyah. She didn't do so hot either.\n___\nThere's a wide array of considerations that have to be made though. \n\nThe most glaringly obvious is that a champ or rework that functions as perfectly balanced on PBE, will rarely follow that trend into live. Population and player diversity are the biggest factors there. A PBE simply cannot compare with live testing. The obvious solution is to use data from all your previous releases/reworks to try and predict how live testing will react, but ultimately every one is different and those predictions will never be completely accurate.\n\nThe other big thing to consider is the sheer diversity in the population that plays League. There is an enormous difference between Iron players and Pros, and Riot has to balance for both of them and everyone in between. \n\nI may be wrong in my recollection but I was under the impression the comment about breaking the game was more in line with creating new and previously unconsidered ways of playing the game. Being able to steal enemy's abilities for example drastically changes the way both we and those we are versing play the game. The 'rules' get broken and new ones created in their place.\n\nThat said, releasing champions strong is somewhat necessary. Releasing them strong eases the learning curve, especially when there are brand new mechanics and play loops introduced, and gets people interested in the character. As they get tuned down, those that truly enjoy the playstyle stick with it and the rest move on. When the opposite is true, most people play one or two games and lose interest. Those champions may have a few dedicated mains, but the majority let them fade into obscurity.\n\nWhen champions/reworks don't have a strong release, it hurts players (less diversity in rosters), it hurts the champions (low play-rate means they will forever get pushed to the bottom of priority lists), and it hurts devs (if a champion/rework fails that's a lot of basically wasted effort). In other words, it's in everyone's interest for new champions and reworks to have a strong impact when they land. That's not to say it doesn't cause some frustration and growing pains, but ultimately I feel such are necessary if you want the game to continue to evolve rather than stagnate.\n\nThat is very much my own opinion though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Holy Spirit","date":"2019-08-23T06:22:15.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"???????
