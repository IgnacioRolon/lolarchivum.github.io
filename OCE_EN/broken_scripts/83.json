I can't really do much if they did buy a name change, but the fact that I cannot take the name when they play 6 games a year is bullcrap. This is the third name I have lost to low-level accounts hoarding the names.\n\nIt's just a stupid system as a whole.","replies":[{"poster":"Ornn","date":"2019-07-11T17:20:47.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im in OCE and i have 5 accounts i swap out of when i dodge \nGrouchy Poro is my main\nTiamat taric\nChocolate Cake\nOrnn Bot\nand Ornn with 100k mastery on Ornn\n\ni wouldnt say i horde them as i will play these forever but i do have 5 cool names","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-07-11T19:06:14.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Grouchy Poro,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EOiihRQv,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-07-11T17:20:47.632+0000)\n>\n> im in OCE and i have 5 accounts i swap out of when i dodge \n> Grouchy Poro is my main\n> Tiamat taric\n> Chocolate Cake\n> Ornn Bot\n> and Ornn with 100k mastery on Ornn\n> \n> i wouldnt say i horde them as i will play these forever but i do have 5 cool names\n\nIf you actively play them, then you're not hoarding them.
