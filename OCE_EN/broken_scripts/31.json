I got done for asking an opposing player whether they meant to say \"g o 0 k\" (I always report for racism but wanted to make sure I understood whether they were being intentionally racist or if it was a mistype). Riot said that was the reason, I challenged, they agreed that context was ignored and that I didnt say it to be offensive, suspension upheld and got some free attitude with my slap in the face. full disclosure I said neck yourself in the same game but the reason player behaviour gave me for the suspension was racism when they later agreed I was clearly not being racist.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xStorm","date":"2017-12-19T09:36:14.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, considering i lost my diamond border due to saying a joke in a NORMS game and getting INSTABANNED for it, i feel the pain. reported several players in RANKED for actually telling people to k**-themselves and meaning it, nope no bans no restrictions, living their lowly pathetic life with rewards. the tribunal is pathetic in deducing who is innocent and who should be punished","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-14T00:45:51.672+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bans being handed out right now are a complete joke.
