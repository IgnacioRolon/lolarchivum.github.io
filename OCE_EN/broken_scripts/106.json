You are nerfing a champion that is useless if he falls behind in the game.\n\nNaut has more damage, more utility, more zoning potential, and more impact.\n\nNaut will beat Pyke in a 1v1 and Pyke is an assassin. Hello, Riot? Do you even play this game anymore?\n\nEdit: Why is Kai'sa not being gutted? The champion is literally broken and is riding a gigabus to freelo city. She has everything in her kit. Stealth, nuke damage, shield, mobility, vision, poke, low mana casts, insane base stats that scale, move speed, and hybrid damage.\n\nShe is, like, every ADC combined and does it all better.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-10-12T02:32:25.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Naut has a lower skill floor, and yet on average, a more experienced player base. Pre-nerf, their winrates were quite similar.\n\nPyke is much better at snowballing (though admittedly Naut is pretty amazing at this too). Having stealth and mobility inherently means a champion needs to be held back a bit more, look at Shaco, if Shaco's winrate goes a few inches over 53%, he is very very unhealthy for the game, whereas a Zilean mid with a 55% winrate is still generally within the confines of meta.\n\nPyke and Naut both scale pretty well, but in different ways. In a squishy comp, Naut with his massive meaty shielding and CC, has more value, and in more brawler comps where Pyke can utilise his ult and follow up, Pyke will has more value.\n\nNaut doesn't really do more damage, he has decent base but alot of it comes from tank items. The issue is tank items, not so much Naut.\n\nNaut is also a top laner who is very dependant on meta. Depending on the meta, Naut moonlights as a support or top, and because Naut is more reliant on specific metas to be useful, you need to be cautious with Nerfs, as changes in the type of meta to favour brawler or roam comps, or nerfs to TANK item meta, will harshly impact him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-10-12T01:54:15.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too many new players no like Pyke streakers (5/5 skill Pykes) , Pyke streakers and medium Pykes (not amazing but they do enough) are more common than bad Pykes. Daz my guess, the fastest Pyke penta I've seen so far was 4-7s I think (from clean up or a straight fight where enemies might have clustered too much for aoes)","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-12T05:08:35.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last time I checked the pick ban rate of Pyke is much higher than Nautilus. Balancing the meta means making more dominant picks less dominant. \n\nAs Nightjar mentioned the Nautilus skill floor is low and as such the rewards for his contribution to a game will also be far less (at higher levels).\nCompared with Pyke who is a regular star of penta kill vids in all regions. Maybe you have experienced different results but the results of the professional players come first and it goes down the line from there. \n\nMy opinion is the same as most others, he has a gap closer aoe stun, self rejuvenation/stealth, nearly the longest hook in the game, an ult aoe nearly the size of ekkos stun that resets on a kill and he stacks damage based on how much health he builds? Come on, nice support champ.... This kit can only be rivaled by Darius, Yasuo or Irelia. Two of the three in their own right are current top meta picks.","replies":[]}]}
