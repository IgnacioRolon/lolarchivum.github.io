I mean, with an MMORPG (Free to Play) they want you to keep playing so they scatter things you can do and use a level-based system. I cannot understand why League of Legends uses this same system when it obviously wasn&rsquo;t made for a game like this.\r\n\r\nI cannot see a valid reason why summoner spells are locked behind an artificial level. People not having smite causes conflicts in blind pick early lobbies and causes people to instantly think it should be two top because their first ten or so games are just that. Unless they have someone that&rsquo;s a higher level than them on their team and then one person is at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe next is the rune system. Why? Just give the entire thing to everyone at level one so they can get used to it. The argument that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; does not work because whether they have it at level one or after ten games, they&rsquo;re not going to have mastered it. The more time people have to use it and tweak it, the better they&#039;ll adapt.\r\n\r\nThe whole system is bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T01:28:45.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean I both agree and disagree. I definitely appreciate the freedom of having recommended runes but being able to choose them all yourself, and having recommended positions to start in but again being able to choose yourself. That said, I remember in my own new player experience way back when I really didn't give two shits that I couldn't use smite. I barely knew what minions were (lord knows I didn't know what was going on when people typed \"come get blue\" in chat), so not having access to smite wasn't even on the radar.\n\nThere's defs an argument that because runes are completely free now as opposed to the old system where I was unlocking slots way faster than I was actually buying runes for them that it's worth reconsidering, but there is still also the argument that new players should be learning how the game itself functions before learning all the extras (no matter how necessary they are). Dumping too much on a person at once just makes them lose interest.\n\nI think a good middle ground would come in the form of that thing they ask you when you make a new account (if they still do) regarding your previous experience or lack thereof with League and MOBAs in general. If you say you're familiar with League, great, you get everything unlocked right away, if you say you're a complete beginner you get taken through it more slowly.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that levelling to 30 is much much faster than it was, so that added to the reduced level requirements for the SS and stuff means you do get the stuff a lot faster now.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-27T07:08:36.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure about your new player experience, but I started near the end of season 6, so it wasn't too long ago for me and boy the levelling system made me angry. Not having flash, not having masteries, not having smite, and having to play around 90 games before I was even close to level ground (still didn't have runes but having a keystone matter alot when thunderlords was 50% of your lane trading dmg) against players who had pure stat advantages from the start and insulting me about being bad on their own turf.\n\nNot every new player is like 'hur dur is dying bad?', or 'do items increase your stats?', or 'oh should I use this spell which is especially for killing jungle monsters on the jungle monster?', or 'does heal... heal me?'. Realistically the only mistake a beginner might make with summoner spells is thinking clarity is viable or smiting to start a camp rather than to finish it. \n\nIt's even sadder trying to explain to a new player that sorry you can't play jungle with your 'jungle champ' like their favourite youtuber because the items you need to clear the camps and get the extra xp to hit the necessary levels are locked behind the smite summoner spell that is also locked behind them playing another 50 games of duo kindred toplane. Whilst I was helping my sister level up I ended up leashing the opposing jungler their first 2 camps or so, because I was lvl10, he was lvl1 and the poor bugger was still trying to fight his blue buff, and didn't receive a leash from his team because in prelvl30 leashes don't happen, and the guy was trying to clear his jungle without smite, without jungle items and without a leash, and must have been having an extremely fun time.\n\nYou can't really do it now, but have you ever tried to enter a ranked game without any masteries or any runes, and taking heal/ghost? Didn't matter which lane you went or how you played. For the first 10min no matter how good you were it was a struggle. Now that's partially due to being accustomed to having all of these advantages, but would it not seem frustrating to a new player when your opponent is already stronger than you without even playing better, and add on top of that they likely have more experience.\n\nMobas should put new players on a somewhat level playing field. There would be an absolute outcry if Riot suddenly announced that whenever you started the game you would get a bonus of 5Armour, 5MR, 5AP, 5AD and 5MS at the start of each game for each season you've been playing for, but this is basically what it feels like for new players.\n\nSure new runes reforged allieviate the raw stat advantages a bit, but the locking summoner spells is outdated and was only really necessary for the beta, since any new player getting into league now probably found out about it from a friend or a youtube video and likely has at least some basic knowledge of what a moba is.\n\nAlso stop telling new players to build a fuckin thornmail on Ashe. The meme is dead, you've had waayyy too long to fix this. I had to explain to my sister that Riot doesn't play their own game, and they just picked an item with a dartboard, and that all the good players build the items on op.gg (this isn't true but it's better than nothing).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T11:52:35.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">is thinking clarity is viable\n\nTotally wasn't me.\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}} \n\n___\n\nIn all seriousness though, you make good points, and I can only speak to my experience. I started way back in 2013, but there's two things that probably made the most difference to my experience. \n\nThe first is that previously I had little to no experience with online multiplayer games and no experience at all with MOBAs, all I'd played was either single player or couch coop really. The second is that I levelled with a group of equally new people (we started it as a LAN party thing) so the people I was playing with and against were way more likely to be either new or really really bad. I'd also never seen any youtube or anything of the like about the game, I picked it up because my brother played it and the cinematics were cool.\n\nRanked also wasn't on my radar for the longest time, so by the time I played ranked beyond placements I had well and truly hundreds of normal games and went straight to gold after a quick placement detour through low bronze, so I guess that's another pain point I dodged.\n\nI think the biggest issue is there's no real middle ground. Pre 30 is treated as the new player experience, but then once you hit 30 you're dumped straight into ranked (let's be honest most people at least try the queue) when realistically you more than likely aren't ready for it. Even when it took longer to level, I sure as hell didn't know what all or even most champions did when I hit level 30.\n\nThat and a bunch of little things like recommended items being super outdated or just generally wonky doesn't make for the best new player experience for sure. Ultimately that's why I think that little quiz is the best way to gauge what each player needs. A completely new and inexperienced player needs a bit more time and a bit more handholding, where someone coming from DOTA or youtube videos would know the basics at least and don't need those level caps. \n\nI frankly also think ranked should be locked behind at least lvl 50 now, but there are legitimate reasons to level a new account for ranked and it would hurt that for sure. Maybe link it to your main account to have it unlock sooner or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-27T04:45:41.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but there is still also the argument that new players should be learning how the game itself functions before learning all the extras\n\nI get this argument for genuine new players.\n\nBut how many genuine new players are there really?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T04:57:05.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">I think a good middle ground would come in the form of that thing they ask you when you make a new account (if they still do) regarding your previous experience or lack thereof with League and MOBAs in general.

Runes being unchangeable until level 8 and then suddenly you have to do it causes more issues than it solves. Also, the spell levels are remarkably similar to what they were seven years ago. You get flash at level eight instead of ten now. massive change.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-27T01:08:11.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one was trying to make an excuse FYI .... this is largely an opinionated post by you and I supplied my opinion in the matter so unless you got some sample that proves this, it’s gonna be an opinionated discussion","replies":[]}]}]}]}
