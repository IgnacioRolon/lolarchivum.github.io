I didn't say that these champs are seen all the time. I went through the champion list and picked all the champs which in my opinion are really good in URF. Not including other champs which i'm not aware of, or if someone knows how to play them well in urf can be really strong. Lastly it has been stated that a lot of the same champs are seen a lot of the time. This is either because people reroll the shit champs untill they get something that is either not trash, or they can decently play. Because even a good champ given to someone who doesn't know how to play him is useless. Or they just have mostly the good/fun champs already. Lets not forget that seeing the same champs constantly is a bit too much of a coincidence and basically what you're saying is that something like 70% of the community are level 1-30 \"smurfs\" with a handful of champs, just for urf. I bet they're russians too ay? Do they melt steel beams with fet fuel as well? And it is not fun to be forced to play a champion you can't play or don't even like but get because he's free to play. Same goes for a cahmpion you can't play very well in general or in urf.\n\nIncorrect. choosing what to play is always more fun. You just can't stand the idea that someone else will pick a champ that is fun in this game mode so you want riot to force him not to.

That is the simple honest to god truth, it is not my fault you don't have enough muscle between your fucking ears to understand that urf is random because you douches thought a meta would be a good thing to create. All variance of the mode had dropped out and there was at least 4 if not more of the same 10 or so champions were picked every single god damn urf game, it was an actual fact that there was a 1/1200 ratio of games not including at least 2 of those 10 said champions and a 1/4000 without at least 1, which caused a staleness to the game, thus ARURF. \n\nSo get off your fucking highchair and live with it.\n\nI get it, you're a 12 year old, but that doesn't make your thoughts reality, you aren't a god as you so believe.

Yet you keep repeating \"meta\" you clearly can't even argue and defend your own argument. Every single champion had a perk. Fuzz was untouchable, zed spammed, soraka silenced, lulu polymorphed, bard got a meep upgrade every 2 chimes, thresh and blitz had hook etc. And almost all coul be countered. Those who couldn't were usually banned. and if you didn't ban the champions you concidered anoying then you're the problem not the game mode. I have seen countless games where people leave in champ in select, reroll (and if they don't have rolls they have to stick with the champ), people complain they can't play the champ, people not having playing the champ even if they are winning cos they can't play him.\n\nNot only are you mentally incapable of handling this relaity, that people want to play the champion they want to play. They also don't want to be forced to play stuff they don't want to by trisomy patients such as yourself. You have thus far shown you are intellectually incapable of defending your own argument, you simply repeat it. You can't even respond to the other person's argument, such as in my case i lireally made a list of all the good champs seen in urf...and you (wait for it) repeated that it was meta. \n\nOfcourse some people play some champions more than others. Zed is a well known champ for high burst and mobility even in norms. You have to have severe neurological depravity to not understand why people pick him. Or veigar, or nasus, or blitz.\n\nIf you are tired of seeing the same champs. Go play aram, there is already a game mode for people like you. And much like twisted treeline, there is a reason most people don't play it.
