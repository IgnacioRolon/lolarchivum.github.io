I played a fair bit of old Evelynn, too. God, I miss the old classic of Boots of Mobility and five Sunfire Capes and just killing anyone due to her one-minute long stealth that wouldn&#039;t break if you were under their feet. That&#039;s nostalgia talking, though.\r\n\r\n**So, Evelynn, Really? You? Aren&#039;t you an Annie one-trick?**\r\n\r\nMhm. It depends on the day, but I have played and learned the basics of every champion. I would have never been able to beat Orianna if I didn&#039;t play her and learn her ranges, her damage scaling, her highs, and her lows. It&#039;s the same with _all_ champions. Annie has a bad reputation for being easy, but I like to challenge that and state that she&#039;s just like Riven or Zed. Easy to play, hard to master. But, back on topic.\r\n\r\nThe new Evelynn has done her justice. She&#039;s more mechanical than mashing Q over and over and maybe throwing in an E every now and then. I think she&#039;s a balanced champ that excels in what she does. She has very little lane presence until 6, and that&#039;s a massive hit considering most jungle champions have insane lane presence pre-6 and it just gets worse when they are level 6. Lee Sin, Elise, Twitch... need I continue?\r\n\r\nMoving her stealth up was a good idea. I think Twitch should get a similar mechanic. I&#039;m just going to say it right now. Stealth _is_ an antifun mechanic. I am looking at you, Rengar, Talon, Kha&#039;Zix. Being able to stealth in the middle of a fight without some sort of delay or counterplay isn&#039;t a fun mechanic to verse, but all those champs had counters for it. The key point: the didn&#039;t get it until level 6. Evelynn was the only champion that got it off the bat. Twitch could get it, but most didn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nHer level 2 cheese was unmatched as it was almost impossible to see coming as no one buys pinks level 1. I have never seen someone, besides a support, which was done pre refilling potions, buy a pink level 1.\r\n\r\nOnto her abilities.\r\n\r\n**Q - Hate Spike**: I hate and dislike her new Q. It took me a little bit to actually get it in my head I could not spam it against champions like I do in the jungle. This is an issue on me, I know, but it was extremally daunting to realise that, &quot;Oh, crap! MY Q&#039;s on cooldown for another 4 seconds! I need to _leave_!&quot;. I do, however, like that it&#039;s reliant on hitting a skillshot to get the full effect. Missing it is pretty much a &#039;next time&#039; option. It severely cuts your damage.\r\n\r\n**W - Allure**: Actually a really well-done ability. One, it should proc 0.5s quicker on creatures because unless you&#039;re smart about your clears, you&#039;re slowing yourself down using it, especially with your Q being spammable constantly. I also like how it pretty much tells the enemy where she is by a small arrow. Thank God for counterplay because this ability is cancer. 9/10, the enemy will get stuck on your character model and be unable to move. This also happens with monsters in the jungle. If you exploit this, you can barely take any damage from your red buff because it will get stuck on you and just spin around and not attack. Two, it makes you actually utilise your stealth and manoeuvring to get the charm off. Sneaky sneaky.\r\n\r\n**E - Whiplash**: A generic ability that is okay-ish. It&#039;s great for tanks. Max this if you&#039;re versing tank champs and watch them cry.\r\n\r\n**R - Last Caress**: The ability that makes Veigar cry himself to sleep every night. I love and hate this ability. I really do. People are upset that an assassin finally has an ability an assassin should have. Her old ultimate made zero sense. I don&#039;t have much to say on it, to be honest. I would rather you got rid of the marker indicating when it can kill someone as that&#039;s nonsense and should not be in the game.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThat is about it. My hands hurt and my queue popped.\r\n\r\nWell done on Evelynn, Riot. She was a change for the better.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-10-16T04:16:36.825+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Broken Scripts, it's cool to see people's thoughts on the new Evelynn, I have been playing her a decent amount myself and really enjoying it so far!

I honestly don't think it's Twitch, per se, but generic stealth that he has. He is exactly what Eve was prior to her rework. A nuisance in the jungle. I am talking about jungle Twitch. I really don't want to get into. The moral of it is his stealth at level 1 should not be 10 seconds. That is from the scuttle to the middle of mid lane. No wards are going to help when there are six paths he can take to gank mid lane.\n\n-\n\nHer Q was a mistake. I was meant to say that I like and dislike the ability but my mind went somewhere else. I dislike that it's the same 'q spamfest' but like that it now provides more than just mashing Q. Her jungle clears are nice.\n\nI really hope I didn't give off that I want her changed. I like the change. I like exactly how she is. Even the smallest tweak at this point could break her.","replies":[]}]}]}
