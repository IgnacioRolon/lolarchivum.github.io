You **only** build it for the active, and even then it's only fully worth on champs that have effects that persist through the invulnerability _(Kennen/Fiddle etc)_\n\nPlus if you want to build it early _(to counter something like Zed or Fizz)_ you absolutely screw yourself over.

The sad thing is, you have no choice because not building it early screws you over even more.\n\nAnd then as if you weren't putting yourself behind enough by rushing Zhonyas, Zed just builds a serrated dirk as a first item _(no matter what build path he takes)_, which makes Zhonyas an even less effective buy.\n\nMark my words, mages don't build this because they want it _(they would much much rather have a deathcap or a Liandries)_, they build it because they feel they have no other choice. Not to mention it is the only AP armour item in the game, so against an AD heavy team, you have literally no build choice, unlike AD champs and magic resist.\n\nIm not sure what item Broken Scripts is referring to, _(I thought it was serrated dirk at first, but it's even less gold to get that...)_ but assuming it is hex drinker, unlike Zhonyas, it is an item that most assassins build anyway _(for the extra lethality if nothing else)_, and the shield is good against teams even without many AP champs, as there is a lot of hybrid damage these days, most tanks deal magic damage without you even realising how much they do, Ornn/Mundo/Garen etc. So the shield almost never goes to waste.","replies":[{"poster":"Honey Possum","date":"2017-10-27T02:04:34.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zhonyas has many uses, depending on who you play you can use it after one spell rotation (kassadin?) then go again once its down.

You're pulling it into late game where no one is talking about it. Even then, only a select few champions actually benefit from building Zhonyas.\n\nThe whole point is being forced to spend 2900 gold when Zed can spend 1300 and have a better item that does not hinder him. Maw has amazing stats that fit Zed, regardless. Sure, his damage may be gimped for a little bit, but not as much as the caster that had to blow 2900 on an item just so they don't get 100/0'd under their turret every 75 seconds.\n\nMost mages tend to have asinine mana costs to offset their burst and poke. Annie, for example, has enough mana to do two rotations at level 3 before she's nearly OOM. Granted, she has a free farming ability that offsets that, but you get the point. Not building a Morellonomicon is a massive hit in her laning, trading, and damage.\n\nSeekers isn't going to stop Zed from all-inning you and teleporting halfway across the lane, is it?","replies":[{"poster":"Honey Possum","date":"2017-10-27T02:57:22.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why you only rush it into zed and fizz, in those cases it does have uses early game. I dont see why you think this is a bad thing, it's part of what makes the game good, being able to react to opponents and adjust your build to compensate for their strengths. Maw is not a 1300 item, assuming you are talking about hexdrinker it does have good stats, but they are a 1300 gold items stats. i feel like you keep quoting the prices and and trying to put them on the same level. Zhonya is better than hexdrinker and thus it costs more. \n\nSeekers is basically the armour for mage counterpart to hexdrinker, and it is quite good. It offers 35 AP and 45 Armour! 45 armour is pretty damn good and it sure can stop a zed all in if you play well, considering how much it should reduce his damage output. The game is far too situational to simplify like that. It depends on how well you trade before the all in etc. etc.\n\nAlso just building lost chapter greatly helps in lane, moreso than morello tbh because you are levelling up more\n\n In the end the items are different.\nHexdrinker helps zed survive once he gets low. Zhonyas prevents you from getting popped.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-27T06:23:27.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> depending on who you play\n\nThis is my point.\n_\"Youll do fine.... just as long as you happen to pick someone to whom Zhonyas isn't a piece of shit waste of space\"_\n\nTheres no options. If you're AD and struggling against AP you've got Maw or Edge of night to consider and thats without even going outside  normal assassin items that you will probably build anyway, you just have to decide what one to build first.\n\nif you're AP, struggling, and Zhonyas works for your champion, great! build Zhonyas! If youre AP struggling and Zhonyas doesn't work for your champion, that sucks! build Zhonyas!\n\n> build seekers armguard then finish their first item THEN finish zhonya\n\nThats the problem, the item only counters Zed/Fizz and the like when it's completely finished. _(The armour doesn't help at all against Fizz, and if you have bought Seekers, then Zed will have already bought his Serrated Dirk, which negates a lot of your armour anyway.)_\n\n> Many champions can make use of zhonyas beyond what you stated.\n\nYea, many can, and many can't, and many don't want to, and many can but would much rather have a Liandries, or a deathcap, or pretty much any other item in the game instead.\n\n> I feel you are only seeing this from your pov too, fizz forces you to build zhonya? And you lose your sustain from it? You just have to manage your mana better whilst he loses considerable all in power.\n\nWhat?\nFizz _forces_ you to build an item that you would normally NOT build, _(an item where 50% of its stats are 100% useless against him i might add, but you still HAVE to build it)_, purely, so that you don't die EVERY time he engages on you. Meanwhile Fizz enjoys life as usual because he pretty much has a free Zhonyas on one of his abilities, Im sorry I didnt realise Fizz was the one getting the short end of the stick here.\n\nIf I could force someone to buy an item that has 50% wasted stats against me, and decimates their early game potential, for no other reason than because I happened to be in the game, id be frickin thrilled. Thats 90% of my job done for me just by picking a champ.\n\nremember that Zhonyas doesn't help you kill Fizz or Zed, it only helps them not kill you.\nIt doesn't actually give you any advantage, it just removes some of the disadvantage they passively have over you. So the best thing you can do with Zhonyas, is break even with them. It doesn't give you an edge. Its not a 'counter' its an 'anti-be-countered-by' item.","replies":[{"poster":"Honey Possum","date":"2017-10-28T07:19:01.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You quote my depending on who you play out of context. Depending on who you play zhonyas can be useful in different ways, but it is always useful in some way.\n\n\"Thats the problem, the item only counters Zed/Fizz and the like when it's completely finished.\"\nSeekers armguard counters Zed pretty well on its own. He serrated dirk shreds nowhere near the amount of armour you purchase. It is shredding around 10, and armguard gives 45. \nConsider Banshees into fizz if you want a more optimal buildpath, it works pretty well too. (Whats this??? Another option???)\n\n\"Yea, many can, and many can't, and many don't want to, and many can but would much rather have a Liandries, or a deathcap, or pretty much any other item in the game instead.\"\nSure as a mid laner we would all like to build pure damage. But you just can't do that lol. Many different cases in the game require you to adjust your build, e.g. if you build that banshees against fizz he might end up having to build void staff so he deals significant damage again. You dont see them on here complaining, Why should i have to build MP when enemy builds MR? \nFizz and Zed are all in champs with burst, so you build an anti burst item, it's as simple as MP into MR. \n\nYour last paragraph is stupid as tbh, removing some disadvantage inherently gives you more of an advantage.  You are just quibbling over the wheres and whys. \n\nAbout what you said here \"Zed just builds a serrated dirk as a first item (no matter what build path he takes), which makes Zhonyas an even less effective buy.\"\n\nDirk doesnt counter Armour. It counters a lack of armour. Buying Seekers literally counters dirk not the other way around. The more armour you have the less effective flat pen is, you need percentage. Thus zhonyas is a MORE effective buy into zed","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-10-28T08:19:17.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do I have to spend 3250 gold to counter AP bursters?
