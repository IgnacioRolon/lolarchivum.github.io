An Ezreal that doesnt have an item at 25 minutes and a Diana that engages whether she has 1000 Hp or 1 Hp. This game was a loss from the start and following multiple losses at the hands of trolls and just bad players &#039;Also myself for playing badly in one or two&#039; I was upset and mad at how every game seemed to be controlled by the deciding factor of, if your mid or adc was bad, you were most likely going to lose.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the Chat:\r\nActually, That happens again and Im going to afk.

As you know Riot's policy will punish someone that breakes the rules, regardless of who they are doing it too. If you didn't backlash like that, you wouldn't have been banned.\n\nIf you honestly read your words to yourself and say \"that isn't abuse, I shouldn't be banned for abusing and swearing at strangers online, ffs rito\" then no one here can help you. Don't blame Riot because you get pissed.\n\nThey will not unban you, because of your over toxic levels of hate towards your OWN team. And btw, that's not how the report system works at all.\nFair enough, maybe EZ should be punished too. But that doesn't change the fact that you should be punished aswell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-21T05:46:28.697+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are different kinds of abuse, and telling someone\n> Very honestly cant be bothered with you dickheads\n\nor\n\n> PROBABLY CAUSE ALL YOU DIMWITS HAVE AN IQ OF 10!\n\nor even moreso\n\n> EZREAL< I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, YOU ARE STUPID! THATS WHY WE ARE LOSING! \n\nDEFINITELY qualifies. If you can't see this sort of behaviour as abuse then you need to take a good long look at yourself. \n\nIf someone said to you, that you have an IQ of 10, and that you're a dumb piece of shit how would you feel? I imagine quite angry and rightly so. How do you think someone would react if you said that to their face. If you screamed at them that they're stupid. They'd be pretty angry, and they would be perfectly justified in being so. \n\nTake another look at the things you said, and take a good long look at the definition of abuse, because this is definitely abuse, and not just one line where you got a bit mad and didn't take your hand off the keyboard when you should have. This is consistent and targeted abuse. \n\nSo, yes, you deserved the suspension, and if you don't take another look at your behaviour (and it doesn't matter in the slightest what the other person is doing), you're going to get hit with a perma.","replies":[{"poster":"Draconus Millius","date":"2016-01-21T06:43:10.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Guess Ill just get on one of my 7 other accounts and troll then :D Cause that seems to be significantly less punished and much harder to prove and punish, so I guess if I don't think Im gonna get a win may as well troll the fuck out of every team mate I get :D If you can't get the change, become the change as they say, since trolls never get banned or suspended I can say im probably safe in doing it! :D","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-21T07:20:00.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can confirm wont get banned, i trolled me way from 1-30 troll your heart out riot doesnt care.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2016-02-13T07:09:45.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly none of that should result in an actual ban.\nsure some of it might warrant a minor chat restriction, but that shits still pretty tame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-13T05:53:12.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm I can't see why you would have been punished. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nWhy is my man's arm not showing up?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2016-01-21T07:25:37.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Draconus Millius,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WqPwrNnE,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-01-21T05:28:23.136+0000)\n>\n> First off this is the game I just played for which I got a 14 day Suspension, Obviously not on this account, but seriously?

They are defending trolls/afkers/kids who intentionally ruin this game as long as they dont type anything in chat....\n\nAnd yes, of course I get tilted when I get matched with people who have half of my support dmg just because they use their ults to steal farm from my adc( like lux I played with last game), or get Karthus in jungle who is laughing to my friends who gets wrecked in lane because we have no real jungler to help them, used ult only to KS and farmed jungle 30 minutes, I am toxic to these people. But Im NEVER toxic to ANYONE who is trying to win game even they are not doing well.\n\n\nLeague of Legends policy is officialy defending trolls, so feel free to log in game, feed, afk, report anyone you dont like, report them for ugly name, report them for not saying \"thank you\" when you kill them, report them when they wreck you in lane, or when you lose against them and eventually they will get banned, because NOBODY in support center cares about what you did for this game or why you got tilted in 3 games when you are playing as a nice normal human being unless you are matched with some frustrated kids who are ruining games on purpose.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
