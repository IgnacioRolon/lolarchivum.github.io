All it does is turn the exact same damage from burst into damage over time, something that ADCs can actually cope with.\n\nI think that buffing deaths dance passive to something ridiculous would be a good start, QSS just negated the damage, which makes zed feel bad and necessitated him to be balanced around the chance that his ult would do nothing, meaning more damage was pumped into his kit as compensation.\nDamage deference on the other hand not so much as because his damage hasnt been negated, he doesnt need to have higher numbers elsewhere to compensate and his BS burst can be reacted to.\n\nSomething like 50% of damage dealt to the ADC is converted to a stacking DoT over 3 seconds.\nThe full damage is still dealt, so the ADC is no tankier than before, but the adc isnt immediately taken out of the fight.\n\nThat means that the adc now gets 3s of lifesteal to react before the ultimate kicking in","replies":[]}]}
