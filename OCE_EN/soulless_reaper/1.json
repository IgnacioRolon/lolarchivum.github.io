So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-04-19T03:54:21.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you're right I still just think it's a tad weird that me feeding that much I deserve a D, just a bit weird.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-19T04:19:53.647+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feed your way to S, and get those chests and keys!\nYou can do it, I believe in you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-04-21T01:20:20.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your first issue is that you somehow think KDA is even remotely relevant to how well a player performs in a given game.
