The first time i try and link its an instant cast and the blade goes on cooldown and stays in my bag. Both my support and I have the buff but the link is not showing and the bonus damage isnt working/showing. When i ult my support gets it but cant control it and just ends up on top of me. Trying to buff another champion doesnt work and selling and rebuying the item doesnt work.","replies":[]}
