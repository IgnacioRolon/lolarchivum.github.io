I haven't made a ticket myself, and no one said that *they* made a ticket, so naturally I thought handing it over to the people who are actually related to the company that made the game would be better than anything I can offer. It's not exactly like I can change the programming of it.\n\nMan, I wish the reds wouldn't completely ignore my posts. I'd be able to tell them a lot about the issues that a lot of people are facing, and possible solutions to them within the programming of the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-07T05:24:50.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something glitched, that's for sure.
