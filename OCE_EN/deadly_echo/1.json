When the account is created, where do the details of your name go? Also, who owns the account if it is given to a friend? As an example, my friend has more than 1 account and wants to give me one. I now have the email address set to my own and have changed the password so only I know it BUT, who owns the account? At the end of the day does it actually matter what name is used when signing up; in terms of who plays on the account? \r\n\r\nIt might not seem an issue to some and tbh it&#039;s not really an issue for me... it&#039;s more that I&#039;m OCD and I want my name on the account I was given! Thanks all","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-10-09T03:47:00.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, legally its not an issue, as you have  aggreed for rights to operate or loan certain things in the game with and without paying money for.\n\nIt's similar to hiring something except its virtual instead of physical.\n\n Remember you dont pay just to aqiure something. You can pay to receive a service or in this case, the hiring of an account (From scratch, not your mates). Think of it like hiring a car, then telling your mate you dont use it anymore so he can have it.... Which you can't.\n\n The only difference is you dont have to pay for the hire (Such as the free account), just pay for the fuel (Such as the RP to get skin's, icons or champ). \n\nFuel disappears, just like the skins and RP etc would after the account becomes inactive or permabanned. Hope this helps.\n\n Anyone else feel free to elaborate on this one lol. If you get what i mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Deadly Echo","date":"2017-10-09T06:18:35.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many digs at Riot that I had to delete just now lol.
