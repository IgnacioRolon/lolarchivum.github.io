Since tuesday the 12.03.2019 every 3min ingame ive got a 30sec lag spike. In none of the other games I play I have had that issue. Ive tried turning off my anti virus, still the same, turning off firewall, still the same, downloading haste, still the same, comepletly reinstalling league, worked for one game and then the lag came back. My ping even reaches all the way too 1300ping !!! \nI even called my internet provider to check the line, also all good. There seems to be a connection problem with the league servers ???\nThis is very annoying and makes the game unplayable. At least you can time it as it is exactly every 3min so you just fall back but you cant win games that way ...\nIve send a ticket at the support service and waiting for a respond. Hoping to get a fix soon.\nPlaying on EUW by the way.","replies":[]}]}
