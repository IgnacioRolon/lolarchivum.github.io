Enemies hit are dragged towards Nautilus and he simultaneously dashes to them, dealing them magic damage and briefly stunning them.\r\n\r\nYasuo Ult: Yasuo blinks to the nearest visible airborne enemy champion to the cursor, instantly generating maximum Flow.

To be clear, a **Knockup** is exclusively when a target is displaced vertically. **Airborne** is when a target is displaced in any direction _(Vertically and horizontally)_ Basically if their feet leave the ground for any reason other than their own choosing, it counts as airborne, _(and being grabbed by a giant anchor would knock you off your feet, as it were :P)_\n\nThis means that Yasuo can activate his ult off pull/knockback displacement effects such as: Nautilus's Q, Blitz's Q, and Darius's E, as well as regular knockup effects such as Fizz's R, Vi's R, Malphite's R, Yasuo's Q, etc etc. So because the champion's feet leave the ground, they are technically airborne, even if only briefly.\n\nThe only displacement effect that Yasuo can not ult off _(to my knowledge)_, is Poppy's R, as Keepers verdict causes it's targets to be untargetable for the duration. \n\nIf Yasuo's R worked only on knockups, then it wouldnt work on Nami's Q, as Aqua Prison does not **knock up** enemies, it **suspends** them.\n\nSo I think that it is intended that Yasuo can ult off Nautilus's Q.","replies":[{"poster":"BigJimm","date":"2017-01-17T00:26:58.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I would agree with the difference between knock up and airborne and I agree with your' statement:\n\"Basically if their feet leave the ground for any reason other than their own choosing, it counts as airborne\"\n\nI think my only remaining complaint if we are to assume that being grabbed by a giant anchor knocks you off your' feet is that the wording of Nautilus Q should be updated because I stand with my original point:\n\"...you cannot 'drag' something that is airborne\"\n\nThanks for the insight =]","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-17T01:22:41.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must agree that the wording is often misleading _(and not just with Nautilus either)_\n\nBoth Nautilus's Q and Skarner's R are referred to as a 'drag', yet both have completely different CC effects.\n\nNaut's Q is a knockback/pull displacement (pops Taliyah's Rocks, and activates Yasuo's R), while Skarner's R is a suppression (which neither breaks the rocks nor \nactivates Yasuo's Ult).\n\nBut they are both called the same thing?\n\nI personally reckon there needs to be a cleanup of wording across the whole of league. \n_(and also take another look at what classes as a 'projectile' as Taliyah's R and Azir's Q should not be blocked by Braum/Yasuo's walls)_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-01-21T00:06:14.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo should be able to ult zac mid air tbh, would be a nice counterplay mechanic to a zac launching in with ori ball on him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-17T02:13:44.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> by definition you cannot 'drag' something that is airborne.\n\nI'm going to have to call bullsh!t on this.
