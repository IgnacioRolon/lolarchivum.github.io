We expected:\n\n * Some sort of spinoff game-mode at a standard similar to URF\n  * _League of Draven&#039;s in-game implementation was shallow (I&#039;ll come back to this) so it didn&#039;t meet that standard._\n * Skins, Icons, earnables etc.\n  * _This was done well (including the Draven shop)_\n * Lots of publicity\n  * _It was hard to miss that League of Draven was happening, so mission accomplished here._\n  * _Personally, would like a time/countdown for OCE/worldwide. I wasn&#039;t sure if things would start at 00:00 AEST or 00:00 PST or 00:00 EST_\n * The option to opt out\n  * _Normally with aesthetics-only changes this doesn&#039;t matter (like those winter maps), but the Draven heads were interfering with clarity_\n  * _This can be handled by explicitly explaining how to toggle the features on/off, or setting it aside as a separate game-mode (the latter is a better option coz then you have a bunch of people sharing a celebratory spirit, probs more work to implement though)_\n\n---\n\nIt wasn&#039;t obvious that Draven would cause this much backlash (most people laughed at first), so the lack of an obvious opt-out is forgivable.\n\n**However**, the shallow in-game implementation of League of Draven is a significant oversight, because this is the basis of engagement - it gives reason to buy the skins/earn the icons etc.\n\nSo even though the skins and rewards were there, and the publicity  was great, **there was no solid way to celebrate Draven**. This ends up looking like an over-publicized skin sale that gets labelled &quot;a cash grab&quot;.\n\nNow that&#039;s established, let&#039;s get straight into it. Ways that League of Draven could have been more of a game mode:\n---\n> #A more engaging League of Draven - Ideas\n\n1. ##Draven Axe Mode\nBasic attacks and spells cause a draven axe to bounce into the air. Anyone who catches a draven axe gets a boost of movespeed and has their cooldowns reduced by 0.5 seconds. This will break some champions for sure ~~-Ezreal-~~ but provides lots of room for experimenting with different champs. With all the raining Draven axes, teamfights would be galore of chaos where even the best of axe-catchers can&#039;t expect to catch every axe. Lots of potential to outplay opponents by catching their axes.\n* ##Draven Personality Mode\nYour Draven head scales in size to your KDA. This means if you&#039;re 3/0/2, your head is pretty massive, compared to Bob who is 1/4/2. This makes you want to keep your KDA as high as possible for narcissistic purposes. This tilts Bob. How big can your head get?\n* ##Definitely not Draven Mode\nEveryone&#039;s name is Draven, everyone looks like draven, looking at someone else&#039;s inventory is just full of axes. You only know who you are and you have no idea who anyone else is until they start using skills.\n* ##Draven Bonus Mode\nEveryone gets Draven&#039;s passive, but stacks build over time instead of by catching axes. Killing an enemy champion grants bonus gold according to how many stacks of adoration you have. Shutting down an enemy who was on a killing spree grants double the bounty.\n* ##Draven Summoner Mode\nNew summoner spell: (used in this mode only) Draven&#039;s ult - whirling death, scales with AP too, 20 second cooldown. Helps teach people more map awareness and dodging skillshots.\n\n\n---\nOther ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2016-04-02T22:42:15.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes plz, especially Def not draven mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"Greatest Fan of","date":"2016-04-30T02:35:26.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that you are hired.
