Just curious if there&#039;s a setting where i can do this or something similar?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-15T00:12:01.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is. When you go into the settings there are 2 types of attack move.\n\n\"Attack Move\" where you press a button, the range of your champion is shown then you click where you want to attack\n\"Attack Move Click\" which is a movement command that tells your champion to attack the closest target to the point you selected.\n\nYou just need to bind it to something. I think by default attack move is on A and attack move click is on V.","replies":[{"poster":"gabê","date":"2018-11-15T06:58:51.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyouuuuu appreciate this a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-15T02:37:14.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"correct. \n\nI have it bound to MH4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-11-17T11:57:27.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"or you could simply just right click enemies and you auto them....","replies":[]}]}]}
