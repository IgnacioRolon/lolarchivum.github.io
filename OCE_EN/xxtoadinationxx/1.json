I know that 3v3 borders won&#039;t show up in 5v5 (not that we have that option anyway) but will ranked teams and solo queue be separate?\r\n\r\nSo if my ranked 5&#039;s team was higher than my solo queue ranking, would my ranked 5&#039;s team border show on all Summoner&#039;s Rift matches (5v5 ranked, team builder, blind pick, solo queue) or would it only show in ranked 5&#039;s and my solo queue border would be the one that shows for all other matches.\r\n\r\nI think I remember season 3 being map specific, so it was just whichever Summoner&#039;s Rift ranking was higher, but I haven&#039;t heard if it has changed or not.","replies":[]}
