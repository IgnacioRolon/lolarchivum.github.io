Last year I had too much IP and ended up buying all the runes from Tier 1 to Tier 3, but part way through Tier 2 I couldn&#039;t buy anymore, not even the Tier 3 runes I wanted to get for some champs to use.\r\n\r\nWhy is there a tier limit? Despite that, is there any way to get rid of the lower tier runes so I can just buy all the Tier 3 runes instead?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-19T07:45:22.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThere's no tier limit, just a hard limit imposed by the game on how many runes you can own total. I can't recall the hard limit exactly.\n\nIf you wish to have any content removed from your account, you'll need to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support as they're the only ones who can assist with account-specific inquiries.","replies":[]}]}
