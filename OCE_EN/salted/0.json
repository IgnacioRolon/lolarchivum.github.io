She always was a really good champion.\n\nNow with the removal of DFG she is more stronger in comparison to those who needed it before, compared to and versing. She has a dash with no cool down if you keep hitting your Qs which aren’t hard, she’s got great base defensive stats which allows her to survive laning phase as a melee caster.\n\nAlso, her W buff was probably stronger than Riot intended. Now with the damaging spheres moving twice as fast, she can damage faster meaning she doesn’t need to stick to her target as long as she used to to blow up all 3 spheres and it also means she gains the shield a lot faster which scales quite well throughout the game.\n\nAlso, she has an AoE mini Orianna ultimate which synergizes well with other people’s ultimates providing she has the safety of Zhonyas and is a great champion to set up Last Breath.\n\nSo overall she was never a weak champion. I used to play her a lot with great success, but Kassadin fits me more :P\n\n{{champion:131}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:131}}","replies":[]}]}
