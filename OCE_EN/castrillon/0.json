In your case, where you already have many pages you would have had a couple of different things apply:\n\n* You get to keep your Rune Pages in the new system (no need to refund them)\n* For Rune Pages that you purchased with IP, we gave you back 1,500 blue essence (via the Rune Collector mission)\n* For Rune Pages purchased with RP, we would give you an epic skin, 1 skin per 4 pages (via the Rune Archivist mission)\n\nFrom what you've said it sounds like you might have purchased most of yours with IP ?  If you used RP to purchase any pages, you should have a Rune Archivist mission to complete, which would get you epic skin(s).\n\nThe full info on this is in the Runes section of the [Preseason FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908)\n\nLet me know if that helps!\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
