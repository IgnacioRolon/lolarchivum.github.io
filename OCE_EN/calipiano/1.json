It's really annoying since you think you have dodged the CC, in fact,  you have been hit and you character just lags on the spot.","replies":[{"poster":"Calipiano","date":"2019-08-24T08:24:11.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow is it?

If none of that helps support can walk you through a more detailed troubleshooting process.

You can have packet loss without high ping otherwise, so it's possible if your connection to the game servers are only just coping this could be the result since more things going on = more packets that have to make it through.\n\nAt any rate, my first recommendations are to run a client repair and to switch to an ethernet connection (if at all possible) and see if either resolves the issue.\n\nPast that, follow through any solutions in this guide that you haven't yet: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nAnd failing that, submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
