FPS Lag, Even Ping is strangely higher.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Legacy Client : 200-300 FPS, 21 Ping (Normal Ping)\n\nAlpha Client: My Normal Ping is now 36 (15 Ping Higher). Others may think 36 is not that high yeah sure if that was my normal ping than I'd be fine but normally its 21 and the fact it sits at 36 now which feels like its 60 ping. Throwing out my abilities/ or pinging or using active items I actually see the delay now. \n\nI sent the LoL Zip file using Hextech repair tool kit to Support. Hopefully they understand what it is. Even in that log it says 17 ping. So My net is fine.\n","replies":[]}
