I want to get out of bronze so I can play with more experienced players so I too can gain experience and useful skills rather than \"how to deal with toxic behaviour 101\".\r\n\r\nI'm not into the whole full serious practising vs bots and communicating via skype stuff, I mean that could possibly come down the track but right now I just want to have someone who will duo with me and hopefully get better together, and gtfo of Bronze.\r\n\r\nAs the title says, I don't want to be playing with a duo partner who is 12 years old, just someone keen to climb the ranks with me by getting to know each others game style and learn whats good and whats bad and what's going to help us win games and especially no toxic behaviour or someone with rage issues.\r\n\r\nCheers fellas","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-10T15:32:40.511+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"You willing to run a few normals so i can gauge skill level?","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-14T07:23:03.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://oce.op.gg/summoner/?userName=Skunken --> not found","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-02-10T22:46:16.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Move to Korea, OCE is an Ocean filled with immature trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2015-02-13T08:40:39.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Said the guy that want to go pro and got bronze again this season.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grumpy Smurf","date":"2015-02-13T04:07:37.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Grump Smurf\n\n32y/o and i play daily\n if im duo with someone i like to Skype with them just for the communication in game. \nStarted in S3 after promo and been bouncing between S5 and S3.

Born in 85 so a little bit older. Cbf with voice comms, Im sure my young wife doesn't want to hear our geek speak anyway but if it came to full time competitive gaming that would be a different story. I have played LOL on and off casually for about 3 years, recently spending a lot more time playing than in earlier years. I have a very small friends list. Not many players to add really. I'm not concerned with your skill level, I feel a duo team grows together with experience and learning your partners play style. I'd love to have a game sometime, good, bad or ugly, it's nice to have other enthusiast mature gamers to match with. \n\nI will attempt to add anyone serious about mature game play from this thread, hopefully we can link up a group on oceania, I'm sure there is one around I just haven't found it yet. Going to check out the OLD PEOPLE HERE chat. I can see there a few less than constructive comments on your message. Just ignore and move on.\n\nI was Silver 2 now Bronze 4 and falling. I'm not a bad player, the solo q is a hard life with a lot of not so great and hormonal kids playing.\n\n**Please add me Robsy - I play daily (ONCE THIS PATCH UNSPECIFIED ERROR IS RECTIFIED)**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-02-11T08:10:30.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm old.
