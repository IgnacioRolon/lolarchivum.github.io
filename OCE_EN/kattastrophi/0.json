The issue with the rune pages is that you can't save your runes. It will then give a random set of runes, when you can save your runes it will STILL give a random rune page. I hope I'm not the only one experiencing this issue, this needs to be fixed right away!","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2020-02-05T03:45:11.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, this patch has completely broken the game. This and the huge MS increase are game-changing bugs that Riot doesn't seem to have acknowledged. Good job, Riot Games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-05T03:41:31.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A clean reinstall has been reported successful for many (unfortunately not all) players experiencing Rune Page drama, so that's probably going to be your best bet. \n\nThe easiest way to run a clean reinstall is via the Hextech Repair Tool: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool\n\nAnother thing you could try would be to sync your computer clock, as that can sometimes cause weird issues.","replies":[]}]}
