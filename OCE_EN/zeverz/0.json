He is easy. Lets not beat around the bush, once you get the timing of his Q, and know when and when not to ult, he's fairly simple. \n2. Not only is he easy but he is very very powerful (which is a terrible combination). With a Q that removes over 1/4 of the enemies HP at lvl 1, he's a huge lane bully, and is near impossible to bully back, and picking him into AP heavy teams is a death sentence for the enemy. \n3. Hes boring, you can almost count on your fingers the number of voice lines he has, and they are the most generic you can get _\"I will protect\"_, _\"Moving out\"_, _\"I will not fail\"_. Even a child could think of a more interesting personality. Compared to the majesty of Aurelion Sol, or the terrifying beauty of Jhin, Galio is little more than background noise. On top of this, his play style is boring and clunky as well, you basically run into the fight, throw a Q out, press R, pray to everything thats holy that your team actually does something about it, and then sit there soaking damage and waiting for Q, until either you die or you win. \n4. His kit is confusing thematically, he is a tank mage and is supposed to be played in a solo lane, but most of his abilities are reminiscent of a support, and don't really fit with him: He has a movement speed buff to help run towards the enemy, **but** has very few spells that require him to be close. He has a shield that he can place on allies, **but** even when its on an ally, it mostly just benefits himself, he has an extremely powerful AoE taunt, **but** lacks the abilities to follow up on an engage.\n\nSo on paper, he's kind of a terrible champion, and if more people played him, Riot would have no choice but to nerf him into the ground. \n\n________\n\n\nHowever, that being said, the people who do play Gallo, absolutely adore him. So it is very unfair to them to basically remove him from the game and put in a completely new champion, with the same name. \n\nThe new Galio is new and interesting, (and he looks 1,000 times better than the blue clay crap that we have atm). But when you actually look at his kit, theres nothing new there, His Q and passive is just re-hashing Vi and Alistar (and league DEFINITELY doesn't need any more of that). His new taunt is basically Warwick's new fear, but in reverse, and his ult looks to fill the same purpose as Shen's, but just more flashy and will almost certainly lose a lot of it's power soon after release, and like so many new champs he randomly gets passive shields (like seriously why is this needed?). And from what I've seen, it looks like he loses a lot of what he used to be (an complete anti-magic mage).\n\nSo from what little I've seen, it looks like we lose a niche champ, and gain a generalist. (which isn't ideal, considering we have too many generalist champs, and not enough niche ones).\n\n________\n\nBut in the end, overall, I think this is a good step. like Yorick before him, and Urgot after him, old Gallo belonged to a different game, a game that no longer exists. \n\nHe was a blue/yellow lump that claimed to be a golem (which are associated with evil, but was apparently a good guy?), that fired yellowy blue... energy?... fire?... something? from no apparent exit point.  And, despite being blue and yellow, actually was a key... soldier? of a completely clean and white kingdom, with a red and purple half-dragon general. Which is apparently the \"main\" kingdom of the land, BUT none of their soldiers wear remotely similar armour, OR even belong to the same race of people.   \n\nYou then try and place this thing in the same universe as new champs like Azir, updated Gangplank and Ekko, who not only make perfect sense within their own theme and kit, but also set the visual and thematic standard for the entire universe and its respective nations. \n\nIt just doesn't work, he needed a visual and lore update really badly in order to just fit into the game properly. \nAnd with a champion whose kit is so uninteresting and outdated, you can't in good conscience completely overhaul his visuals and leave his kit untouched. \n\nI will deeply miss the old Gallo, but I'm ready to embrace the new one! He does look very fun, and as someone who loves playing roaming champs like Sol and Taliyah and also loves playign tanks, what more can you ask for?\n\n\nSo I'm looking forward to his release, and i expect I will thoroughly enjoy playing him, probably even more so than the old one.\n(despite him not being voiced by David Lodge -_-). \n\nSo thats my opinion on the matter, make from it what you will. xD\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \n\n_PS. does that look like the batman logo on his chest? or is that just me.._","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-08T08:53:23.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss how defensive the old gargoyle was with his w healing.
