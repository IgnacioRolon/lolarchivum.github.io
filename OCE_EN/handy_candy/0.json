The waves does not fear the almighty Captain Gangplank! Gangplank sailed across Bilgewater and wherever he goes, terror, fear and destruction follows with the exception of having orange peels being left around all over the place. \r\nGangplank saw a fresh strip of land and anchors his ship near the land. He gets off the ship and smiles as he found a new area in Bilgewater that no one ever knew about! It was his chance to take over it and its citizens, if the land had any, and grow more oranges, if Gangplank finds rich soil that is. He marches across the land and was amazed what the land provided. Rich soil, large space for free movement and the tribes that viewed him as a god simply because they thought his ship was a grand transport used by gods. He created a new crew, bringing even more destruction, violence, blood and orange peelings across the lands. They were known as the Vitamin C.\r\nThe Vitamin C&rsquo;s crew rarely invaded separately but invaded as one group. They also were immune to some sickness that affected other crews as the oranges boosted their cruel, pirate immune system. Soon, Graves joins Vitamin C for the money and loot and since the day Graves joined, the roster grew larger for Vitamin C. Vitamin C was so infamous that words spread out to Ionia and Zed and the Order of The Shadows teamed up with Vitamin C shortly after words reached Ionia. Gangplank&rsquo;s empire grew and Bilgewater and half of Ionia is now Gangplank&rsquo;s land. \r\nYears passed since Gangplank created Vitamin C and many things happened. Miss Fortune was killed by Gangplank&rsquo;s hands, finally getting his revenge. He conquered Noxus, Demacia and the rest of Ionia and was to be known as the King of the World. Gangplank also promoted an &lsquo;Eat your fruit&rsquo; campaign to teach children the importance of eating fruits, mostly oranges, and the healthy benefits it gives you.","replies":[{"poster":"MemoryStickGuy","date":"2016-06-24T13:19:48.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL, i LMAO, vitamin C crew hahaha.......so creative man, you are one genius who remind people the importance of eating healthlly man, you are good.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Handy Candy","date":"2016-08-11T09:25:46.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply but thank you. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}]}
