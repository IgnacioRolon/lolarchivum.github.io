You might also try different champions that you never really bothered with. Make goals, such as ranking up, getting Mastery 5 on some champions, or unlocking more champs.\n\nYou can also sign up for [tournaments on the community page](http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/), or find new friends from the forums or throughout your games to group up with.\n\nYou might also just take a break. There's no real reason to play the game constantly; getting burned out or bored isn't uncommon. You could come back at any time later.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-07T20:41:23.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me if you want.
