Black Cleaver takes a while to become 100% useful. True MF can proc it a bit quicker but generally you want to have full damage from the first AA.\n\n2. The current ADC build is in a perfect spot. It gives everything the ADC needs with a few different options viable for different Champs and enemy team comps, if you're gonna build a Black Cleaver what exactly would you be trading off? Something really important\n\n3. You will generally be a massive bulk of the team's AD damage, unless you have an AD Assassin on your team in which case they will have a tonne of Armpen themselves so no need to to worry. If you're building Cleaver because of a REALLY heavy AD comp then that could work but if you're just building it every single game for yourself, Last Whisper works better for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-19T01:58:06.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always play MF and I think she's absolutely fine.

I go for the standard ADC build and it works just fine.
