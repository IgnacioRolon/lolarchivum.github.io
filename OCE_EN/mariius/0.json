In Ahri's case, she gets damaged by all three attempts of R, while in Alistar's case, he gets damaged again even after being damaged by the initial knock back. \r\nMy questions are, DO you get damaged by trying to pass Azir's wall and failing? Do the damage repeat? How much damage is it exactly? If so is the value of the damage known to the Azir player? Do you take reduced damage for repeated trials? (eg Ahri's R)\r\n\r\nI am aware these could be due to bugs but that's unlikely since it's true for all champions not just specifics. (as shown in video)\r\nIt'd be really helpful if someone can clarify this as I currently main Azir.\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-12T17:05:38.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This all comes down to unit collision , teleporters can just move around the wall  and characters who can get past unit collision aka fizz can get pass you didn't show Mater Yi but he too can get past.  and the damage comes from rebounding off the \"wall\"","replies":[]}]}
