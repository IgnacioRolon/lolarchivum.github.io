Go in now, and you'll quickly end up in Bronze V with 0 LP and garbage MMR, and then whine on the Boards about ranked being unfair and that you deserve to be a much higher rank.\n\n**1 level's worth of PvP spamming is NOT enough.**\n\nTrust me, get good in PvP (ie Normal Draft) before playing Ranked.
