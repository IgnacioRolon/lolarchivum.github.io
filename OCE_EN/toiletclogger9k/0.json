I had one skin that I wanted to buy which was striker Lucian for 525 RP, just so I could have every Lucian skin, and in hopes that next shop that I could get a chance to get heartseeker Lucian, the skin that I ***really*** want. I just wanted to ask if I contact support in regards to buying the striker Lucian, will my shop still be reset or will it be hard reset and I&#039;ll get new skins. Lucian and Trist were the only champions I played a lot of out of all the champions I got in my shop. Also, in the post from Riot regarding the reset, it said limited skins won&#039;t be available? I&#039;m pretty sure heartseeker Lucian is limited, so is there no chance that I get that skin in my shop (I saw a few other people got the skin in their shop but I assume that was the bot messing up). \r\n\r\nHoping a rioter or someone more informed than me can answer. Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Meat","date":"2017-09-19T04:24:47.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've read on the NA boards somewhere that you can send in a ticket if you had skins you were going to buy, might want to pop over to those boards and read them, see what the solutions are!\nGoodluck!","replies":[{"poster":"ToiletClogger9K","date":"2017-09-19T04:55:47.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, will do.","replies":[]}]}]}
