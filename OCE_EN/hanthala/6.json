I make montages and looking back i have made some plays that i would like to include in these montages, at the time that i made the plays i didnt know i&#039;d end up making montages out of them and i wasnt sure what i would end up doing with them tbh but i sure as hell wasnt going to simply discard them. So i went into replay.gg and copy/pasted their codes into a word document that i currently have saved on my pc but i forgot to include as a side note the patch client version. Meaning i have the codes but dont know the corresponding client version. The plays are all from last season and im pretty sure i can get the patcher client version from skin spotlight or something. But i was wondering if there was anyway to find out the patcher version from the codes. Idk maybe with riots help they could find out but is it open for the public or is it considered copyrighted property.\r\n\r\n*Youtube Channel :D -https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClzwDGLQOWvnZ_pV1b9q-3Q","replies":[]}
