Do you really not realise that the flash was a panic flash in a failed attempt to get over the wall? Yes it was bad but how does that one fuck up summarise an entire persons skill level? Also the clip is called \"fail\" for a reason.\n2. It was a very fast paced game with 35 kills in the first 20 minutes, and if i remember correctly I most of the time was being forced to group a lot just prior to my solo-push in the clip.\n3. Again if you look closely, what depleted my health wasn't the katarina's ultimate which was practically negated by my heal, but it was her E+W combo. Also another thing your missing is that I was able to get off a full silver proc in exchange for using my condemn which in turn brought her down to less than half hp turning the fight in my favor.\n4. If I don't attack move as you claim, would you be so kind as to explain why it is that every time I click the ground beside me a little red thingy-magigy appears there? and why it is I keep attacking katarina when im clearly not clicking on her?\n\nLastly this clip was on old clip from last year when, yes, i was silver (key word: was) but what is honestly mind-boggling is that you are silver right now  -_-","replies":[]}]}]}
