It wouldn't have been the first time I've seen someone make that mistake :P\n\nGo and check your purchase history. As long as you haven't spammed it with singular rune purchases, then that champion purchase should still be recorded there. Note the date and try to recall what you were doing/where you were that day, to see if it could have been you/it was impossible that it was you. It will help identify if someone else has access to your account, and possibly whom.\n\nNevertheless you should probably change your password just to be safe.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stormed by Janna","date":"2015-04-23T23:49:12.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":P DId you buy the \"Starting pack?\"\n\nand I hear ya, every time I see someone pick master yi I think to myself \"oh gawd, here we go again\".","replies":[{"poster":"xSilverRosex","date":"2015-04-24T09:49:45.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never bought any bundle packs before, and I think buying champs with RP is a waste","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-04-24T03:58:05.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i got morgana randomly idk where she came from","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-04-24T03:58:41.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but aye free champion idm","replies":[]}]}]}
