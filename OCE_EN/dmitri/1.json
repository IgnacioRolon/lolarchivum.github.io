Now, I ended up muting the offenders (two individuals who I will not name for obvious reasons) and after the match, even though I had them muted in game, I could still see them running my name (and my supports) through the dirt and then popped up the idea that we are in normals at low rank, and that regardless of rank, normals was a game-mode to have fun in, learn and relax, whereas the people who were being quite abusive were adamant that normals is a game-mode to win and that every game mode (bar bots) is here for you to win and if you are here for &#039;fun&#039; you should just play bots. So, I am genuinely curious, what you consider?","replies":[]}
