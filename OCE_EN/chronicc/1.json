I'll see what I can find on that.\n\nEDIT: Quick update, it seems that asking for reports is only punishable if it's used as a \"leaping off\" point for harassment.

What this means is that even if you're an ass who reports falsely or out of spite a lot, the one time you do report validly it will actually count. That said, nothing has really changed, a false report is just as meaningless now as it was previously.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"cant be found","date":"2018-02-09T10:55:26.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i thought i would post seeing this really does annoy me, i just played a game in blind pick and because i connect slower i couldn't call a lane leaving adc which i hate with passion so much, i told my team i was not capable of playing  adc  and if i had to go bot i would be playing [champ] , to which people said they don't mind. So i get in game and [support] support instantly starts taking all the cs so i left lane and tried to proxy it, at this point the support is calling me a troll and many other words, to which i reply you forced me bot lane you would not let me support and its not called adc it's called bottom now for a reason ,and now you stop me from csing. Anyway all lanes lost and game finished quite fast but towards end of game 3 people in my game start spamming all chat saying please 9x report the troll, which i ended up getting chat banned for 10 games over now please explain to me how this is fair at all riot? i assume i got 10 game ban seeing recently my mac client was playing up causing me to dc like 4 games in a row which punished me then, but i mean how did i deserve 10 game chat ban seriously not spending any money on this game until things like these are fixed i was literally banned minutes after i got reported, so who the hell managed to look over the case and ban me in a couple minutes ? cause any one with a brain can clearly see i did not deserve to be punished over it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T11:03:50.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As should have been made fairly clear from the comments on this post, false reports don't mean anything.
