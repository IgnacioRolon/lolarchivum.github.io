I personally have a close friend of mine that has Aspergers as well and they have found ways to combat the disadvantages that come with it, and ultimately be successful. Over the time I’ve played with them I have learnt a lot about their coping strategies but I feel it is important to begin with the problems you may face so that we are on the same page and so that you are aware of them (if you aren’t already) and ready and capable to combat and adapt to them in the case of them affecting your in game experience.\n\n---\n---\n\n# Planning and Adapting\n\nWhen you are playing league or in life in general it is very common for an person with Aspergers to like planning things out things with lots of details. Now the issue when it comes to league is that it is very reactionary and adaptive when it comes to gameplay, which means plans fail and have to change on a regular basis, which can be difficult to deal with being so bound by routine.\n\n_If you want a bit more detailed information on how this affects the brain and how this happens, you can do some research on an effected called the “Amygdala Hijack.” The basic explanation is when the brain is put into a situation where it doesn’t know how to react, the rational brain takes over and whatever feels natural at the time, well you do it, which results in a disproportionate emotional reaction. [GBayy99 a youtuber did a brilliant video going over this and how to handle/deal with it, I would definitely suggest giving it a watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxE8wTbYJs8)_ \n\n---\n\nThe first step to combating and adapting is to be aware that it is happening. Recognising the behaviour when it happens will help you know when to take action against it. Recognising it is the easy part though, and once you have it comes to the important part: adapting. Mostly, this comes with experience. It is essentially a reaction you have to train yourself to take, so the best way to do this is to play and to teach yourself to adapt in whatever ways you have the most success with.\n\nWhat I would recommend you doing in the situation of this happening though is first, Instead of trying to think about it rationally, try taking into account what is happening and reacting to it. Obviously you have to train those reactions, but it is a good way to negate the effects of ‘panic mode’. Once the situation (be it fight, trade or objective) is handled, then afterwards you can mentally reset, and consciously realise what happened. You can then learn from the situation and create yourself a new plan with the information that you have just learned.\n\nWith enough practice you will be able to do this on the spot and in the middle of, even team fights without second thoughts, letting you smoothly transition into a new plan of action and be unaffected by having to adapt to what is going on.\n---\n---\n# Roles\n\nI have played with this friend a lot and we have spoken a good deal about his experiences with each role that they have tried and the problems that they have had, and the ways that they countered them. For easy reference we are going to refer to my friend as “John”.\n---\n* **Top**\n\nTop lane was the first lane that John played heavily. He found that in the ‘island’ that is top lane it was quite stressful as everything was based purely on how _he_ performed. However he found that the best way to combat this was learning the ins and outs of a few select champions and getting really good at them. Confidence in his ability was key here, as he knew that he could outplay and win the lane against his opponent because he knew his champion better than the enemy did. Once he did this the stress of it being a 1v1 lane went away and he was able to enjoy playing Top again.\n---\n* **Jungle**\n\nJungle is the role that John has the least experience in, not because he found it hard to cope with because of his different mindset, it just didn’t fit his playstyle. That said, the thing he struggled with most was creating plans too rigid for the nature of the jungle as they would often have to change on a clear by clear basis. The way that he found best to combat this was looking at the lanes between jungle camps and being ready to adjust his plan depending on how his laners were doing/how far pushed they were, essentially leaving that door open for changes. This eliminated the issue and taught him some valuable lessons.\n---\n* **Mid**\n\nNow since John had already been a Top laner before going to Mid the problem of it being a 1v1 lane had already been dealt with, so for reference if you experience this issue, I would have a look at the top lane section. Apart from that John didn’t really have any notable issues that he had to work through for mid lane on this topic.\n---\n* **ADC (and Support)**\n\nNow I am going to group bot lane together here, however I am going to make a quick note for ADC only. ADC was a brilliant role for John as he found that when he was forced to react and make a choice on the spot it let him best channel the mechanics he had learned and salvage the situation he was put into, which encouraged and helped him to play reactively to what was going on.\n\nAs for bot lane in general the issue that John ran into was the feeling of possibly letting down his lane partner and not doing as well as he feels he should. In this situation the thing that John did is try to remind himself that it was a duo lane with two _people_, so sometimes one part of the lane would be more skilled than the other. However he trained himself to look at this from a learning point of view. In that sense that, when he was playing ADC and he had a more skilled support, he taught himself to learn from what they were doing right and apply it to his own gameplay, and visa versa for support.\n\n---\n---\n# Final Notes\n\nAll up Veloshotz, I hope this helps in giving a bit more insight as to how this may be affecting you and how to react accordingly. Aspergers in this situation is something that shouldn’t affect what you _want_ to do in game, focus on playing what you find fun. While it might come with certain challenges, if you train yourself to overcome them you will be well on your way to becoming a master at whatever role you choose to play as it can teach you valuable lessons early on in your gameplay that others don’t learn till much later on.\n\nIf you have any other questions or want me to clarify on anything that I have noted let me know and good luck, I hope that this helps.\n\n_As a bit of a footnote about our friend John, and to give you a bit of encouragement, during season 4 John made it to Master Tier at around 200 LP and was the best Draven player on the server, along with having Aspergers._\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Veloshotz","date":"2017-02-04T00:27:37.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for helping me in this issue Elam i really appreciate it.\n\nI also have known that i tend to go well in the adc role quite well to be honest and im currently playing {{champion:81}}  and {{champion:42}}  pretty well but im bronze so this is an overstatement i guess i also have been enjoying {{champion:236}} as well\n\nif its ok i was wondering if u could give me some advice on what john would do if he ever got angry at the game or started to tilt as i have the knowledge for what to do when i get angry or tilt but dont know if i should be handling it in a different way with my syndrome \n\nI mean no offense to john.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-02-04T06:45:30.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Greetings again Veloshotz,**\n\nFrom the experiences I have had with John the one thing I did notice that when he did go on tilt was that he had strategies in place to combat when he was tilting. From what I understand having these strategies that you can do is extremely important for mentally resetting. I would put these strategies into two types of categories, being in game for those that you need to do when coming back from losing a fight or when behind, or after a game to prepare for the next game that you go into.\n\n---\n\n**With the strategies that he used in game these ranged from things such as:**\n\n* Figuring out what went wrong and then learning from his mistake for future situations (this is a very important one to tune your mindset to). \n\n* Playing champions he knew inside out so that when it came down to it, if something was going wrong, he was able to refer to past situations to fix the problem because he had played through the scenario so many times. \n\n* Once something happened in game such as a teammate dying or himself getting a kill, he would re asses what his plan was because he knew it opened or closed certain opportunities. This let him set up his plan to be more effective for what was going on in the game at that time.\n\n* Playing to learn and not to climb elo. This was a big one as he found that when he played to learn and better himself as a player, every thing that happened became a learning experience, and dying instead of being a frustration, became a lesson. Team mates not doing so well? He would focus on what he could do to better to lead them to victory instead of worrying about what he couldn't control.\n\n---\n\n**For stopping tilt going into other games he did things such as:**\n\n* Taking a break, getting up and having a drink of water, having warm showers was also great because it let him clear his mind in a controlled environment.\n\n* Playing a relaxing game for a short while where he knew he had control over, a great example would him playing Roller Coaster Tycoon between games while thinking over the previous game.\n\n* Thinking over the previous game, and having a ranked Diary. Ranked Diaries were really cool for John, he shared a few of them with me a while back and its something I personally suggest a lot of players to do, writing down after each game what you did well and what you could have done better, again reinforcing it being a learning experience to get better at the game.\n\n---\n\n**Keep in mind though this is what worked for John, and it is best to experiment and build strategies that work for you that you are able to do whenever you feel stressed in a game or feel like you are on tilt.** Though I would suggest trying these strategies yourself and seeing if they work for you. If you come up with any of your own strategies that work for you that I haven't listed, I'd encourage you to come back and share what they are, as it may help others as well.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps answer your question, emotions can be a big part of an Aspergers brain and teaching yourself about how they work and ways to help yourself work with them is extremely important. If you have any other questions or want me to go a bit more in depth on anything else let me know.\n\n_Quick footnote, if you haven't already you might want to give Ashe and Miss Fortune a try for your ADC champion pool, you might enjoy them. Along with this because of their play style and kit you may find it easy to use these champions to improve your mechanics, which is something you might be looking for._\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Veloshotz","date":"2017-02-04T07:10:47.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Elam again i really appreciate u helping me out with this some off these strategies would definitely work for me as 1 or 2 of these strategies i do seem to work so ill definitely try the others out.\n\nwith {{champion:22}} and {{champion:21}} however i did like playing ashe at some point but startedto get bored of here kit and with  miss fortune i never have really enjoyed her that much tbh.\n\nim currently thinking of maining Ezreal to diamond with maybe another adc secondary so thats what im looking at doing this season.\n\nOne more thing about john i have to ask is that did he ever struggle at picking what champion he was going to play or choosing a champion to stick with and learn because i dont know about him but i struggle severely with this\nalso long term decision making with champions i struggle at too.\n\nif u could give me some advice that would be more then appreciated thanks\n\nVelo.\n\n\nPS.   strategies for not tilting i would give would be playing no more then 7 games a day max as i feel other time bad things in previous games that happen to me tend to slowly build up and peel away my mindset over time.\nalso not playing when im really tired tends to be a safer choice.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-02-05T08:22:16.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings again Veloshotz,\n\nAs for picking what champion to play or sticking to one champion to learn, John found it easiest just to stick with the champions that he enjoyed the most. The thought process being that if you pick a champion that you enjoy and that you want to learn and get better at, the best way to do that is to play them lots. So think about what champions you enjoy, you said that you are maining Ezreal at the moment and he can be a good choice for a main.\n\nI also want to chime in here about picking what champion when, I am a big fan of playing your best champion no matter what champion in lane you are up against. If you are confident in the champion itself picking it can very often be better into a bad match up then swapping to a champion you aren't so confident on.\n\n---\n\nAs for \"long term decision making with champions I struggle at too.\" could you elaborate a bit more as to what you mean by that?\n\n---\n\nIf I may to note on if you want to get better from a gameplay stand point, what you want to be focusing on at the moment is your mechanics, you need to build up these through consistent practice and focusing on improving them. These can be things such as trading in lane, positioning and your last hitting. The reason I suggest playing Miss Fortune and Ashe is that since they are relatively simple to pick up at a basic level, it lets you focus on improving your overall gameplay when playing them instead of teaching yourself mechanics that only apply when playing that specific champion.\n\nIf you would like a bit of guidance as to how to start going about this, feel free to ask and I will be happy to help.\n\n---\n\nAs for the strategies you mentioned in your final notes I agree with those and I find myself and many other players going by those as well. Often though if I am on a real hot streak of winning a lot of games, I find I can play more than 7 depending on my mentality. I usually like to judge it off of how many loses I have and how my mental game is feeling rather than over all games. Also getting a good amount of sleep along with eating enough food and drinking enough water is good for maintaining healthy gameplay sessions where you play at your peak.\n\n---\n\nI hope this helps answer your question, let me know if I can be of assistance again. Good luck in your games and I will see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-03T13:01:46.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why arbitrarily limit yourself?\n\nJust try champions and lanes that click with you until you find a match.
