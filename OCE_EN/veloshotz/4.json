Instead, look for what you find the most enjoyable. I suggest not doing your soul searching in Ranked, though; you will lose fewer games if you discover your main roles/champions before you start attempting to climb by mastering them in Normals.\n\nIf you enjoy what you are playing you are going to be able to spend more time learning about it and will take more interest in improving your skills at it. Play a nice variety in Normals and you'll see where you perform the best and enjoy it after some time. You can check out [your op.gg page](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Veloshotz) and easily see what you're performing well on consistently. If you had enjoyed playing those, grab them and go perfect them in Normals until you're ready to climb the ranked ladder! Don't forget that there is always more to learn about your role and champion and the game as a whole, so read up on [guides](http://www.mobafire.com/) and watch some pro streams for great tips :3","replies":[{"poster":"Veloshotz","date":"2016-08-06T11:21:56.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tips really appreciate it","replies":[]}]}]}
