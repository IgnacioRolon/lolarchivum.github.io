Sometimes I can play for months and sometimes I leave the game for months at a time.\n\n\nI don&#039;t usually write in the forums or go out of my way to contact people regarding League, but I&#039;ve had enough. Today I had a solo ranked game where 5 people had attempted to lobby together in the hopes that they could be placed on the same team. Unfortunately 3 were placed on my team and the other 2 on the enemy side. After asking several questions I gained the information that all 5 were communicating with each other whilst in game. Initially I thought nothing of this, however I soon realised that one of them on my team was purposely playing against us so that he could make sure that his other two friends on the enemy team could win the game and gain Elo.\n\n\nI&#039;m not really sure about the current rules that Riot Games have against this or whether or not something like this is an offense. Yes I&#039;ve reported them, however I feel like it is time to implement a solution to issues like this that plague the ranked ladder. Like I said I have been playing League for about five years now and I&#039;ve seen hundreds of people move on from the game. After asking several of these players why they don&#039;t play League anymore, the universal answer I received was that the game is way too toxic and that it is unhealthy. It is too often that I come across scenarios like this during my League sessions and sadly nowadays a get more games like this when I play.\n\n\nReporting someone is not enough and I think I will join the hundreds of thousands of players who have quit the game.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-17T05:21:32.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a good boy, I behave.\n\nWhy did those clowns not just queue as a five player premade?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-05-16T23:18:02.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there isnt really a solution to this issue. if riot bans everyone who broke the rules they would have no players left. the punishment system from riot gets rid of people who reoffend. i would argue their system is TOO sensitive because ive been perma banned 3 times for debating people in game not being toxic. if you cant deal with human error (the people in your game who troll/are toxic) then i dont think the issue is league its your ability to compete in team games. try starcraft or chess imo","replies":[]}]}
