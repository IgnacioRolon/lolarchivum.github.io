I&#039;ve played league since the start of season 2, and I&#039;ve been on and off again over the last year or so. I&#039;ve recently decided to start developing myself and my ability to play the game at a higher level, and would love to meet others with a similar goal.\n\nI&#039;m a flexible jungle main since season 3, with in depth knowledge of top and support as well, my general champion pool consists of tanks and assassins, although I am willing to learn new champions and roles to better suit my team&#039;s play-style and preference. \n\nIf you wanna ask anymore questions or want to contact me or even if you're looking for a duo for season 7, feel free to add me on &quot;Millzy Bot&quot;, thanks for reading!","replies":[]}
