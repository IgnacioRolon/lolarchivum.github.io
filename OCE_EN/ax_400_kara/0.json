As per the [\"End-Of-Season Information\" Support page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010365913-End-of-season-information), rewards should be out by the 12th of December, so if you haven't got rewards by then you'll want to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"2018 Season Ranked and Honor rewards\" option).","replies":[]}]}
