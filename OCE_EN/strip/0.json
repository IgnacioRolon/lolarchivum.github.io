The exception is made *only* for confirmed bots, no matter the offence.\n\n>the ashe just hit level 30\n\nLevel, doesn't really mean all that much. It could easily be a smurf account, or someone with at the very least, prior MOBA experience. While placements can be a bit off at times because everyone's MMR is still settling, ultimately you were matched with them for a reason.\n\n>she sold her items and bought new support items\n\nSo she was probably trolling, regrettably, there will always be people like that, and the best thing you can do, is report, move on, and not let them affect any more of your games. The system will pick up that kind of behaviour quickly.\n\n>I was told this season everyone starts 'iron'\n\nI'm not sure where you heard this, but as far as I know it's inaccurate. To the best of my knowledge the new account MMR is roughly high Bronze this season, though if they are losing all their games their MMR will quickly adjust, and their provisional rank will be lower than that.\n\n>i understand the trouble with match making in 3v3 flexed that it's not based on solo queue\n\nThe biggest problem with matchmaking in 3v3 isn't MMR accuracy, but population. Not many people play TT, so matchmaking will be skewed. Your LP gains/losses will reflect this though, earning lots/losing less for harder games, and visa versa for easy games.\n\n>my mmr was silver based on op.gg\n\nEspecially in early games (<50) MMR found on op.gg is a guide at best. It's an estimate, and doesn't use Riot's actual calculations (which are hidden). It can be a decent enough measure of relative skill compared to other individuals, but using it to compare to whole ranks, or to say \"op.gg tells me I should be gold\" is not a good way to use it, because it just isn't accurate enough for that.\n\n>can we please, please, please, fix this?\n\nThe only surefire way to fix it is to get more people playing TT. Reducing the queue up time is one way to do that, but then you also deny many players the chance at all. The current schedule is the most viable from the data, but it's far from perfect. It more than likely never will be with the population we've got.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Strip","date":"2019-02-03T14:31:03.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"help","replies":[]}]}
