On my way to plat 4, I went on lots of winning sprees... however recently I have just had one good game than a defeat, one good game than a defeat. And these results keeps going and going and going and I always find myself stuck on around 50-80 lp. I still feel really comfortable in these tiers, and I believe that I play at a Diamond level, however I just really need some assistance (recommended by a Diamond - Challenger player) on how I can continue a win spree.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-10-01T15:56:34.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it comes to maintaining a win streak, or winning games at all, I find that keeping an open frame of mind is quite important. Entering a game expecting or hoping for a certain outcome usually means I spend more time worrying about what that outcome will mean (if it even happens) than being reactive and proactive within the game itself. *That* usually means I'm not playing as well as I should be.  \n\nAlso, even if you think you're comfortable in your rating try to make sure you don't get complacent. There's a point we can't objectively analyse our own gameplay anymore and that's when get stuck. I know it's happened to me too many times to count which means it may be worth saving yourself a lot of trouble, unlike I often have, by seriously focusing in your next couple of games and seeing whether that changes anything or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-01T08:13:42.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play THESE FREELO CHAMPIONS!\n\n\nAS CONTENDER NUMBER ONE, WE HAVE...
