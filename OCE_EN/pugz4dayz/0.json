Last time I had CC score 120 in 40min game. I built her quite tanky with focus on cooldown reduction.\n\nAnd {{champion:57}}  also have exceptional CC, as he can hit multiple enemies with his Q (low CD), his W has root and E slow, R really large root. Also Maokai is extremely tanky, so he will possibly stay long in teamfight and applies CC along the way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2019-02-28T07:14:53.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the literal \"Who gets the highest CC score per game?\" answer. Nocturne. The way his ult works gives him obscene scores","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-28T03:13:07.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my votes go to Nautilus for most versatile immobilising cc, with his passive root (1.5s), q knockup(0.9s)/root(0.1s), his e 50% slow (1.5s) and his ult knockup(1s)/stun(2s). Grand total is 7s which is a lot of epic league fun time to be held down for. 5.5s of which will not allow any kind of mobility.\nThat said, once he uses the rotation, he can't do much to cc you till his cooldowns come back up, which gives you about 6s breathing room, even at max cdr.\n\nrunner up though, cdr Zilean with his e-q-w-q-e combo, which features a total of 5s of the most fun slow in the game 99%, a 1.5s AoE stun, for a total of 6.5s of epic league fun times, which thanks to 45% cdr, can be even more epic league fun time, because he can repeat the combo all over again after only a short 1.75s. If you want to be even more super fun, take glacial augment and weave an auto in there for a 2s 40% slow to cover the offtime between your hyper cc combo and to screw with anyone thinking they can bypass your funness with a qss.\n\nwith Brittle, theoretically Ornn has a bit more cc, but because of the nature of his kit, only a small part is guaranteed without supplementary cc from teammates, but theoretically with a 2s 40% slow, 3x1s brittle stun, 1s knockup, 2s 10% slow and 1s knockup, allowing him to supply a total of 10.8s of cc in optimal conditions. Not sure this is a fair comparison though, since I'm not sure a 10% slow is comparable to a 40%, 50% or 99% slow.\n\n whilst cdr Morgana can almost chain cc her q-r-q for 7.5s, there is infact a 0.45s gap where an enemy can but probably won't flash way.\nLeona's stun chain combo (q-e-r-q) only sums up to 3.5s of stun and 0.5s of root, but it feels much worse because she does alot of damage and engages frequently and aggressively.\n\n\nIn summary, Nautilus get's 1st place with the strongest and most versatile overall cc, Zilean get's 2nd place because he has the most practical CC chain since he doesn't rely on ults and can have you either stunned or 99% slowed 78.8% of the time or until his mana pool runs out, which can be super infuriating for melee toplaners without dashes like Nasus or Darius. Morgana comes 3rd thanks to the high range catch potential but is reliant on her ult for her combo. Ornn would be the clear winner if we ignored practicality and just wanted to know the duration of debuffs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-02-27T22:59:07.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on what you mean by \"Most CC\"\nDo you mean:\n1. The champ with the highest number of abilities that have CC?\n2. The champ that can keep you under crowd control for the longest amount of time.\n3. The champ with the ability to interrupt you the most.\n\nFor example, as for champs that can keep you CCed the longest, {{champion:22}} might well take the top spot (an educated guess seeing I haven't done the maths. Either way, she's up there!)  But even though she can keep you immobile for 3 seconds, I wouldn't call her the \"Champ with the most CC\".\nSo what you mean by \"Most CC\" changes what champs we can choose.\n\nPersonally however, as a 'best of all worlds' contender. my money is on {{champion:154}} \n\nHe has 1 ability that _**isn't**_ a knockup.\nBut its not about numbers, its about how he uses them.\nHe can't keep you 100% catatonic like Leona can by chain-stunning you. But because of the timing on his abilites, when one ends theres only maybe 0.1/0.2 seconds before the next one hits.  So while there is some time, its not actually enough to do anything.  So even though he's not keeping you CCed 100% of the time, he might as well be, because you cant do an awful lot in that time.\n\nAlso unlike {{champion:111}} or {{champion:89}} all his CC is AoE or multi target. So thats a factor too.\n\nHe is a disrupt god, and I think disrupt is far more deadly than straight CC duration. (although his CC duration is lengthy too).\n\nSo {{champion:154}} has my vote.","replies":[]}]}
