First of all, if your enemies all gave up at the first sign of being behind, nevermind actually losing, you're not going to have any fun winning because there's just no challenge and no merit to it. Second, that is not how video games have always worked, even in the single player scene (e.g Dark Souls) but _especially_ in multiplayer competitive games.\n\nYou say those 2 players are wasting people's time, but by throwing in the towel at the first hint of trouble have you not wasted their time? You're guaranteeing them the loss and therefore wasting the 15-20 minutes they've been playing + queue and lobby times just because you...didn't want a challenge in a competitive game?

I've had discussions about gameplay with the High Elo players, and find that only 1/10 of their games have actually inters/trollers unlike low elo where its 9/10 games, and they all say the same thing, if it looks bleak, get out, start another or dodge in champ select (using OP.GG's multiple summoner function to see what your team has done, and what they're streaks are)\n\nI can play like a god (it does happen, albeit rarely) where i snowball my lead, and try to help my team get ahead, but of course we get that one person who went 0/10 Yasuo mid, and spent the game flaming everyone and he starts the FF, but i don't want to FF, but the other 3 do, not because the game is unwinnable, but because no one likes playing with toxic players, for sanity's sake, the FF goes through, which is fair (even if it pisses me off to no end) \n\nSanity > Winning a game","replies":[]}]}
