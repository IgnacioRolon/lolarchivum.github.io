I got put in a lower priority que for afk behaviour. I admit a was afk and I&#039;m proud of it. The reason I went afk is because during team select a troll who did not respect the pick order picked MID after somebody already picked mid. This made us have no ADC. He said he wants mid or he will feed. I will not help a troll like that win. So during the game I refused to play. Riot must review games like this and reverse afk bans like the one I got because I went afk for the right reason. If you just play on and help the troll win he will think its ok to troll. I should be honored for what I did, not banned","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:25:40.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KGB Elemental,\n\nLow Priority Queues/LeaverBuster punishments cannot be reversed, as the system detects whether any Summoners left a match early. Because you met that prerequisite, the LeaverBuster punishment was applied. Context does not matter in the overwhelming majority of cases, only whether a rule was broken. Be sure to not leave matches in the future and report negative/toxic players once the match is over. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.","replies":[]}]}
