Now when i first started I was placed Gold 2. I dropped to gold 3 because lost a bit but managed to start winning get back to gold 2 and was on the way to gold 1. This seemed right to me because I was actually plat 5 last season and sitting in the high gold/low plat range.\r\n\r\nSo when i redid my placements can anyone explain why i got silver 2? I was expecting gold 5 at worst. I did so well in my game to redo my placement. (2/2/20 Bard Game 63% KP).\r\nI was on a winning streak about to get into gold 1 as well so it wasn&#039;t like I didn&#039;t belong... \r\n\r\nSo my question is do I wait for another  fix or do I have to farm through silver? To be quiet honest this seems really unfair.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T04:20:40.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"~~Updates here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/u2iR6nTU-ranked-flex-match-making-issues-update~~\n\nUPDATE: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks","replies":[{"poster":"okysea","date":"2016-11-15T05:16:49.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That didn't explain anything at all.
