So are there any fixes for this I have tried the majority of the Bug Splat and Game Crashes fixes.\r\n\r\nAlso will I get penalized for this? I tried playing a game of 3 v 3 Twisted Treeline and got through champ select.\r\n\r\nSorry for this inconvenience\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n-okysea","replies":[{"poster":"okysea","date":"2016-01-28T00:01:04.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed.
