I&#039;m just curious as to what Riot&#039;s stance is on calling out such players for their cheating ways? I&#039;m aware with various other rules (mainly toxic players) Riot doesn&#039;t encourage publicly calling out offenders, though I was curious if this is the same for scripters. I&#039;m mostly interested in Riot&#039;s stance on videos pointing out obvious scripters, though also interested in if calling players out in game is allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FAQ:**\r\n**Isn&#039;t a ban enough?**: Sure, the scripters will indeed receive a ban if they&#039;re scripting, though this takes weeks (if not months) to actually be put into action.

On Oceanic you barely ever see a message stating a scripter you've reported has been banned, and usually it's weeks (if not months) later before the ban is actually issued. \n\nAs an example, the most obvious scripter I've seen was a TF scripter.. They were instalocking the card they wanted everytime first rotation, dodging everything to the unit (even circular skillshots before they were actually visable, such as Lux E) and cancelling AAs/stutterstepping randomly to dodge things they didn't overly need to dodge. Even scripters that obvious will go 30+ games and 1-2 weeks easily without a ban on OCE.\n\nEdit: They do ALWAYS end up banned (longest i've seen one survive was about 3months, though they only scripted ~40-50% of their games judging by the champions they played, not all), though it's never instantly or with-in a few hours like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-23T12:02:15.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't give a fuck.\nWe tested this a while ago.\nA friend of mine was using Katarina scripts.\nI screen capped him admitting it in game, explaining it all.\nSent it all in via ticket.\nI got the copypasted \"We will investigate the issue but can't disclose information to you\"\nMy friend never heard from Riot at all about it, still plays to this day.\n\nSeriously, all Riot care about anymore is \"toxicity\". They want to get rid of the community's reputation as the worst in online gaming. That way new players will be more likely to continue playing, and continue to dump money into the game. All the older players are quitting because they realize how shitty the game is becoming, so they need to source their money from somewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-03-30T05:01:21.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is a script??","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-17T08:58:15.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name and shaming is a no no.

I've never seen it mentioned as a general guideline or specifically when talking about calling out scripters, which is why I'm asking the question here and wanting community feedback. \n\nWith the if they're actually scripting or not side of things, that is quite a valid point there - we don't want players going around accusing innocent enemies of scripting. However, for some a scripter is extremely easy to spot and in some situations you can be extremely sure about it. If a player is dodging everything to the exact unit and behaves the same way every time in certain situations (ie anti-gap closers, the timing is always the same) it can be extremely obvious. Another example is Twisted Fates locking the card they want AS SOON as it appears, instantly, every time with 100% accuracy - that's quite obvious.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-17T09:23:34.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah things like this can be annoying, I dont think I have ever seen a scripter before.\nBut I have encountered like 1 billion freaking bots.

I understand SOME may be banned more instantly, though extremely obvious scripters remaining unbanned for so long isn't a good thing.\n\nIn the particular case I refer to, the player was dodging lux Es before they were even visible, to the unit (right on the edge). They even at one point were spamming laugh while dodging, fighting with the scripts (resulting in them stutter stepping in an extremely weird, inhuman way). They remained unbanned for about a month after this particular game. At the time I got vs them they had a match history which all looked scripted as far back as 1-2 months, totaling 2-3 months of scripting before a ban was issued.\n\n>  Please understand** Riot** needs to be 100% the person is scripting when they enforce a ban.

Lux's E is an extremely obvious thing to prove a player's scripting as (in most cases) they'll dodge it to the single unit before it's even visible, something which is literally humanly impossible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Freyä","date":"2016-03-17T08:56:34.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"lyD","date":"2016-03-17T09:12:41.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they usually mark accounts for ban and ban them all at once in waves.

The ban waves are too spread out to combat the main problem of scripters having access to unlimited accounts.","replies":[]}]}]}
