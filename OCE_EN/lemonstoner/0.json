And plus the main problem is you commenting like you have some kind of authority over us, calling these posts \"nonsense\". Perhaps I'm looking too deeply into this but it really makes me think you have an insatiable sense of ego in OCE Boards","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-10-23T01:22:23.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An insatiable egotistical jerk with a grasp of how to search through existing boards before creating a clone of multiple existing threads on the same issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-10-23T05:04:00.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fattyhotdogs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sM9Aj22O,comment-id=00030000000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-23T01:22:23.006+0000)\n>\n> An insatiable egotistical jerk with a grasp of how to search through existing boards before creating a clone of multiple existing threads on the same issue.\n\nThe problem/issue's solved, you're a dead meme now","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-23T01:28:20.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This shit is bananas\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcsvbi5SfwM","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-22T09:52:57.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please calm down\n\nI am confident they realise this issue exists (hence the chat feature is disabled).\nGive them some slack too since this is weekend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Procrasto","date":"2016-10-22T04:03:51.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any idea on the time till a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"LemonStoner","date":"2016-10-22T05:03:39.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah but they will have to fix it soon","replies":[{"poster":"Procrasto","date":"2016-10-22T06:17:18.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really hope so, its been 5 hours now","replies":[]}]}]}]}
