I already own 5 GP skins but since it&#039;s pretty cool I might pick it up.\n\n{{champion:41}}  \n\nThe rest are Pool Party Lulu 30% (945rp), Battle Boss Blitz 30% (945rp), Ghost Bride Morg 40% (585rp), Winter Wonder Ori 40% (585rp) and Order of the Banana Soraka 20% (600rp). None of these are low enough for me to impulse buy at all. Wish the 1350s were more than 30% off since I'd probably buy them.\n\nWhat did you get?","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2015-12-19T04:31:40.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"70% off Pop Star Ahri","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-12-19T04:26:19.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"None.
