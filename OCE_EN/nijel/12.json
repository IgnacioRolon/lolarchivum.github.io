I think it&#039;s an excellent way to get more people involved in the tournament, capture some magic moments and start off the new community-driven effort with a bang!\n\nBollockz, the main man behind the whole thing, has given me the go ahead so we need to sort this out before the 20th of November!\n\nI&#039;m looking for someone with:\n-availability on the 20th (of course)\n-some streaming experience (not essential tho)\n-game knowledge\n-confidence and panache\n-ability to move around Sydney\n-a potentially better mic and webcam \n\nIf that&#039;s you leave a comment or add me in game and let&#039;s see what we can do!","replies":[{"poster":"Bombolz","date":"2015-11-08T10:40:54.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will the streaming work? I thought there would be multiple games running at the same time, because in the case of 16 teams, it would be 8v8 at first before eliminations take place. Or will it stream only the finals?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-11-08T22:35:24.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll just pick a random game from each round and I'll stream it. Maybe even pick different teams each round so that more people appear on stream. Hopefully there will be a way to join an ongoing game if the one we've selected ends early so that the stream doesn't end up relying on me (and if someone else joins) to talk for 30 minutes until the next round.","replies":[{"poster":"Bombolz","date":"2015-11-09T01:25:29.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, that's a good idea, you could try picking the more anticipated match-ups, who knows there might be diamonds or challenjours in here (challengers aren't unbeatable).","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-11-09T03:04:51.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've thought about that. It really depends on the way that the teams are seeded. I'll have to see what happens in the 5 minutes between check-in closing and the bracket being released to figure it out. It'll take a bit of coordination but hopefully it works out alright.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-08T02:01:17.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice nice, hope someone can assist!","replies":[]},{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-07T09:56:58.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exciting stuff.
