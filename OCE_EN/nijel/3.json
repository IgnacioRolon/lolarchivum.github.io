Here are some suggestions to spice it up and increase the chance that everyone finds someone they like. \n\n**Reroll** &ndash; There should be an option to reroll at least some of the cards you get. Being stuck with nothing you want hardly gets you in the holiday spirit and ends what is supposed to be YOUR store experience disappointingly. There could be reroll tokens you can spend to flip back over a specific card to reveal a new discount of the same value. You could offer a number of tokens from the start or make people earn them by playing 3 match made games or by winning one etc. \n\n**Trade Discounts** &ndash; You should be allowed to trade your discounts with your friends if they haven&rsquo;t been purchased already. It feels like an absolute waste when you get an offer for a skin you know someone absolutely loves but you have no interest in. Maybe the % values would have to be the same to stop people getting multiple 70%&rsquo;s but that&rsquo;s not up to me to decide.\n\n**Offer something Beyond Skins** &ndash; Sure, skin discounts are awesome but for players who have been around for a while it might take a hefty discount for them to care at all. By including additional offers for random icons, ward skins and skins + chroma people might find themselves buying something they&rsquo;ve never considered buying full price.\n\n**Player Decides What&rsquo;s Revealed** (_shoddy jpg is an example_) - Players should be allowed to decide what kind of discounts they want to see. By displaying twice or three times as many cards of specific varieties [Skin, Champ, Random Skin for \"x\" champ, Ward Skin, Icon, Random Chroma etc] and allowing the player to choose a specific number of them [6 of 12 cards] every player should end up with discounts on the things they are in the market for instead of the market they are forced into. _the shoddy photoshop job is an example_\n\nThanks for reading, tell me what you think!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-30T09:38:26.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Nijiiyo\n\nThanks for the suggestions!
