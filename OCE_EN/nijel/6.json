Yes, you and friends will get the chance to lay it all on the line for Triumphant Ryze. Oh and there are no rank restrictions either so everyone can have a go (and get smashed by that  one challenger team that always decides to show up last second). \n\nThis tournament will be held online on **Sunday the 7th of February starting at 3pm**. \n\n---\n\nIf you have a team who is interested in playing follow these steps:\n\n1. Every player must register individually on the event page to ensure they are eligible for Riot prizes. http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/events/171345\n2. Only the captain needs to register their team on challonge and write the members/positions of the team in the description box. Other members do not need to make challonge accounts. http://oce-is-best-place.challonge.com/5v5_1\n3. The captain should add Nijiiyo in game to have a direct point of contact if they have any questions.\n4. Show up on the day and play!\n\n---\n\nIf you have any questions or want to get involved (we need some graphics and stuff) please contact us and we'll get back to you asap. We also have a Facebook page now: https://www.facebook.com/OCEisBestPlace/.\n\nHope to see you there!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-28T06:12:15.685+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember you need to register on the event page as well to be eligible for prizes! but GL HF\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"qwertilian","date":"2016-02-05T09:28:28.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was interested in joining or making a team. if anyone was keen?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2016-02-01T01:18:18.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} I'd sign up if I didn't have to work #RIP","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-02-01T02:51:26.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably better for everyone else, they wouldn't have stood a chance.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2016-02-01T04:09:08.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \nLOL true","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-02-07T10:05:48.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratz to Xero Empire for their intense 2-0 win over Tyrant Esports Club. \n\nThanks to everyone who participated and watched.
