If you haven&#039;t checked the settings before, there are two &quot;music&quot; and &quot;sfx&quot;. Music only controls music (as far as I know and is fine) where as &quot;SFX&quot; covers ALL sounds effects. \r\n\r\nThe SFX one really grinds my gears. If I want to hear the sweet sounds of the pick and ban phase I have to opt into the little blips and swooshes of LFG and a deafening THWACK every time I click any tab. Sure, I can close LFG and never use any features of the client (currently I just mute SFX) but I&#039;d prefer a little more customisability.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-03-09T10:40:40.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be great in game also, allow the pings to be loud as fuck, but some non needed sounds to be muted. Or does that already happen?
