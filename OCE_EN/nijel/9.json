So yeah, please write any old thing on there and I&#039;ll feature the best responses on the Facebook page.\n\nAnyway, I&#039;ve resorted to bribery. For helping me out with my devious pyramid scheme I&#039;ll give you the chance to win a $10RP card. There will be more prizes in the future so don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t win this one. Mystery skins, icons, ward skins, rune pages and champs might show up. The more that people get involved the more I&#039;ll put into the prizes. Trust me this is just the beginning. \n\nThen again, you might not want free stuff and I can&#039;t force you but I&#039;m pretty sure you need funds to buy _our special OCE_ {{champion:38}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:17}}_ skin._\n\n[The second RP giveaway is now live on Facebook.](https://www.facebook.com/OCEisaNicePlaceAfterAll)\n\nEDIT: **Due to a suggestion I'm also having a competition right here on the boards.** Bump the thread by saying what you think we can do to improve OCE and I'll pick someone to get a mystery skin.

Without it none knows what goes on in games, some people aren't even able to stop and think about what if this was me, what would happen to my account. \n\nPersonally i feel that if there was a tribunal then it would greatly improve the community, even if it doesn't really commit to anything some people might feel differently in game after a hard day of reading the toxicologys.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-09-29T13:15:18.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. Part of the reason we find ourselves in the state we're in is because we don't have The Tribunal. \n\nThe ability to see what is acceptable and unacceptable is essentially limited to what people say on the forum (in the name-and-shames and similar). The Tribunal was a more comprehensive way of looking at a specific player's behaviour and more widely what we considered toxic as a community.

Some people will just have the urge to fight and flame at fellow teammates. And the whole 'banning' these players idea is a bit like panadol, just a temporary relief, as while all will be fine while they're unable to play, but it will most likely only infuriate them more, resulting in them being more toxic, making the community even worse. I kind of like the idea of rewarding positive players, as it gives the toxic players a goal to strive for, whether it be the free skin, or summoner icon. Then again, those who don't receive it may inhabit the \"_I don't care, I never wanted (x) anyway, _\" Which would make them continue their negative behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-09-30T11:00:37.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's tough. \n\nWhile having rewards like the icon are neat the desire to be positive or at least not toxic needs to come from within the player. Since we've been running rampant for the last two years it's harder for people to realise \"hang on, all that stuff I've been doing isn't actually ok\" until they get a ban. But you know, here's hoping it's only uphill from here!\n\nI also wrote about the honour system (which I think Riot should update) in this post if you're interested to give it a skim: https://oceisaniceplaceafterall.wordpress.com/2015/09/14/the-death-of-honour-and-the-rise-of-mastery/","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-09-30T06:29:01.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What OCE needs the most right now is a larger community presence.

However on a personal level I don't really like the way you named the blog, being \"OCE is a nice place after all\", as it would suggest that OCE is somehow not originally, however considering we know that OCE just as bad as every other game server virtually ever hence I am a little bothered by that blog title.\n\nOther than that, I think you're doing a good work. Oh and the font size, I think they need to be reduced, so there won't be this much scrolling when reading.

I can't really have \"OCE is a Nice Place\" as the title because not many people think it is. It just sounds like I'm being ironic or cheeky. I think \"After All\" is actually quite positive as it suggests beyond the evidence against it that the statement is actually true.
