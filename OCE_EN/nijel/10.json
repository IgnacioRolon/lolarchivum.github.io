We have you covered.\n\nOcean Week is all about playing games to get as many points as possible to help defend Oceania, and the most fun way to do that is with friends. If you are looking for people to play with we have set up a discord server for you to join to find fellow Summoners.\n\n[**Here&#039;s the discord invite link!**](https://discord.gg/GP8JK7N)\n\n---\n\nThe discord server is broken up into 4 different chat channels for each of the maps, along with 1 channel #general for discussion. If you are looking to find a group to play with, post in the channel that is for the map that you want to play. The channels are:\n\nSummoner&#039;s-Rift-NORMS\nSummoner&#039;s-Rift-RANKED-FLEX\nHowling-Abyss-ARAM\nTwisted-Treeline\n\nYou can choose to either send a message into these chat rooms or invite people that are posting, it is up to you. Use this as a template for the message to send into the chat to make everything as seamless as possible, and to help you find a group as fast as possible.\n\n&gt; Summoner Name: \n&gt; Preferred Roles: \n Rank: \n\n_I would only recommend using ranked information if you are posting in the ranked channel for Summoners Rift games._\n\n---\n\nWe sadly however must have some rules in place before you go posting, and the rules in the discord are as follows:\n\n1. No spamming, once you state your information only do it once and wait for an invite\n2. Adhere to the boards Universal Rules \n3. The 4 invite channels are for the information using the template provided only, if you would like to have a chat about Ocean Week or have any questions, talk in the #general chat.\n---\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask them in the general chat in discord or ask them down below in the comments. \n\nGood luck in your games and have a fun Ocean Week!","replies":[{"poster":"almightybacca","date":"2017-01-25T09:30:28.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats hot\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[]}]}
