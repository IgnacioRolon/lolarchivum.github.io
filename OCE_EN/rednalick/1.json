It is incredibly annoying when there is suddenly a AFK on our team past the remake period who makes you loss the game therefore you get demoted. I think that they should add that whenever there is an AFK after the remake period who does not come back before the game has ended, you shouldn&#039;t receive a demotion.\r\n\r\nThis also really confuses me as plenty of times I have been on 0 LP, lost a game and not get demoted. Why is this? \r\nThis is incredibly weird to me as this is very random. \r\n\r\nWould love if they added this as it is very annoying having some who plays the first 20 minutes then suddenly decides to just go AFK and then you lose your Rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-07T23:57:54.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason the remake period is so limited is because anything more is easily abuseable.

If you play very well, as in S+ performance then a loss may only net you a small loss in lp. The players that play bad lose much more. In the case where you are on 0lp and facing demotion, then a very good performance may save you from demotion. it would be an extra safety net. this can't be abused.\n\nstop defending and kissing riot's ass please. they haven't fixed it because they would get no $$$ in return for putting the resources into fixing it. a riot employee has even openly admitted on these forums that it is bottom of their priority list.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-11T00:21:38.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do the performance metrics/lp gains have to do with AFKs? That's like trying to use a bottle opener on a can, completely different problem and solution.\n\nAs for your suggestion, as one that has been made by many others, it is very flawed.\n___\n**First of all League of Legends is a team game. **\nYou can have personal skill out the ass but if you don't know how to play as a part of a team then you aren't going to have much success. Introducing such a system would destroy teamwork, i.e the core strategy of the game. Are low elo players unreliable? Yes. Are they there for a reason? Yes.\n\nSomeone could have the personal skill (mechanics and gameplay) of a a Diamond player and no capacity for/understanding of team play. You put them in a Bronze game and they'll smash because they're skill and game knowledge are far above that of your average Bronze player, but put them in a Diamond game and they will **_lose_**. The higher you go the more reliant you have to be on your team, and the more reliant they have to be on you.\n\nPersonal performance weighting on LP gains might apply in Bronze and low Silver where play is inconsistent, but if you are working with your team (just because someone is hella behind doesn't mean they are useless) and helping coordinate them you will be rewarded with wins anyway, and if you choose to go off on your own and splitpush, and leave your team to 4v5 when they obviously can't then you will face the consequences of that. _Splitpushing/picking is worse than useless if you don't get anything and/or lose too much for it_.\n\nTeam play wins games.\n\n___\n**Second of all, the same reason they won't tell you what exactly goes into your mastery grade.**\nIf LP was based on solo performance people would go out of their way to improve their score, or hang back and not take a death to keep their score instead of playing the game, essentially destroying any hope of victory. Best case it makes the path to victory very unclear, because the system is rewarding solo performance, and yet it is still team performance that determines the game.\n\nWorst case you will have people actively leaving their team and losing games because they will lose less LP and the rest of their team (heaven forbid) had a bad game. Lower elo is a place of very polarising scores, if someone is doing badly you need to either help them out fast or accept that they are going to be way behind and do what you can to stop or mitigate their opponents presence.\n\n___\n**Third, skill is relative, and therefore W/L is the equaliser.**\nDoes the matchmaking system have impactful problems? Sure. If you're in High Plat+. If you aren't then you are being placed against people of the same relative skill. Maybe your team is having a bad day? Maybe their team is having a good one? Either way your average skill is basically the same and therefore it's up to teamwork and strategy to win the game. Such is the core principle of a team based 5v5 game.\n\nSolo performance is **entirely irrelevant** if you can't combine it with what the rest of your team has to offer. One player alone will **never** win a game. It basically comes down to who has the better teamwork. Tell me you've never had a game where your team was fed and you still lost the game because the enemy had the winning strategy?\n\n___\n**Fourth and final, actual skill relative to League of Legends and the satisfaction of improving VS. instant gratification?**\nPersonal performance impacting LP would destroy what League of Legends is. It would be an entirely different game. Instead of, \"oh we lost what did we do wrong?\" which encourages improvement, it's \"oh but I did good so it was all my teams fault\" which does not. \n\nSo consider this then, sure you lose less LP and you blame your team but you've still lost the game. You continue like this, maybe you do well maybe you don't but because you aren't working with your team at all, instead focusing on your own score, you keep losing. You're losing less LP but you're also losing more games. Are you gonna climb with that, or are you going to drop even further?\n\nImproving your rank in LoL is about improving your personal skill AND your ability to play as a part of and where necessary as a leader of a team. If you don't improve then how do you expect to climb? Your rank doesn't magically go up over time, you have to work for it.\n\n___\n**tl;dr League is a team game, and teamwork is what wins games and is therefore what is rewarded. Basing LP on personal performance metrics is a cop out measure that would make you feel a bit better in the short term but ultimately would lose you more games and not help you climb anyway and would drag down the overall health of the game and matchmaking along with it.**","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-07-09T12:38:09.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to almost make a tangent but isn't there another criteria/system in place for dc'd teammates that gives loss prevented?

Especially when at the end you yourself say that this game is about BOTH. like seriously, who are you trying that hard to impress at riot?\n\nYou talk about teamwork in a way where it seems you are not comprehending the difference between dynamic queue and professional league of legends. If you solo queue you are matched with random people. You can be a great teammate but your teammates might not be. How good someone works with their team is still an individual skill and part of their performance. Basically you're trying to justify a good team player getting punished because their team mates are not.\n\nYour only real argument against it is that someone may intentionally not participate in fights to get a better score. This is a weak argument. \n\nFirstly, who said the current mastery grade system is perfect? Perhaps it values certain things too highly (eg. not dying more than once). It can and should be changed/tweaked.\n\nSecondly, for someone to truly have a great performance, they would need high kill participation. So sitting back and not participating will not get you anywhere. If they already have that kind of score then 1. it makes no sense to then intentionally lose and not try to win, and 2. refer back to first point.\n\nThirdly, it would be up to riot to decide how much weighting performance would have. you seem to have not understood that w/l would still be a big factor.\n\nLike honestly, it boggles my mind how you can be against a system that would, over time, reward people for playing consistently well (both skill and teamwork) and punish the people who consistently play bad. Right now the system allows the opposite to happen. You are incredibly delusional if you think this would drag down the health of the game instead of improve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-11T23:41:01.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting a bit too salty so I'll back up a bit, I was definitely more aggressive than I intended to be/should have been in my response.\n\nFirst I'll say I don't think the current system is perfect, but I also disagree that personal performance should be a factor, at least not anything in the realm of the mastery grading atm.\n\nThe mastery grading does seem to be impacted by kill participation but not hugely. Even if you assumed something LP related was tied heavily to kill and objective participation, what about a strong split pusher? A top lane Nasus might get 4 turrets and an inhib on his own but not have much participation elsewhere. The trouble with introducing mechanisms like these is that they exclude (intentionally or otherwise) certain playstyles or strategies. \n\nA static W/L may seem less fair in the short term, but in the long term equalises.\n\nI don't wanna get into another essay so I'll leave it there. tl;dr I think there could be improvements, but I don't think personal performance metrics are the way to go, I think it'd have to be something far more sophisticated/context related (e.g exceptional healing in team fights for supp or damage taken in team fights for tanks)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-10T00:37:56.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gotta love the trolls which wait until the 3 min mark, then at 3:01 when cant remake they dc and never come back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Janná","date":"2016-07-07T08:06:46.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to lose a couple games at 0 LP to actually demote- it's like a safety net if you like.
