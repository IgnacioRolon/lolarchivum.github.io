Looking for coaches and clients to get this thing off the ground.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there! I&#039;m Chris, or Christoph in game. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI peeked Diamond 2 earlier this season, although stopped playing competitively due to higher school workloads (being in senior sucks!) etc, thus decaying to Diamond 5. Alas, I have competed against OPL pros in solo-queue and can mechanically hold my own against challenger level players. I have great game knowledge, long term experience in 5v5 ranked team scenarios and can play all roles - and I really want to share my knowledge with newer/lower ranked players to encourage them to improve at the game.\n\nI&#039;ve been playing more casually recently (normals/ARAM) and can&#039;t help but notice the amount of lower ranked summoners that have potential to climb, although complain they are stuck in the cliche, non-existent &#039;elo hell&#039;. It saddens me that this demotivates them, and I explain how I started in bronze too. Everyone has to start somewhere. But it&#039;s the people who are willing to put in the time and effort to improve and accept constructive criticism that have the tendency to climb the ranks.\n\nTherefore I, along with my friend Jake (Hooyah in game, Platinum 4) have created **LeagueMentor**, a course capable of being tailored to every summoner based off their individual needs, for the players that truly want to improve and climb. What makes our coaching unique is our personalized approach, in regard to really getting to know the client and prioritizing the aspects of the game that they want to improve at the most. This is achieved through VOD analysis, training drills (sandbox mode pls), interactive tutorials and real-time duo-queue, to name a few.  We&#039;ve put significant effort into structuring this course, so naturally we will want a little something in return for offering our service and expertise. We haven&#039;t settled on a payment model yet, but it is certain that the pricing will be fair and on the cheaper side compared to competing sites. \n\nWe have a teamspeak server (**austs1.gameservers.com:9326**) so if you are interested in becoming a mentor and mentee, or simply have any inquiries about payment or the course itself, feel free to pop in! There will most likely be either Jake or myself in there, and if not just leave you details in the lobby chat or try again another time. You can also leave a comment down below if you&#039;re keen.\n\nTL;DR - Started a new coaching service. Cheap prices. Unique, personally tailored course. Looking for preferably new/low ranked players that want to improve. Also looking for plat+ ranked players to become coaches.
