I am focusing on fox fire Ahri in this, and the reason I am posting this is because in this skin the orb that Ahri uses as her weapon is blue just like in her default skin however given that the other colors used throughout fox fire Ahri are all orange including the colors of her w and the projectiles fired from her ult what I am suggesting is that her orb be changed to an orange color that would better suit the color schemes used throughout the skin, and also I know that it hasn&#039;t been changed in her other skins however in her new skin the orb is pink so why not make this one orange. {{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"BootyButtons","date":"2015-08-20T11:47:28.872+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!
