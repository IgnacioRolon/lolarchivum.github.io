It was up for a few hours today and I enjoyed every moment of playing it. After playing for 5 years Summoners Rift has become pretty stale for me.\r\n\r\nI understand the fact that we don&#039;t have enough people playing to support it, allegedly, however if people don&#039;t mind waiting in queue for 10-15 minutes, such as myself, I believe we should at least be able to play the game modes that are supported in other regions.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
