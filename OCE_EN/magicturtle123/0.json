I had tried norms and arams with no luck prior (as well as URF games) but that was what got it. I think it must need multiple teammates. (Please note we also won the game right after) Try for a 5 man game rushing mid tower or something if your mission hasn't already expired.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mr Silly","date":"2018-07-05T06:26:00.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here","replies":[{"poster":"DisturbedBeast","date":"2018-07-06T03:28:49.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the mission is still up, read my other comment :)","replies":[]}]}]}
