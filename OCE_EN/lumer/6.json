I try to level up an ability and it won&#039;t click. My mouse moves just fine in client, but the left and right mouse buttons dont work at all. Ive had this mouse for 3 years now and never had a problem, restarting client, PC and unplugging had no effect. Started a bot game after to test if it was just one game but it happened again.","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-08-15T21:26:51.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Morning Lumer,\n\nSorry to hear about your mouse clicking issue.\n\nMy major suggestions would be to first use another mouse/keyboard to rule out hardware possibilities. If that doesn't work, try resetting your config though keep in mind you'll have to redo your bindings:\n\nLog into the game then hop into a custom game. Alt+Tab out of the match, then navigate to your League installation folder, which should be in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\n\nDelete the folder named Config\n\nOnce you've deleted the folder, leave the custom match. You'll then want to hop into another custom match to confirm the changes were saved.\n\nLet me know if this helped :D.\n\nThanks\nSwhyper","replies":[]}]}
