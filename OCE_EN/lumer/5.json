If you otherwise tell me that Board is actually near its finishing phase then I am sorry. I feel this entire project is a failure on many levels sadly.**\n\nA few things I think are what lead to today situations on the **OCE board **where there is no discussion and topics just drift off the page as you said:\n\n1. The comment section doesn't really encourage discussion in the same sense as the old forum, hence most of the stuff is reduced to \"leave a comment here\" style. So less replies is pretty much expected. Not to mention currently post tracking is a pain.\n\n2. The discussion/forum community is for the most part against the Board's existence but they still introduced it. So who and how many do you think will be using the Board regularly now?\n\n3. The Board mod removes any thread that is not completely into League of Legends, unlike the forum one where he only removed threads he thought was toxic by nature (sometimes he was active in removing, sometimes he just let it flow).  There were many arguments and fun threads as a result, that was what gave the forum colour.\n\n4. They separated the original sorting into \"New\" and \"Hot\" while keeping the \"Best\" as the defaulted option. First of all, most of us don't like upvote sort so that's not good. Secondly, the original forum had both New and Hot together so new threads would appear at the top and those which constantly received replies would also stay at the top for publicity, isn't that wonderful? Yes it was indeed but they separate that so now we have to constantly jump between the 2 sorts to achieve what we originally had, that's just busy work.\n\n5. The picture attachment function, while it's good that you can attach picture easier than before we are now stuck with a feature of not being able to paste the picture anywhere we want on the post we write, but only at the very bottom. Again, worthless, it's no longer a self expression method but eye candies to attract readers. You can drag the pic upwards into the post but it will show as a link instead of a picture, not to mention the sizes of them are reduced heavily you almost always need to click to view what it actually is unlike old forum, where you have the control over the dimension of the picture within the maximum file size given.\n\nI guess there are other subjective/objective points that lead to the current state of Board, these are the ones I can think of from the top of my head atm.\n\n**EDIT:**\n6. It's more of a bug than intended but it hasn't been fixed as far as I know. Whenever you hop on some NA LoL site on other tabs it will also change your OCE Board's region as NA, you have to manually change it back, it's annoying. (And god forbid I continue from the list above.)\n\nThat's what went through Riot's mind when they created Board. ","replies":[]}]}
