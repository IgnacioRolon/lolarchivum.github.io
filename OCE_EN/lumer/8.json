Always welcome to receive feedback on anything from grammar and spelling to flow and coherence. This is the first creative piece I&#039;ve written because I wanted to, not had to. I hope you all enjoy my tale, sitting at 1313 words, so there&#039;s a bit of wiggle room.\nAlso, looking for some specific suggestions and feedback on the title.   \nWithout further ado, enjoy.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe bright orange light of the sun burned brightly on the horizon, birds sang their harmonies, and Runeterra was waking to a new day. The last day. Soon the moon would inch its way to smother the light of the land, marking the end of time. Leona watched solemnly behind Ahri, who was  using her tails to do tricks with her orbs of arcane energy. Her playfulness never failed to bring a smile to the face of Leona, even in times as dire as these. Leona knew she had to go, to drag herself away from her love. Forever. It had to be done. Her destination was Demacia, on the coast of Conqueror&#039;s Sea, there she would find Lux, sister of Garen and wielder of light. The Temple of Solari, where Leona now resides, sat on the eastern side of Mount Targon, the tallest mountain in all of Runeterra. The journey would see her make her way through Mogron Pass, the barrier between North and South Valoran. She stepped back into the shadows, away from Ahri. Leona had to go alone. \n\nThe trek to Demacia was swifter than Leona had anticipated, arriving shortly after noon had passed. She needed Lux&rsquo;s help, there was none else other than a fellow light-bringer she could trust. Ahri was too precious, she couldn&rsquo;t lose her. Leona finished climbing the stairway to the door of the Crownguard&rsquo;s family home, as elegant and lavish as the people who live in it. Stowing away her sword, Leona lifted a hand to ring the bell located by the door. Within seconds a maid opened the grand entrance and ushered Leona inside.\n&ldquo;Do you have an appointment?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You will have to wait until Garen&rsquo;s available then&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m here for Luxanna&rdquo;\nThe maid looked at Leona, puzzled, then sighed and signalled her to follow. She was lead up a long, spiral staircase, walls lined with intricate murals and the banister engraved with ancient words. At the top she found a regal doorway, shining with bright lights, the colours of rainbows. This is where the maid left her, presumably to attend to other matters. Leona lifted a hand and knocked on the door, the colourful lights playing with her vision, distorting her hand. With a loud boom, the doors opened revealed a luxurious space filled with light, both natural and unnatural. By the mirror stood Lux, wearing a pure white dress, a far cry from the battle armour Leona is used to seeing. Lux moved swiftly to the door where Leona was still frozen in awe.\n&ldquo;Leona, what do I owe the pleasure?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I had a vision, it came to me in a dream&rdquo;\nLux let out a high pitched giggle which was enough for Leona to cringe as her ear drums were assaulted.\n&ldquo;During the eclipse, four will rise in Conquerors coast, just North from here&rdquo; Leona persisted, not to be shut down so soon.\n&ldquo;And you want my help?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I need your light Lux&rdquo;\n&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect me to abandon my duties to go on a wild goose chase. I will not be accompanying you. Now, I have other things to do, so please, escort yourself out&rdquo;\nLeona began to object, but the doors cut her short as the closed before her. She had no time left, she had defend the world all on her own.\n\nLeona travelled up the coast finding, to her surprise, no conflict. It wasn&rsquo;t long before she reached the place she had envisioned. A small, secluded beach lined with tall, dark cliffs. In the base of the far side cliff, she could see a cave, with and mouth large enough to fit anything wishing to enter. This is where they would be. Leona took a deep breath and started walking towards her doom.\n\nThere they stood, the Titans. Four of the most powerful beings to ever walk this land. Nautilus, Titan of the Depths, able to call upon the power of the ocean to turn the tides of battle. Trundle, the Troll King, manipulates ice to smash his foes to pieces. Hecarim, the Shadow of War, raging wars in darkness and the head of his army of  spectral horsemen. Finally Nasus, Curator of the Sands, able to unleash burning spirits from the ground to weaken his enemies. As the moon slowly began to block the edge of the purifying rays of sunlight, the Titans prepared to defend the prophecy. Leona was out of time. With a cry of battle she leaped to Nautilus, slicing her sword in the space between his armour, sunlight coiling through the shadows of his body. Using her shield as a weapon, Leona smashed the helmet of Nautilus, leaving a crack in the steel above the eyes. He let out a mighty roar, enough to make even Gangplank fear the deep. It was like the sound of waves crashing back into the ocean after building to great heights. She raised her sword to deliver a fatal blow,but was hit by a pillar of ice, sending her flying. Dazed and confused, she sat up, locating the source of the blow. She stumbled to her feet, only to be knocked down again as a stampede of shadows trampled her from the side. She wasn&rsquo;t strong enough, she was going to die. She struggled to keep her eyes open, her head locked in place from exhaustion. Fire began to rise from the earth, burning her skin as she stared into the sky, the sun now almost completely hidden by the bulk of the moon. Another shaking roar escaped from the mouth of Nautilus. The sounds of slicing and grunts of effort could be heard from the direction of the Titans. But this voice was female.\n&ldquo;This is necessary&rdquo;\nWith one final thundering cry of pain, Nautilus fell, the earth trembling as the colossus slammed down. Leona turned her head to see the most unlikely of saviours, Diana, her nemesis. Diana&rsquo;s eyes, however, we&rsquo;re fixed to the sky, just as the moon covered the entire sun, causing a full eclipse. Leona could feel energy rushing into her, but not from the sun. This glowing energy was an unnatural white, the dulled light casting more shadows than it expelled. This was the power of the moon. In unison, bright sun energy enveloped Diana, sliding along her crescent blade. In this moment, the sun and the moon were united combining in strength to imbue power upon their chosen champions. Lifted to her feet by renewed vitality, Leona looked into the eyes of Diana, and with a nod, they leapt to battle side by side. Silver beams of mercurial light rained down from the sky, turning the battlefield an eerie blue as golden rays danced from The Radiant Dawn&rsquo;s shield, weaving through the celestial torrent. Now overpowered, the Titans took the defence, but the combined force of the Solari and Lunari was too strong, and they crumbled. Leona used the heat of her abilities to melt the ice of the Troll King, while Diana shone moonlight into the heart of the Curator of the Sands. The two titans dropped to the soil beneath their feet, only Hecarim remained.\n&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t live to see your world destroyed&rdquo;\n He charged the ethereal women, in a desperate attempt to fulfil the prophecy. \n&ldquo;Feel the sun&rsquo;s glory&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Embrace the Night&rdquo;\nThey too then charged at the Titan, in an epic contest of will and might.\nIn the final seconds of the eclipse, blade of dusk and shield of dawn met monstrous titan in an explosion of energy and light. Leona hit the deck, as the lunar energy drained from her body. \n\nRising from her stupor, Leona looked up. Four, towering bodies were positioned before her. The prophecy was fulfilled. The Titans had risen, but they weren&rsquo;t merely Titans now, they were Worldbreakers.  \n-----------------------------------------------\n\nReferencing \"Prophecy of the Worldbreaker\":\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/prophecy-worldbreaker\n\n\"In the end, the moon will smother the sun.

I recommend picking one that is grander.
