Who do you guys think I should buy?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there someone else I should consider? If so, plz let me know.\r\n\r\nThx, AcerArena","replies":[{"poster":"AcerArena13","date":"2015-08-10T08:37:15.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for the help guys","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-10T04:59:09.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what you want to do more:\n\nLb = Escape + Burst dmg\nAhri = Single out opponents + burst dmg","replies":[{"poster":"AcerArena13","date":"2015-08-10T05:10:15.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Zen Bot,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ANvhIThZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-10T04:59:09.694+0000)\n>\n> Depends on what you want to do more:\n> \n> Lb = Escape + Burst dmg\n> Ahri = Single out opponents + burst dmg\n\nDo you personally have a preference?","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-10T06:07:00.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you want my opinion:\n\nLeBlanc has a good burst dmg rate, her ulti helps a lot with that burst dmg (2 w's within 2 seconds)\nBut Ahri has a better poke with her Q and if she gets ganked her E,  ulti and Q will help. Her Q also has a healing passive.\n\nBut I'm a Zed player :P\nI hate going up against Ahri the most, LB 4 me is quite the opponent, if you want to try out new stuff","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-08-10T05:51:54.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you like Annie I would recommend Lux, Viktor, Vel'koz and Veigar aside from the ones youve mentioned, all of them are strong, fun to play and not commonly played (with the exception of Viktor)","replies":[]}]}
