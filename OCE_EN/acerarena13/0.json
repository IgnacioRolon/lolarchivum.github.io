I recently got into shyvana jungle, it is very good.\r\nHowever, I&#039;m having some problems with my first clear.\r\n\r\nMy route so far has been krugs (leash), red, raptors, wolves, gromp, and then blue if i have enough health. Sometimes skuttle too.\r\nI&#039;m only level 22, so all I have for runes is a few armor seals. Because of this, I am usually dying around wolves. If I don&#039;t die, I am quite low health, so I usually can&#039;t do group or blue. I have to recall and buy pots. \r\n\r\nSo what I have considered is after doing red, I go to scuttle and kill it, so my health gets time to regen, I get health for killing skuttle, and my smite gets time to refresh. After this i would finish my clear.\r\n\r\nIs this a good idea? Am I doing something wrong? Should I be doing this differently?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts. \r\n\r\nThx, \r\nAcerArena","replies":[{"poster":"AshKetchup ","date":"2017-09-12T08:16:48.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just dont fight the jungle animals lol thats what i do","replies":[]},{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-07-23T06:24:05.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a big Shyvana enthusiast but a pretty mediocre player take this with a grain of salt:\n\nI like to get a leash on Krugs and smite them for the buff, straight to Red then wolves and smite will be back up for blue.\nI'm generally out of potions by then and like to skuttle then look at ganking, otherwise backing.\n\nI also take full offence masteries (21/9/0) and AS/Armor runes.\n\nYour idea of full clearing the jungle isn't bad at all if you can do it though, it's most important to be able to get your machete upgraded asap for the extra gold on smite and far easier clear.
