However, I feel that this is a legitimate problem that needs to be looked at. \r\n\r\nAlthough ARAM is a less popular game mode, it is still one that a lot of players find enjoyable. But too many times, a normal game of ARAM can be ruined by the prescene of bots.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the problem. Often, there are not enough people wanting to play Aram, so riot fills the gaps by adding bots to the game. This is good in theory. However, the bots need to be within close skill range to normal players, which they currently are not.\r\n\r\nTo start off with, some bots will simply not leave the spawn until after minions spawn, meaning that the frequent fights that happen before this time can easily be won by the team with less bots. Sometimes, they even don&#039;t play the whole game, which is ridiculous. \r\n\r\nBots generally start of with tier 2 boots and that&#039;s it. Not even some potions. This means that they will be considerably weaker than their opponents, disadvantaging their team. They then often like to build another pair of tier two boots. After this, they sometimes build ridiculous items for the champion they are playing. For example, I once had a lee sin bot on my team which decided to by archangels staff. Also, the bots will usually never buy components for items (such as a longsword when building into a phage), instead they will simply wait until they have enough gold to buy a full item, once again giving their team a large disadvantage.\r\n\r\nFinally, the way bots actually play is also very bad. They usually simply run into the enemy team and suicide, giving free kills and gold. Obviously, pings will have no affect. Moreover, bots often don&#039;t play the champion itself very well, such as constantly missing skill shots and not participating in team fights. \r\n\r\nIf you play a game of League Of Legends, you are dedicating a significant amount of time to it. It should not have to be wasted by playing in unfair games that are not fun for the real players.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the AI on ARAM bots needs to be significantly improved in order to provide an enjoyable playing experience for all players.  \r\n\r\nPlease post your opinions, I am interested in knowing other people&#039;s views on this matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-10-08T09:35:01.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when did bots play ARAM?

If so, that is unacceptable  imo.  And would real people actually build two pairs of boots?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-08T09:55:01.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just something people do sometimes. Not everyone has the knowledge to know what to do in different situations, or they don't know how to apply that knowledge. Personally, I think this becomes more clear in ARAM because it is so different to normal play. Most people do try their best to win but it's the few who ruin the experience for others. \"One rotten apple spoils the bunch\" and whatnot. And yes, some people do actually build two pairs of boots, some of them not realising the effects don't stack (and a few of those refusing to believe anyone on that point).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-10-08T09:47:46.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh it's in ARAM games too?
