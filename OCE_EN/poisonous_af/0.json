When I used that I get a emote called Vamporo, a poro with the costume like a vampire. \r\nAfter then when I was about to equip that to my emotes stuff. I can&#039;t find it anywhere, neither the loot nor the emotes collection tab. I went to the purchase history, it shows every other reward I got before except this one. Did I just get a emote that&#039;s unreleased? Feels bad for lost my reward.{{sticker:sg-janna}} \r\n\r\nPlayer ID: SVE Liberty Walk","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-03T12:42:06.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience emotes, especially ones that are auto redeemed can take a bit to appear in your inventory. Usually restarting your client will do the trick but sometimes there's a wait necessary as well.","replies":[]}]}
