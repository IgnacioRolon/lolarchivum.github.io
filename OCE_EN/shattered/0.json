So what's happening is that I go in to game, everything is fine for like the first nine minutes then bam. It freezes. I can still move my mouse, but can't press ESC to bring up the menu or CTRL-ALT-DEL to open the task manager. It is just stuck there... I tried waiting. Ten minutes with no response whatsoever. I need to restart my computer by pressing the power button and when I press the power button it all unfreezes but then my computer shuts down and I need to wait the entire process of logging in, connecting to the internet and reconnecting. It usually happens once per game but this time it happened twice and reset my low priority queue countdown. Riot and community please help me. I have included a DxDiag note incase somebody needs it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T03:47:29.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard of an issue like this before, to be able to get nearly ten minutes into a game without a hitch and then it crashing. And it's a weird way to crash too, with you being able to control the game for a brief moment right before the shutdown. You have Windows XP, so I presume you have had it for a while (more than a few years). Since you regain control of League a moment after you press \"Shutdown\", I'm thinking that one program which you have running in the background is interfering with League.\n\nFrom your DirectX Diagnosis log I can see that there's nothing wrong with your setup, you're over the minimum requirements. Just keep in mind, [support for Windows XP has officially ended](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/end-support-help). It could just be Riot are using a new library that isn't supported by that OS, which causes it to crash so late in game. Shame if that's the case, because to fix it you'd have to basically re-program Windows XP, or upgrade it.\n\nThat's my take on it. Best of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Shattered","date":"2014-12-21T07:59:49.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, I have another computer that I can only access for certain amounts of time a day, and it is Windows XP as well and everything runs fine.

My suspicion is that it's the process alg.exe which is causing this issue. It's a free anti-malware, pretty good imo but if you have an outdated version (most likely since XP support has ended) it could be blocking the newest version of League is some way. If you are admin and are comfortable with it, try force closing alg.exe and see if League no longer crashes. If that's the case, then it's a problem within ALG, not League.\n\nIf that does nothing, however, try the following. Force close the following processes (**words in italics is a brief description of what it is**) (You will need to be an admin to do the following):\nchrome.exe (all instances) *Google Chrome*\nalg.exe *Anti-malware*\niPodService.exe *Apple iPod background sync service*\nNintendoWFCReg... *Nintendo Internet Connection Authenticator*\nRtWLan.exe *Not too sure*\nstsystra.exe *Not too sure*\nacrotray.exe *ALG tray icon*\negui.exe *Not too sure*\njusched.exe *Java background updater*\njqs.exe *Not too sure*\nekrn.exe *Not too sure*\ncvpnd.exe *Not too sure*\nAppleMobileDevic... *Apple whatever-isn't-an-iPod background sync service*\n\nAll of these services are ones which are default in Windows XP i.e. they were installed at some point. If some of them don't want to close, then find the actual program on your desktop and use it to close it (might be the Apple services, they are terribad at coding for Windows). Test your computer again and see if League does not crash.\n\nIf that does not work, then you can try force closing the following: **WARNING: The following may be system processes that have been installed by Windows Update or by Service Packs. Ending these tasks could have negative effects on your computer/loss of control. Do this at your own risk.** If your computer does crash, then just manually resetting should fix it (you aren't editing what opens when your computer starts up, otherwise your computer would have never worked in the first place)\nwscntfy.exe\nwmiprvse.exe (all instances)\nwmiarvse.exe\nrundll.exe (all instances)\nnvsvc32.exe\n\nAdditionally, I don't think Skype has anything do to with it, for all the time and for all the OS's I've used it on while playing League, it has been fine.\n\nI apologise if this method seems a bit crude and time consuming, but it's the most definite way I know of that you can make sure it's not another process which is interfering with League. Do post back the results you get from doing this.\n\nP.S. You can always try reinstalling, if you're desperate.","replies":[{"poster":"Shattered","date":"2014-12-28T05:08:45.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.
