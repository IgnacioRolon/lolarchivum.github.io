Garen excels at running into or at enemy teams but once he's in there he either dies in seconds because he's going crit or he does nothing except shred armour and execute a target that was already going to die. Garen is extremely easy to win lane with, he doesn't have a lot of counters aside from anyone ranged. But you're right, if no one gets a Last Whisper, Black Cleaver or isn't playing Jarvan, Garen will be so darn unkillable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-30T13:27:00.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard the same thing when I mained Master Yi before I even hit Level 20 >.>","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-29T04:24:17.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just have to not worry about what others say (if you do you will spend every day on this game in tears) \nits just fact that some champs are easier to do well with than others, you just have to accept that and move on, (i dont play garen so i dunno how hard he is to play) but if garen is your favourite champ and you love everything about him then play him no matter what anyone says! but if you play him just because he is the only champ you get good scores with then what they are saying is true and you should consider playing other champs.\ni personally just play champs i like whether they are op or not. \nanyway the crux of the matter is; people get mad when they lose and will think of any reason to blame everything other than themselves and if your champ is considered easy then they will use that as an excuse for their own shortcomings. i play Azir who is considered pretty hard to play and if i do well the enemy team says \"%%%% your bs champ riot wtf so broken\" and when i play badly my own team says \"wtf azir pick a real champ he is useless\" so whatever you do you're gunna get rage it doesn't matter what champ you play so just play one that you like and put up with it.\n\nhowever what you said at the end makes no sense, \"if you get kills you obviously don't need to play a 'skill based champ' but noooo.\"\ngetting lots of kills all the time means you have mastered that particular champ and should move on to one that is more challenging for you.\nits like maths at school if you get good at year 5 maths you move on to year 6 next year, it doesn't mean you should sit at year 5 maths lvl for the rest of your life just because you are good at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-28T06:36:41.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it doesn't take much skill to press q then right click an adc, and then press r to use your point and click execute when they're low though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2014-12-27T09:50:41.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people dont know how to play against a certain match up, or dont know wht the hell they r doing.
