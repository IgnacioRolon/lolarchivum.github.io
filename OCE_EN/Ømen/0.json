Navigate to the Nvidia Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings\n2. Program Settings Tab > \"Add\" button > \"Browse\" button\n3. Navigate to \"[drive path]\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\league_client\\releases\\0.0.0.177\\deploy\"\n4. You will see 3 league executable files, \"LeagueClient\", \"LeagueClientUx\", and \"LeagueClientUxRender\"... Select any one of them\n5. Now that you have selected a program file, set \"Altialiasing - FXAA\" to OFF ... \"Texture filtering - Anistropic sample optimization \" to OFF... \"Texture filtering - Quality\" to HIGH QUALITY... \"Texture filtering - Trilinear optimization\" to OFF\n6. Find the other 2 applications that you did not select in step 3, repeat steps 4 and 5 for each one.\n7. If your client is currently running, blurriness will not go away until you close and re-launch the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Arya Mathers","date":"2019-03-03T16:30:38.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed mine!
