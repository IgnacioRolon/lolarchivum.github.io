Once a new champion is released, there is a certain level of hype around obtaining this champion and the release skin with it (they bring out a bundle, etc). Putting this ranked restriction in place, will most likely convince some players not to obtain their new champion+skin using RP, as they may feel they can't use the champion to it's 'fullest' extent, as to not being able to use it in ranked. That being said, I really don't believe Riot is a company who's really 'In it for the money'. So, another reason, is that they want players to be able to use the champion that they purchase (IP or RP), in however way they feel, as they have recently purchased the champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Timebomb0800","date":"2014-12-10T07:49:37.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> it would be cool if newly released champions were restricted from ranked play for around a week or so, so that abuse cases both positive and negative don't effect the rest of the team, e.g people trying the champ for the first time in ranked/ learning how to play against the champ/ stop people from the PTR having a leg up. not sure if everyone would be keen for this idea, would like feedback\n\n\nI approve, either team will be advantageous or disadvantageous from the new champ feeding being/useless and no idea how to use them (or just UP) or they will be stomping as counterplays have not been discovered yet (or just OP)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T07:49:24.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would definitely make sense","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cenobis","date":"2014-12-10T05:46:34.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's something that I can go with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2014-12-10T04:48:45.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds better..
