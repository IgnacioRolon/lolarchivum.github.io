I have well over 8000 games, between four level 30&#039;s and another level 28 on the way. I have played (a LOT) of B5, all the way up to Gold III. I joined OCE the day the server opened, as far as I know, so I have had a little experience.\r\n\r\nI just want to say: CONGRATS! You have succeeded in making the community on OCE just as useless and pathetic as any other server (if not one of the worse) Tanks hide in bushes, hoping to get kills after their entire team dies.. assassins and ADC&#039;s are now the front line of battle! Towers are taken out undefended, by MINIONS and whoever actually engages Dragon or baron first loses because they NEVER ward or wait for full team (or actually go for it after an Ace when enemy team cannot defend)\r\n\r\nYou can use your team for bait.. and never engage or decoys, so the TANKER can get away, the high CC champs stay back and do nothing until the team dies and they then use CC to try and get away and fails! ALL THIS is totally acceptable for this community and you will actually be PUNISHED if you call people out and call them stupid for being four or five levels down against their opponents and all they want to do is abandon their lanes and towers, falling further behind by staying and doing NOTHING but mid. \r\n\r\nYou can be the only one oin your team who is warding or covering tower defense or buying time for your team to respawn (because, once again, they do nothing but push mid and die at enemy towers while you are waiting to respawn and it YOUR fault. AND GET THIS: YOU get reported because the morons can now group up in three or four man groups!\r\n\r\nTHE FACT IS: 9/10 people playing ranked (Up to and INCLUDING GOLD) on this server could barely win in Int bot games because they have no idea what objectives are or how to TRUELY help their team (instead of coming in to do ONE HIT and take the kill) They then see someone else die ONCE or TWICE (while being four or five deaths down themselves) and call feeder or troll while not defending towers or trying to farm a bit more to catch up. NO! They go mid, beg their team to do same and fall further and further behind while the better players are LITERALLY begging in chat and with pings for them to defend THEIR OWN TOWER FROM MINIONS!\r\n\r\nI use smite in lane: with the new Jungle items, you can start of ANY type of build you want and it a decent starter item. But you are not ALLOWED to try anything or non meta because you get accused troll and or/feeding when you are the highest level, taken the most towers and EVEN TAKEN TWO ENEMY INHIBS SOLO. and if you fight back, stand up for yourself? BANNED\r\n\r\nIf you realise just how PATHETIC and stupid your team is AND YOU DO NOT WANT THEM IN HIGHER TEIRS and therefore ENCOURAGING stupidity.... BANNED\r\n\r\nIF YOU SAY NOTHING AT ALL.. BANNED\r\n\r\nI came into this game AGAINST the advise of so many people and warnings about the community, hearing it is basically the laughing stock of the gaming world... Really starting to see why that the case when the idiots attack someone, cannot take the response, so they cry to Riot and RIOT actually ENCOURAGES them. TRUE trolls own this game and make it what it is and people who are actually doing something about it get punished.\r\n\r\nI might of been harsh, yes: But I was not racist or homophobic or teliung people to kill themselves or wishing cancer on people families... apparently, all this is fine and dandy.... But call people a  moron for abandoning their lanes and towers and doing NOTHING but push mid, even when 2 or 3 people are dead...  or use smite... or draw enemies away from your base by taking out enemy Inhibs.. or using smite to steal Dragon or Baron.. or enemy Red and Blue buffs...  ALL INTSA PUNISHMENTS.\r\n\r\nI thought this was Australia, where if someone calls you something, you can call them an idiot when you are backing up your arguments with reasonable, logical and valid points THAT THEY THEMSELVES ATTACKED with. Clearly not, and we are some form of kindergarten where mummy (Riot) has to hit the &quot;bad&quot; kid who would not give the little angel all the candy! Because the little angel is SO POPULAR and has many &quot;friends&quot; who do!\r\n\r\nADC&#039;s treat supports like literal wenches instead of actual teammates. Tanks hide in bushes while our ADC and Mid Mages are the front line. And if I build a Hurricane/Static Shiv combo (to defend my BASE) I get called a non meta troll... and reported/suspended.\r\n\r\nSo yeah: so long and thanks for all the fish but this moronic community and it&#039;s &quot;Leaders&quot; can go jump off a cliff. ALL you have done is encourage stupidity, mob-style rule and made this server just as pathetic as all the others.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen BIade","date":"2016-06-27T05:09:37.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE server is just as bad as all the others.
