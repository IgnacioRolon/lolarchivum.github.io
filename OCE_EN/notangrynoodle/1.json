Ranked games are only for smurfs and boosters. Winning your lane and helping team will never win you the game, might better beg for a better team. All the game company has done is to persuade players to spend more money on buying skins. Why is league still named as PvP game when it&#039;s not about how well you perform in the game lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-19T22:46:00.927+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not at the point of uninstallation, but the game is certainly in the worst state I've seen, and I've been here since season 2.\nI'm not even talking about the toxic player base, the game itself is a shambles atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-02-19T12:40:45.313+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"The game has had several core aspects evolve drastically over its life cycle. Off the top of my head.\n\n* Game has moved further and further from solo carrying. Now teamwork matters much much more. You can't go top without tp, every game is just whatever team goes balls deep on bot first. Now its whatever team has the heaviest weights rather than the best players that decides things.\n* Strict meta enforcement despite the fact Riot always used to say they didn't want to force meta they have consistently restricted player build/playstyle choices.\n* Ability creep. Note I mean this as in they have moved away from basic more down to earth kits. Every new champ these days has some crazy new mechanic.\n* Removal and replacement of the older classic champions. Riot essentially just deletes the original champion and completely replaces them these days if they do a rework.\n* Certainly T being allowed to make champions.\n* Punishment for game effecting behaviours is still minimal (griefing/inting etc) whereas punishment for verbal has become really tight and left to a bot that doesn't care for context. Swearing jokingly to a friend is banable if the bot reads your logs etc.\n* Moving towards more exploitative business models with regards to cosmetics.\n* Game is revolving more and more around competitive players and E-Sports with every single season.\n* Complete lore removal and rework from the ground up. Almost all the old lore has been retconned now.\n* Mass reworks like the juggernaut and marksman reworks that changed tons of champs who didn't need changing for the sake of a \"class rework\" (think they are stopping this now tho)\n* Now fully owned by Tencent.\n\nI could probably name more stuff but this is just the general list. Arguably some of these could be preferable however they would be preferable to someone who didn't play in the older seasons and get attached to them. A lot of the old players are haemorrhaging and have been for some time. It doesn't matter to Riot (Tencent) however as they understand that these constant changes and new addictive systems/gameplay patterns being brought in will result in a net gain of players. More new people join than old people leave. In short it depends but personally for me its gone downhill consistently. I uninstalled again today after another game against Zoe. Man who would think putting all a champions damage into one ability would be a bad idea? Haha dude. That was more just the last straw however.","replies":[{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2018-02-20T04:57:45.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ITS NOT ROIT ANYMORE ITS TENCENT AND LOOK AT PUB G its is or was the most streamed game and has a massive e sport following already and esport game is not a game to have fun in its a game to get a job basically","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-22T05:18:00.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how you want to look at it.\nIts owned by Tencent but the developer is still RITO","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-02-20T13:11:53.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TM06ASF,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=9ugua19o,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-02-20T04:57:45.018+0000)\n>\n> ITS NOT ROIT ANYMORE ITS TENCENT AND LOOK AT PUB G its is or was the most streamed game and has a massive e sport following already and esport game is not a game to have fun in its a game to get a job basically\n\nWhat are you trying to say exactly. Are you for LoL being 100% esports focused or against it? I mean either is a valid thing to want my point with my post is just that those who come from the older seasons are much more likely to dislike that direction. With a game that evolves as much as LoL I think it is natural that people enjoy their first moments most and get more bored as those moments morph into other things.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chedley","date":"2018-03-07T02:26:45.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok bye","replies":[]},{"poster":"djfunkey","date":"2018-02-19T14:57:04.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a solo player running into 3 premades is horrible as well jeez","replies":[]}]}
