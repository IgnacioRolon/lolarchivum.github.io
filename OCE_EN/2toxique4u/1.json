When i alt+tabbed to check if the game has started, nothing pops up. so i click the icon on the start bar and nothing pops up. after many attempts still nothing. i couldnt even turn the stupid game off so i reopened a new league client and tried to reconnect and now it says ive tried to join a gam in an unofficial way by not clicking the play button or joining a match and when the reconnect button finally pops up, they remade and now i have a stupid priority queue.
