The more and longer you afk/dc, the more severe the punishments.\n\nWhere it will take an average player quite a few short leaves to get an LPQ, someone who has a long history of afks/dcs will get an LPQ almost instantly after offending.\n\nIt's also worth noting that afks/dcs in ranked are treated much more harshly than those in other game modes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-30T06:31:24.926+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Leavebuster system will identify you as an AFker/DCer *regardless* of whether or not you return to the game, in situations where you are DCed/AFK for 5+ minutes. As a note, Leavebuster will not give punishments for a first offence in minor cases, and it will not give longer punishments (10/20 minutes or, potentially, bans) in anything but extreme cases.\n\nThe thing you need to consider is that leaving a game (whether intentional or not) for most-any duration will have a significant impact and, in most cases, will be enough to ruin it for several of the other players, even if it's only a minute or two.","replies":[]}]}
