Then Riot investigates the matter and deals the reported player appropriately.\r\nJust an idea, feel free to constructively criticise or full poo poo on it.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-12-22T12:22:15.625+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lots of people have this idea. Plenty of people would simply all report the 1 guy that lost lane so they save their own LP even if the 5th guy did nothing wrong except have a bad game.\n\nToo easily abused and adds a hell of a lot of extra work to make sure people arent abusing it.\n\nJust accepting the loss and move on is a lot easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-24T06:27:07.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also there already is a penalty for players who ruin games. In ranked, they demote. In normals, basically the same thing. Their MMR goes down so they have to play with people who are doing the same thing. If you were to implement your idea, what would be the point of winning games even? You could just play and then report 1 person and never care about winning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-23T08:15:28.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem, once again lies with the players.\n\nthere will be players who abuse this system. \n\nthere will be players who will report the player who failed to carry for failing to utilise the kill gold they 'ksed' (I hate these self centered invertebrates).\n\nand implementing any leniency systems like this to an MMR based system, will have a cost, since mmr gains have to be paired with mmr loss in a ranked system, otherwise inflation will start to affect the integrity of the ranked system.","replies":[]}]}
