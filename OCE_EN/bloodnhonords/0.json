Support cannot give *any* information about another player's account, explicit or implicit, so you will likely get a generic \"thanks for raising this, we can't tell you anything\" type response.\n2. Given that this occurred in private messages, there may not be anything they can actually do. When it comes to things like threats, there are avenues that can be taken, but when you voluntarily add the player, it limits the actions they can take. I'm unsure if they're even allowed to keep records of private messages, in which case there is very little they would be able to do (since they'd have no records and can't confirm if a given screenshot is doctored or not).","replies":[]}]}
