Now at this time I had my PayPal on it. So I could just go onto my PayPal and just get some quick Rp. Now about 4 months later I had a huge payment of $600 go out of my bank. I made a clam to riot about this. Now they still have not responded to this day. But on my account there was some Rp but it never added up to he amount of money that spent. I only got 6000 Rp out of it now recently I just got a perma band. Now I will admit to being toxic in the past but I had cleaned up my act. The game I played I got a little mad but didn&#039;t swear at anyone. But riot desided to perma ban me. Now I know this won&#039;t get my account unband  but I didn&#039;t push the to get answers about the missing money. Because I loved the game so much.  But I don&#039;t really feel like playing it anymore after a perma ban. Maybe riot will work somthing out with me. I would even be willing to pay for my account please","replies":[{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2016-10-18T10:51:46.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, im gonna be frank with you, this is riot, riot isnt about the players, they will do things that seem nice e.g. giving out free skins hexchests thingies and whatnot, but they are a really bad moeny grubbing company, they have also taken extra money from my account on transactions which when i tried to get an answer their response was a copy and paste of the thing i agreed on basically saying they are allowed to(which legally they are) and then said too bad, they would not unban your account because right now they have you in a spot where you have to pay to get everything back, my advise to you would be find a MOBA like heros of the storm or dota where the companies care about their players, and actually respond to things like this, but bad luck bud best of luck in the future","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-19T00:52:35.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=About 9 Kenyans,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=5H2cFN6A,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-18T10:51:46.964+0000)\n>\n> Dude, im gonna be frank with you, this is riot, riot isnt about the players, they will do things that seem nice e.g. giving out free skins hexchests thingies and whatnot, but they are a really bad moeny grubbing company, they have also taken extra money from my account on transactions which when i tried to get an answer their response was a copy and paste of the thing i agreed on basically saying they are allowed to(which legally they are) and then said too bad, they would not unban your account because right now they have you in a spot where you have to pay to get everything back, my advise to you would be find a MOBA like heros of the storm or dota where the companies care about their players, and actually respond to things like this, but bad luck bud best of luck in the future\n\nas much as i love riot and what they do i couldn't agree more..","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-10-19T05:06:51.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said, Riot is probably one of the MOBA company out there who don't give a fuck about the players. Giving out free skins and shit is just to show a act of kindness when in reality they are earning thousands of money that they can give players more than just a free skin. the chances of them unbanning your account is very unlikely and I just wanna leave it out there that Riot is basically \"Give me your money and screw you\" kind of company.  I don't know about HoN and all the other MOBAS out there but I play dota and I can assure you that the company actually care about the players more than Riot will ever do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Frommo","date":"2016-10-19T03:15:52.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry but making a post on the forums won't do anything, you must be willing to commit yourself to sending support tickets and if nothing happens and they don't even give you a proper response then i'd not bother with trusting riot to make purchases with them. However, I have not experienced this so I am all good. Don't support the company with your money if they are being shitty people.

Have they given any reason why they can't help or has it just been a ordinary response with an apology?\n\nAll I can say now from this experience is enjoy the game, but unless they get back to you hold on to your wallet.\nHope you can still have fun with league.\n\nP.S. Don't stop sending those tickets, like a ticket every week or something","replies":[{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2016-10-19T05:00:04.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well on this account I got every singe champ and at least 1 skin for each champ so I'm not to keen to start over and Iv sent in 2 tickets and they give me different responses","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
