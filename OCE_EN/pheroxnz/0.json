Not including this ban, you have 7 past cases of bans due to negative behaviour and one due to intentional feeding. This is the most I've ever seen through instant feedback as permabans are usually handed out much faster.\n\nBy the time this game was played, your standing with the system was extremely poor, so it wouldn't have taken much to push you over to permaban status. You're lucky you weren't permabanned prior to this is what I'm saying.\n\nIn this game your whole team was really positive, you were the one player being unsportsmanlike to your own team as well as the enemy. Enough people decided your behaviour was report worthy and the instant feedback system decided that enough was enough, and handed the permanent suspension.","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-10-19T08:59:58.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo dude is there anyway of finding out what our record is like. because i may have been a tad rude in past games but only in a joking manner. perhaps a warning system where if you are reported a certain amount of times you are notified that your skating on thin ice. this woulf most likely straighten up alot of toxic shitters and make them think twice about how they act. food for thought \nhehe xd.\n#freetyler1\ncheers","replies":[{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2016-10-19T22:48:58.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if uve been rude in past games, e.g. swearing at all for any reason and u get reported your likely to be punished because the system just looks for swear words and punishes you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-18T10:18:26.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Gehrin, I'm a bit of a lurker on the boards, don't say much unless something sparks me, and this guy did. \n\nI ended up contacting PheroxNZ about this, before you answered, to get more info and he swore he doesn't remember being banned 7 times. He recalls a 24hr ban in Season 1 for Int feeding and has a few Low Prio Queues since after being flagged by Leavebuster, but nothing major like the 7 time bans you are talking about. No Chat Restrictions, no Time Bans ...he doesn't even recall getting warning pop-ups in-client.\n\nCan you shed some light on this for him please?\n\nHe's pretty upset atm like he's just had a Bad Breakup out of the blue and for no reason he can understand and Riot is the Shitty Girlfriend who dumped him and broke his heart lol but I think if he had more of an idea of a timeline over which this incidents happened he might accept his punishment and understand it was deserved which will help with any future levels of toxicity. ATM he's just really angry and upset - Bad Breakup remember </3 - and the only thing he's currently feeling is 'Riot banned me for no reason' because he is confused over these 7 bans so he's not in any position to have a rational conversation.\n\nThank you =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2016-10-18T08:21:24.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This game ment everything to me and I spent so much on it can I pay for it back please like I will admit to being toxic in the past but I actually put in the effort to not be to toxic I will be willing to pay for my account back Iv deleted the chat files out of lol now ","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-10-19T03:04:09.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I spent some time to dig further. It appears that your account has been shared for a long time, with a friend that you've played with regularly who has two banned accounts of their own. This person is responsible for at least a few of your bans and is why your account has used up its **many** chances to reform. The fact that two people have been playing ranked on this account even amounts to boosting. This is the risk you take when you share your account and one of the reasons we **expressly forbid account sharing**.\n\nWe don't require you to pay money to unban your account. We require you to not take the actions that would get it banned in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2016-10-19T05:17:46.524+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"Plus i wasnt banned for boosting i was banned for this chat log","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-19T07:52:09.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PheroxNZ,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=be63rQGe,comment-id=0002000000000002,timestamp=2016-10-19T05:17:46.524+0000)\n>\n> Plus i wasnt banned for boosting i was banned for this chat log\n\nNot the point Gehrin was getting at. The point was that your were sharing your account, which is explicitly against the rules (as stated in the TOU and EULA), and, since it included ranked games, it would fall under the category of \"boosting\" which, again, is explicitly against the rules. That's not even considering that the other person using your account had *multiple* accounts that were perma-banned previously.\n\nPoint being: you're not just in the sh!t for your negative attitude anymore and there's no way you are *ever* going to regain access to that account.","replies":[{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2016-10-19T22:04:41.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, so unban me for being toxic and ban me for boosting then, dont call me \"extremely toxic\" for this bullshit lol.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TSV1 Lucifer","date":"2016-10-19T15:20:24.326+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"This is so wrong.

My chat logs show grieving??? ok?? I targeted a player for saying im playing better than him when I am?? ok?? \nI honestly don't care about this account that much maybe you should just admit your wrong for once and admit your shitty bot that goes through looking for swear words doesn't punish people correctly as it doesn't understand the context of situations so it cant tell if people are being toxic.\nThat is the sole reason i was given for being perma banned.\nLike I said, if you wanna go ahead and ban me for \"boosting\", go ahead, but dont pull this bullshit on me and say im being toxic for no reason. grow some balls and man up to your mistake and admit you were wrong instead of digging for extra information to actually warrant a perma ban.
