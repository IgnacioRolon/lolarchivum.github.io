But the justice system doesn't wait for all murderers in the world to be caught before going after smaller offenders does it?\n\nSometimes murderers never get caught.  No system is perfect.  And unlike the justice systems of the world, league's system doesn't have a multi billion dollar budget and hundreds of thousands of employees devoted 8+ hours a day to catching the bad guys.  So if all the worlds justice systems cant always stop one of the most serious crimes it's possible to commit.  Why would you assume that a 10 year old online game has all the answers?\n\nLeague's system does what it can without compromising the average player _(we all snap sometimes, and I for one don't want to lose my account over a single day's bad mood)_.  People who repeatedly offend, WILL get punished, maybe not in the few seconds after you press the report button, but eventually if they keep offending, they will be slapped with punishment.\n\nThe system isn't perfect, and it never will be.  No one is disputing that.\n\nBut it does what it can, and it's better than no system.
