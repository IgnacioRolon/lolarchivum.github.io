That's the main one.\n\nIf recording in OBS, you can actually separate your microphone from your game sounds and other people talking, so you can change the volume of one independently.\n\nThe use of a clip before the intro is good, but it needs to be a quick clip. The 30 second clip about [REMOVED] is good and all, but there's a fair few seconds of silence in there, where you have nothing. That's no good. You want to try and keep the first clip to below 15 seconds, and you're free to cut a few times in the same one recording to save time and still convey the full story.\n\nYou're playing around and having some fun with some elements of editing which is good and all, over time you will adapt some preferences and end up with some tropes you keep coming back to. This will be your style, and once you discover it, it's important to honor it as best you can, to keep your content consistent with those that are already on board and subscribed.\n\nI've done content creation and advising for years, if you've ever got questions to ask, come and find me :)","replies":[{"poster":"Smurtehmurph","date":"2017-07-11T12:05:22.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can I get your opinion on some of my newer content?

It's not that funny, but the length is good\n- Zooming requires some refinement\n- The players need some sort of branding or identity, We don't know who they are, they're not overly distinct\n\nContact me privately for tips and shit.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-05T07:52:37.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much better then the majority of other videos people post on here, no random over-edits being thrown in my face every 3 seconds just fresh 7 minutes of two lads having some fun in League, what I like to see. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Smurtehmurph","date":"2017-07-06T20:43:08.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been posting a video every day, and the quality is only improving.  if you could sub and maybe share me to some friends, that'd really help me out!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2017-07-11T06:51:42.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oi slap in some music, and I won't bother saying anything else coz Jason's said everything else I would have said. :L","replies":[{"poster":"Smurtehmurph","date":"2017-07-11T12:04:53.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPyaD99qNL8\ntry checking out some of my newer videos and seeing what you think :)","replies":[]}]}]}
