I didn't mind because the finals were great anyways and it was good to watch with other people. Some people could have taken more than one because the bags were already out on the seats. Also there was a price difference for tickets with swag bags and those without so you should check which one you had.","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-07T04:55:15.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah that's maybe why.
