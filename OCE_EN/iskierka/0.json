The weight of their collective gazes unsettled her- it always had, from the very first time she had performed. But it fed her, too&hellip; There was no denying the blossoming sense of pleasure and pride as they rose to their feet, their riotous applause loud enough to shatter worlds. Entertaining _gods_&hellip; it was not a job many immortals might claim.\r\n\r\nBut to do it as well as she? _None_ could claim that. Sona was not known as the Muse for nothing. She did not keep writers up at night through sheer nagging persistence. Her magic was music, her passion lived in melody, in emotion: it stirred the hearts of any who heard her. She didn&rsquo;t need darkness to creep into people&rsquo;s dreams or minds- they called to her, _begged_ for her inspiration, coveted her devotion to their masterpieces...\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as her audience drifted away to their leisure, a familiar stabbing pain shot through her heart. Emptiness. Loneliness. Sona rested slender arms on the beautiful floating instrument before her. _It is always like this, my dear&hellip; they come and they leave, and nothing remains but a faded, worn-out memory&hellip;_ Her own recollections were vivid, of course. The songs lived within her, bursting free when she strummed her etwahl. Everybody else would forget. Everybody else would ask for more. Always wanting and craving. Never satisfied.\r\n\r\nShe shielded her eyes against the beauty of the heavenly realms, the ever-shifting clouds gilded with sunshine and starlight. Day and night both thrived, waging a picturesque and silent war that brought a majesty of colours to the never-ending skies. It was breathtakingly, _painfully_ beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnd lonely. Always so lonely. The problem with expansive celestial realms, Sona thought, was the lack of cosy hearths- as well as the false intimacy gods played into when they decided to manipulate each other&hellip; She smiled to herself, both amused and sickened by the games she had witnessed. Her part to play in them was small, limited by her silence. Voiceless, still, for as long as she could remember. Flawed, some had said, but even they could not fail to recognise her skills.\r\n\r\nHer smile curled into a wrathful smirk, brows puckering with a hint of menace, and her fingers drifted across the strings. The etwahl growled her feelings for her, a discordant, short cacophony that unleashed savage pleasure. Well, perhaps gods were fools, then. Yes, she decided. Blind, ignorant to the truth that surrounded them.\r\n\r\nThey had no power. They had deserted the mortals and their faith to play their own silly games amongst each other. \r\n\r\nYet some Immortals had chosen a life on Runeterra. Sona had admired their resolve for a very long time. Creatures, _Fables_ as the mundane population named them, thrived in the mortal realm&hellip; Gracefully, feet not quite touching the golden sandstone, she turned around and left the amphitheatre, her etwahl moving before her as both protector and friend.\r\n\r\nHer own residence was small. Sona had fashioned it from clouds and sandstone, whilst four marble pillars marked invisible boundaries. Few dared seek her out in her own home- she treasured her privacy more than many other gods. She never invited guests&hellip; perhaps, then, her loneliness was her own doing? A wry smile twitched at her lips, and she pushed the thought away. It didn&rsquo;t matter. Soon she would find a solution to her problem.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of a sandstone platform was a small dais, upon which a short pillar held a large, slightly curved dish. Tiny strands of stars swirled about within its shallow depths, whilst curls of cloud vapor roiled like waves upon the surface. She pressed her hands against the sides of the dish and peered into it, concentrating for a moment. _Show me Runeterra&hellip; Show me the League..._\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, the swirling mists and stars had shifted and coalesced. The imagery had a blue, celestial tinge, but there was no mistaking the scene that played out before her. There was Lee Sin, a favourite champion of hers, making a mad dash towards that terribly arrogant Draven and&hellip; yes&hellip; a swift, merciless kick sent the Noxian executioner reeling into the waiting arms of his enemies. Amumu did not hesitate to wrap unwelcome bandages around the glorified walking mustache, leaking tears before unleashing that terribly haunting scream of despair, effectively paralysing Draven.\r\n\r\nHer heart ached once more, the pain becoming more and more intolerable. Gentle, crystalline blue eyes shone with unshed sorrow, and she found herself dipping a finger into the mesmerising pool before her. As her skin made contact with the heavenly essence, the images of the fight faded.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sona&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe silence was broken. Sona jumped in surprise, wheeling about, her etwahl springing to her defence and hovering before her.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&hellip; I know you prefer not to be disturbed after a performance&hellip;&rdquo; The man-god before her was young, as far as she could tell- born in more recent times. Time was a strange thing in a place that did not measure it by any mortal standard. There was no revolution of the sun, no spinning of the land, no clocks or sundials or watches&hellip; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;For a very long while now&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t been able to stop thinking about you.&rdquo; He paused here, crossing the threshold of her home. She tensed, retreating slightly only to bump against the pillar. The god became aware of her fear and stopped, bowing his head, his eyes fixed on the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I should have spoken to you at the amphitheatre, but I was so afraid&hellip; you know what the others are like&hellip; and it is hard to be accepted here if you do not follow their rules&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHer fear fell away, her expression becoming curious and accepting. She nodded, one hand lifting to rest upon her etwahl. With idle fingers, the etwahl spoke for her: _yes_.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of her music, he lifted his head once more, emboldened by her communication. &ldquo;I have to confess to you. My heart will not let my mind be if I do not. I have been consumed by thoughts of you, by your music, your energy, your passion&hellip; I fear that I have gone far beyond falling in love- you have addled my mind, my whole _being_ so entirely that I struggle to remember what purpose I had before I met you. You are my world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe words froze the blood in her body, yet a gentle pink flush spread across her cheeks. Now it was her turn to look down, comforted by the sight of her ever-present etwahl. She lifted her other hand, her music now more complex as she began to speak. _I did not expect to hear such words&hellip; not that it doesn&rsquo;t please me, but&hellip; I do not know how to answer your feelings. Long have I believed that my sole existence was music and creativity&hellip; But I need to know if I am more than that._\r\n\r\nThe god clutched at his heart, a soft gasp escaping his lips. Despite the distance between them, Sona saw him shake. His fingers flexed around the soft folds of his clothes as though searching for a buoy in a storm, and he sighed before lifting his head. &ldquo;S-sona&hellip; Muse and Inspiration to all&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t realise&hellip; that you were adrift of your purpose&hellip; that your heart was no longer&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA spark of anger lit a fire in the pit of her stomach, and she flicked her fingers across the strings. _Enough. Do not insult me. My music comes from my heart. But my heart needs more than this to fill it. It needs experience. It needs life. There is no life here. There is only the languishing of time and the pettiness of spoiled children._\r\n\r\nHe flinched away at the harshness of the notes. His face had grown paler at her discourse, but she did not regret it. The fire had settled nicely inside of her, heating her blood once more. &ldquo;I am sorry, Lady Muse&hellip; I did not mean to anger you, or displease you in any way.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;If there is anything I can do to help, please&hellip; please ask it of me.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nShe did not answer immediately. Silent moments stretched away like the emblazoned horizon. _Can you help send me to Runeterra? I wish to become mortal._\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, stupefied for a few moments, before letting loose a short laugh. &ldquo;Is- is that what you truly want? Would you give up your immortality to-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n_What is life without pain, without joy? What is a heart without lasting memories and experiences? What will my music become, if I cannot be inspired in this wretched place? Yes, this is my choice. I would walk amongst the mortals and the Fabled, and rediscover myself&hellip; As a champion._","replies":[{"poster":"Faith In Team","date":"2018-09-07T22:42:06.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"amazingkk :) gl for competition","replies":[{"poster":"Iskierka","date":"2018-10-02T04:03:05.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! <3","replies":[]}]}]}
