In the game she is holding a weapon that is shaped like a circle but the skin picture shows her holding a different weapon entirely. I bought the skin because I thought the **weapon was boss**, but when in game it wasn&#039;t the same and I was pretty let down. (http://s3.amazonaws.com/leaguesales/images/imgs/000/000/091/original/warrior-princess-sivir-02.png?1452570157) I&#039;m not sure if you guys are aware of this, but I just thought I would let you know because I&#039;m sure others like me are out there that have done the same thing. I wrote a ticket to you guys yesterday as soon as I discovered this and I was told to come here because they couldn&#039;t act on that type of issue (refund/fix the skin guarantee). I am hoping one of these can occur as technically I didn&#039;t receive what was advertised.\nThanks for the awesome game, Nick  :)  {{champion:15}}","replies":[{"poster":"TitusBlackwell","date":"2016-04-30T05:42:53.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it wouldn't be a warrior princess skin if she didn't have a giant version of Xena's weapon!
