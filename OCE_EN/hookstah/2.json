This debuff may last however long is balanced, and doesnt do anything until activated by her w. More of that later\r\n\r\nHer q is a slow no instead of a stun, the numbers are whatever seems balanced\r\n\r\nJer W is the same, but instead of dealing damage at the end, it applies an aoe slow to those hit, the slow is like 10% or something really small. However, if the w hits an enemy with her passive applied, it will stun them instead. This will allow you to have more counterplay. This brings in allot of counterplay opportunities, but also allot of devastation from leona, because if she applies stacks on multiple people, and gets them both with the W, she will stun more people\r\n\r\nHer E is the exact same, but also apploes her passive \r\n\r\nHer ulti is also the same, but if she hits enemies that are already stunned, the ult stun length will be rediced by half (similar to kennens stun), but the enemy will instead be slowed afterwards for an extra second and/or take extra damage\r\n\r\nThis rework i thought of will allow Leona to be a sloghtly more diverse champion, offering more rewards the better you play her, rather than getting instastunned, followed by another stun and a slow. The basic leona combo would be w, wait until it is about to explode, and then e onto the enemy (from a bush maybe). If done correctly, the e will apply a stack and if timed correctly, the w will then stun them. You could then q them after for a slow. At the same time, if your an enemy, you could back off when she activates w, and if she comes out of nowhere, you cant be instastunned, allowing for a very small opportunity to flash/dash away. Also, taking away jer passive and w damage in tjis rework, and instead replacing them with these playmaking/cc abilities would make her feel like more of a support, and would stop her doing more damage than her ad carry pre lvl 6\r\n\r\nJust an idea, if you like it then upvote so riot can see.

If you play her right, it could be devastating, but also weak as shit. And remember, her w would pnly stun if the enemy had her passive on them. So most of the time, unless your awesome, it would only stun one person. Besides its just an idea, its not like rioters actually get ideas of these forums lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
