Yes i know thats a terrible matchup. but even in bad matchups there should be a chance to come out at least even right?...right? I straight up played better than him. I outfarmed him to bits, with my q and w, always making sure I was out of range for him to jump on me. It stayed like this, me outfarming him for about 8 or so minutes. Then he got bored i guess and E&#039;d over to me to get closer, so i thought &#039;wtf okay i can stun him cause his E is down&#039;. So i did, and i actually managed to kill him with just a dorans ring as a tf (Though his w and ingnite ended up doing about 400 dmg to me and killing me in the end anyway with just a dorans ring aswell, but i wont even get started on that) \r\n\r\nAnd then, well then we hit 6. He had a sheen. Thats all, and I had a Negatron cloak and a Needlessly large rod. Thats how much I outfarmed him. So we played for a bit, and then he shot sharky at me, then E&#039;d onto me. Yes i shouldnt have been that close, but even then i wasnt rerally, it weas a max range shark and i had no boots so i couldnt escape it in time (Flash was stgill down from the previous fight). But again i thought &#039;okay maybe i can live if i stun him&#039;. NOPE! I put on W and it started at the blue card, so it had to rotate through red before it got to gold. But it litterally didnt have time to rotate. I still remember the exact time it took him to kill me with just a sheen, 100 - 0 no previous poke. 1.3 seconds. Yeah. With just a sheen, he killed my in just over a second. And thats basically how the rest of the game went, I was forced to go super MR and health heavy, so i was useless to my team until i scaled up later with AP. But this damn fizz, who failed more flashes than i have fingers, just didnt deserve to win that lane. Im sorry but something needs to be donw about him. He could 100-0 me for about half if not more of the game until i got litterally 150 mr and a fully stacked ROA. But even then, it just took 2 shots instead. We ended up winning anyway cause i was TF and could ult and help other lanes win cause i knew mine was over. but just plz, make fizz less cancerous. Do what you did to mundo or nid. You made their projectiles smaller to sepearate the good players from the bad ones, so the bad ones didnt undeservingly steam roll. This fizz was not a good player, but still won. ITs things like that that annoy me about the game.\r\n\r\nAny opinions? {{champion:105}} \r\n\r\nIf you want me to link the game just ask, i cant be bothered unless someone wants it","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-14T15:17:27.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and then you realise, he is actually so strong at the moment he is getting nerfed, you realise you were laning against one of those ultra rare retards who cant even play fizz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-14T13:03:07.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is op af in capable hands","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-14T12:55:58.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes getting nerfs in 6.12","replies":[]}]}
