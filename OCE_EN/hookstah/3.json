(fk idk he's a boxer alright?)","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruce is a bruiser who likes to get close and personal to do his work. He heavily relies on fighting on his own terms, if he doesnt initiate the fight, he wont have his channeled abilities ready, but when he does initiate the fight, he can lock you dowm with short cc and dmg you with quick, channeled blows\r\n\r\nPassive: Warming up (idk shh) \r\nAfter auto attacking twice, Bruce&#039;s next auto attack will be a ranged charge. For example, if you click on an enemy out of melee range, you will charge forward to them, knocking minions out of the way and stunning them for (.4 .7, 1) seconds (going up with your ultimates level) and applying on hit effects. This passive has an (8, 5, 2) second cd. (going down with your ultimates level)\r\n\r\nQ: 3 Blows (?...)\r\nBruce attacks a target twice with 200% attack speed, and then charges his next attack for (1, .7, .3) seconds (scaling with ulti). After this is done channeling, Bruce&#039;s next attack will deal large dmg, and stun the target for 1 second (at all ranks)\r\n\r\nW: Absorb\r\nAfter channeling for 1 second, Bruce will absorb the next projectile. For 3 seconds, Bruce will be able to shoot that projectile back out as an allied ability, in whatever direction he chooses. This projectile will maintain the dmg it had from its origional shooter, and will also maintain any cc it had built in. (I know this is a really powerful ability, but it will have a long cd of like 30 seconds. So use it wisely\r\n\r\nE: Boxers Strength (I know ya&#039;ll judgin me now)\r\nBruce will attack his target twice with 50% attack speed (half his normal attack speed) The first hit is normal, but the second hit will know his target back a short distance\r\n\r\nR:??\r\nI havnt thought of an ulti that bruce could have yet, maybe you could think of one?\r\n\r\nBruce&#039;s laning phase will rely entirely on you engaging your fights. When your passive is off cd, you could use your Q on minions, and wait for your third attack to be channeled. This third attack if done correctly will also apply Bruce&#039;s passive. You could then charge in with your charge, and your Q&#039;s stun and bonus will be applied to your target instantly (as your passive applies on hit effects). During the stun, you could then use your E to hit them and knock them away, allowing no time for them to trade back","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-28T01:24:50.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So lee sin but with fists.","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-28T01:25:41.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Xv2eQpqm,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-28T01:24:50.682+0000)\n>\n> So lee sin but with fists.\n\ntheres a skin for that :3","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-30T01:10:02.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A damn good skin at that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-10-27T22:24:47.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dno man league always puts a spin on things not just have generic titled character, for example martial artist is lee sin but hes also blind and can do this cool sonic stuff. and imo there already is a boxer with a spin on it which is vi. the kit seemed to stick together ok until absorb just came from nowhere like what? thematically very strange to throw in imo =)","replies":[{"poster":"Hookstah","date":"2016-10-28T04:34:03.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, i was trying to give him a unique defence ability thats not just a shield, kinda like yasuo's windall.
