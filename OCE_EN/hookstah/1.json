Cause i constantly find myself expecting an S and then getting an A or lower. In My last game, i went 8/0/2 as twitch in a 22 kill game. I thought &#039; i definatly have to get an S here&#039; but no, i got an A. And then i thought &#039;maybe its because i didnt have over half of the team kills&#039; but then i saw a jayce on my team who was 7/2/2, and he got an S. How does that work? How does someone with less kills and 2 more deaths get a better grade? I had 0 deaths! You cant really do better, so somebody please explain to me how this damned system works\r\n\r\nMuch love {{champion:44}}","replies":[]}
