I understand that I am only in bronze (oh no) but I am a support main (which is seemingly quite rare). I am a very team orientated player. I can play just about all supports to an extent, but I will put in **A LOT** of effort to learn the supports you guys want that fit the team and i will be very dedicated. Just give me a chance ^_^ thanks for your time.","replies":[]}]}
