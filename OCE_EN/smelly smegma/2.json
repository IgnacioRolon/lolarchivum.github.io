It starts glowing showing that its done. But when i click on it, It doesnt do anything at all. So when im doing teamfights, sometimes i might dive in thinking that my flash is up. But instead i just dont do anything and get caught.\nThis happens all the time","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T10:03:03.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I see. It's making you think that you have lower cool-downs when you don't. Do you have anything like Lolreplay or something installed? They can occasionally cause issues like this.\n\nAnyway, this is a bug and thus should be posted in [the right board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
