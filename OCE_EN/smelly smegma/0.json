First 2 games was a mix of high silvers and high bronzes, then the last game I played, i had 2 golds, a silver and a bronze on my team, and something like 4 golds and 1 silver on the opposing team! This was ranked, i was the ONLY unranked player there. I got absolutely stomped despite the great lane help i received. I have the screen shot of the players/ranks on my gaming rig to show this... But I can't even get into bronze because im getting stomped by Gold players. Kinda makes you feel like an even worse player than you were lol","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-05T12:42:03.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand, when your unranked and play rank, your MMR is set  at somewhat between average and high so thats probably why you end up playing with golds and when you play your placement games those games will determinee your MMR by decreasing it with each lost or increasing with each win and when you end up finishing your last game all the games you've played that will determine your MMR resulting your rank. But thats how I think it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-06T06:08:13.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't feel that's entirely accurate since I generally don't get paired up with golds in normals since I assume my estimated mmr is too low but when I play and win a few normals games with my friends from platinum (they carry my feeding ass but I won't ask them to boost me because I feel it's wrong) we get paired up with gold-platinum-diamond (it's like an entirely different game to what i play and I have no clue what is happening).\nThe point though is afterwards I get paired up with golds until I lose like 15 games in a row and then we're back to silvers and bronze. I think the placements reset your mrr but the game does estimate your position even if you are unranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-12T09:36:41.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mhmm.

I assume because you can get a mix of high and low elo players.\nBronze may be difficult to get out of because you may have to learn how to carry a game.  you can't rely on the others to be any good.\nI","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-05T01:48:41.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They'll shove the words 'but it is a team game' down  your throat but expect you to be able to carry by yourself.

Bronze games are impacted heavily by a [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) that is hard to break through.\n\nI could say that plat and diamond are easier than bronze, because in some ways they are. Your team has game knowledge that is lacking in bronze and the players are generally self-aware and sufficient.\n\n I still find bronze easy though, as I don't go in to a bronze game expecting players to be like in my normal ranked games. I know they are going to be tilted, and I know how to deal with this so that we can come out on top. I don't have to carry, I just have to be an encouraging force on the team. \n\nBoosters have always existed, so they can't be as big of a problem that everyone thinks. \nDynamic q isn't going to make a division so much harder, especially when you have tools available to fight it. \n\nTL;DR change your mindset and you'll find bronze easy.","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-08-05T01:45:49.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if it is known that bronze is hard to break out of and is impacting the community so harshly with their negative bias then Riot should work towards finding a solution. I think it's a slap in the face just to tell people to change their mindset since I know plenty of positive people in bronze who are let down by their team. This new update they are doing for the client in great and all but most people will vote for better game play then better graphics. So they should fix the game play and matchmaking issues first. But alas prettier game = more money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-04T15:40:50.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dynamic q and boosters","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-05T00:46:41.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye I was playing with a 2 friends a few days ago but no voicechat; one is mid silver ({{champion:7}} Mid bought it the day before) , the other is low platinum ( {{champion:420}} top doesn't play her much), I am bronze 5 ({{champion:35}}  Jg my assassin jungler of choice). We teamed up with 2 golds in their own premade bot janna + Miss Fortune but lvl4. When we played I decided that since our top lane was platinum against silver it was fine to just countergank their khazix and so I camped mid lvl5 gold victor and the enemy silver bot as well as counterjungling and hunting the enemy khazix. Anyways long story short the botlane was horrible, I managed to get the leblanc ahead of victor but eventually he outscaled her. Top lane didn't need much help and he started snowballing down his lane so hard. I got pretty ahead from consistent ganks and abusing shaco's early game power. I had to come in and save the botlane alot, the miss fortune kept getting caught out of position and they kept picking bad engages in bot lane and I had to keep the enemy botlane from getting out of hand. The janna fed and lategame the missfortune was busy catching up in farm.\nI managed to get a dbl kill on the kha and sona when I counterganked him and gave the kill to the mf and leblanc killed the victor so I tried to take fire drake and we started doing drag at lvl5 with lb, janna, mf and me and after I started hitting the dragon (which we could easily take despite my being oom since I had smite and visionward) and they started backing and we couldn't take the drake till later.\nI swear either they had the worst games of their lives or they were boosted because they were so bad I hope I never play with them in ranked.\n\nOh and they took my first jungle camp by accident even though I didn't ask for a leash since I was shaco.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-05T01:06:14.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have disillusions; I know I'm bronze 5 but my god these guys were definitely bronze.
