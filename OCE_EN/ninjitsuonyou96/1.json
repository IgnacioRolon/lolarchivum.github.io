A skill shot rocket punch, stops as it hits a champion, can be intercepted.\nDeals damage based on percentage of his own health and applies a slow. Holds 2 charges, so whilst Bob has two fists he can fire both but only fire the second after a short delay from the first.\nAfter casting, his fist/s will eventually return to him and return the same percentage of health that he used when he cast his Q.\nIf Bob goes to the location of a grounded fist, it will return and the cool-down is decreased.\n\n\nW. A buffing effect for a short duration, increasing resistances whilst in heavy-form and increasing movement and attack speed whilst in mini-form\nCould even include or just be a passive for each form.\nPossible passives being a minor increase to damage based on health or resistances.\n\n\nE. A ground stomp or slam of sorts, dealing damage around Bob and applying a minor stun to any enemies in the immediate vicinity, Will instead slow champions that were not directly in front of/or around Bob\nWhile in mini-form Bob flings himself to target destination and deals damage to enemies upon landing.\n\n\nR. Launches his gigantic belly to target location, dealing considerable damage, applying a stun to those directly hit by the boulder and slows those who were within range.\nActs as a wall, while still being a part of Bob, it can be attacked and dispatched.\nAt the end of the Rs use, if bob is a certain distance nearby his belly will be launched back to him, if otherwise Bob is at a greater distance he will be flung back to his belly instead. \nWhile missing his belly, Bob enters his mini-form where he is just his remaining body parts (head, arms, legs)\nBobs health is not missing whilst his belly is in use he just has less health than when it's not, so upon use of R he still technically has full health, but loses about 30-40% to his resistances.\nWhile mini he has a bonus 30-40% to movement speed and attack speed, along with lower cool-downs and can still use his abilities as he would before, though the effects would just be less impressive.\n\n\nSummoner - Natan96 (OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmic Wasteland","date":"2015-11-18T08:16:54.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"weird skills and stuff needs more work into the champ and skills","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninjitsuonyou96","date":"2015-09-19T01:22:57.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well any criticism is good criticism, guys there's been a 100+ views and barely any feedback, if you could just tell me your thoughts, problems, issues or ideas about the concept. please and thank you.","replies":[]}]}
