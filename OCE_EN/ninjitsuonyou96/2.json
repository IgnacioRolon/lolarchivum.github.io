(Interchangeable two handed + dual wielding weapons)\n\nMelee Fighter - Attack Damage/Armor Scaling\n\n\n\nP = Primary\nS = Secondary\n\n\n\nPassive - After 5-7(?) seconds Out of Combat, Ryker will steel his will, readying to engage his enemy, gaining a bonus to his Armor and Movement Speed until re-entering Combat, his Next Basic Attack will deal Bonus Damage based on Ryker's Armor.\n\n\nQ - Divide 9, Dynamic Style - \n(Nodachi)\n\n- Ryker can cast \"Divide 9, Dynamic Style\" to empower his Third Basic Attack against an enemy champion to strike out towards that target champion while within the Nodachi Attack Range, dealing bonus Physical Damage, as well as dealing 3% of the champions health as true damage and then slashing his Nodachi out to the side in an arc extending to the full Attack Range of his Nodachi and then back towards his inner left or right side (depending on target cast location), enemies caught in the arc are also dealt damage (based on AD, AP and Armor) and slowed by 30% for 3(?) seconds.\n(Attack animation while empowered will begin as a Basic Attack and then result in an Ability cast)\n\n\n- Ryker can cast \"Divide 9, Dynamic Style\" to empower his Sixth Basic Attack against an enemy champion to strike out in a cone towards that target champion while within the Nodachi Attack Range, dealing bonus Physical Damage, as well as dealing 6% of the champions health as true damage and damaging all enemies within the Nodachi Attack Range Cone.\n(Attack animation while empowered will result in an Ability cast)\n\n\n- Ryker can cast \"Divide 9, Dynamic Style\" to empower his Ninth Basic Attack against an enemy champion to   \n\n\n\n\nS - Sunder 64, Onslaught Style -\n(Katana and Wakizashi (or Tanto)) \n\n- Each time you've Attacked an enemy on your 2nd/4th/8th/16th/32nd Attacks you may cast \"Sunder 64, Onslaught Style\" on an enemy within range to exceed the Attack speed limit, Attacking a targeted enemy and dealing damage equal to 50%/40%/35%/30%/20% of your last 2/4/8/16/32 Attacks. \n\n- If you've attacked twice (4/8/16/32 times respectively) and only twice (4/8/16/32 times) while in combat within the last 5-7 seconds and while within range, you may cast \"Sunder 64, Onslaught Style\" to actively Attack your enemy twice (4/8/16/32 times) again over the next 1-5 seconds\n\n- (If you miscount, there will be an indicator for your Q on the HUD to notify you of which number Attack you are up to and which setting you can cast with the \"Sunder 64, Onslaught Style\" active, for example, if you Attack past the second Attack and miss the opportunity to cast \"Sunder 64, Onslaught Style\" for the first time at 2 Attacks, you may wait until you've Attacked up to the next counter (4/8/16/32 Attacks) and cast the next setting for \"Sunder 64, Onslaught Style\" being any number of Attacks from 4-8-16-32.\n\n- 2/4/6/8/10 second cooldown for recast, 16 seconds cooldown if cast at \"32\".\n\n\n\n\nW - Switches Between Weapon Set.
