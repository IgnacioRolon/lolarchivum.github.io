(Based loosely off of Syndras, Viktors and Vel'Kozs' base stats (2017). \n\nHP - 500-550\nMana - 300-400\nAD - 50-65\nAP - 0\nArmor - 25-30\nMR - 25-35\nAttack Speed - O.620-0.650\nMovement Speed - 320-340\nHP Regen - 6-8\nMana Regen 6-8\nAttack Range - 530-560 units\n\n\nPassive - EXPOSURE: When Jerrit opens a rift portal he becomes exposed to the magic of the void and for a short duration he gains a bonus to his Ability Power and Attack Damage, also a small increase to his mana regeneration, while also losing a small percentage of his HP during the duration.\n(Scaling every 3 levels)\nExposure has a cooldown after each occurrence.\nWhen below 20% HP will revert to lowest level changes.\nDuration: 3/3/4/4/5/5 seconds\nBonus AP: 3.5%/4%/4.5%/5%/5.5%/6%\nBonus AD: 3.5%/4%/4.5%/5%/5.5%/6%\nMana Regeneration per second: 1.5%/2%/2.5%/3%/3.5%/4%\nLoss of HP per second: 0.25%/0.5%/0.75%/1%/1.25%/1.5%\nCooldown: 10/12/14/16/18/20 seconds\nFunctionality - Buff, \n\n\nQ: Opens a small rift portal to the void beside him and another at target location, Jerrit then flicks a small magical orb through the portal opening besides him which then travels through the void, gaining size, velocity and magical power, and is then released from the rift portal at target location, firing the orb in a line, damaging and slowing all enemies in casting range.\nDelayed cast of 0.25 seconds upon selecting the second target location, standing in place during cast.\nSet Damage: 60/100/140/180/220\nAP Scaling: 70%\nSlow: 30%/35%/40%/45%/50%\nCooldown: 9/8/7/6/5 Seconds\nMana Cost: 50/55/60/65/70\nFunctionality - Primary Poke, Slow, Zone Control,\n\n\nW: Jerrit manipulates an area of space at target location and transforms it into void terrain for a short duration, causing all enemies that cross though it to be slowed and have their armor and magic resistance reduced, while increasing movement speed to those affected by Exposure.\nDuration: 6/7/8/9/10\nSlow: 35% all levels\nMovement Speed: 15/20/25/30/35\nArmor/Magic Resistance Reduction: -10/-20/-30/-40/-50\nCooldown: 21/18/15/12/9 Seconds\nMana Cost: 60 all levels\nFunctionality - Slow,Buff, Debuff, Zone Control,\n\n\nE: Jerrit throws a handful of dust into a portal to the void that appears within 300 units around him, the dust will reappear from the casting loaction after 5 seconds within the void, or you may recast the ability sooner after the 1st second, if left for the full duration in the void, the dust will reappear from the portal, scattered out back towards Jerrit the dust is sped up and bursts out damaging all enemies within range in a wide arc, if recast before the full duration the dust fires as a short cone from casting location instead and deals less damage, whenever E kills an enemy it heals Jerrit for a small portion of his HP (healing stacks for multiple enemies killed at one time by E up to 10%)\n\nDelayed Cast of 1-5 second upon ability use, no movement restriction.\nSet Damage: 90/120/170/230/300\nRecast Damage: 70/100/140/190/250\nAP Scaling: 90%\nHeals: 2.5% all levels\nCooldown: 19/17/14/11/9 Seconds\nMana Cost: 90/85/80/75/70\nHP Cost: 20/35/55/75/100\nFunctionality - Poke, Heal,\n\n\nR: Jerrit channels for a few seconds before opening a rift portal at target location big enough for one champion, Jerrit or an ally can pass through it and enter the void disappearing for a short duration and becoming untargetable, before reemerging at another target location after a short delay, upon leaving the void an ally will receive the Exposure effect for a short amount of time, but without Exposure's cost, if Jerrit himself enters the rift portal he will automatically receive the Exposure effect at the end of R's use, however it will remain in effect either until Jerrit dies, reaches 20% of his HP or he toggles it off.\nChannel Time: 2 seconds all levels\nDuration in void: 0.5/1/1.5/2/2.5 Seconds\nDuration of 'Exposure on Ally: 6/7/8/9/10 Seconds\nCooldown: 90 Seconds all levels\nMana Cost: 100 all levels\nFunctionality - Transportation, Buff\n\n\n\n\n\nSummoner - Natan96 (OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-10-29T05:28:54.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Current kit seems really boring. There's nothing outstanding that makes it fun. Maybe think of more interesting adverse affects. Ziggs bombs bounce which is what makes them interesting, Orianna's ball is the source of the rest of her abilities, Syndra can interact with her spheres. Right he kinda just throws them at you for damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjitsuonyou96","date":"2016-10-29T12:26:28.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i think of it kind of like a Vel'Koz Q that's coming from a location of your choosing because it's not directly from him, but instead of splitting at the end of the cast range it phases through the enemy and slows them, before the orb travels back through the void and returns to Jerrit.\n\nSo it's more about control in area, like lock-down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bloodstorm21","date":"2016-10-23T05:36:02.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in all honesty jarrit seems like he is overly complicated and hard to use, it also seems like he would be riddled with bugs he seems like a weaker mix of azir and malzahar with less presence as it he dosent seem to have too much sieging power.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninjitsuonyou96","date":"2016-10-23T07:36:49.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for your input, aha i can see why you might think that, though i imagine his Q to be more like a combination of Syndra, Azir and Viktor moves except the orb would appear at the location specified and then move in a line, from there to the end of it's cast range, so his Q would be meant as his primary poke tool to damage and slow enemies in the line, before using his E for his secondary poke as they are slowed, also his E would be cast a short distance from in front of him (if that makes sense) so basically if any enemies get too close it becomes useless, i said it takes 0.5 seconds to cast because dust isn't powered until that long after being thrown out, i imagine it to be like Yas' windwall in that regard, like it isn't cast from his immediate location but from just in front of him and then out in a wide arc.\nI'm really just trying to help you see it in your mind like i do :)","replies":[]}]}]}
