English is not my mother tongue but German. I put the link to my original that I am trying to translate in here so take a look if you can understand it ^^\n\n> So now what shall you know about Nihil before we start?\nNihil is a melee toplane fighter without mana or energy costs, but his skills need fighting spirit spheres, that he obtains if he kills creeps or hits Champions.\n\n\n2.Lore\n\n> He was the greatest gladiator of all Runeterra at the time the League was founded, the heir of a long line of ancestors, all being famous Gladiators, he was meant to be the Number 1 Champion in the League of Legends, that is what he thought at least....\nBut only a few Days after his entry he got basted by a chubby man with a lamppost!!\nHe could not stand this humiliation vanished and was nevermore seen....\n\n> In Front of the door to the Institution of War appeared a wandering monk and asked for admittance. He said that he is ready to face his destiny, now that he found enlightenment. He is clothed in a rattled frock, but stands tall, not proud but confident. But is answer is repelling: \"Not every wannabe can just come here and become a Champion of the League. Who are you that you seek admittance?\" \"I am nobody... and I ask you to open or i will open them myself!\" was the tied answer of the monk.\nHe waited for two days with no result, the doors remained shut so he smashed them with one hit and said: \"I am nobody and no wannabe and I demand admittance to the League.\"\nSince he never said his real name they called him \"Nihil\", nothing, and gave him his rightful place in the tiers of the Champions of the League.\n\n\n3.Base Stats\n\n> Since I don&#039;t know that much about base stats I orientated myself at those of Garen, Jax and Lee\n\n> Health: 607 (+85 per level)\nHealth Regen: 7.8 (+0.6 per level)\nAttack Damage: 57 (+3.4 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.642 (+3% per level)\nArmor: 27 (+3 per level)\nMagic Resist: 32.1 (+1.25 per level)\nMovement Speed: 350\n\n\n4.Abilities\n\n> Passive: Fighting Spirit Heist\nIf Nihil kills a creep or hits an enemy Champion he robs their Fighting Spirit, that flouts over him as a Sphere. Nihil can have a maximum of 5 Spheres and each one increases his attack damage by 1/3/5.\nAs long as he does not have full spheres and auto attacks an enemy champion he gets a sphere and applies a debuff to them that is slowing an enemy by 3% for 3 secs, this debuff is five times stack-able and the fifth stack stuns the enemy for 1 sec. A Champion can only be stunned every 10 secs.\n\n\n>  Q: Spherethrust\nCost: 1 Sphere\nRange: 900\nEffect: Deals 10/30/60/100/150 (+ 80% Attack Damage) magical damage to the first Champion and Minion it hits it deals 15% less damage to every following Minion, down to a minimum of 40%. Every following Sphere deals 10% less damage to the hit Champion than the one before.\nCooldown: 15 secs on all ranks (starts with the first Sphere)\n\n> Nihil stands still and fires a Sphere in a straight line, if is hits an enemy Champion he gets the Fighting Spirit Heist Debuff and is marked for 3 secs. If Nihil has not moved he can reactivate the skill again in the following 1.5 secs to fire another Sphere in the same direction but this Sphere is homing to the marked Champion. The homing Spheres may be blocked by another Champion that gets marked instead. Nihil can use this Skill as long as he has enough Spheres.\n\n\n> W: Steeldbody\nCost: All Spheres (Usable with zero Spheres)\nRange: Self\nEffect: Passive: Nihil gets 5% (+1/1.5/2/2.5/3% per Shpere) additional armor and magic resist from items (the passive bonus is disabled if the skill is on cooldown)\nActive: 3/4/5/6/7 secs 15% (+1/1.5/2/2.5/3% per used Sphere) damage reduction from all sources (except true damage), Nihil heals himself for 40/70/100/130/160 + 10% (+1/1.5/2./2.5/3% per used Sphere) missing health and reduces the own damage and attack speed by 15%\nCooldown: 27/24/21/18/15 secs\n\n> Nihil focuses  only on defense to make is body as hard as steel and absorbs all his Fighting Spirits to increase his resistances even further but loses focus of his offensive capabilities.\n\n\n> E: Sphereriding\nCost: 1-3 Spheres\nRange: 650\nEffect: Nihil leaps to a unit. Is this unit an enemy Champion he hits him three times with 5/15/25/35/45 (+ 110% Attack damage) normal damage per hit (these hits activate on hit effects) and suppresses  himself and his target for 0.5 secs. If the unit is and enemy minion he will only hit once with 10/30/50/70/90 (+200% Attack damage). If the unit is an allied Champion both will get a 15% movement speed buff for 3 secs\nCooldown: 15 secs on all ranks\n\n> Nihil leaps to the target, is the target the marked Champion this skill will cost one Sphere , if the target is an enemy minim or an unmarked Champion it will cost two Spheres and if the target is an allied unit it will cost 3 Spheres.\n\n\n> R: Fist of the Nameless\nCost: All Spheres\nRange: 470\nEffect: Nihil leaps unstoppable  to the target location and smashes in there with a radius of 300 dealing 175/350/525 + 1 damage per 5/4/3 of Nihil&#039;s actual health + 10/20/30 true damage per used Sphere. This skill leaves an handprint on the ground that slows enemy Champions by 5/10/15% and increases  allied Champions movementspeed by the same amount. Nihil is exhausted after this skill and unable to use heist Fighting Spirits for the next  15 secs.\nCooldown: 120/100/80\n\n> Nihil channels every bit of force in his body to deal an extreme heavy blow that can even change  the consistency of the earth to his favor.\n\n\n\n5.What shall he look like?\n\n> Well I am no pro of copyright questions, so I will not search the net for a pic and copy it here but my idea of a champ is based on the monk of games like RO or RO2 or even simply shaolin monks, so I imagine him to look a bit like that ^^\n\n\n\n6.Now it&#039;s your turn ;)\n\n> Ok now it&#039;s time for constructive criticism =) and u may help me with the verbalization ... maybe some of the words do not fit in the situations I used them? help me to refine this idea and make it an success =)","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-08-11T10:45:50.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is Lee-Sin.","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-08-11T10:47:09.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also why is the link in German?","replies":[{"poster":"QuetzaIcoatI","date":"2015-08-11T11:26:02.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cause im german and thats the original that i tried to translate ^^\n\nAlso why do u think that he is lee? ^^","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-08-24T01:02:11.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He throws orbs, fights with no weapons, wears monks robes, need I go on?","replies":[{"poster":"QuetzaIcoatI","date":"2015-11-05T15:00:59.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what lee is wearing is sth like martial arts clothes not the habit of an european monk and there are quite some champs that fight bare handed/clawed and his orbs are more like syndras than lees soundwave","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-11T10:54:40.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"those stats 2 high","replies":[{"poster":"QuetzaIcoatI","date":"2015-08-11T11:27:15.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"help me to lower them ;) which stats are too high in ur opinion?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-19T07:52:40.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"587 (+81)\n3.9 (+0.3)\n56 (+2.9)\n0.66 (+ 0.04)\n26 (+3.1)\n30 (+ 1.12)\n340\n\nQ: 20/50/70/100/130 (+60%) (magic damage ability)\nw: Cost 1 sphere Passive: 5% (+ 1% per sphere) (+ 1% for every 20 bonus armor (does not stack with self) Active: 20% reduction (+1% for every 50 bonus armor and magic resist) and healing for 20% (+ 30/60/90/120/150) (+1 for every bonus magic resist and armor)\ne: 15/30/45/60/75 (+ 45% bonus ad (max 135% bonus ad)) to champs. 30/60/90/120/150 (+ 170% bonus ad) to minions.
