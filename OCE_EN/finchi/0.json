I know what your going to think when I say I&#039;m just in bronze, &quot;Ohh, its just another shit %%%% bronze player shit posting on the forums&quot;, but honestly I can&#039;t understand how I keep losing in ranked. I try my hardest to give constructive feedback and ideas on how to play and win, but no one listens and heads off to do their own thing in a different lane, then the enemy team picks that up and wins a fight. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s just too hard to communicate with other player with no voice chat, some people may thinks its a bad idea because of all the people that will just flame over the microphone, but that is what the mute button is for. Its just way too hard to communicate with other players because typing just takes too long and pinging has numerous meanings. People can&#039;t read minds, they just don&#039;t know what your thinking or yelling the the monitor.\r\n\r\nThe way people play in bronze league is just terrible, I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m a god at this game, but people do mindless thinks, like just going a little more CS and getting caught out. This is where voice chat would be nice, people just don&#039;t listen to pings, it just another noise to them. \r\n\r\nAlso any ranked advise to play with random players would be nice, as I said I&#039;m only in bronze and I&#039;m open to any advise, and just as a point playing 5 man is not always a choice.\r\n\r\nSo to summarize, I think that voice chat would be a valuable asset to the game, it would make playing so much easier to make good plays with your team and to give feedback, their are actually people out there that are willing to give constructive advise and people will to receive it, and if people start flaming over the mic, just fucking mute them. \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nFuck","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-01T05:54:03.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find a premade 5man for ranked, become super close friends and climb together (this is what riot has been aiming for, to reduce toxicity through premade incentives). You can even use comms like Skype, Curse voice and Teamspeak so that you can \"give constructive criticism\" and \"rally your team on objectives\".\n\nThe voice chat thing would be so difficult to implement at this stage of the game's development. People in the league community are on the whole, incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toxic. \nHere are some immediate issues I see with your idea:\n\n* People are toxic and will flame, flame, flame (you're gonna end up muting 90% of players)\n\n* It is unbelievably skewed towards the assumption that everyone is gonna speak english. On most servers (OCE included), players come from a wide range of backgrounds and quite a few don't want to, or can't speak english. This could result in more flaming from teammates (e.g when I accidentally type in french in chat, people get really uppity and start saying they'll report me. Voice chat would make thins like this so much worse). \n\n* You keep going on about people that will take constructive criticism, but this is only a very small part of the population. Majority of people will get defensive and start tilting.\n\n* Despite Riot making big steps towards making the league community less homophobic, racist and sexist, these are still pretty big themes when it comes to harassment. Even having a feminine summoner name, it opens me up to so much trash talk and creepers. Imagine this, but with voice chat when someone decides you sound like you fit the stereotype. \n\n[This ](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/130833690818)is what Lyte said a while back on the whole idea\n\nTL;DR Play with 5 friends and use one of the comms out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Staldy","date":"2016-01-30T22:20:46.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i'm silver, but the thing that has helped me improve heaps, is watching replays of my deaths and see where I can do better. \nI downloaded this, http://store.overwolf.com/app/Overwolf-Replay_HUD and am climbing on to gold. That will help deal with your play, because anyone here would agree, you'll be making mistakes in some way.\n\nOn the team thing, yes bronze is annoying and don't communicate. What I've found the best way to deal with it, is to ping and communicate in chat. Also, buy wards! It's amazing how much vision a ward can grant and keep you alive. Without knowing which role you play, can't really give lane specifics, but try to keep your cool in game. Getting angry at people will only take away from your play making ability.\n\nVoice chat built in? Nah, same problems as chatting in game. Try to find a duo partner and use voice with them. Best way is for a bot duo or Jungle and top/mid :)\n\nMost important of all, remember that every game is winnable. At Bronze level, throws happen much more regularly, so just hang in there, farm up a bit more and believe!\n\nStaldy","replies":[]}]}
