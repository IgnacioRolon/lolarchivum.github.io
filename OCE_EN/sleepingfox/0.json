If any Rioter does read all of this please take any solutions if anything take all of them and bring this up to other Rioters.\n\n**BIGGEST PROBLEM ALL PLAYERS FACE\nClient lagging from just navigating it....**\nJust clicking the play button can take a few seconds for some players joinging friends and leaving parties can take some time.\nClicking Home, Profile and Collection and any of its submenu tabs can take a few moments.\nClicking on Loot takes longer...\nClicking on Store takes forvever and sometimes it doesn&#039;t even open... takes too long to open out of everything above it.\nJust logging into the client then clicking on anything takes forever to load for some reason...\n_**What slows down players from moving one game to the next**_\nThe time it takes for the client to update that the game has finished takes waaayyyyyy too long\nClicking on play again or next after finishing a game takes alot of time.\nClicking Confirm after picking the game mode takes a sec.\nClicking find a match also takes a sec.\n_If Riot can fix this slow process of the client this can immensely improve players just navigating the client and having fun whilst not slowing down the fun which players are having and increasing player base happiness. This may be a very very hard task for riot as the client is not usually the main focus of Riot but I believe in them.\n_\n\n**EXP BAR BEING TO SMALL_ or hard to find_**\nThe problem with this system is that the lol client doesn&#039;t give you an big enough indicator for how much EXP you need to get to the next level. The indicator is the very thin line around your player icon. Not only that hovering over it doesn&#039;t even display how much EXP you need for the next level.  You only get to see how much EXP you&#039;ve have in detail in overview under profile and only after playing a game on the result screen.\n&gt; _Fix for this_\nHaving the EXP bar from the overview profile with the number of EXP moved above to the left of the loot icon. This allows for players at the very least notice the bar itself and allows for players to feel they&#039;ve made progress through better visual indication.\nLeaving the EXP bar small makes it harder to find and easier to ignore. Also creates uncertainty of whether or not the player made progress as the EXP bar on the icon is really easy to miss.\n\n\n\n\n\n_The point of the new system was to originally make farming for blue essence harder for people who create bot farms and add change to the original IP system to make it more interesting._\n\n\n\n**Rewards for leveling up being to shallow/small or just bad in general**\nThe players and professionals do understand what riot is trying to do with the blue essence system, but much rather prefer the IP system due to its simplicity and just having a number going up after every game feels good.\nThe EXP system that is currently built doesn&#039;t allow for players to gain anything other than EXP after playing ranked, normals or even other game modes. The new rewards for leveling up are usually champion shards leaving the disenchant value being very small and slows players down in getting either a specific champion they want to buy or upgrading the champion to permanent. \nHaving the disenchant value being very low incentivises players to horde the shards and leads to them feel bad to disenchant them as better or more unwanted shards may or could have been disenchanted in order to buy a specific new champion in the store rather than waiting for its shard to drop.\nThis leaves new players to feel as if the rewards mean little to nothing or very hard to get decent rewards and make old players who use to play on the IP system feel as if being cheated of an actual reward.\n\n&gt; Possible fixes for this\n&gt; Increasing the amount of blue essence you can gain from shards to %50 of the value of the price to upgrade the shard.\n&gt; \n&gt; Increasing the amount of champion shards you get to always make an total disenchant value of 810 &gt; 2200 or equal to the amount of exp you need to level up. \n&gt;\n&gt;Add 100x ~ 2200 blue essence from lvl 1 ~ lvl 30  when you level up as a reward not as a reward in the capsule and leave the capsule with its total disenchant value alone in order for players too feel like they&#039;re getting extra and have the ability to enchant the shards they receive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Create an Half way/Quarterly mark for rewards for mini rewards keeping players engaged and play for more. (eg 200BE for Quarterly and 400BE for halfway making total Blue essence gained 800BE) Thus giving players the players BE to upgrade the shards they get from the capsule. (using lvl 25 as base EXP needed to get to lvl 26)\n&gt;\n&gt; Decreasing the amount of EXP you need to level up by %50 or by %30 at the very least and move the level you need to play;\n&gt; Normal 5v5 Blind from lvl 3 &gt; lvl 6, \n&gt; ARAM 5v5 Howling Abyss will open up at lvl 6 &gt; lvl 12.\n&gt; Co-op vs. AI 3v3 Twisted Treeline will open up at lvl 5 &gt; lvl 10.\n&gt; Normal 3v3 Twisted Treeline will open up at lvl 7 &gt; 14.\n&gt; Normal 5v5 Draft lvl 10 &gt; lvl 20\n&gt; Ranked 5v5 lvl 30 &gt; lvl 45?\n&gt; \n&gt; Giving ranked and normal OR special gamemodes more EXP (eg %150~%200 exp) for wining, thus incentivizing players to play the gamemode and win games and not lose games on purpose thus going against bot farms and also allows for easier gains in EXP.\n&gt; \n&gt; _PS. pls rito use at the very least the first fix, if possible multiple or some of these which are scaled down..._\n\n\n**We want double EXP weekend mode back**\nThis use to be the double IP weekend mode as players were able to get more IP to gain new champions faster and test out those new champions faster than they normally would get due to the double EXP. Sadly this comes at an cost as players may abuse this an put more bots into the game increasing the bot problems in China. However, having Double EXP Weekend to incentivises people to play on the weekend with friends. (like how the ip system use to have, loved playing with friends during it)\n \n&gt;Possible solution\n&gt;Making thing such as having an break period such as first 10 games you get double EXP and resetting after 6hrs or more.\n&gt;Making first 2~4hrs after playing a game have double EXP and resets after 4~6hrs or more.\n\n**After wining a game it doesn&#039;t feel that great like the old IP system**\nThis is due to many factors which players can face for example;\nWith the EXP system capsule rewards not being that great players don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re gaining anything after every game due to the drought of rewards in between levels. \nHaving the disenchant total being very low 810x blue essence doesn&#039;t equal out or overcome the bad feeling of getting nothing between every level up.\n\n&gt;Possible solution\n&gt;Gain 50x blue essence for losing and 150x blue essence to incentivise wining in order to go against bot farming.\n&gt;\n&gt;Getting S+ gives you 200x BE and goes down by rank of performance. (eg. A+- gets 150x BE, B+- gets 120xBE, C gets 100xBE ect)\n\n\n**There are too many champions in League and it feels like it will take forever to get them all. ** _(New player and casual player problem)_\nOver the years there have been a major problem in new players and casual players getting turned off in getting new or just any champions at all due many factors some of them being;\n-After a certain extent it becomes very hard to level up (lvl 1 needs 144EXP to lvl up, whereas lvl 30 needs 2688 EXP to lvl up)\n-Takes forever to get enough Blue Essence due to EXP system, bad capsule rewards and can&#039;t demo champs in practice tool ect. \n-New players don&#039;t even start with some champions.\n-Total amount of champions in the game 134x Champions... too many to think of, try out and or buy....\n-Pricing too high for alot of champions:\n    -32x Champions Costing 6400 BE\n    -51x Champions Costing 4800 BE\n    -24x Champions Costing 3150 BE\n    -21x Champions Costing 1350 BE\n    -14x Champions Costing 450 BE\nOver Over half the champion pricing being unreasonable (6400BE and 4800BE.....83/134 Champions).... too much 6300BE and 4800BE\nCosts more than $700 worth of RP to buy all of them...... they&#039;re not even skins...\n\n&gt;Possible Fix\n&gt;Have all 450BE champions as starter champions which every and all new accounts start with **AND** Decrease amount of champions pricing;\n6400BE 32x &gt; 20x champions    (12 champions move down to 4800BE)\n4800BE 51x &gt; 35x champions     (28 champions move down to 3150BE due to 12 moving down from 6400BE)\n3150BE 24x &gt; 40x Champions     (12 Champions move down to 1350BE due to 28 moving down from 4800BE)\n1350BE 21x &gt; 25x Champions     (7 Champions move down to 450BE due to 12 moving down from 3150BE)\n450BE  0x &gt; 7x Champions          ( Due to 7 moving down from 1350BE)\n&gt;If this change is applied total champions needed for games modes such as Ranked must be increased from 20x &gt; 34x Champions in total instead. And rewards for players who own 450BE champs can get 100BE for every 450BE champs they have.\n\n**No description of specific game modes**\nGiving description for draft, normals, flex and ranked and its diffrence between them can help new players to understand the difference between them.\n\n&gt; Fix\n&gt; Just put the description on the right of the Draft and blind pick options\n\n\n**Gamemode navigation problems**\nPvP, coop vs AI and Training mode icons are very small and does not show borders like how there is a border between training and create custom.\nThe first thing that is automatically choses when choosing game modes after picking play is usually Draft when alot of player pick Blind pick instead...\n\n&gt; Possible Fix\n&gt; Use the line that is between Training and create custom, and put them between PVP, COOP vs AI and Training to differentiate them with each other.\n&gt; Make the buttons Bigger and easier to see and notice for new players. \n&gt; Have COOP vs AI be automatically chosen when Play is clicked instead of Blind pick for new players unable to play blind pick.\n&gt; Blind pick should also be above draft pick and be the first thing that is chosen.\n&gt; Have Description of all game modes \n\n**Nothing to do while waiting for game to start in loading screen**\nDuring this time players usually tab out of the game, go afk or even play other games while waiting for League to finish loading and start. This can often lead to people coming back at 1:20min into the game or even longer due to players taking forever to load into the game. It also makes players want to smack their heads in with the keyboard\n\n&gt; Possible Fix\n&gt; Make loading into the game down to 20sec\n&gt; Have the all player chosen champions on the loading screen decreased to %20 of its size or decrease its size to %70 and then adding small buttons which can open up stuff. Then add this for the %80 of its screen;\n&gt; -Adding a small mini game such as some of Riot&#039;s Arcade games (eg Blitzcrank&#039;s Poro Round up)\n&gt; -Having the Whole Arcade room as the load screen where you can access Riots crazy music, moving splash arts and view other champion skins with its lore.\n&gt; -Or just Having champion Lore on with champions and their skins slowly fading into other ones. \nSadly this has to be done without lagging out the system as older systems may not be able to handle it and crash","replies":[]}
