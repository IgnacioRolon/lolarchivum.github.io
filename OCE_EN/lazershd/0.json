That's why I've removed the name of the player you mentioned in your post.\n\n The best place to report is in the end-game lobby by clicking the report player button, or if you think this case is particularly serious or might not be detected, then you can submit your report directly to Riot through a [Riot Support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Make sure you submit your report in the _\"Report cheating, phishing, or negative in-game behavior\"_ category.","replies":[]}]}
