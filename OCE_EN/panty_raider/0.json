Last Zyra skin was the SKT skin and that was 2 years ago...... makes me quite sad :(","replies":[{"poster":"Panty Raider","date":"2016-09-19T10:05:44.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...... hence why i said they should start making skins for champs that have been out for a while..... can you guys read? or mentally stupid? :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-16T08:41:57.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get in line behind Swain, Karthus, Yorick, Urgot, Evelynn, Poppy, Cassiopeia. and everyone else that Riot forgot.\n\nSome of those champs haven't had skins for 4 or 5 years (and Yorick has NEVER got a new skin)\n\nZyra needs some new skins its true, but Karthus doesn't have a single skin that changes any particle effects _(let that sink in, a mage who's entire kit revolves around swirling magic around himself and throwing out everywhere, doesnt have a single skin that changes his particle effects. But Olaf, who does nothing except throwing an axe, does have skins that change his effects)_ Swain hasn't got a skin for 4+ years. Yorick has never got a skin and unlike Gangplank who has lots of skins, he didnt even get one with his update.\n\nZyra has 3 skins, 2 of which change her particles, and both of which are very very good skins.\nShe is LOW on the priority list here I'm afraid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ebay Account","date":"2016-09-16T08:06:07.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least she has 3 fairly good skin, unlike some champions that have 1-2 skins bad skins.","replies":[]}]}
