Said we should just play safe and hope the other two lanes could carry.\nAsked to play safe and he kept trying to trade.\nYou can imagine the outcome? \nThe game degenerated into a troll-fest. We just ended up flaming each other in the all-chat.\nNow he ended up going 2-12. But because I was zoned off so easily my CS score was pathetic.\nI still think he cost us the game. But my job as an ADC is to farm and ultimately, I failed.\nSo instead of just blaming my teammates (even if deserved), what could I have done?\nAny thoughts / advice?.\n(Its kinda similar to a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e ADC)\nWhat should I have done?","replies":[{"poster":"AwkwardKitties","date":"2019-01-11T09:16:20.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xerath is a long range poke mage with just his e as hard cc, mf requires to either use q to poke you low or items to do much dmg, you either need to play safe which will be hard or close the gap.  A hook champ would be good to pull them close or like your cait pick, to hit them at range as well. Coordination is needed and bot and in low elos its the first kill that snowballs the lane into a win so your fiddle was right in that sense but two horses pulling different ways don't pull the cart forward.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2019-01-09T14:04:14.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quite frankly nothing. It’s just one of those lanes where you just need to survive. If you had ended the landing phase down 20 cs and or 2 deaths you would have been fine. Riven and Zoe both could have carried the game if the bot lane had gone a bit more even. The thing about xerath support is if it doesn’t snow ball it falls of hard if he doesn’t snowball the game. Now granted your 2/7 mini isnt exactly helping the cause either. The general way to beat a bot lane like this is either A, out sustain the poke so you need a champ with heals or shields something like a soraka\nOr B, play something with hard engage and just kill em. Something like a Leona or a Rakan","replies":[]}]}
