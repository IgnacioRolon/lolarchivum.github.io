I (adc main) almost always have my pink ward out and did the same with green wards before they were removed but i often get matched with supports who don&#039;t even buy sightstone and am usually the only player with a pink on the map. \r\n\r\n If those who don&#039;t ward had some sort of incentive to place wards other than the obvious vision advantage, people would quickly develop habit of warding effectively. \r\n\r\neg. Every time you place a pink ward, you get 5 ip and also get 5 ip for every minute that ward stays alive (to encourage contesting wards). this would work out to an extra 100 - 200 ip per game (depending on length) which isn&#039;t an enormous amount but also is more than enough to convince people to ward and have a positive impact on the game if only for extra ip. The values aren&#039;t really important, it&#039;s more about the reward for warding at all that makes the difference.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;d have to work out something different for sightstone but even making sure that every player has a pink ward down at all times with a method similar to this would have enormously positive impact at lower elo and also help the players at higher elo who already do ward to afford the specialised runes they need to compete.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-01-28T10:01:23.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be abused tho.

Riot pls. Wards are incredibly under-utilized in lower elo gameplay. Players (especially adc mains) that constantly push and over extend get killed over and over again. I as a support notice that for botlane my wards and sweepers are enough to safely protect my adc. However it's not just about warding. Normally I have the river and sides warded and constantly ping my adc or another laner to back off when I spot a gank. This shows lack of map awareness and means that trash who blame me for not helping flame me. There is hardly anything we can do to teach awareness to players unwilling to learn from their mistakes. \n\nOn the other side warding is very important anyway and your argument is perfectly valid and something should be done. \n \n{{champion:412}}","replies":[]}]}
