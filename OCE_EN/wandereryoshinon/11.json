I got the mastery tokens required for mastery level 6 on Jinx within 3 or 4 games of her when the new system came out but now that I am mastery 6, I can&#039;t get anything higher than an S-. Can someone explain to me what makes an S or higher game? I feel like knowing this will make me a better player because I&#039;ll know what I need to do to be considered to have had a good performance in a game...","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-10T18:13:29.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting an S doesn't win you games, nor does it make you become a better player.\ncheck out this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX2mbqN9HfQ","replies":[]}]}
