I&#039;m not even upset about the fact that it stacks infinitely now. if a Cho&#039;gath gets to a point where he has enough health for it to be ridiculous after going 10/0, good on him. \r\n\r\nThe problem is the fact that his stacks don&#039;t drop off anymore. It&#039;s stupid that a Cho&#039;gath can go 0/10 in lane, get a few lucky executes in with a health pool that is already stupid cause you can eat minions to 6 stacks (which is fine by itself) and then be invincible and have true damage that scales with that invincibility. \r\n\r\nAnd before anyone says build last whisper or something along those lines, it makes no difference when he has a health pool that compares to the dragon in addition to his 400 armour cause his team will kill you and you can&#039;t ignore him because he does damage too. \r\n\r\nIn summary, Cho&#039;gath needs to either stack infinitely and be able to be shut down and lose his stacks or be capped at 6 permanent stacks because having both is absolutely toxic and there&#039;s no way to play around it like there is with other infinitely stacking champs like Nasus or Veigar.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-27T00:20:27.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so, what your saying is, cho is op since all the matches you play lasts at least 80 minutes???","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-27T03:13:44.880+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a good cho'gath becomes a massive issue in any game that goes longer than 25min unless the enemy team has a bork or last whisper. I used to main cho'gath and there was always the trade off between going tank and going ap, but he is seriously a whole new level of strong after this rework.\n\n Imo pick or ban in bronze and silver atm.

Chogath hates bortk and liandry's. he hates being kited and his abilities are pretty easily dodged, most champs currently have a way to build into or use abilities to put cho either out of the fight or behind. twitch build botrk, jinx jsut does tons of damage with runaans and rockets, jhin does mad damage adn has an execute, miss moruine shreds his armour. all the champs you currently play actually have a great deal of ability to play against a cho gath.","replies":[{"poster":"LotusOfTheLight","date":"2017-10-12T10:37:12.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And you need to stop being drunk.

His silence is really impactful, his q is nice for making picks or just disrupting a teamfight and he actually does alot more damage than traditional tanks, his ult damage is a bit strong now though. He's also not that easy to kite out if he gets to the point where he's massive since he'll be with his team absorbing all the damage whilst forcing you to try to not get knocked up.\n\nKiting out a nasus, or even a darius or garen isn't so bad because they're really short range but cho'gath can q behind you, w infront and then walk towards you, zoning you quite hard and in teamfights, if you aren't well positioned or have a good tanky frontline, then you're probably going to be forced to burn flash.\n\nI kinda don't like how strong they've made cho'gath, and cho'gath was the first champion I ever mained.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-07T23:55:03.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"high elo korean cho'gath outplay in the LCK: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47pT821sZBk\n\ntanks with true damage burst.","replies":[]}]}
