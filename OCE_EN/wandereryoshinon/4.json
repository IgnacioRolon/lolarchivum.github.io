When you compare it with other items like Randuin's Omen, Frozen Heart, and Zz' Rot Portal (which all grant additional stats, passives and actives) you'll notice that Thornmail is most useful when playing against team compositions that rely heavily on Physical Damage and Attack Speed. If that sounds like your team then it's likely it will be difficult to defeat this champion.\n\nIn other situations, such as playing against compositions featuring two or more magic damage dealers, Thornmail becomes significantly less effective. If this is the case, which it usually should be, you as an AD can focus on your positioning and kiting in order to allow your team to slowly whittle them down. You can attack them as well but do your best to stay away from them. Tanks (or juggernauts) are usually at their strongest when they are right on top of you.
