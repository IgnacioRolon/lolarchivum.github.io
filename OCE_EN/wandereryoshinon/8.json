The champion.gg page for adc (which i encourage you look at for yourself) is pretty much the same for every elo and it shows that there are 4 marksmans with winrates higher than 50%. The other champions that make up the &quot;viable&quot; (for lack of a better word) adc champions are mages with high base damage and melee carries like yasuo and irelia.\r\n\r\nSo, my question is; &quot;Why can&#039;t adc just be a viable role?&quot;.\r\n\r\nHigh elo mains of adc are flocking away from adc or toward these new strats trying to find something that is impactful because marksmans just don&#039;t do enough early (which is fair because they are supposed to carry late), but then the marksmans don&#039;t carry late. Thanks to duskblade and stormrazor, ad assassins kill marksmans in one auto attack (to which there literally is not counterplay) and tanks are unkillable thanks to the build that is necessary to kill them being underpowered (for getting through massive amounts of armour and hp like it&#039;s supposed to) and overpriced for what it provides.\r\n\r\nI thought that the changes to essence reaver would make caster marksmans stronger (which it did in the case of exclusively lucian) and that the changes to infinity edge would make hypercarries stronger. But they didn&#039;t because the cost of the core build for hypercarries went up by almost 1000 gold and the assassins (as stated before) make disgusting use of stormrazor so even if marksmans had the damage to scare tanks, they would not have time to do anything meaningful. This is also true of the caster marksmans because they don&#039;t have the damage to kill tanks on account of building very little penetration and their damage is not fast enough to protect them from assassins.\r\n\r\nEven in professional play, marksmans are seeing a decline in play rate which essentially means that without a coordinated team, a group of champions that  1/5 of the player base main and should be in every game given the role they play in team comps is unplayable.\r\n\r\nSo... Why can&#039;t adc just be a viable role?","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-26T23:47:58.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be an ADC main ( I still ADC main as I got bored of top lane, vsing the same shit over again) and I can tell you atm adc is in a shit show. \n\nThey nerfed zeal by increasing it's price by 200. This was totally unnecessary as crit HARDLY DOES ** damage anyway now.  So taking the ability to buy zeal early just gives all crit adc's no fkin chance to do jack shit. Now, if you buy the brawlers seperately, you do crit but then your attackspeed is fucked so almost any of the top tier adc's (such as lucian or draven) can easily burst you down before u can even have a chance to crit that 10%. \n\nNow, storm razer was introduced and you can 100% crit on first try. But guess what! It doesn't matter when u do 0 damage late game. \n\n\nI've played only Jinx and Lucian these last 2 patches (in ranked) but have played the other adc's in normal games.\n\nJINX: God help your soul, you need to survive lane till late game. She is only viable after you buy 4 items (which is sometime around the 30-40min mark depending on the cs you get) and if you're lucky, the game won't be over by then.\n\nLucian: God tier, can fk any adc over early games (but is in a fair fight with Draven). You need to play your cards right against Draven or you die (basically a skill match with both you as an ADC and your support as a helper).\n\nNow when u play against a Draven without Luician here is my reaction.\n\nJinx: ur dead.\nKaisa: Ur fkin dead m8 unless ur support is good or the Draven is bad\nAshe: Lmao enjoy being 2 hit early.\nSivir: If you play your cards right, you can kill him by poking his ass with your Q, but you get bullied hard if you get in range of Draven.\nVayne: Skill matchup based on adc & support.\nVarus: Does ok once he gets rageblade, but since it got nerfed in 8.13 not sure anymore.\nKog: No idea, never played that champ.\nCaitlyn: RIP cait, without old i.e = hardly any damage even in late game so you're forced to auto attack for days until they die.\n\nYou don't really have much of a choice as an ADC. It has become support reliant now. Either your support carries you to victory or you die a painful death.\n\nUnless you pick either Draven or Lucian since they have very high damage in early game.\n\n\n\nNow, I have no idea what they meant by ADC's used to be top tier. Before these changes, Adc's still sucked dick lmao. They may do a lot of damage but they are also squishy, they die so easily now with League of Assasins (with domination).","replies":[]}]}
