It&#039;s also worth mentioning that I&#039;m silver 5 so i don&#039;t have a firm enough grasp on the game to know how this would affect it or if it would make AA marksmen too strong. So please, tell me if this is silly or what could be done to change it to being not silly if you like the concept\r\n\r\nGetting to the point, i think that the cooldown, or stack time, on the move speed on warlords should have an inverse scaling with level such that if you are moving constantly and auto attacking constantly (ie. playing borderline perfectly), it should be almost permanent in a fight. Now, I&#039;m not saying make it so for the current warlords. obviously the move speed percentage bonus would have to be changed and the life steal would either have to be gutted or removed entirely however i think that giving adc&#039;s more move speed than other champions with a keystone in this way would promote kiting and managing the ranges of enemy champions leading to a better skill definition for AA adc mains across all ranks. \r\n\r\nThis move speed would also solve the problem of assassins somewhat by making bursting adc&#039;s a necessary out play to their style of gameplay as opposed to something that assassins do if and when they feel like it. Also, should an assassin mess their combo up, they wouldn&#039;t be able to just go auto for auto with the adc they&#039;re trying to kill until they get their cooldowns back because they would not be able to keep up with them and stay on top of them.\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#039;m silver 5 and would not expect to be able to keep the move speed off coldown, only the top of the ladder should be able to keep the move speed constantly. Also, again, please tell me if this is silly and explain why further than &quot;are you stupid, adc would be so broken&quot; cause i want to understand why its silly if it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-10T23:09:52.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would just make people hate yasuo more than he already is, we don't need that, people will start playing yasuo again.\n\nThey are changing the life steal to work off of your ad instead of damage next patch anyway. So say yasuo presses q on a minion, his q will get a bonus heal, but next patch that bonus heal is gone, though the healing then becomes more effective versus champions as the heal technically ignores armor.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bish√∂p","date":"2017-03-09T23:45:31.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it all comes down to survivabilty. The new warlords is very strong on champions like draven and ezreal. i have found alot of success with the new warlords on ezreal it just made him that much more slipperier so OP!  the cd is fine and makes it a balanced mastery.","replies":[]}]}
