I think it's gonna make tanks a lot less opressive in the late game once they have 500 armour and 4000 health (until riot finally decides to nerf the stats on tank items and give them more interesting item actives).\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think it will be a nerf to bruiser top laners that rely on conqueror to deal with tanks. Not being able to preserve stacks unless you're attacking a champion will make setting up advantageous trades significantly more difficult for champions that currently rely on conqueror. I feel like it would make more sense to make the stacks last 5 seconds for melee and ranged champions with the addition that exclusively melee champions can PRESERVE stacks by hitting minions (I want to stress that i do not think that melee champions should be able to build stacks by hitting minions). This way, the rune would function in a similar way to how it already does for melee champions while allowing ranged champions in the bot lane who are playing aggressively and harassing frequently to make use of it. Ranged top laners like quinn and gp will not be fun with this change but quinn is never going to be fun in top lane and gp using anything other than grasp of the undying is objectively more fun to play against.\r\n\r\nAlso, please for the love of god make it attack damage instead of adaptive force. Mages do not need like 50 bonus ability power and 10% true damage at level 11 when their items already give them so much damage and pen as it is. Mages should not be able to one shot tanks therefore they do not need this rune. Giving them more stats and true damage will just make it harder than it already is for squishies to survive mages. Also giving them significant ability power and penetration in a rune would make playing against mages like victor and vladamir in the top lane a nightmare.","replies":[{"poster":"Mot√∂rhead","date":"2019-02-24T10:21:51.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree with the no pre-stack on minions as it just flat out gives tanks the advantage to engage more than they already do in lane and in a roaming situation in the jungle. The fact bruisers lose this makes it so they have to give up their entire engage and trade just to get it to proc which in the end makes it useless to even try go for a sustained long term trade.\n\nYou are right in saying make it AD and not adaptive force as you said mages are already broken as is with cheap items and overloaded stats in items other than rabadons which they will funnel this bonus ap into.","replies":[]}]}
