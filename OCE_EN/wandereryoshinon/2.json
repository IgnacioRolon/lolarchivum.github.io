As Someone who has mastery 7 on the champ, and have been playing it for over 4 years, i can tell you he's rubbish, the only time he has ever been OP was before the Essence Reaver Revert\n\nAs for your Ult lower than deathtimer\n\nAssuming his runes were correct (Electrocute, Sudden Impact, Eyeballs, and Ultimate Hunter, with Presence of Mind and Literally Any other Precision Rune)\n\nThat's only 15% CDR on Ult base, with a 20% of Current CD if he got a kill\n\nLast i checked his ult is 1:30, 75, 60\n\nWith 40% CDR, his ult still doesn't go below 35 Seconds\n\nShort of you dying post 40 mins and him killing several players in that time WITHOUT it, his ult will never have been up every time you respawned\n\nDon't Lie, he's not OP, he's not even good right now\n\nIf you want to beat him because he's \"OP\" pick a High CC champ, and make sure they have 2 kinds, so you can't be stopped by Spell Shield","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-28T09:19:40.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at about 20min into the game, assuming average levels have advanced normally and his teams only around 3 levels below the Nocturne, his respawn time should be about 44.25s.\n\nNocturne Ult gets to be about 100s by rank 3, I'm assuming he'd very fed, full cdr, ultimate hunter stacks, rank 3 ult, the works.\n\n25% base ult cd down from ultimate hunter -> 75s and applying 40% CDR -> comes down to 45s.\nNow assuming Nocturne is only killing our buddy over here, that's another 20% off the total cd from Presence of Mind, 9s off, shaving Nocturne's Ult CD to 36s.\n\nSo in a white room, this is possible. In practice it's not as good, since you have teammates and a map, and if Nocturne is fountain diving you, he'll have to wait for his respawn timer as well.\n\nBut from Yoshinon's perspective, including time taken to walk back into a sidelane to die (approx 20s), then yes Nocturne could very well be ulting faster than they can get back to lane.\n\nThat said, as I posted earlier, that's not really very special, alot of champions who rely on their ult can do so. \n\nA rengar with the same setup could shave his ult cd down to about 26s. I.e. they could ult, kill you, leave, ult kill somebody else, wait for you to get back to lane, and kill you with their ult again the moment you come into lane.\n\nAlso I personally much prefer Stopwatch and Cosmic Insight.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-28T09:22:50.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also I hate rengar, he's far more oppressive and bursts wayyy harder on a shorter cd.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-28T09:24:11.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You kidding?

If you really feel the pressure, buy zhonias and ninja tabis, and he becomes alot more manageable.\n\nYou're dying because you don't understand that splitpushing as a squishy adc is just asking to be made into a tasty treat by a whole host of knifey assassins.","replies":[]}]}
