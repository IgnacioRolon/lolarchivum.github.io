You get 2 quests a day that can get you 20-30 tokens daily, i've completed every quest since the event started and i have over 200 tokens now, i havent even spent a cent. Plus there isnt really much you'd be missing out on if you dont buy it, literally just a  ward and a bunch of Yasuo/Riven main quests.
