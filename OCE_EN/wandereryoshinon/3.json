You might as well get a cup of coffee too. (tristana q should have ran out)\n\n... I love nautilus, but why do people even play adc?...\n\nAutos just don't work anymore and adcs aren't even that good lategame, yes I know adcs have spells and stuff, but these are adcs taken glass cannon and they're still not putting out that much damage. Yes they're good against towers and objectives like baron and they don't need mana to output dps but at 6 items their damage output is kinda pathetic considering how weak they were leading up to their 'moment of glory', the lategame. Full glass cannon builds, especially in lower elo just don't put out enough damage to justify being as squishy as they are.\n\nNow another calculation, my janky piece of garbage tank adc build against nautilus:\n{{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3085}}  {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3009}}\nIt takes 35 autos to kill him and 32 autos if you use the active from BoRK as a finisher. That means it takes this tank build around 22s to dispatch an afk nautilus under the same conditions.\n\nAlso this build was designed with ashe's passive, fervor of battle, and battle trance masteries in mind and was made to be tanky enough to be able to stand in auto range during a teamfight, heal any poke through lifesteal and spirit visage and apply armour shred and any other effects to all targets, not to actually 1v1 tanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-12T08:04:14.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am very very boring.\n\nAlso I forgot to add in the effect of masteries and runes and I'm so stupid but I can't be bothered doing it all over again and so I'll just say that from estimation, masteries and recomended runes should shave a bit of time off all those time taken to kill an afk.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-02-12T22:50:34.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 bruisers gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-11T06:31:44.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of it this way. once you get your last whisper item, it give 60 armour. if you have lifesteal, which you can get with masteries, items and runes, you can negate it. thornmail itself is a weak armour item and most wont get it unless you are building more than 200 armour. and if that is the case then you need to not pick a full ad comp. build armour pen and lifesteal, and you wll consistently beat thornmail/","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-11T23:34:49.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=dragon poo,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=us8pIpfI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-11T06:31:44.766+0000)\n>\n> Think of it this way. once you get your last whisper item, it give 55 armour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-11T08:35:17.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep or have some ap on your team and just accept that you won't be able to fight the tank without some peel until you get your full build.

It's not a very good item in this assassin/tank and a few mages meta. Adcs just aren't threatening enough to need this item and given that half the meta adcs aren't atkspeed based, this item is very lackluster since the damage back is negated lategame by lifesteal, so it's a midgame item, that doesn't have health attached to it, which makes it very hard to be a proper tank against a mixed damage enemy team if you buy it first or second (although for rammus this is an exception as he scales excellently with thornmails statline and you should avoid autoing him when he's in defense curl). Also the lack of health makes this a terrible first item rush.\n\nThornmail can be useful and it has a fair chunk of armour, but if survivability is your issue right now as a tank, randuins is far better for subduing adcs since tank base damages plus the overall reduction of damage output a randuins can do to an adc, means you'll fare far better trying to tank the damage.\n\nRanduins >>> Thornmail for a tank in most cases, since the extra health makes this item overall tankier during the midgame, it's a decent first item for a tank if you aren't doing amazing and the atkspeed debuff coldsteel and the crit damage reduction go a long way into cutting an adcs damage output. Not to mention the randuins slow is more useful than you'll notice but it helps.\n\nThornmail makes you very vulnerable to magic damage and doesn't really help once the adc has gotten a bloodthirster.\n\nThe atkspeed debuffs from frozen heart and randuins don't synergise well with thormail but when measuring up which way to build, the atkspeed debuff ends up scaling better into lategame and make it harder for adcs during teamfights to get their dps out.\n\nJust with the passives, not even factoring the armour, assuming the adc has 50% crit chance that's around 30% of your adc dps from autos, gone, before I even have to consider armour.","replies":[]}]}
