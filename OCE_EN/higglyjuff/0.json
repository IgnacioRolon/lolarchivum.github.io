I could have an entire day with normal 72 ping only for it to randomly spike later as the day progresses. I know that the problem is nothing to do with the internet here as I am able to connect well to many other applications, webpages and games just fine. I don't think I would be able to watch a video on Youtube if I really had bad internet. And I'm not just talking bad, I'm talking horrible. Ping at 1000+ causing me to disconnect as I gank. I can only come to one conclusion in my mind, and that is that it has to be the server that is having issues causing random players, in random games, at random times, to have very bad connection. I just need to know if others are having similar issues and if there is a solution. Can someone please enlighten me.","replies":[{"poster":"Tifa","date":"2014-12-16T10:16:15.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was playing with friends, 3 of us received a huge lag spike at the same time during a team fight which lost us the game :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morior Invictus","date":"2014-12-13T09:28:01.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting exactly the same thing.
