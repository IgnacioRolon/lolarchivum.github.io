I guess reliable, non-toxic people that don&#039;t tilt easily to ranked with. I don&#039;t necessarily want to join a team but whatever works I guess. \r\n\r\nI have trouble remembering things sometimes, it&#039;s hard to explain (example: I used to main Thresh and Lulu and can no longer play them to their full potential) so if that&#039;s something you can deal with that would be great.. haha\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t have to main adc. If you are an adc and if we work well together then cool, 10 points to you. Can chat on Skype or Discord if you want but you&#039;ll probs just think I&#039;m a weirdo. \r\n\r\nDrop your IGN here and I&#039;ll add you if you&#039;re interested, I&#039;m not really good at selling myself.","replies":[]}
