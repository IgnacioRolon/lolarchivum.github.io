I scoured some websites for the artist of the Black Plague skin line (I&#039;m talking about Black Scourge Singed, Iron Inquisitor Kayle and Cursed Revenant Nocturne) because I felt the artwork was similar but the dude behind those doesn&#039;t seem to have updated anything in a while so I can&#039;t know for sure if he worked on this project. His name is Pan Chengwei for anyone interested.\r\n\r\nSo please Riot Senpai bless this post with the names of those poor souls who slave over their desks creating content for you to exploit..  \r\nOr\r\n-the significantly more likely option-\r\nMy fellow artsy losers in the community, have you seen this particular artist before? Can anybody give me a name? An Instagram? A Facebook page? A Deviantart? An Artstation? Anything. I&#039;d be very grateful. \r\n\r\nCoven teaser:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRKja2hGKoU\r\n\r\nLeona teaser:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMQVVZPSqNA","replies":[{"poster":"Lunae Lucida","date":"2018-11-30T03:44:43.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh i wish rito would give more attention to the artists behind the badass stuff they put out. i really love the teaser art and i hope they put it on league displays","replies":[{"poster":"Lunae Lucida","date":"2018-11-30T03:45:44.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAIT HOLD UP I GOTCHU FAM\n\nhttps://www.artstation.com/sukeart - Eclipse and Coven Promos\nhttps://www.artstation.com/lash - Lunar/Solar Eclipse Leona splash artist","replies":[]}]}]}
