There&#039;s lots of arguing over which one they personally want to complete and all in all it&#039;s just a hard time getting a full comp of people on the same page ultimately wasting time when someone fucks up their picks/augs and everyone just loads in and surrenders. So basically, looking for like minded people (or even links to a place to find groups for completing missions in general, like a FB group or a disc channel or whatever if there are any cause this kind of thing does happen every now and then with harder missions) to just get this shit out of the way. I also don&#039;t mind trying to help people complete their missions! It&#039;s just much easier to get through when you&#039;re all doing the one task.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently up to: \r\nClear Onslaught difficulty\r\nClear Onslaught with all 5 as same champion\r\nClear Onslaught with 4 or less Augments\r\n\r\nJust add me in game and shoot me a message if you&#039;re down. \r\nI also don&#039;t mind trying to help people complete their missions!
