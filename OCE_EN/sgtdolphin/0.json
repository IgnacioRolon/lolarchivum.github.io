Or minions will stay alive at 0hp and keep attacking each other. You can move, cast abilities and last hit. But abilities and animations will not show.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been forced to tether my phone and use its internet as a hotspot to circumvent this issue, because even at off peak times like 3am will this issue still be a problem.** 0% packet loss and 40-50 ping and its still doing this lag**. Using mudfish a VPN service still doesn&#039;t fix the issue. Could the modem/router be the issue causing this then if the only solution so far is using my phone? Considering a VPN will change routes to the game server but still use my local network?\r\n\r\nI have sent tracerts to riot support along with various game logs, which they have responded with it possibly being my ISPs fault or my computer (I don&#039;t think it can be my computer if a mobile hotspot fixes the issue and a person in my area is also getting the same lag).\r\nI&#039;m just wondering if anyone else has had this issue and knows how to solve it.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t want to reformat my computer but i&#039;m willing to try anything to fix this issue. I can&#039;t use my phones internet forever.\r\n\r\nLogs are not showing the issue either.\r\nMy phone internet where the game is very playable with 1-2 hiccups per game like a 200 ping lag spike or something: https://prnt.sc/hct1b2\r\nEthernet, where this horrible lag occurs: https://prnt.sc/hct13v","replies":[{"poster":"JamesyBoy97","date":"2017-11-24T09:19:41.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happening to me aswell","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-21T11:05:11.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like packet loss to me, and also sounds like it's on your ISPs end. \n\nThe first thing I would recommend is connecting via ethernet instead of wifi if you haven't already. Wifi connections are notoriously unstable and therefore not recommended for online gameplay. \n\nIf that doesn't help then I'd recommend giving your ISP a call and asking them what is going on, you can also take a look at Riot's Lag Report site to get some info as to how your ISP is affecting your games: https://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/\n\nYou can also find some other common connection issues (player side) and their fixes here (though it sounds like it might not help much): https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbPY3Rpr-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here#connection","replies":[]}]}
