Its ok though, we can change that :)\n\nStep 1- **Narrow down your champ pool**\n\n* [Right now, you have a ridiculously large champ pool. ](http://oce.soloq.gg/multi/search/4320527/SEASON2016). While being flexible with your picks is usually a good thing, sometimes it gets a bit excessive. At the current moment, I suspect you won't have mastered these champions (by mastered I mean know build options, matchups and mechanics like the back of your hand, not mastery rank 5). \n\nWe are going to pick two roles (you will always get one of these roles in ranked) and draft out a champion pool for each role. I see you like to play top+mid+jg, so I am going to write out 3 champs for each role. You pick your two fave roles from this. \n\nMid- {{champion:99}} [you like to play her](http://www.lolclass.com/video/328/lux-mid-guide-by-tsm-bjergsen-season-6?utm_source=site_navigation&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=hero_search), [she provides good cc and burst damage](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/lux-62), [safe pick](http://probuilds.net/champions/details/Lux)).  {{champion:1}} ([Cheap, easy to pick up, good poke](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/annie-1), tonnes of damage and cc)\n{{champion:91}} (AD assassin midlaner,[ comparatively easy](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/talon-82) compared to zed and yas)\n\nTop- {{champion:54}} ([Very tank](http://www.lolclass.com/video/332/malphite-top-guide-by-tsm-hauntzer-season-6?utm_source=site_navigation&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=search), [good poke, good team initiate](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/malphite-35), can build a lil damage)\n{{champion:117}} ([Very good vs melee top](http://www.lolclass.com/video/161/lulu-top-basic-champion-guide-with-quas?utm_source=site_navigation&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=hero_search), [brings high utility](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/lulu-95), safe pick)\n{{champion:78}} ([Cheap, easy, tanky](http://www.lolclass.com/video/310/og-soaz-poppy-top-season-6-guide?utm_source=site_navigation&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=search), [great ult if used right](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/poppy-43), W is a lifesaver)\n\nJg- {{champion:254}} ([Lots of damage even while building tank](http://www.lolclass.com/video/132/vi-basic-jungle-guide-with-meteos), [great ganks](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/vi-109), fun)\n{{champion:32}} ([In case your team needs some AP](http://www.lolclass.com/video/143/amumu-basic-jungle-guide-with-meteos), [high CC](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/amumu-23), tank)\n{{champion:24}} ([Nice damage based carry](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/champion/jax-15))\n\n_**Notes:**_ I would advise staying away from nasus and yasuo in low elo. \nNasus because you are often needed to provide pressure (can't do that because farm) and because low elo games are often stomps and you don't have enough time to stack. Yasuo because he is a mechanically intensive champion that is heavily reliant on team communication and works best is specific comps (something you will not be finding in bronze (or even silver + tbh)). \nI would also suggest staying away from devourer junglers as you most likely wont have the time to stack till sated, as your lanes will need the most help they can get. \n\nStep 2- **Champion optimisation.**\n\n* **Click on the links after each champion recommendation**. Do a little research on your champion. Make specific mastery pages (and rune pages if you can). Look at variations in builds and maybe throw together some item sets as well. Learn to build so that you compliment your strengths and cover your/your teams weaknesses. Make sure you are paying attention to what the enemy is building/ has in their team comp. E.g: there is no point building MR when the entire enemy team is AD\n\nStep 3- **Master you champions in normals**\n\n* Right now, **it doesn't look like you are ready for ranked**. [A 12% win rate over 30+ games with only 1/19 champions with a KDA above 1 isn't going to improve overnight](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=digitx2). If you continue to play ranked, it will likely get harder to get out of this slump.  \n\nPlaying normals will allow you to get a feel for your champions and you will slowly get to a point where you don't die as much, and get way more kills. It will also make your more comfortable on the champion so you don't play games in fear of \"how bad are they gonna flame me this game?\". Just play to the best of your ability and focus on having fun and mastering the champ. \n\nA couple of things to work towards during this phase:\n\n* [Good CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH)- crucial for when you are playing safe, the majority of your gold is going to be earned this way.\n\n* Warding- [Right now your warding is awful](http://wardscore.loltools.net/?name=digitx2&region=oce) (I went through your ranked history it was a stretch to find games where you placed more than 2 wards). Warding will help you stay safe from ganks, as well as help your team decide when to make plays.\n\n* If something is going wrong, you have a big loss streak or someone starts tilting you, take a break for a while. [Go for a walk, clear your head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGRQ_EcO-wI). Playing with a negative mindset is not going to help you climb, and you may end up taking out frustrations on players in game.\n\nFollow these steps and come back in a month or two for more tips, when you are truly ready to suceed in ranked. \n\n**TL;DR\n1. Narrow champ pool, 2 roles, 3 champs per roles (6 in total)\n2. Optimize runes and masteries for said champs\n3. Relearn basics\n4. Don't play ranked for a couple of months till you sort this out.\n**\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2016-03-24T15:09:28.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't quite sound like your ready for ranked, perhaps just play some normals to improve your skills before playing ranked if your main goal is to get out of bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BraidedPube","date":"2016-03-24T13:45:38.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 wins 29 loses. The 4 wins you have you got hard carried. You suck at farming tbh 1.8 cs a minutes on nasus? you have 40 minute games with 40 cs and 0 kill participation when you are playing a top laner with tp what do you do all game?.\n\n\nYour rune pages are terrible not level 3 runes and you run magic pen on both rune pages one page you didn't even fill up all the slots. Im assuming you dont use the mastery pages with 29 and 18 points in them, just kidding I can see you do 30/33 matches you dont even use mastery pages with 30 points in them. Also dont run deathfire touch on vi. just go to champion.gg and copy shit from there. Dont build double deathcap it makes no sense.\n\n\n\n\nso TLDR:  copy runes and masteries from champion.gg, buy runes, put points in your masteries and most importantly sit in a custom game and practice csing because 1cs a minute is less you would  get on a support champion. There is no elo hell because you are not getting held back by your team at all and stop playing yasuo please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-24T11:14:56.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I might be able to help.\nI wont play with you, but I can spectate your games.\nThis will allow to see what you are doing wrong and how to improve.\n\nlike this really.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeSpooks","date":"2016-03-24T09:47:31.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What champions do you play and do you have any communication software.","replies":[]}]}
