Try to aim/reach for perfect CS every 10 mins.\nBecause the average of CSing is 80 per 10 mins.\n\nAnd remember to buy boots, holy crap. Its 300 gold pretty cheap shouldn't take you 30 mins to buy one.\nalso if you have left over gold when you buy items use them, get a pick get a smaller item that cost like 300 gold or so.\nUpgrade your items.\n\nNow not to be extremely rude, but from what I can gather from this you deserve to be there at the moment.\nYou need to work on skill, and knowledge. Buy some freaking boots, Upgrade your trinkets.\n80 CS per 10 mins is what you should be aiming for.\nStop being so god damn aggressive, stop chasing for kills.\nLearn to BACK OFF, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azoraaa","date":"2016-04-02T11:52:22.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive noticed that everyone is saying your cs needs work. Honestly the way you can make csing easier is by having more damage, the way you could do this is saving up some ip and getting TIER 3 Runes especially quintessences which I noticed you haven't got, doing this would make it 10x easier. Hopefully this helps you out and you can improve your cs :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-30T15:28:09.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[You posted this same thing a week ago, and I gotta admit, we gave you some great ideas on how to improve. ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/NEqnLUxE-i-need-help-getting-out-of-elo-hell-)\n\nRight now, the champs you play are all very mechanically intensive, and require a lot of skill and communication to pull off well (or even at all tbh).\n\n**Champ pool**\n_You really have to focus on easier champs_. The only vaguely easy champ you have is Udyr, and I can think of at least 3 champs that would fit the same niche as him and would be way easier.\n\nIf you really want to get out of bronze, I suggest you pick up the champs I listed in the other post. \n\nBecause you really really need to practice in normals (and therefor must be able to fill every role) I would suggest:\n\nADC- Caitlyn/ Ashe\nTOP- Poppy/ Malph\nSUPPORT- Annie/ Leo\nJUNGLE- Vi/ Mumu\nMID- Annie/ Talon (just because you play ad mid a lot).\n\nLike Yasei pointed out, your CS definitely needs some work. Try t[hese exercises](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH) every day (alternate the champs you use) and see how you improve. \n\n**You aren't going to magically read something here and get out of bronze overnight. You are going to need to work really hard and be really critical of yourself every step of the way. **\n\nP.S Once your normal scores increase and you have a decent and easy champ pool, come back for more tips :D \n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-31T00:26:10.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah have to disagree cait and ashe are trash champs and so is leona for support.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-01T05:18:36.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP mainly plays mid/top/jg (there is 1 bot lane game in match history that I saw when writing this.)\n\n* Ashe is a cheap and basic champion where OP can learn how to effectively kite with the added safety of all the ashe slows.\n* Caitlyn is a super easy poke based adc so OP can practice poke and farming without messing up too much of either. She is also incredibly safe.\n\n* Leo is one of the cheapest tanky supports, who is able to provide loads of CC. She also has a nice balance of skillshots and other abilities for the OP to learn.\n\n***\n\nEveryone on this thread is giving some really good and valid advice that will definately help the OP. However, at the moment the players really needs to just focus on being able to play a champion to the point where they can get 100+CS in a 20minute game as well as at least go even in KDA.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-30T15:31:22.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I noticed that too.\nAs much as we try to help, they gotta take the first step.\nI.E (Accepting, actually putting in effort to get better, learning from mistakes)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-31T00:24:48.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To win dont play kali, zed, shaco, yasuo  and udyr.

And i know you do them. e.g say you are vs a player that is better then you don't go up to cs if you know he is strong , Your better to lose cs then die.\n \nAnother tip is be nice to everyone as it will make them play better, dont get them on tilt as it often results to feeding.\n\nAND FINALLY MY NUMBER ONE TIP (this got me to climb)\n\nadmit that you are bad...... that's it .... simple. YOU ARE BAD AT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. BUT you can get good by focusing and practicing and even watching replays of your games to see where you made stupid mistakes. Once you accept you are bad ... you can climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nibz","date":"2016-03-30T16:02:13.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not one to comment because im having a pretty bad loss and seems like i feed alot, i really dont do it that much until end game :P\n\nI noticed a few lux there, one had 2 hats\nyou seem to stick to certain builds\n\nIf you are being pressured by an AD, get some armor and play safe\nAP, get some Magic resist and play safe\n\nTry poking the enemy. i see alot in my games of people going all in when the enemy has more items, more cs, more kills\n\nI like to poke them down a bit then go in. granted i dont get to much as i mainly support but im learning from my mistakes and learning from watching videos...\n\ntake Yasei down there, I have watched all his \"helping others improve\" you should go watch them they help\n\nI get angry at people not upgrading wards now! its a thing, i never upgraded yellow to blue trinket because i did not know you could have an infinite of them on the map, i thought it was one only when you use another it replaces the first, but nope many many many if they do not know\n\nIn mid, you get 2 wards.. watch map.. look for their jungle.. if you see it in top ping the map and poke the mid a bit, you know you're a little safe\nif you see them top way ensure the top bush of mid is warded and the same for bot\n\nif you do not know where they are, do not over extend they will probably bait you into their jungle\n\nWatch the player, it's like Poker, read the players face and learn.. if they play passive and then all of a sudden go aggressive for no reason, get out, their jungle is there\n\nif they play aggressive the whole time, let them.. I usually let them be aggressive and waste dat mana\n\nif they poke constantly i'll let them but dodge (and poke back too, if they hit you try to hit them, get an even trade) then when their mana is getting low and i know they cant all in but i can, in i go\n\nPick up littel tricks, I had a fizz against my lux, he would jump every stun so i baited his jump by throwing a shield at him, then he came down and i stunned R E  maybe an ignite cos fire is fun\n\nI had an ahri game against a karthus, he spammed all day and ran low on mana, knowing jung was top i all in on him\n\nOne thing, again, watch map.. If your jungle is being ganked in the river near you, go help him.. if someone is being chased, go help them\n\nIf you kill your mid laner push tower and go roam if a lane is pushed up\nALWAYS PING you are coming\nALWAYS PING when your lane is missing\nALWAYS WARD\n\nuhhh\n\nI think i've too much and a load of crap but yeah..\n\nEDIT\n\nYasei Doubutsu !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nyour match history, Those Trinkets in last 3 or 4 games...
