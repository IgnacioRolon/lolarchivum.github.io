I&#039;ve had my Korean account banned and can&#039;t access my Garena account because of region blocks because I live in Australia and don&#039;t care to use a VPN. I constantly get told my mothers going to be dead by Asians out of no where and they start saying random fucking insults, constantly talking about how I&#039;m white. My problem is that they tell me they aren&#039;t playing in the oce region, which is fair enough but I don&#039;t have the same opportunity to join theirs which is what irritates me.\r\nCan I get an explanation on why their regions get locked or why ours can&#039;t also be locked to AU and NZ?","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-07-12T11:26:23.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because oce is bigger than jsut aus and nz, although its infested with Chinese, a good handful of them are actually students, who really, if they cant speak proper english shouldn't be over here anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-07-12T23:06:17.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low quality bait.","replies":[]}]}]}
