I&#039;m currently gold 4, however I&#039;m an exceptional team player so I believe on a premade team i can perform at a high standard, I main riven in solo queue but also have a large champion pool of tanks, and I keep up with meta such as lane swap starts and double jungling. Add in-game (Spaghini) if youre interested.
