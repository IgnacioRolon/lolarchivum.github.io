Cho'gath's CC is pretty strong if he lands his void spikes since the slow afterwards is incredibly strong, but I really don't think they're going to remove his silence at all, Cho'Gath needs it and it would too much of a nerf if they did.","replies":[{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-04-22T18:22:41.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, for an AoE silence it does last awfully long.
