I recently migrated to Australia because of i have to continue on studying here. I was from the Philippines With diamond 2 rank and all Heroes owned and a bunch of skins owned. I just want to know if I can transfer my League of Legends Philippines to League of Legends Oceana. Because i really put a lot of effort in that account and spent 4years of playing using that account.
