At level 1 her Q has a 16 second CD. If you can, try to bait this out and go in for a balls-to-the-wall engage. During this time, try to keep minions in your favour (do not fight her without your minion wave as she has quite high base damage).\n\n\n* Full on engage when abilities are down. Her abilities have rather long CDs during laning phase. Without her abilities, she has no escape, no defence, no real way of getting out of situations where the enemy laner is jumping on her face.\n\n\n* During laning phase VS a Fiora, you must be constantly harassing her and zoning her from farm. Even if she doesn't end up getting kills, if she gets enough CS gold to buy hydra, she is going to get a massive power spike and it is gonna be a bad time. Once again, champions that have short CD abilities (to engage after baiting hers) and constant poke are good for this. \n\n\n* Be super nice to your jungler and ask for early ganks to put her even further behind. \n\nYou can counter her through champions and itemization (which is even easier, especially when you are like me and have potato mechanics):\n\n* Counterpicking champs. If you are playing ranked there is a chance that you will be able to make your choice and pick into fora. I would advise someone with short laning phase cooldowns (so you can full on engage when her abilities are on CD), and/or someone who can build tank in the case that she does end up strong. Think: Panth, Renek, Singed, Malph (her true damage passive is annoying, but if you are playing smart, you will be protecting your vitals).\n \n\n* Fiora works really well with attack speed. Build a randuins/ frozen heart (this also works really well when versing devourer junglers).\n\n\n* You can also build QSS to counter her ultimate (no ult = no team wide heal). Even if your champ isn't a QSS type of champ, suggest your ADC picks it up (ADC is most likely going to be targeted anyway, due to squish).\n\n\nWhile her abilities are strong (and her passive, very strong), Fiora has a lot of counter play. Her duelling capabilities also make her feel quite unique (which is something Riot aim to do).","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-03-18T03:48:38.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah fiora too strong, remove it. \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-18T03:11:52.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone champion is countered by another champion.\n\nNiche is the name of the game when it comes to how LoL is played.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-03-18T03:18:35.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=p6EPiQpq,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-03-18T03:11:52.190+0000)\n>\n> Everyone champion is countered by another champion.\n> \n> Niche is the name of the game when it comes to how LoL is played.\n\nexcept fiora, who doesn't have any counters, she only has checks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-18T00:55:52.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a champ gets remove just because one person doesn't know how to deal with it, then very soon we would have no champ left...
