Currently im silver 2 and hoping to get s1 or gold by the season start but autofill is decreasing the amount of games im playing. here&#039;s why:\r\n\r\nNOBODY WANTS SUPPORT: this is the main issue and why autofill was introduced in the first place but the problem is the dodge penalties are too small so when anyone gets autofilled to support and no one is willing to swap they dodge (including myself as i don&#039;t like playing support and i cant play it well well at all) -3 lp is better than losing 17 lp if you see yourself losing because you are the support \r\n\r\nMULTIPLE CHAMPION SELECTS: ok here is one that really annoys me i queue up with mid and top  (i can jg if needed) and get a champion select 9/10 times i get top (Primary roles should be weighted more but thats a rant for another time) but the person who got support also picked mid and top and usually they will say something like &quot;anyone want to swap?&quot; or &quot;mid or top want to swap&quot; which is absolutely fine but when they get the same answer 9/10 times &quot;No&quot; they dodge then i get another champion select and everyone is happy with their roles except no someone on the other team dodges this happens again and again until I get autofilled to support and guess what i do the same thing (refer to previous point) putting me on a 5 min wait and - 3 lp and this entire process will take about 15 - 20 mins\r\n\r\nmy point is autofill was brought into the game to lower queue times but it doesn&#039;t as it indirectly makes queue times longer because of everyone dodging and i dont blame them for dodging many people find support very boring or some people just are not good at it so they will take -3 lp and a 5 min wait over support anyday.\r\n\r\nBeing able to veto a role from autofill may help but we all know the one role everyone would veto would be support giving us longer queue times due to a lack of support players putting us back at square 1   \r\n\r\nRant over Thanks for reading \r\n\r\nI would really like to know what this is like at higher elos if someone is willing to comment Thanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-01T07:07:35.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great post! \n\nAuto-fill is affecting everyone negatively right now.

Sometimes you _immediately_ find out someone is a one trick or playing on a smurf account set up for only one role, which can cause frustration if a swap can't be agreed upon. I've even seen players rather arrogantly pick the champion they insist on playing but respect the role they've been autofilled (and win anyway). \n\nDodging over autofill can occur but I'd say that dodging because of a bad team composition or champion pick is far more likely. As for queue times, it really depends on the time of the day and how many support mains are online. As a support main myself, that means I've never really experienced unbearably long queue times when I've been online ; )","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-01T15:24:52.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I see all these people complaining about Autofill and I never get it.\n\nHowever I'm not willing to offer any advice because you said you **can't** support.
