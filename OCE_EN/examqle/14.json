Every time i play against him there is almost nothing you can do, sure you can push him around at lvl 1 - 2 but after that he will become unstoppable and im writing this post to see were the problem lies so let me get into it.  {{champion:105}} \n\npassive:  The only thing i find mildly annoying is the reduced damage from auto attacks it really dose not seem like much late game but is very noticeable early especially if you are playing an AP champion, this just makes him harder to harass so he will probably be able to stay in lane until lvl 3 and as i said before thats when he becomes unstoppable.        RAGE meter: 3/10 \n\nQ - very simple ability. the fixed distance dash is fine and can be predicted and outplayed with any mobility spell as it has a fair cooldown early and it doesnt really do a ton of damage as it only scales with 35% of his AP. never the less it is a point and click gap closer something that is very strong on many champions.  \nRAGE meter 4/10\n\nW - (this is were the fun begins -__-)  Ok this is a incredibly simple ability, your auto attacks deal a DoT over 3 seconds this scales with 45% of his ap now THAT WOULD BE FINE by itself a DoT with every auto attack  BUT it also scales with  (+ 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8% of the target&#039;s missing health) on top of the 45% of AP.  Percent missing HP with every auto attack and thats just the abilities passive when active your auto attacks deal even more bonus magic damage for 6 seconds this bonus scales with 30% of his AP so if he had 150 ap and auto attacked you once with the ability at lvl 1 he would deal 55 damage on hit and 87.5 damage over the next 3 seconds..  thats 142.5 magic damage with one auto (before resistances) and thats not even taking into account the percentage of missing HP so it would deal even more.      \nHOW TO BALANCE: now this is just a suggestion but in my opinion removing or just lowering the percent missing HP damage should balance the ability   \nRAGE meter 7/10  \n\nE - the bread and butter of fizz&#039;s entire kit. to break this ability down im going to do it piece by piece. \n\n* Fizz hops onto his trident towards the target location - gap closer that does not need a target.\n\n* becoming untargetable for 0.75 seconds - This is what makes people rage quit.... no matter what you do you cant hit him there is little to NO counter play \neven powerful targeted CC abilities like Vi&#039;s ultimate will be stopped  and in some cases put on cooldown just by pressing one button\n\n* before splashing onto the ground below him, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies and Slow icon slowing them for 2 seconds. - ok so after you become untargetable for what feel like 3 years you then do another dash to a location that does not need a target dealing a AoE burst in the location you chose, the damage on this thing is ridiculous  Magic damage: 70 / 120 / 170 / 220 / 270 (+ 75% AP)  the slow is also very annoying but i think thats not the problem.\n\n* SECOND CAST: Fizz immediately hops off his trident towards the target location, dealing magic damage to nearby enemies. - so fizz does not have to wait the full 3 years to deal tons of damage to you \n\nHOW TO BALANCE : ok hear me out rito pls, REMOVE THE UNTARGETABILITY!!! this is the only way to balance this ability, now... fizz will still have a crazy amount of mobility so he can dodge what ever skillshot anyway but it adds much needed counterplay so you can try and stop him so if you do manage to land a stun on him while this ability is active you are rewarded with fizz not one-shotting you :D. also it adds a level of skill to the fizz player who now has to time his jumps instead of not having to worry about it. \nRAGE METER 10/10\n\nR - ok this ability is annoying but the only complaint i have about this ability is the massive slow it give when it first hits you (oh and the hit box is just massive) if its going to knock you up it doesn&#039;t really need a slow also fizz has 3 gap closers so its not like you have much hope of gettting away anyway\nHOW TO BALANCE: remove or lower the initial slow so there is just a spec of hope of getting away.\nRAGE METER 7/10  \n\nIf you have read this all the way though Thank you and please note that all this is just an opinion and i ask that people respect that.\nleave a comment telling me how you think fizz should be balanced and have a great day &lt;3 {{champion:34}}","replies":[]}
