Ive had a look around and found heaps of stuff on it with little hotfixes for windows 10, p2p and ipv6 settings, and a whole bunch of other stuff that ive tinkered with, but NOWHERE have i seen a solid reply from Riot letting the community know what the go is...\r\n\r\nso my question is twofold, (A) Will riot acknowledge its a severe issue across the entire game?? (posts from EU and NA as well as OCE were found) and (B) when in the world can we expect some kind of peace of mind, not having to queue ranked in fear of absolute annihilation??","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-04T09:59:04.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
