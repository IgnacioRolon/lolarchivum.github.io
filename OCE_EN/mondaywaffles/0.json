However where Miss Fortune was going was not anything mentioned, but towards the area to where she could cash in her bounty.\n\nThe bounty board, the old stained paper that hung upon it. With heads and prices, all was tempting to Miss Fortune, as she torn off a dozen, she came to cash in one as well, as she had carried a sack, with crimson liquid staining the straw colored fabric, she placed it down upon a nearby barrel as she waited for the man who wanted their victim dead. As she waited she gazed out of the cove, and onto the blue crystal sea, the smell of salt struck her, making goosebumps crawl up her skin as the water wisped onto the shore, spraying her softly with delicateness. her mind was cast back, lost in thought.\n_____\nIt threw her back through her memories, the time she was on the island with her mother, helping her make flintlock pistols for paying reavers and pirates, with scars and faces she couldn&#039;t even recognize, they were all blurry to her except for one, a face she would never forget, the face of Gangplank, how he barged into the shop demanding her mother&#039;s finest pistols, the thought suddenly turned for the worse, as the beautiful own creations she uses, fired upon her mother, her screaming was silenced, the flames and heat she could almost feel like if it was touching her face right now, the lifeless expression of her mother and father, and her very own home, burning away to ashes and dust, and the laughter of a cruel and evil man, who spared the child for now. If only he knew it would come back to bite him when he least expected it.\n\nThe rarest of sights, the face of fear was on her face so brief, it was almost like you thought you saw it, but it was there, it showed anyone who was seeing Miss Fortune she wasn&#039;t a monster, but still human, someone who went through pain to who she is now. But nobody would be able to see this, especially the man creeping upon her. She didn&#039;t hear the man crept upon her, it was masked by her own thoughts and the sound of the sea, however she wasn&#039;t slow and she caught onto someone sneaking upon her, and with her grace, she pulled out her flintlock, aiming it directly to the man sneaking upon her, with the click of steel cocking back, and her finger fast as lighting and ready to pull on the hard cold steel trigger, she paused. It was the man who came to pay her for her bounty collecting, with a sack of leather, he loosened it slowly and showed her gleaming gold, shiny and eye-catching before quickly sealed by tight red linen.\n_____\nThe deed was done, she took the gold, he took the head, and with that she parted ways, she was already ready to head back upon the open sea and claim the dozen heads out there with prices too good for them, before she felt the rumbling of her stomach, a quick stop to the shop would all that be needed as she strutted down to find herself the local store.\n\nThe soft tinkle of a bell rang, as she bit into a peeled orange, the juice ran down her as she was satisfied with her purchase, a quick turn down onto the docks as she strut down the water-logged timber, passing sailors and reavers she already had spotted a bounty, an up and coming reaver, he was boasting how he was going to become Bilgewaters king, better than Gangplank ever was. His face was fresh, not a sign of a scar, nor of age or weariness, it was completely fresh and young and full of life.\n\n_He didn&#039;t hear the clicking of a flintlock pistol,_ a wisp of a bullet shot through him, an explosion of pain in his lower body, collapsing to his  knees, the men onboard jumping down into the water, for it was better than to be killed by Miss fortune, the man didn&#039;t hear anything, it was all going blank to him, he gasped as he stretched out for his gun, only to hear something nightmarish, the thudding of feet, he was violently rolled over, as the blurry vision of Miss Fortunes face was the only thing he could look at, she was looking at a bounty, letting it go as his eyes caught onto what was on it.\n_____\n&quot;2500 Gold, Dead Only.&quot; as the young pirates eyes glanced over to the end of Miss Fortunes barrel, and the last words he heard were poison to his heart, as Miss Fortunes lips curled into a smile, her cold eyes gazed into him, like he was just a rat caught in a snakes trap.\n\n_**&quot;Bang!&quot;**_\n\nMiss Fortune highjacked the ship as she set sailed upon the crystal blue sea, as the body floated in the bay of the water with the bounty attached to him, with Miss Fortunes doing written all over him, the blue water around the boy was crimson as the blood was spilled upon the murky water. But it wasn&#039;t strange for the Port City to hear the guns of Shock And Awe echo through the city, it was quite common to be exact, for it was just, an average day in the salty encrusted city of Bilgewater.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:49:20.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wanted a little more about the past you hinted at, about her mother and the island, but it's still very entertaining to see MF kicking ass.","replies":[]}]}
