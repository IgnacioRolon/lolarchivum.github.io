We don't have to wait another 20 minutes just for another game. on behalf of everyone everyone on the low priority queue that actually want to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-12T06:47:00.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's really buggy at the moment.\nIt is low priority for a reason.
