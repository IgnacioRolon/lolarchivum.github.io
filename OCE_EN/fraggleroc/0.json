Not a good experience. Usually the best thing to do is just mute the entire team and communicate through pings. If they rage/throw the game, just focus on yourself. You'll make mistakes, they'll try get you killed, but at the end of the game, it's just about you focusing on how well you're playing and how well you can read the in-game situation as the game progresses.\n\nIt's easy to say, I know, but with time you'll get used to it better :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"AugustNightmares","date":"2015-03-17T04:47:59.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once EVERYONE on my team dc'd except for me, so I told the enemy team and they just fast pushed and finished.
