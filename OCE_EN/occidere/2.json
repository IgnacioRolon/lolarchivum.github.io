If nothing has changed on your own network it might be an ISP issue.\n\nI'd suggest you run a [trace route to the OCE server](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) as your first step, and you could also look at the support page on [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\n\nLet me know how you go\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
