Then this happened...\r\n\r\nSo I went 11/5/14 as {{champion:24}} , and had the most gold in the team. Still no S rank.\r\nThis understandable, my score was decent but not really S rank worthy. \r\nWhat REALLY ticked me off was that 3 of the other members of our team received S ranks, our support even getting and S+\r\nI don&#039;t understand why a 9/7/7 {{champion:420}} with less gold than me should be granted an S rank while I don&#039;t receive one??\r\nPlus, our {{champion:81}} received one also, and he really did no better than I did, in fact, I would say he performed worse. He had one less death that me but I also had 4 more assists (and I had more overall gold)\r\n\r\nI understand that my CS wasn&#039;t the best, but considering that it was 95% jg farm and the game lasted less that 30 mins, I think it was still good enough. If the fact that the number of CS that I had was that big of an influence, I feel like the way these ranks are calculated need to be looked at/possibly changed.\r\n\r\n(Please note that I also got a quadra kill in this match, but it seems to me like multi kills have no effect on the overall rank)","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-06-10T01:19:26.449+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the boards, seriously. It has been explained **countless** times..\n\nHow many support {{champion:420}} have you seen? None? So this {{champion:420}} in your team was being compared to every other support {{champion:420}} (not a very large pool of results to compare to hey). For that champ in that role, that's probably a HUGE score\n\nWhereas you were being compared to every other jungle {{champion:24}}. And I can 100% tell you that I see HEAPS of jax junglers do WAY better than you.

You don't see supports with that much cs usually. Sure, its a bad measurement of skill, but its there. Of also would have counted his wards placed.
