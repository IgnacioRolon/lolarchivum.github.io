A recollection, perhaps. \r\n\r\nNothing more than a wisp of memory. \r\n\r\nWhen she had been a human &ndash; a little girl, barely into her fifteenth year of age &ndash; life had been&hellip; fuller. The world had been bigger. She remembers a man with a sword wrapped in the sharp beauty of a storm. &ldquo;Fiora,&rdquo; he whispers as crimson lifeblood pours out of a hole in his chest, &ldquo;Fiora, my daughter.&rdquo; Then she&rsquo;d been taken away by the men in the long, flowing cloths the colour of the blood that discoloured the bluesteel of her blade.\r\n\r\nHad she loved him? Yes. His death brought more anguish, more pain, more death, than her frail, ruined shoulders could withstand. Did the world have to pay? Yes. Maybe it did. Maybe, if she could show them his worth in blood, they would understand. When would they comprehend the meaning of loving one that was lost? \r\n\r\nFiora had been dead for a long time.\r\n\r\nWhy, was true death not when one&rsquo;s heart stopped beating, but when one&rsquo;s heart stopped beating for another?\r\n\r\nThe bleeping heart monitor screams in distress. _Why?_ The sword is calling for its owner. _Why?_ Her fingers are replaced by long, graceful, shiny things that reflect the harsh, broken light. _Why am I still alive?_\r\n\r\nA little girl, on the ground in front of her, crying crystal tears that fall to the ground like the dewdrops of the earliest dawn as the door hisses shut behind her, stemming the river of blood that she had harvested from the researchers&rsquo; bodies.\r\n\r\n_Fiora, my dear, Father has a present for you &ndash; here, a new doll. Do you like it? What will you call her?_\r\n\r\nThe blade&rsquo;s hilt is spattered with blood.\r\nSo are her hands.\r\nShe screams.\r\n\r\n_Fiora, my child, a respectable girl needs not meddle in the art of swordplay. Where are your dolls? Come along, now._\r\n\r\nA hand, greasy with engine oil, suffocates her. Fiora&rsquo;s sky-blue eyes shoot open &ndash; wrenching her from her nightmare &ndash; as her lungs shriek for air &ndash; for the air from her youth, back in the time in between. \r\n\r\nAir, unpolluted by the bright, sour, coppery, bitter smell of blood.\r\n\r\nThe Scientist smiles sadistically at her. &ldquo;Good morning, my _daughter_.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n_You are not my father._\r\n\r\nShe looks at him with all the hate in the world as her mouth opens in agony. No sound comes out. \r\n\r\n_My father is dead._\r\n\r\nFiora cries &ndash; tears long overdue. Tears long gone.\r\n\r\n_Why are you crying? Go play with your dollies like a good little girl._\r\n\r\nThe man in front of her is less of a human than she is &ndash; the irises of his eyes are the colour of stale milk, and his skin hangs from his crooked, warped frame like melted candle wax. He smiles again &ndash; baring haphazard, picketed teeth &ndash; and takes a long, thin drill from his pocket. Fiora looks away and bites her lip until it bleeds crimson tears as The Scientist rips into her arm &ndash; but she feels no pain; the only thing she can hear is the agonized screaming of metal against metal.\r\n\r\nHe can&rsquo;t seem to stop muttering, over and over and over again, like a mantra, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good enough. Not good enough. Not good enough.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFiora can&rsquo;t remember how long it&rsquo;s been since &ndash; since what? Since she&rsquo;d truly felt _alive?_\r\n\r\nThe Scientist grimaces at the glazed-over look that crosses her pale, impassive face and severs a cord in her arm with a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\nSevered. Disconnected. Paused. A full stop in a never-ending sentence. \r\n\r\nHe can&rsquo;t hear the heart rate monitor over his own paranoid mumbling. \r\n\r\n_Fiora Laurent, will you claim House Laurent and take up the blade in your father&rsquo;s name?_\r\n\r\n_No._ \r\n_I am not Fiora Laurent any more._\r\n\r\nShe&rsquo;s a product of a man&rsquo;s twisted fantasy, built in a facility six feet below the ground. Long forgotten, discarded among the dreams and memories, collecting dust.\r\n\r\nNow she knows she&rsquo;s not human. An oil leak in her shoulder spatters foul-smelling liquid onto her neck. She ignores it as The Scientist wipes it off with an engine cloth.\r\n\r\n_I wonder what the outside world smells like._\r\n\r\nSomething goes wrong, then.\r\n\r\nThe pain detectors, rusted and barely functional after centuries and centuries of neglect, rattle awake. The Scientist, engrossed in the dark landscapes of his own mind, doesn&rsquo;t look up.\r\n\r\n_I wonder what it&rsquo;s like out there._\r\n\r\nHe drills into her arm. This time &ndash; unlike the countless times he&rsquo;s violated her body &ndash; Fiora can feel it. A thin, jagged needle that worms into her flesh and blossoms into an explosion of pain. She screams &ndash; soundlessly.\r\n\r\n_I wonder what it&rsquo;s like to be alive._\r\n\r\nSparks litter the ground like tiny pieces of shattered fire-glass as The Scientist is abruptly ripped from his deranged muttering. He removes the drill from Fiora&rsquo;s arm, but by then, it&rsquo;s far too late. \r\n\r\nOne second too late in an overflowing river of time.\r\n\r\nThe lithium-ion batteries stored in the curve of her back send rivers of white electricity jumping across her cold skin. \r\n\r\nShe&rsquo;s scared. \r\n\r\n_What am I?_\r\n\r\nThe Scientist moves closer, tail between his legs, shouting incoherent words and holding his hands up in a pathetic expression of surrender. \r\n\r\n_What will I be?_\r\n\r\nWhite-hot light glows from her palms as she tears herself free of the bonds that have held her for centuries &ndash; even millennia. \r\n\r\n_How long has it been since I tasted fresh air?_\r\n\r\nHer eyes are flooded with purple light as The Scientist falls away from her like a snowflake caught in a blizzard. \r\n\r\nHis head hits the ground with a sickening thunk.\r\n\r\nFiora breathes in the contaminated air and flexes her hands. Except they&rsquo;re not of her flesh anymore &ndash; they&rsquo;re a beautifully crafted blackish-silver metal that moves like liquid on her skin. Fiora shuts her eyes and waits, seating herself on her throne of snarling coils and hissing pistons. She&rsquo;s not sure what she&rsquo;s waiting for, but she waits anyway.\r\n\r\nHer instincts are not wrong. \r\n\r\nThe double doors in front of her &ndash; plastered with the words _PROJECT: Fiora_ &ndash; are wrenched open by an elegant hand, clothed in orange-gold light. Fiora opens her eyes and takes in the harsh light of the outside world as steam &ndash; not blood &ndash; floods into the room.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fiora.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe voice sounds like warmth and light and stolid strength.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like the sun.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe person in front of her holds out a sword &ndash; a slim, deadly, beautiful thing that trails violet light. Fiora slices it through the air and marvels at the way it moves; like a knife through water.\r\n\r\nA familiar smile emerges from beneath the glowing mask. For a moment &ndash; just a moment &ndash; Fiora remembers something. \r\n\r\n_A shield &ndash; a sword &ndash; a golden set of armour &ndash; long, auburn hair trailing down wide shoulders &ndash; golden skin &ndash; the fierce glare of a great, blinding circle in the sky._\r\n\r\nIt remains just long enough for her to remember how to want, and then it&#039;s gone &ndash; erased from the plane of her memory. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come. You have been away for a long time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nOutside, in the hallway, there are more. More rooms. More people, from the time in between.\r\n\r\n_Lucian._\r\n\r\n_Leona._\r\n\r\n_Yasuo._ \r\n\r\n_Master Yi._\r\n\r\n_Zed._\r\n\r\nThe doors open.","replies":[{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T05:35:30.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy mother of...
