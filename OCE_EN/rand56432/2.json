(not if you keep indulging your self in OP-talk)\naltho, riven being at 53% is ridiculous for a \"mechanical champion\". yasuo is more forgiving against lowelo so to explain the winrate, but these \"mechanical\" picks being >50% wr in it self is something out of a fairytale. one where bronze riven have positive wr. its funny actually how people with more games on riven has less winrate then ppl who just picked him up. explain that atheist and Christians","replies":[]}]}
