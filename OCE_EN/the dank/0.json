I haven't been able to play for over 2-3 years now.\n\nEdit: Sorry I should have mentioned I have spoken with support and they have no idea. Looking for someone who has troubleshot the issue on their own.","replies":[{"poster":"XiaoZhengTai","date":"2019-11-08T10:25:20.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try modifying ur firewall level to low.\nOr have you updated ur computer these days?

One of the only things I haven't been able to do.\n5. Asus rt-ac68u\n6. Hardwired straight into the router.\n7.

So lost. It's most likely router issue but I don't know of any settings interfering with a wired-only connection.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-05T15:21:33.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid that's the end of my knowledge.
