The tournament has a $4PP entry fee or $20 per team and there will be a $250+ prize pool.\r\n\r\nWe will be recruiting over the next week and require players in all roles, we will be holding trials once we have enough. The only prerequisite is that you must have current residence in or close to Brisbane as it will be hosted at QUT Gardens Point. You will also need a significant amount of spare time as we will be training through scrims and flex often. If you think you might be interested in competing feel free to shoot us a message!\r\nP.S. This isn't going to be a one tournament wonder team, this will become the official Risen Academy roster.\r\n\r\nHere are some more details in regards to that tournament:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/270112187271203/\r\n\r\nHere is the link to our application for a position:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQCDgX8sdztc7beqJ-21s571pOoqdNs3wIXojb_6O86m3JNQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR0xR5PGSmaLjofXL88Zr72OojBbZeSAxVphpN1pe3COQd_cKeGA2wESUdA\r\n\r\nThankyou!","replies":[]}
