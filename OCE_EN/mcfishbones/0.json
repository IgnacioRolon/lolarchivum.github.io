I work full time and all i want to do when i get home is enjoy my free time playing league of legends ive been playing for over 4 years and the amount of respect and loyalty riot shows to me as a customer is disgusting. When i clearly see people on forums being given a benefit of the doubt and unbanned. I AM SO FURIOUS at the poor treatment/service riot has to offer. LIKE I SAID I AM INNOCENT. I COULDNT CARE IF YOU REMOVED MY RANK AND ALL MY STATS AND HEAVILY MONITORED OR FLAGGED MY ACCOUNT. I am getting alot of video proof of people reporting me after games for using 3rd party programs on another alternate account that i will later upload and show you RIOT employees that your tribunal system is really broken and somewhat does not work to its 100% potential. When i gather at-least 20 videos showing party players ganging up on me to get me reported. i am already halfway there. Riot i want immediate action and im sick of waiting 24 hours for a response.

I have been waiting for 13 days and made a new ticket. I want you to speak to them for me and this guy on our behalf and a request to lift the bans. We have been so sincere and would like some compensation and courtesy back. I did not get a warning and for two years of playing this game with no ban and chat restrictions we get a permanent ban. I don't care what anyone says this is not fair to the people who make one single mistake and a company doesn't realize all the good we are trying to do we really urge for your help please request them to give us a second chance to prove we wont do such things again look at our tickets if you want and request them for us we have waited so long. Regardless of the mistake we make, if you have been good, one fair go is all we ask for and that is so effortless and so easy to do. Out of all the 60 plus million people that play this, giving a second chance to a couple of sincere people does not sabotage anyone's gaming experience here we are not criminals.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-30T03:02:15.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were given 'one fair go'\nYou were given access to this game - and you were shown and agreed to the terms of access every week.\nOf.they give you another chance?

I'll need to know a bit more about what happened to help.\n\n+ _Chat logs and other evidence._\n If you've received chat logs from **Riot** please post them.

Everyone deserves a second chance regardless, Please help me and this guy i was begging in my ticket go look and see and all i get is effortless responses we put so much money into these accounts and riot should not treat customers like this i am getting tired of this 2 years with no ban and i get no second chance i want my account back as i have seen peoples bans get lifted straight away.

I'd be happy to get some **Riot**ers and emissaries to look over your case. Just follow the instructions I had in my original reply.\n\nBut keep in mind we really can't guarantee anything. Rules are rules, and unless you were banned for scripting, you should have received at least 1 warning/minor punishment, in some cases up to 3 warnings before a perma-ban.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MCFishBones","date":"2016-05-26T21:37:41.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its a shame riot does not have the decency to reply to this at all.","replies":[{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-27T01:57:40.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I don't know what to do anymore either it's too good to be true being sincere and honest gets you nowhere they should grant second chances to people who deserve them regardless of what mistake they make as a reward to give back to the community i'm just fed up with it now.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-30T02:58:54.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You proved that you are not sincere and honest when you took the actions that lead to being perma banned","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"x Y","date":"2016-05-26T10:17:13.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly agree and i feel you cause it's happening to me! It's been 12 days since i was permanently banned i was literally begging in my ticket and no customer should even begin to beg for a second chance? I thought riot should give second chances regardless everybody deserves them! if they do it again then yes ban them. I have never been banned for the 2+ years i have played and i got permanently banned and they wont undo it and they just ignore me and not give me a second chance to show them we wont do it again and this is over a game 12 days and i am still trying and waiting for a rioter to give us the second chance we deserve. We have never been banned and it's pathetic that customers get treated like this. I want immediate action for me and this guy as well cause this is not fair and i am getting the same responses. We have done nothing but be honest and sincere and this is how we get repaid. Humans make mistakes so give chances to people who want to make up for it.
