Sure you say they cause &quot;Degenerate play pattern for the opposing team&quot;. But really, why give us a ban phase if you&#039;ll ultimately say no to certain champs. If we the community decide &quot;hey, karthus and teemo are annoying as Sh!t to play against&quot; then that&#039;s what the banning phase is for, teemo has sooo many counters it&#039;s not funny, and Karthus - if people buy an {{item:3157}} or a {{item:3026}}, they good. If a certain champ breaks the servers, I would understand the Permaban, but this is because you arbitrarily decided that you didn&#039;t like them in OFA, so you removed them saying &quot;their not good for you&quot; like an overprotective mother. The same logic could be applied to almost any champ in the game, so why not ban those too Riot, why not ban every champ in the game besides Yorick. God know&#039;s he could use more play time.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-17T14:42:13.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> because you arbitrarily decided that you didn't like them in OFA, so you removed them saying \"their not good for you\" like an overprotective mother.\n\nI'm pretty sure **most** people didn't enjoy playing against Karthus or Teemo in One for All which meant they were practically permabans anyway. As such, I doubt the decision to disable them was ever going to be a very unpopular one, or one that has much to do with Riot forcing their opinion on us but reinforcing the majority's. Unless these champs were nerfed in some way, which would most likely leave them far less satisfying _and_ oppressive in comparison, it might be for the best they stay locked away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-17T08:42:02.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Karthus a lot, and you can regularly get his ult doing upwards of 1000. When there 5 of them, thats 5000 damage to everyone on the enemy team (most tanks only get 4000, at a stretch even in late game) and if you use Hourglass on the First one, then the next 4 will still decimate you. and there is no AD hourglass, meaning AD champions will be forced to buy an AP item as well as a GA, and if youre an AD champion and your whole teams first two items are Hourglass and GA... thats a free win to Karthus.\n\nits basically a free ace every 3 minutes, (unless you rush GA which has never been a smart move and puts your whole team at a disadvantage, and even with GA you still get Aced 2 out of every 3 ults)\n\nAs for Teemo, unless you stay in lane, behind minions, you WILL die, you cant take Dragon or baron or anything. Not to mention the 12.5 second blind (which if you are vsing an AD team is a free win.\n\nSo just like Katarina on hexakill, people will just permaban them anyway, meaning you have less actual tactical bans. \n\nNo one wants LESS bans.","replies":[]}]}
