However, due to the &quot;opposites&quot; nature of the system, you can _not gain damage by building defensively_.\r\n\r\nThe second idea would be an ultimate. Now the numbers would be tricky to balance but the key idea is that of possession/appearance change. Here  is a clunky, potential outline :\r\n\r\n_On all casts_  blinks to target (either short range targeted or long range skill shot) and stats stay the same. Duration varies, medium cooldown _On ally cast_   swaps appearance with ally (not unlike that black market item is the corresponding gamemode), ally gains movespeed               \r\n_On enemy cast_ Swaps champions, but not level or statistics (if you have full ad and swap with an Annie you still have no ap, if different level, you                          get the same spell leveling order you had on your own champion, otherwise, you gain theirs).  \r\n_On Neutral cast_ possesses neutral creature (if baron or dragon, gain appropriate abilities) and moves around in their skin(baron exception) and can cast spells while in, for example, minion form (baron and dragon exceptions).  Maybe gains small buff depending on which creature inhabited.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Tl;Dr The point behind this is basically, turn into minion, sneak up, destroy/cc/nuke (depends on the rest of the kit).\r\n**\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Idea is a long lasting skill shot silence and a skill shot heal. Both would be super powerful because of their skill shot nature (self would be healed for medium amount when cast) Maybe have burst potential with the right build.\r\n\r\nPossible appearance/lore :\r\nExiled king of the fae - a now virtually extinct race, raised on the streets of Noxus and thirsty for revenge by taking over the world of the &quot;usurpers&quot;.\r\npan-like appearance, male.\r\n\r\nA bit overloaded perhaps but any interesting concept if anyone wants to develop it further...\r\nSo yes, potential shape sifting champion.","replies":[]}
