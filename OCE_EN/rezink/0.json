Why do we have the shit mode of ARAM full time... a mode with 1 lane and random champ picks.. but we don't have a full time TT queue it blows my mind. \n\nYou guys have Supposedly been collecting data  for the last 2 years.. so so what did you find out? Its too expensive? The 2 min queues are too long? WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?\n\nI'm tempted in transferring because I realize OCE in never going to get full time TT. Well that free server transfer was such a great deal. Free transfer to a 'beta' server so we buy transfers back after getting sick on playing on a lesser server, which has been in BETA for like 2 years.\n\nRant over, bet I am not going to get a reply took me 6 weeks of spamming to get the last one not sure I have the same amount of dedication this time.\n\nThumb this shit up if you want to help out the bros from down under :/","replies":[{"poster":"Supawesome","date":"2016-01-12T09:06:54.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why Dota 2 is better. \n\nleave LoL and play Dota 2 i made the change 6months into waiting. i dont regret 1 day :)","replies":[]}]}
