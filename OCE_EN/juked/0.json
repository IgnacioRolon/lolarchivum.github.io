Because of the drastically increased CDR Garen's \"Judgement\" can be cancelled for the \"instant cooldown\" only 0.2 seconds after it's cast. By spamming the E button (or whatever key the player has their third basic ability bound to) it's possible to gain as many as 5 ticks of damage per second, rather than the usual 2. *Note: I'm semi-confident it's 2 ticks per second after a quick Google search, however that may be inaccurate.*\n\nIt's *not* a bug because everything is working as it should. It could, however, be considered an exploit from a certain perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"Juked","date":"2016-05-25T02:53:05.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahah very true well my mistake i thought it was a bug from hearing it around. either way its still pretty strong :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-24T13:59:32.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not bad but still not the most OP.
