A long password is better than a random one, most passwords are \"guessed\" by computers randomly putting letters together, so something really long like \"thecowwenttothemarketandboughtsomehayfordinner\" is a lot more secure,takes much longer to crack and is more memorable than \"a@17Hj\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}
