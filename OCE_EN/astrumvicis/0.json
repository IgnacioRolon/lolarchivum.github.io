I went to make a team today and there is nothing on the schedule, no ability to start a team and nothing showing up when I try to search online for a reason. On the NA boards people still seem to be actively looking to make teams and recruiting. Did i miss something here or is OCE getting left out somehow?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-29T11:31:03.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clash was last weekend for OCE so you missed this run.\n\nClash was originally designed to be a semi-regular event, but with all the hiccups along the way things got quite delayed. The tournament we just had was the first official not-beta tournament, so hopefully, that means Clash will be fairly regular from here on (subject to how well things go on other regions), but as far as I'm aware we don't have an exact timeframe for when the next one will be running as of yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Astrumvicis","date":"2020-02-29T08:43:40.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Friends have suggested that it might be running on a bi-weekly schedule based on information from the original release of clash.
