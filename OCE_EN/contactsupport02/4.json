And so does shen in general.\n\nEdit:  Surgeon Shen is now best Shen skin rest are garbage ty riot. Warlord shen was iconic. ty for ruining it.\n\nI really don't know why all owned skins of visually reworked skins don't just auto refund and give you a notice when you log in to client, you are given back the RP you payed, with which you can re buy the skin or if you now longer like it, (and wouldn't buy it it in it's current state) can just spend the RP on something else, you know Riot, common courtesy.","replies":[]}
