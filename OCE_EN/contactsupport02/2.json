Riot already has this all calculated out that the higher point regions are IMPOSSIBLE to hit by just banding up and playing together, this is going to net them hundreds of thousands of dollars, it&#039;s just so disgusting will you EVER do anything ANYTHING that isn&#039;t heavily financially driven.\r\n\r\nAnd the rewards aren&#039;t even GOOD, mystery champion, seriously  MYSTERY CHAMPION? that could be fking 450ip champion? are you SERIOUS? at least give people the choice, pool party icon, another useless icon, pool part minions, couldn&#039;t really care, and for high level players you are anal about csing will only find this annoying if anything,  55 million points free mundo skin, I&#039;m already assuming this is basically impossible to hit unless the player base spends like $500k+ dollars on mystery gifts\r\n\r\nNote: I&#039;m not saying Riot could start giving people free sht constantly, but in like the 5 years this game has been live they just do nothing that isn&#039;t blatantly profit based, hell they gave us like a week of group bonus ip which they send might be permanent then fked it off because clearly it was going to hurt their profits slightly despite the fact it was clearly bringing people together to play 5&#039;s, (if it wasn&#039;t then there was no reason to remove it) \r\n\r\nThis is why I despise this company, even Jagex made more efforts with its community in the early years.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-13T02:44:39.163+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"money runs the world, get used to it. league is there biggest source of income, so of course they're going to be profit driven. they're not a non-profit organisation. fucking dumbass.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-13T03:26:12.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nKAYnQ4b,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-06-13T02:44:39.163+0000)\n>\n> money runs the world, get used to it.\n\nWhile money does run the world, but it's running a little bit too much imo.","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-06-13T05:23:08.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ every single thing they do is to maximize profit, they don't even do double ip weekends, even cash grab shooters do that, LEL, but that's not so much what I'm referring to, they make something like this pool party thing, a chance where the community can work together to earn points, but they can't help turning it into a cash grab, there's no veteran skins of any sort for long term players, they literally don't care for ANYTHING that doesn't make them money.

Player incentives and loyalty programmes are proven through and through. As in, gamblers are going to gamble regardless. League players are 8/10 going to keep playing regardless. Whether it's your loyal patrons or your playerbase -Dangling the occasional carrot in front of them (although they know it isn't worth) is a proven businiess mechanic which seldom fails.\n\nTLDR- You can cry as much as your broke bumbum likes.
