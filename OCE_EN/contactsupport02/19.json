Like does anyone like Kayle? Does anyone appreciate kayles existence in this game? I've seen challenger players ban Kindred just becasue she's so fking annoying to deal with.\n\nTahm is just disgusting, he is broken, like not saying overpowered or under powered just straight broken, as I said before I don't know how this made it to live, it is so fking obnoxious in top lane, or any role really. like he barely offers anything yet he's payed top lane because he's just so fking annoying. and his just genuinley a pain to a deal with an will just end up poking and diving 90% of top laners while just ignoring their dmg/towers dmg with his two hp bars. forcing someone to come and deal with this fking abomination of a champion.\n\nAnd illaoi, I mean this champion is just so useless, she has a small niche against melee champions, anything ranged is jsut going to destroy her, she can cheese some melee champions but against a competent opponent she's pretty well useless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-04T11:51:26.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I actually killed kindred with {{champion:6}}  spport in a game not long ago.\n\nShe popped Ult, I popped noxian c charge took a bit of damage and landed a couple of autos, stood back  a bit she left her Ult by a fraction to try and land something, acid Hunter with tlords decree , dead \n\nPlz don't knock the crab if you've never played him.","replies":[]}]}
