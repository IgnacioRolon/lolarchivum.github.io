(rant)","subforum":"GD","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only dragons that are actually good buffs are the first and third, the dmg stats and a bit of movement speed, they aren&#039;t amazing but are worth it, the 2nd and 4th are near useless, 2nd is completely useless, little bit of dmg to structures its essentially useless.\r\n\r\nAnyway I just watched my ezreal go to second dragon instead of just killing two open inhibs while the enemy team baron&#039;d, I even TF ulted to show him there was no one defending it they were all baron, two open inhibs.\r\n\r\nLike the frustration I see people contesting dragons like the second dragon when it&#039;s risky it&#039;s literally pointless the most valuable dragons are first and fifth, it is not worth contesting dragons if its even slightly risky,  they are essentially worthless, people need to fking understand this, the main reason to take a dragon, is if you still need the first or you think the game may go long so you won&#039;t to either keep the chance of fifth dragon open for you or deny it for the enemy.\r\n\r\nPlease, just think, if you can take a second dragon or one tower, every time, take the tower, second dragon or 30 cs? take the cs, understand how worthless dragon really is, please, if you&#039;re going to play ranked just understand what the objectives actually give to your team, right now it&#039;s basically like &quot;DRAGON DRAGON GOTTA GET DRAGON LCS KOREAN FAKER DARGON MUST HAVE IT OBJECTIVE CONTROL&quot; Basically the thought process of mid high plat ranked players. /rant","replies":[]}
