Anyways, in season 2 worlds, SEA won, they won worlds, TPA and guess what, they are now a wildcard region, they WON WORLDS, they beat the BEST KOREA had, the BEST CHINA had, they beat EVERYONE. And now guess what, they are a WILDCARD region, there is literally zero chance that Oce will ever be on any sort of world stage other then wild card, and maybe worlds if they qualify through wildcard, which they probably won&#039;t, since SEA, Brazil, Turkey, fking even Russia are simply better.\n\npretty much, every single team sport, Australia can&#039;t compete on the world stage, bar a few, like hockey, swimming i guess even though thats more of a solo thing that Australia has always been heavily invested in, um i dunno what else there is, maybe beach volleyball? \n\nI can&#039;t even think of a way, that Oce can ever become competitive in esports, it just isn&#039;t possible, it&#039;s like if you made a team play in silver ranked teams to prepare for a match against diamond ranked teams, even if we do have five freakish players (which we don&#039;t) who are near world stage level who are they supposed to practice against? There is no way for them to prepare for what they are going to face, it&#039;s almost like playing a new champion for the first time, they may have mastered beating oce teams but as soon as you throw them in a different environment they&#039;re trying to learn on the fly, and there&#039;s no way for them to access this level of play within Oce.\n\n I really feel that&#039;s how it&#039;s gone for Chiefs, look at them, they flawless&#039;d the last split and are flawless this split, except for 4Not, which I wouldn&#039;t even be surprised if Riot told them to throw that game to bring some attention to the scene, but it can basically be disregarded as a loss since 4not are now gone and it is far more likely chiefs just slacked off knowing they were home and hosed rather then 4not legitimately outplaying, smarting and beating them.\n\nbefore we even consider facing world class teams on a strategic level just blatant mechanical flaws need to be iron&#039;d out of near EVERY SINGLE PLAYER, like every single opl game you will see some sort of key ability just straight up wiffed, e.g a sejuani ult, or something along those lines, every single game it happens, it could be put down to a lack of focus, or just the fact that every single oce team make these mistakes occasionally it&#039;s just the standard. I think what teams should be aiming for and riot oce as well is some sort of way to give the oce region international exposure as often as possible, they could sit here and play in their OPL crap for 400 years and get nowhere, like when NA teams just take month long trips to korea, they face korean teams, they play the solo q, they film it watch it go over it, and push their region forward.\n\nHonestly I don&#039;t even give a fk about the oce pro scene, but this is what I see needs to happen, Chiefs have peaked and they&#039;ve got nothing to improve on, they need something to punish all of their mistakes and crush their strategies so they are forced to make new ones and notice their mistakes as they get punished, oce doesn&#039;t seem to know what it is, but the international teams do, and it&#039;s commonplace, whether it&#039;s just mechanical errors that aren&#039;t being punished, or just straight strategic flaws that breeze through here in oce but would get stopped dead by any international team, idk, and I don&#039;t really care.\n**\ntldr: Chiefs are hands down the highest level Oce has, they are basically flawless in both splits, it was more then likely that 4not game was intentionally thrown to be some epic plot twist to get more viewers, and even if it wasn&#039;t the loss is meaningless, Chiefs beat everyone in oce and get stomped at wildcard, they have peaked and they need to play more international games to get better, they are at the point where they don&#039;t need to beat oce teams, they need to beat themselves, and then beat what beats themselves and so on and so fourth. Chiefs can do it, they have already proven they can by flawlessing Oce, but how can they possibly get the international exposure to learn what their weaknesses are? and that&#039;s where this region is doomed, and the story is the same for almost every other wild card region.**","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-20T05:22:01.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stopped reading when you said: \"Australia can't compete on the world stage\"\n\nIt's OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-06-20T23:54:39.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TouchMyKimchi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uXjUJ9Er,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-20T05:22:01.590+0000)\n>\n> Stopped reading when you said: \"Australia can't compete on the world stage\"\n> \n> It's OCE.\n\nWho cares?

But that doesn't mean they aren't currently out there to be found in the near or distant future.\n(To suggest it's the Australian server because of the physical location of the server is absurd ie: For EUW can all summoners outside of Amsterdam not be included?

( i'll make a paragraph on this point in the next section)\n\n**Outside invitational and revenue generation**\n-----------------------\n\nEvery time we create an event in OCE its instantly sold out and people will swarm it and get involved, it would be great to create our own EVENT for international teams to come and play.  get them into our soloQ and Russell some feathers and lift the bar. even if our teams don't win, they will get the crowd cheering them on and also allow OCE players to experience and possibly meet their favourite international players. it doesn't need to be huge, maybe a team from NA and one from EU or maybe even the other wildcard regions..\n\nBring them down for a holiday, they get exposure and at the same time the whole thing can be streamed.\n\n**I have a ton of ideas on what we can do.. but being realistic it comes down to have much money riot is willing to throw at it, and how much revenue can be generated.**\n\nWe can learn quite alot from international temp houses being made and used to offer outside teams a holiday destination.\nultimately i also think we need to evolve as well..\n\n**\nPlayer Development**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\ni think our pro scene splits should be best of B03 not B01, this is something even NA is having issues with atm, and i dont think its a good thing to follow them in this regard.\n\n* More Devlopment and mini ametur tournaments which consist of B03\n* More focus on getting soloQ players into ranked teams\n* More clans \n\nThese last point might sting abit\n\n\n* SoloQ needs to be taken more seriously, it needs harsher punishments, the biggest problem is we've had it too easy and most players arent scared because the most they have ever heard of happening is a chat ban, which they actually don't even mind, The behaviour curve needs to be adjusted and improved, too much griefing, trolling and people being closed minded.\n\nthis gets worse as you reach the top of the ladder because the playerbase is smaller, most players diamond+ know of at least half a dozen players you need to avoid, most will dodge but that even doesn't always work because you will just get them again, due to the Q size.\n\n* Buddy boosting needs to stop, it really does. its a huge problem and has now reached the point where there is such a difference in player ability is pretty noticeable across not just high elo, but mid and low elo as well, this hinders player development which will ultimately effect the player base in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**I think we can be better, but i think we have also come a very long way, and i think there will be more and more added to our region as time goes on.**","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-21T04:31:48.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top notch post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-06-21T11:14:55.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Australia can win anything in the pool. \n\nTherefore, pool party skin team will win worlds.\n\nJob done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-06-20T04:07:03.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Side note: there's also the blinding issue of any world class Oce player immediately being snapped up and shipped off to NA/EU, but that's not much of a worry, we will likely never have a player of that level.
