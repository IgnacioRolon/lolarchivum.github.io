And believe playing poorly, or intentionally feeding, is _deserving_ of serious verbal abuse that the creators of the game should actually condone. \n\n... lol.","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-09-19T06:10:08.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the main point you should take away is he got banned for some abuse, which was directed at a player being a cnt, and abuse is as simple as muting someone and it's gone, whereas, players who intent feed like this malphite do not get banned (the malphite in vid wasn't banned) back when I played league, you could tell me to go kill myself, hope my family gets cancer, etc. etc. whatever you want i really don't give a fk what you say as long as you contribute to me winning the game I honestly could not care less, might report someone for saying that depends on how I feel but I'll probably forget by the end of game and be happy with the win.\n\nNow if someone was intent feeding, trolling, or hell in ranked just playing badly my frustration would grow, very, very fast. (the main reason i quit ranked and this game due to how enraging it is that and it just became extremely redundant and repetitive, it isn't fun it simply makes people angry, and I have confirmed this with many other players)\n\nBefore playing league of legends the idea of getting banned for abusing someone was just so foreign to me, like I hadn't even considered why you would abuse anyone on an online game or that it was even a problem, until I played League of legends.\n\nLike for example I have recently gotten into Diablo 3 and played easily well over a 100 hours of it in the last month+ and I have not been abused by anyone at all for anything, why? Because the game is simply fun, and if someone is trolling around game play wise (which doesn't happen) I can just kick them, or leave and find a new party.\n\n**Anyway this reply got very long winded, the tl;dr you can just mute someone abusing you, you cant mute a troll or a feeders gameplay, focus should not be on banning ppl who abuse people, focus should be on banning trolls feeders etc.**\n\n that will naturally bring verbal abuse down more then banning ppl for abusing EVER could, and I think this is the main point dunkey is bringing up, and when Dunkey said the only fun in this game was sht talking people, I understood this completely towards the end when League was really getting redundant and boring for me a lot of the fun was just being an all chat troll, not necessarily abuse, but just smart ass trolling, when I killed someone, when someone killed me, whenever and it was simply because thats all I enjoyed in the game anymore and I hadn't quite realised it yet. \n\nI'd just like to clarify the point, I didn't 'quit' exactly I just 'stopped' like i got to a point where I'd think I feel like playing a game, lets play some league then 15 minutes in or so, I was just fighting the urge to afk, no because someone abused, not even because people were necessarily trolling or feeding just because it had become sooo boring, it just wasn't what the game used to be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-19T05:47:40.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with how he treats people, \"scum-%%%%ing bastard\" isn't something I'd ever think of saying. EVER. It's good he got banned for saying stuff like that.\n\nBut he has a lot of good points about the gameplay, a lot of games I play I see people doing stupid stuff or *trying* to make the team fail. When it's on my team I want to kick their butt, when it's on the other team I feel sorry for those guys. Yes, it's wrong to abuse them for it, and in the end it only makes the game worse, but issues on both sides of the fence are driving a lot of people away, myself included.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-19T06:58:30.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen this video at least 6 times on NA Board already (that's only counting the ones I noticed).\n\nNot to mention you're like 1 week late lol.\n\nLet's overlook the intentional feeding guy for a second here and only consider whether or not there is a case where an over-the-boundary verbal beating is justified.\n\nThere is none, hence bans are justified.","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-09-19T11:56:55.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why you're talking about the ban as that was not the truth that was spoken, the truth is that this game is sht, and I haven't played this game for months, but when I saw this vid I wanted to make a thread. like the summary of how essentially every league of legends game unfolds is brilliant, the fact the game simply isn't a fun game to play, it's a tedious, redundant, snowbally game that has very little reward for individual excellence, it didn't always used to be this way but it's what it has become.\n\nAs for the ban, it could go either way, you can look at it as if \"well he abused someone therefore he gets banned\", or you can get real and realise that the only reason he was toxic was because that person was doing everything in his power to intentionally ruin a game, now I'm not Riot, I don't decide how they ban, but you only need the slightest drop of common sense to realise that if you ban the reaction and not the catalyst you aren't going to stop the reaction. Riot and it's pussycore/troll community are to stupid to realise this/just don't care.\n\nBan verbal abusing people that's fine, but the PRIORITY, should be troll, feeders, afkers etc. And right now, there is literally ZERO effort to stop these players, for me, despite all these increased punishments the game is no less toxic from when I first started playing in season 2, yet in season 2, a chat restriction didn't exist, and people were dealt with via tribunal. You know I literally fear to offend anyone in the slightest way when I play league because if I do they will report me and once you get a certain amount of reports you are just instantly chat restricted, whether or not those reports had any validity.","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-22T10:30:52.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From your large slab of text, it seems you dislike Riot much more than the game itself.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-22T07:14:15.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm enjoying the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Foxfire Ahri","date":"2015-09-20T00:14:24.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wonder if the Malphite got banned too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-19T06:15:27.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you quit why do you still come here?","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2015-09-19T11:58:57.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
