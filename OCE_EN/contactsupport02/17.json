But now I&#039;m forced to pick two roles and sit in 10 minute queue times. \r\n\r\nFor anyone that liked filling this system is rubbish. And yea 10 minute queue times, they are really a massive time sink. \r\n\r\nI feel like in giving people lots of control over what they play the teams have become more in cohesive as ever, there is no point even showing what champ you&#039;re going to play beforehand because hardly anyone is going to adapt to what the team needs/wants they just queue up for the same two roles every game and instalock the same thing every game. And as for skill level since people are supposed to be getting their &quot;main&quot; really haven&#039;t seen an increase in skill, still see the same lee sins not building the warding enchant, top laners not using their tp properly e.g grouping while their tp is up while enemy top is splitting taking free turrets, supports still can&#039;t support, adcs are still bad, I have seen literally no skill level increase at all.","replies":[]}
