I didn&#039;t follow the voting because I don&#039;t really care, but I was expecting swiffer 100%, Carbon didn&#039;t surprise me for some reason people like him I have no clue, he&#039;s probably one the least entertaining most boring people I&#039;ve ever seen in the league &#039;pro&#039; scene or just in general. (he&#039;s also bad) \n\nR.I.P Oce.\n\nOh my, and Destiny as sub, this server is beyond redemption.

And Raydere+Egym were so popular that the other chiefs missed out. This lead to a trickle down effect for the top lane, because the next two popular players were ChuChuz and Carbon in their positions, so no more Legacy players could be on the team. Ryoo got a few votes and out of the rest of the players (not Chiefs or Legacy), was the most popular top lane pick, so he made it into the squad.\n\nI wouldn't say that OCE is trash, we just have a lot of drafting and middlegame strategies to work on. They tried to make Kog'Maw work but their team composition was just out of whack. Like Spawn said, in one of the games they should have given the flex pick Ryze to Ryoo, and picked a Lulu for ChuChuz to make that composition work. \n\nCarbon was perhaps trying too hard, I dunno, he made some bad plays, but it happens. Raydere wasn't so impressive in the last game against Turkey, he was constantly taking poke from the Miss Fortune. Thought Ryoo, EGym and ChuChuz had a reasonable series.\n\nI think I picked Minkywhale (top), Spookz (Jungle), Swiffer (Mid), Cardrid (ADC), and Nada (support) as my choices, but EGym and Raydere just had way too much of the vote, for any of those to make it into the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-28T01:57:34.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Japanese are rich.\n\nEducate yourself on peoples cultures before you talk please.\n\nWatching SKT at worlds was demoralizing. They've been nerds for a lot longer than we have - as a society and growing with it and having it around them puts them at an insane advantage (China etc) - they were paying 10$ for t1 1MB/s internet when we were paying 600$.\n\nAmerica are a corporate giant and they themselves got destroyed because of this. It might have taken a while for it to present itself but when they formed the company and had all the love in the world in America, it's no surprise they won at some point. But still Azubu smashed them etc.\n\nLooking at the competing countries, a lot of them are demoralized because of the cultural and technical disadvantages and there are plenty of real world problems.\n\nAustralia is a spoilt country now but they haven't been for very long and there are a lot of people striving for greatness around the world and a lot of people that are on a similar level and when these teams meet they clash hard and fast and it is all over and will often be a landslide game after game after game.\n\nThere's too much involved to really discuss but can you just please stop trashtalking OCE.\n\nYou're not trashtalking famous people or our Champions, you're trash-talking the underdogs and it's almost as filth as the Internation Wildcards Allstars Chat was when I took a peek. Think about these people before you start talking them down. Take a look at the trash on Twitch chat before you join them because they are the scum of the Universe and it is an embarrassment for the human race and what youre saying is bordering on being similar to them and their twisted messed up attitudes.
