I've played since mid-season 2 and climbed all the way from 1100 elo to 1700 so I consider myself quite experienced with the game. Although I am a mere lowly ranked player, I have supported a friend, a challenger ADC in some of his ladder games. \n\n1) Know your match-up\n\nSome ADCs + support combo in the simplest way, will destroy you. I'm too lazy to list it but you can pretty much be the judge of this through the amount of poke/cc/burst each champion has. Experience would help. This would also dictate your play style.\n\nie. Don't go aggressive as {{champion:67}} + {{champion:111}} vs. {{champion:96}} + {{champion:40}} (unless you get a REALLY good catch)\n\n2) Itemization\n\nOutside of the lane phase, item prioritization matters A LOT. I can't emphasize this enough. Although ADC is a pretty one-dimensional role, choosing to buy {{item:3153}} over {{item:3072}} can be very game changing. Online build guides can help you out on this.\n\n3) Positioning + core mechanics\n\nThis is arguably the hardest thing to master as an ADC. Where you stand, when to auto, and when to walk away/towards. This is a skill you need to learn yourself as it mainly comes with experience. \n\nie. When teamfighting as {{champion:67}} , choosing to stay in stealth and moving a few steps (when ulting) over attacking instantly can be a detrimental choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"heartbr0ken","date":"2015-08-23T09:11:03.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the secret tip, that pro adc's use all the time.\nThey will hate you for using this tip:\n\n> _Don't be salty to your support._\n\n/thread","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-23T03:20:12.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok, i mean i dont have a rank but i watch a lot of lcs, i know my shit whether or not i myself can execute it personally, but ok, im not gold so.....ill just shut up :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gloomies","date":"2015-08-23T03:22:55.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha ill listen anyways i guess :P","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-23T04:15:05.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol. well i dont know what you know but you might wanna get into attack moving/attack move click if you dont do that already, thats the biggest tip for outputting the most damage per game\n\nits better to just not push the wave (so only last hitting), unless you can get away from a gank easily without summoners, or if you're sivir who can clear the wave ez with WQ\n\nany increase of constructive communication with your support is helpful, try and be assertive since everyone is easy to piss off on the internet\n\nalways upgrade yellow trinket if your support isnt warding heavily or get red trinket to help clear.....or blue to check objectives or brushes. pink wards are good too\n\ni dont know how often you buy last whisper but its undoubtedly the most effective armour pen item in the game, especially at level 18\n\nyou might want a youmuus on someone who is vulnerable and/or benefits a lot from attack speed like twitch and ashe\n\nif your lane/any lane you plan on going to is pushed too far up, like to around enemy inner turret you should farm in the jungle instead as you're usually the most vulnerable champ in your team","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-23T01:20:27.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't spam auto attacks on the minion wave unless you know you won't get ganked.\n\nAnd wander around into a comfortable spot before right clicking the enemy tank and going AFK.\n\n\n\nJks, use your trinket and keep in mind that laning phase is mainly based on what the supports do. There is very little you can do to kill their support or ADC if yours doesn't help (so just farm), unless either you or the jungle are challenjour smurfs or the jungler camps your lane and lets mid feed. On the other hand, if you're not doing well and have a great support, the support can CC and let you right click them till they b or die.","replies":[]}]}
