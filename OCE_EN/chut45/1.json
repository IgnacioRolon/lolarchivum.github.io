I have both a windows 7 laptop and a mac os x computer (yosemite version) and I have been experiencing high ping and FPS while in game. This has been happening since the Kalistar patch. However another issue is delays . What I mean is whenever I right click or press a button on my keyboard it doesn't react/detect fast enough and my champion just stands there for 4 seconds and then it does something. Basically its like a  pause and play.Where it pauses for 4 seconds or 5 seconds and then after it allows me to play. But the issue happens frequently and it annoys me.  As this is happening I am unable to view other parts of the map and I can't move my screen to see if others are experiencing this. \n\nI have been researching and so far I found someone thats facing a similar issue.  here is the link http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=87461\n\n A quote from the link which seems to relate to my post \n\n> I don't know if its exactly the same as your issue from reading your post but I have been disconnecting at least 2 times a game for 3-5 seconds before it returns. I have no idea what would be causing this. I thought I wouldn't mind it and it would probably get fixed eventually but its already cost me some games by disconnecting in crucial teamfights.\n\nPlease try and fix this ASAP. \n\nThanks\nChut45","replies":[{"poster":"Trikyi","date":"2014-11-27T07:28:38.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes this problem is also a issue for me.
