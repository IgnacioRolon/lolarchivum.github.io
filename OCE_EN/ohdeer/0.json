It's also worth considering that some things like threats *are* in fact a crime.\n\nRiot has the right to moderate the game the way they see fit since it's their game and all. Being a business they are going to moderate the game in a way that makes the majority happy since it makes that majority more likely to spend money and/or spread the game and introduce new people. They are also going to moderate to their M rating.\n\nAs players, we agree to follow a code of conduct in order to play the game. Fail to do so and you lose the right to play the game, except Riot is lenient enough to put the consequence on the account rather than the player unless there is actual criminal activity involved.\n\nAlso, you don't get punished just for cursing.","replies":[{"poster":"ZefLyf","date":"2019-07-18T06:06:39.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"Riot is lenient enough to put the consequence on the account rather than the player unless there is actual criminal activity involved\"\nWell that is provably false, ip bans are a thing, and have been given to toxic players. Not that that is relevant to this thread.\n\n\"you don't get punished just for cursing.\"\nYou get punished for being reported for cursing. All riot does is use a filter to match words and phrases to reports and you get banned. They are unable, or unwilling, to catch inting and griefing so they rely on a 2 bit algorithm to flag naughty words. The 2% wr nunu is all you need to look at to confirm that. It is completely worthless to a player base who all have access to tools they can use to censor for themselves.\n\nYou want to talk about riots business model? The way they make opening loot boxes, missions, and every other damn thing in the client as tedious as humanly possible to encourage sunken cost fallacies the same way gambling does? [This genius design?](https://i.imgur.com/tcgVqtO.png) \n\nBanning accounts is just a great way to ensure whales like OP get to pay twice for their favorite champs and skins, and don't think riot hasn't included _that _ in their business model. They've been itching to ban him for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-18T12:49:22.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"No they aren't? The only time RIot attempted to ban a player instead of an account was Tyler1. It was a mess because they didn't have policies in place to handle such a thing. They set the policies and decided that account bans and not player bans were still the way to go, even for players like him who were consistently toxic on new accounts because of the speed at which such accounts were banned.\n\nReported or not you don't get punished for cursing. You might get punished for cursing *at* someone, but it's not the cursing that is relevant, it's the targeted insult/abuse/etc. The system isn't a word filter, the system physically could not function effectively that way - [this post does a good job explaining why](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Ifb0rpEJ-riot-should-just-make-a-list-of-banned-words-and-how-not-to-be-condescending).\n\nThe only terms that come close to a word filter are the no tolerance terms such as 'kys', and even then there is context to consider (e.g \"who says shit like 'kys' to strangers on the internet?\" should obviously not be banned).\n\nSlow, does not mean ineffective, it means inefficient. They can and do punish for int-ing, griefing, etc but it's slower than the chat system because behaviour is harder to verify than words. In saying that, a not insubstantial percentage of int/griefing reports are bad games or bad decisions, not *intentional* feeding or griefing.\n\nMy thoughts on loot boxes are rather irrelevant, unhappy players don't spend money. It's literally in Riot's financial interest to keep their majority happy in whatever form that takes.\n\nAs for people with banned accounts spending more money, even if we assume that those players do spend more money despite losing all the money they've spent before (which most just don't do), the percentage of perma-banned accounts is minuscule. As in 0.06%\n\nSomehow, I don't think 0.06% of *accounts* (as in not even players) are the big money makers for Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"ZefLyf","date":"2019-07-19T06:19:33.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is a morally bankrupt company pandering to the crying children under it's employ that actually believe other peoples chat can affect their player experience in the same way a 2% wr nunu can.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-19T06:48:36.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you considered that other people have a different perspective from you?\n\nPersonally, I would rather play with a complete and blatant troll throwing my ranked game, than someone throwing threats and 'kys' around.\n\nI don't speak for everyone of course, but neither do you.
