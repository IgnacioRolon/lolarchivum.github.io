I know I would, I have way to many Ahri skins that I have a lot of trouble deciding which ones to use in what games (1st world problems I know). Make it so it doesn&#039;t tell you what skin you got until you reach loading screen ? Add in the chroma pack support to it as well and you&#039;ll have even options?","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2015-09-12T08:09:54.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man this would be fun. My friends always tell me that my skin choices are bad even when i have for example both of the Rengar skins, i can never decide which one to pick, because they are both equally awesome in my opinion, so making is choose for me would be just too much fun for me. Better see this in the game i mean if they add ward skins to champ select might as well add this!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Khizzar","date":"2015-08-29T15:20:37.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think a large amount of people have more than 2 skins on a single champ :D","replies":[]}]}
