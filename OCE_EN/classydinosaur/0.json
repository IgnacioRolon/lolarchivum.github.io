I love a bit of strategic gameplay and lots of wacky champions to fool around with so I'm sure I'll get my own fun out of it regardless of what people say!\"\r\n\r\nFast forward three days later.\r\n\r\nThis game is a thousand times more unpleasant than I ever could have imagined. The people suck, the community sucks, the repetitive gameplay sucks and the developers suck. Losing a game is frustrating, winning a game is exhausting, playing the game for any amount of time is an excercise in pure tedium. The only benefit I've gotten out of this experience is seeing for myself what an absolute hot bubbling mess of witch pus it is. Enjoy your garbage fire, I'm off to play literally anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-11T04:57:17.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, don't judge the game until you're 30 and in ranked and not playing bots.\n\nThe real game starts at 30.","replies":[{"poster":"ClassyDinosaur","date":"2019-11-11T05:09:44.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Played around 20 odd games outside of bots with other people (if you could fairly call them people and not half-formed orcs that slithered out of the mud pits of Mordor on a muggy afternoon while the interns were working the shovels). \n\nIt is pure. Fucking. Tedium. Yeah whatever it might not \"be for me\" and I'm not going to entertain the inevitable \"lol just git gud\" dead horse that gets flogged in situations like this...but jesus tapdancing christ I gave it a fair shake of the sauce bottle. I didn't even get any sauce out of the bottle, I just got a dusty spritz of calcified rat cum. That alone is reason enough for me to flip the bird and never touch this jug of lumpy milk masquerading as a game ever again.\n\nAlso, enjoying a shit thing after hundreds of hours of exposure to it is not a point in that things favor...its not warming up to it. Its stockholm syndrome. You can hold your hand over an open flame for 100 hours and yeah eventually you'll stop feeling the pain, but you'll have done serious damage to yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-11-11T05:58:05.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Played around 20 odd games outside of bots with other people (if you could fairly call them people and not half-formed orcs that slithered out of the mud pits of Mordor on a muggy afternoon while the interns were working the shovels).\"\n\nOdd's are those were quite literally bots, League doesn't actually do anything about the issue of botting accounts to 30 and selling them off, so it basically means that those literally weren't people.\n\n\"Also, enjoying a shit thing after hundreds of hours of exposure to it is not a point in that things favor...its not warming up to it.
