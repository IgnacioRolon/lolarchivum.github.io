Now i have all the champs and really want to play URF sooooo bad. So Riot if you can, please keep URF on after april fools, put it into a custom, whatever! JUST KEEP IT. Everyone agree's that the gamemode was probably the best EVER!   I dont want to sound like one of those guys that cries over loosing URF. But i just want to play it again. Anyway, Riot this Game Mode was awesome, and dont bother nerfing or removing champs for this mode, since alot of champs are OP in URF. It's a fun game mode and banning or nerfing every champ so its fair defeats the purpose of it.\r\n\r\nsincerely \r\n\r\nA Fan xD","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-09T07:08:04.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Treaton,realm=NA,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=2x2gsr55,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-09T03:26:59.519+0000)\n\n> Anyway, Riot this Game Mode was awesome, and dont bother nerfing or removing champs for this mode, since alot of champs are OP in URF.

There were good reasons to nerf and remove champs from URF. Please, just cause it's a special and awesome game mode, doesn't mean I want it to be unbalanced as it already is.","replies":[{"poster":"Treaton","date":"2015-03-09T07:52:11.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but nerfing it and removing champs kind of takes the everything away from URF and just leaves the players with what is considered \"fair\". I dont know about the constant anivia Ult but dude, its not like she is unstoppable.\nand zilean got nerfed already before it was realeased, fyi, no one likes to play champs that are going to win either way, no one likes that. thats taking away to challenge people and makes u think versing bots instead. for example. u play a champ, u get so good with him/her/it that u basically stomp everyone, where is the fun in it then ? It gets boring to win over and over with the same champions just cause u mastered them, its really challenging to try new stuff. but i guess thats only me....","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-03-09T23:27:27.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, Anivia's damage AND slow with her ultimate is OP. Basically, she can pretty much 1v1 anyone that isn't bursty. Also, people will play every champ possible because it's URF. Every champ becomes viable. Also, just cause it's URF doesn't mean people won't play to win. I personally know people who will play the most overpowered champs in the game just because they are effectively unbeatable in URF if they got the chance.\n\nJust imagine, as soon as Kassadin is allowed in URF, once he hits 6 it's GG. He will be able to spam riftwalk as much as he wants and no one will be able to kill him.\n\nI get what you are saying, but in my opinion, some champs need to be removed from it to keep the game healthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-10T06:12:26.710+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DiamondAries,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=2x2gsr55,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-03-09T23:27:27.255+0000)\n>\n> Dude, Anivia's damage AND slow with her ultimate is OP.

URF is by far my favourite featured game mode. Tbh, why don't they put all the featured game modes in custom games? They're welcome to remove them from que, but why not just leave it in custom games for a lot of the players that enjoys them a lot? It'll give the game soooo much more diversity and the game overall will be much more entertaining.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Treaton","date":"2015-03-09T08:36:35.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats something i want too xD  have to wait and see if we get it for longer or permanent :)","replies":[]}]}]}
