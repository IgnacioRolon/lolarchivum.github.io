It patched to the 33% mark and then what happens is that it starts calculating difference and file scanning. It scans 3340 files and then pops up the message \"Update failed: Unspecified error occurred. Please check the logs for more information\" and then gives the option to Continue or Send Logs. Regardless of what I hit the patch does not continue operating, and remains at 3340 files scanned, 33% complete. Does any one know what the issue may be and how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-15T22:54:41.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a fault in the way your Mac is communicating to Riot's servers, or maybe it's a fault in the way Riot's servers are communicating to your Mac.\n\nEither way, one thing you should try is attempting to update from a different internet source, if feasible. Otherwise, you can try setting another DNS address to fetch your links from (sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't). Ask if you'd like instructions on that.","replies":[]}]}
