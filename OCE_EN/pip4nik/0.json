That, or the account somehow had a Bronze 5 mmr, the person went 10-0 or 9-0 in their promos and got Bronze 2 (but once again should be a higher rank).\n\nI doubt the account is being boosted since it's never been used to play ranked before, but it could have been sold.\n\nOr the person simply might be lucky. I'm Bronze 4 and at one point I had a 90+% win-rate over ~25 games. That's what got me from Bronze 5 0 LP to Bronze 4 90 LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-07-12T13:02:34.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whatcha mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-07-12T20:54:13.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a 100% win-rate on several champions (but some are only over 1-3 games), and has an 89% win-rate in Bronze over 35 games.","replies":[]}]}]}
