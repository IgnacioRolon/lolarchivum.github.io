When 30% of my promo games had someone on my team either go AFK or disconnect why should I be punished by having that game count as a loss and subsequently put in the lower rankings. Other players can be extremely lucky and have 10 reasonable games in ranked and end up in higher tiers etc. and yet others are left with people who have internet connections made from string between two tin cans and drag their team mates down into the lowest ranks.\r\n\r\nThis game link I believe showed that despite playing quite well and managing to get a few kills, that our team mate (Talon) being disconnected ultimately ruined our chances of winning and as such I don't think I should be demoted to Bronze II for that poor excuse for a game; \r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/87459219/201021950?tab=overview\r\n\r\nA few games earlier (in normals) our team still lost, but I played fairly well, carrying the team (including selling my boots for more damage in a base defense and warding more than any of my other team mates). I can deal with losing because my team sucks or me not being good enough to carry the game to victory, but I am putting this link up just to point out that I am still fairly good at the game and not just another person claiming that I should be in \"Challenger\". I fully understand that this is a ranked team game and as such losing is losing, but at least in this game we had 5 players and stood some chance of winning the game;\r\n\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/87453205/201021950?tab=overview\r\n\r\nWhat got me into ranked in the first place was that I like a challenge. I also had a goal. My friend was in Silver and said to me that if I could get into SIlver that he would Duo with me. When I got into Bronze 1 I was frustrated especially because I knew just how many games I would have to win just to get to Silver 5. Given the number of AFK'ers, Disconnections and feeders I am starting to understand the whole Bronze ELO hell thing people keep going on about.\r\n\r\nThis issue I want and in a few ways need to raise is that when playing ranked games having a player on your team disconnect, go AFK or worse, deliberately feed are some of the worst experiences you can have. The consequences of someone losing the game for the team are that they will most likely have their rankings and their match history reflect poorly on even those that played out of their minds trying to scrape a win in a 4v5 game and reflects poorly on the ranking system itself and should be something that RIOT actively addresses.\r\n\r\nI used to play a lot of support. Lulu was one of my favourites and the new champ Bard was one that really got me into playing a good warding, roaming support, but when I had a bad losing streak in ranked due in some parts to my mistakes in game (i certainly won't be claiming to be a gold+ player) and partly due to my ADC's being quite poor and or other lanes feeding I decided to push my limits and went back to normals and started playing Jinx ADC, Wukong Top and Annie Mid to get used to playing in a different roles and different champs to see if I could carry a game or see if I was in need of a lot more practice.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to play ranked I lost I think 7 out of 10 games in the promos. One game was awful on my part as a Nautilus jungler and I failed seriously in that game, but in my other games I thought I played pretty well and once I won my first game as LuLu I decided to keep playing her as support. My luck ran out pretty quickly though when lanes fed or worse someone disconnected or went AFK and when my ADC was just awful I started considering changing champs/roles right then even in game, but stuck it out and when I got my rank, Bronze 1 I was pretty annoyed. I'm not sure if I could see video of my games, but if I could have I felt that our losses were not largely attributable to me. Sure I could have tried by swapping lanes and going full Attack Speed/Ability Power LuLu and carry our team out of defeat, but my experience has been that when the support takes over or the toxicity in game chat goes up you are even more likely to lose and to be honest I wasn't confident I could do that and had committed my gold and masteries to support and by the time I was thinking about changing it was too late anyway and I was too far behind in gold and experience to make the difference anyway.\r\n\r\nAfter playing quite a few normal and custom games as Jinx and Annie I felt quite confident that I could win a game as an AD/AP carry in ranked. I was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe game hadn't even really started and we all knew our Mid laner Talon was not going to be there. We tried anyway and to our credit we held up OK given the 4v5 game. Then Talon reconnected. Praise the Sun! I thought OK stay positive, we can do this. No sooner did Talon walk into mid lane he was swiftly killed by Lux. Great. GG. He then disconnected again. Then came back and tried to support. Nope. Completely useless. He then quit and we lost and I was demoted to Bronze 2 and decided to write this post.\r\n\r\nGood luck in your games and hopefully I'll be in Silver some time this century.\r\n\r\nGGWP","replies":[{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-04-23T20:50:05.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so, whenever we want to not lose lp we just afk?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorch Cardinal","date":"2015-04-24T01:21:34.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not what he said.

Something to consider would be having AFK'ers lose more LP whilst the others in the team maintain their LP when a team mate goes AFK or disconnects.\n\nNot sure how hard this would be to implement, but would help to reduce the consequences  for the rest of the team when they are unlucky enough to have one person who throws a game by leaving.\n\nNot sure it would be as easy to deal with intentional feeders, but Tha is why I suggest a fix to AFK'ers and disconnecters. I figure the system would be able to automatically register if someone is standing at the fountain for most of the game or not being in game at all.\n\nThanks for asking for clarification.

Winning 2 and losing 2 in my series for gold only to have the 5th game a afk mid.
