If you have a girlfriend/boyfriend.\nAnd hug them. Or if you live with your parents (I dont know your life)\nHug your mum.\n\nI do this all the time to one of my housemates, when ever I have a shit/bad game.\nIts gotten to the point when she knows when Ive had a bad game and is ready for it XD.\n\n-----------\n\nSome 4 v 5's can be won (Even tho its difficult)\nAnd that's only 1 game out of the 1000 games you've probably already played or going to play.","replies":[{"poster":"TheLeperMessiah","date":"2016-03-17T11:08:12.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things is I'm wondering whether I just play my console games. When league is working as intended I relish the opportunity to completely dominate other players with my more aggressive builds of Bard the caretaker, but when my job requires me to work split shifts and the only time I have to play are in two hour blocks and 2 out of every 3 games has an afk player in it I just think to myself it is worth my time? At the moment the answer to that question is no it is not worth my time and RIOT needs to know that. Maybe this game has a few more years left in it, but when the competition is so fierce they need to wake up and smell the roses because if I was a halfway decent player I would be wondering whether the math was on my side rather than the skill level I can play at  because most games are pure trash and don't even give you the opportunity to play as the developers intended","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lurenza","date":"2016-03-17T10:39:20.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The one feature that annoys me is locking in champions and bans, simply selecting them should be fitting. \n\nAlso RIOT isn't really to blame for those annoying players that ques up just to leave, it's certainly quite annoying ;-; {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[]}]}
