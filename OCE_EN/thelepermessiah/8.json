Norms are for fun and screwing around, but even then I still like to win like this game;\r\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/\r\n\r\nOr playing with really unlikely Champs and doing surprisingly well with them;\r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/V3toE2gA-bard-pentakill\r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed though is that in particular MID lane assassins go all in into fights they know they will lose when they give up winning lane and ADC&#039;s give up once they have a few deaths and can&#039;t win trades despite a great way to get back in the game by farm up under tower and clearing waves to defend turrets.\r\n\r\nThe below advice or breakdown of the games I watched of them and participated in with them might give you some idea of the kind of players I think lose games when the chips are down or even when they are up;\r\n\r\nDude you need to stop going for kills and get towers\r\nhonestly I was watching your game with Bard and you had a massive lead that you did nothing with and late game you spent most of the time dead\r\nwhy did you not get lifesteal\r\nyou would get a kill and then just die\r\nyou were in the middle of the jungle whilst your team was trying to push top lane\r\nyou spent too much time on your own\r\ni dont care how fed you are you get caught by riven and it was 50/50 if you lived\r\nyou need to stick with your team\r\nthat Garen carried that game\r\nnot only did he get kills but killed towers\r\nif you had of stuck with Garen he could have tanked the damage whilst you blast em away from a distance\r\nlifesteal would have given you sustain you lacked\r\nyour bard was good\r\ndidn&#039;t have low CDR but his ults and stuns as well as picking off kills helped your team alot\r\nif you want to go into the jungle at least ward\r\nforget the jungle camps\r\nlet the jg kill them\r\neven as a fed jinx you were getting low in the jg\r\nyour job as the ADC is not to get kills your job is to mess up the enemy team and kill towers\r\nyou got kills\r\nand occasionally tried to win the game\r\nbut most of the time you spent cleaning up after your team did all the work\r\ngreat long range rockets, but in all honesty you were not there for your team most of the game and it went for as long as it did because you were not there to help\r\nI cannot believe your last game\r\nagain in the jungle for no reason\r\nyour minions did a better job than you did\r\nthe minions were the only ones on your team to get a tower\r\nstop stuffing around in the jungle\r\nward, clear minion waves and take towers\r\nthat game proves that even without kills you can do damage so stop running around doing nothing\r\ntell your team mates the same thing\r\ndude\r\nout of the games i&#039;ve seen you play recently you have not got kills\r\nand repeatedly get caught out in jungle\r\nit happens all the time\r\nif you can&#039;t help me duo then what is the point in playing ranked with you\r\ni duo with you because i thought you wanted to win and to learn \r\nbut you continually ignore my advice\r\nsorry mate but i play norms to stuff about in\r\nand ranked to win\r\nI play a roaming support so i can help out &quot;all&quot; of my team mates\r\nif you leave me in lane i can&#039;t wave clear\r\ni can&#039;t ward\r\nif i leave you in lane you can farm up get fed through cs and still carry\r\ndon&#039;t go in the jungle for no reason\r\ndon&#039;t ward deep you are too important for damage\r\neither stay under tower or roam with me anything else is likely to fail\r\n\r\nLet me have it.\r\n\r\nAm I completely wrong or am I just not up with the current agreed upon way to win from behind (or in front)?","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2017-01-05T01:29:56.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good advice that low elo adcs need to follow to win.","replies":[]}]}
