Most of the time my ping is below 50, but occasionally it goes crazy. The whole delayed NBN really annoys me.\r\n\r\nSo this game I realised something was wrong and used my phone as a tether. Great connection with 4G just pefect 60FPS and 40 ping.\r\n\r\nGot to game 3 minutes in or so. Yes yes I&#039;m a bad person, perma ban etc. etc. I apologised profusely. Team scores at this stage were 1:1 for kills. Dealable.\r\n\r\nMy adc is a few levels above her opponents and no deaths.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the mid laner is on tilt and is all game. Fed the whole game and wondered around in Jungle to die on at least one occasion.\r\n\r\nThese people in Bronze 5 are so easily tilted and can&#039;t hold it together and I&#039;m sick of it. Seriously my adc gets two shot by an Annie in bot lane and thinks it is my job to somehow save her from the full on burst. Sorry buddy it&#039;s not like a Blitz hook I can&#039;t take one for the team you just have to not be in range of a Tibbers.\r\n\r\nI get blamed for the terrible Jayce and get abused all game. Doens&#039;t matter if I help hold them off at tower. Doesn&#039;t matter if I get my Jungler a double kill I get abused all game.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had enough. I need to be able to DUO with some people who don&#039;t give up so easily and spend less time as keyboard warriors than Champions on the Field of Justice","replies":[{"poster":"Endless Heights","date":"2017-01-03T13:44:42.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so you know the worst ELO is bronze, but in saying that it doesnt get much better until gold, or so ive been told, silver last season was the same for me as a jungler, you cant do anything right, keep your head up and focus on improving your game. at the end of the day its just a game, you arent a pro player, and nothing you do in game effects anything bar a little icon next to you profile. If theyre so good, theyd carry, theyd win, they wouldnt be B5 and they sure a fuck would know better then to flame the instant people do something wrong","replies":[{"poster":"blackdemonshadow","date":"2017-01-03T14:24:19.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gold is just as bad as bronze is, and plat is just as bad as gold is.

I like to think of myself as a decent player. I mean I only play a few champs well, but I can consistently do what I would consider to be a decent job of playing to win. I really like long games so haven't really focused my runes/masteries around early game which is something I am trying to address now, but the thing I really struggle with is the frequency of games where my team mates play poorly. I mean no logical reason for there actions just blindly going in to team fights and exposing our towers to damage. Pushing deep with no ward cover. Not using their trinkets. Having poor cs skills that I even as a bard can beat","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-03T11:10:13.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes unfortunately that's the drawback of bronze division.

The only difference between bronze and gold is that people in bronze know they suck,  gold players also suck but think they are challenger material. Everything is everyone elses fault regardless on how they played out the situation. The blame game is amazingly strong.

In a team game that makes it hard to quantify whether I could play at a much higher level, but I will not know unless I play in a game full of golds.\n\nI am also a swimming coach whose job revolves around swimmers in my squads being well aware that they are not the best because it is listed at every competition they go to. Because they are not the best we actively look to encourage individual goals and skills that they can work towards which will enable them to improve their own personal bests.","replies":[]}]}]}
