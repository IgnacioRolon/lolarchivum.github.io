Now that Zephyr is gone{{item:3070}} I am hard pressed to figure out how to do this type of Bard again unless I take a {{item:3078}} or {{item:3142}}, but as you can see I got quite good at trying out the more niche potential of {{champion:432}}.\r\n\r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/V3toE2gA-bard-pentakill\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;ve noticed with playing mostly normal and Bronze level games is that the normal support items for {{champion:432}} like {{item:3092}} or {{item:2301}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3050}} or {{item:3110}}  {{item:3190}} {{item:3117}} {{item:2045}} or {{item:3504}}  {{item:3364}}  that are bought for supports in LCS etc. either don&#039;t cut it when trying to keep your carries alive consistantly at the lower ELO because they die so often that the actives just aren&#039;t available for the number of times they do foolish things or the play style is so boring and does so little damage that if my adc is a potato I am left being less useful late game. I can&#039;t stop them doing things like facechecking a bush or walking off on their own or fighting a 2v1 when I&#039;m either dead or helping another team mate out that can actually carry a game. {{item:3222}} with it&#039;s Active is great and all, but when a lot of players at the lower ELO ranks dive towers foolishly or place themselves in a position of certain death and don&#039;t watch their mini map the active is used once and often isn&#039;t available for the shear number of times players at these levels make bad game calls so although it is effective at higher ELO where a clutch cleanse can win a game I find it gets used once or twice and the team mate is so out of place that they die anyway. So I went down a really aggressive build path and have had a moderate and I would say more consistent level of success building like this and I really think it makes {{champion:432}} viable in other lanes and throughout a game if you are good enough with it.\r\n\r\nAs always I buy {{item:2043}} and have {{item:3340}}  up where useful and buy a {{item:2302}} if I&#039;m really in need of additional vision. Frankly I find when playing normals that my team mates don&#039;t bother looking at their mini maps regardless of the warding I do so I usually opt to just buy an early pink and roam enough to get vision where it is really important. Not really sure why I am almost always the one who wards the most regardless of the lane I play, but that is the ELO I mostly play in so I just roll with it.\r\n\r\n{{item:3096}} for consistent gold even if you kill the occasional creeps unlike {{item:3098}} while your adc is not in lane as well as mana and health\r\n{{item:3158}} CDR movement and summoners\r\n{{item:2033}} health and mana throughout the game and a little extra magic damage to boot\r\n{{item:3071}} the most controversial item in this build, but has CDR, health, AD (still useful), movement and up to 30% armour shred for you &amp; team\r\n{{item:3094}} once you have {{item:3071}} this item shines, Attack Speed, Crit (stacks with high base AD &amp; Cleaver), Movement, bonus range &amp; magic dmg\r\n{{item:3151}} Magic Pen, passive procs on meeps, AP and health\r\n{{item:3512}} Movement Passive is amazing as well as the Tower defence and split potential, MR and Armour\r\n{{item:3742}} Movement Passive is amazing and compliments any additional bonus movement % as it gives base movement. Health and Armour and deeps\r\n...and replace {{item:3158}} with {{item:3100}} or even possibly {{item:3504}} will work great since you now have so many bonus movement items that the % really stack up to the point where 45 lost base movement speed from boots is compensated and in some cases better than having boots.\r\n\r\nThis build along with per level CDR, armour, magic resist runes and Hybrid Pen runes allows this bard to be a really useful all round utility support mage dealing moderate physical and magic damage throughout the game without relying on having team mates that know how to play really well when all they have to do is hit the enemies that I&#039;ve shredded armour with {{item:3071}} . I&#039;d say this build is not only fun, but at low ELO is a great way, if you are the play making type {{champion:432}}  can win you games.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the above build looks something like this and really depends on where you want to spike in power. More magic pen or health and armour.\r\n\r\n{{item:1310}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3151}} \r\nThis build allows you to penetrate more enemy MR and can really help a team that has a few mages in it since Wit&#039;s End and Hurricane can shred MR fast.\r\n\r\n&gt; Now looking at the proposed changes to mage items in the PBE proposed patch 6.9 notes I think not only can I opt for the AP items I can possible create a more competitive Bard in most lanes. Do more of the magic damage you really want to as a {{champion:432}} and do so with 300 more health and effectively having a {{item:3071}} for your mage carries in the form of the new {{item:3001}} and high AOE magic damage and a short range mini {{summoner:4}} in the new {{item:3145}} {{item:3067}} Hextech item.\r\n\r\n{{item:3047}} or {{item:3158}} depending on whether you plan on going the {{item:3285}} or {{item:3100}} path later on\r\n{{item:3145}} +{{item:3067}} looks so much fun (changes listed below) with health, AP, CDR and an active that would make a {{champion:432}} mage viable\r\n{{item:3056}} for Health, armour, CDR and the amazing movement passive and tower diving passive\r\n{{item:3001}} the addition of CDR and more MR as well as increased MR removal in late game really make this a compelling replacement in my build type\r\n{{item:3151}} AP is even more useful in a build of this type and as always the magic pen and other stats that work well with {{champion:432}}&#039;s passive &amp; Q\r\n{{item:3285}}/({{item:1414}} Jungle) or {{item:3100}} or {{item:3504}}  with appropriate rune changes to make sure CDR is maxed and movement the same\r\n{{item:3742}} replaces {{item:3047}} for more movement, health and armour overall\r\n\r\nHere are the changes that are proposed in the PBE notes;\r\n\r\n&gt;   Hextech Rocket Belt (Temporary Name) {{item:3145}} +{{item:3067}} \r\n&bull;Recipe: Hextech Revolver + Kindlegem + 800 Gold = 2750 Total Gold\r\n&bull;Health: 300\r\n&bull;Ability Power: 80\r\n&bull;Cooldown Reduction: 10%\r\n&bull;Active - Fire Bolt: Dash 300 units in a direction (at 1200 speed) and then unleash a nova of fireballs that deal 100 - 250 (+25% of your Ability Power) magic damage to enemies hit. Enemies hit by more than one fireball take 15% damage from additional balls. (30 second cooldown, shared with other Hextech items).\r\n&bull;This Dash cannot go over walls.\r\n\r\n&gt;  {{item:3001}} Abyssal Scepter\r\n&bull;Recipe Change: Fiendish Codex + Negatron Cloak + Amplifying Tome + 695 Gold = 2750 Total Gold\r\n&bull;Ability Power: 70 &gt;&gt;&gt; 60\r\n&bull;Magic Resist: 50 &gt;&gt;&gt; 60\r\n&bull;Cooldown Reduction: 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; 10%\r\n&bull;Aura: No longer affects minions\r\n&bull;Aura: Now scales with level. Reduces Magic Resistance of nearby enemy champions from 10 to 25.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think below, whether it be in regards to my opinions on playing support in low ELO, ,my take on the possibilities with the proposed mage items in the PBE notes or whether you really like my attempts to create a viable hybrid {{champion:432}} mage/utility support to rival the {{champion:61}} &#039;s of yesteryear.","replies":[]}
