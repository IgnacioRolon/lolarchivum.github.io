Even managed a Pentakill back in the day as a tanky jungler;\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/V3toE2gA-bard-pentakill\nYeah I know amazing and completely unlikely (just wish I had of known how to video the game).\n\nMore recently I&#039;ve been playing ranked and have come up against the same thing I always do when I care about the outcome of games beyond simply having fun and that is the feeders, the afk&#039;ers and those that simply give in or get bored. Sure on occasion I play a bad game or the oponents are clearly better, but I&#039;m looking to up my game and some in-depth advice and or a chance to befriend some people who share my mindset on the game.\n\nWhat I have found is that if I play the traditional support role I lose more often, ie. no damage, no armour or MR.\n\nThis seems to be that if I go the {{item:3222}} path I can use the active effectively very rarely, ADC takes more risks thinking I can somehow make them invulnerable and they die more frequently than the active is available.\n\nSo here is a list of what I do and what sort of success I seem to have with the style of play. Even if it doesn&#039;t suit your style or even the Meta it is here as an example of a way to play Bard that I have enjoyed.\n\n1. Runes;\nHybrid Penetration (more on this later)\nScaling CDR Quint&#039;s x2= 10% @ 18\nScaling Armour x9 = 27 MR @ 18\nScaling MR x9 = 27 MR @ 18\nMovement Quint x1 = 1.5% movement\n\n2. Masteries (basic rundown);\nWindseekers, Runic, Movement out of combat and in brush, 45% CDR cap, Armour and MR bonuses\n\n3. Skills;\nOften start with W to aid jg\nQ first to 5\nW second to 5\nE last\nR when available\n\n4. Items (yes I get {{item:2302}} if I&#039;m in the mood to play full support);\nStart.\n{{item:3301}}{{item:2031}} {{item:3340}} \nFirst back.\n{{item:3096}} and/or {{item:2033}}{{item:2055}} \nIf a bit more in the bank.\n{{item:3158}} and/or{{item:3114}}\n{{item:3504}} and/or {{item:2053}} {{item:3512}} \nFor Damage (and to add to my MR penetration and add power to my Q, W and Meeps)\n{{item:3151}} \nSell {{item:2033}} for {{item:3109}} \nIf super late game.\nReplace {{item:3096}} for {{item:3071}} (seriously this item kicks arse on a late game {{champion:432}} as you can wittle down the enemy Armour alot)\nReplace {{item:3158}} with {{item:3742}} (by the time the game is this long in you have all the other items which contribute a high % of extra movement speed either passively in and out of combat and the extra Health and Armour as well as the passive movement out of combat make up for a lack of boots)\n\n5. Summoner Spells {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:3}}\n\nSo to round off. This build has;\n1. Wards if I play it that way. Taking this to replace basic trinket {{item:3364}} \n2. Early sustain and gold (really important in lower ELO where a lot of other players play a kill or be killed game rather than objectives and low death count)\n3. Hits the 45% CDR cap prioritising CDR early\n4. A little AP and a passive that boosts my ADC&#039;s damage and sustain with heals which are effectively weaker {{summoner:7}} \n5. Lane pressure and defence {{item:3512}} \n6. Decent enough damage output with {{item:3151}} \n7. Sustain later on and extra bonuses to teammates with {{item:3109}} \n8. If the game goes on long enough I can take a beating and dish out enough damage and shred {{item:1031}} for team mates with {{item:3071}} and {{item:3742}} \n\n9. Out of the full Build, {{item:3504}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3109}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3742}} only {{item:3151}} doesn&#039;t provide additonal movement speed so even without {{item:3158}} I can zip around the map super late game and continue to be the tankiest nuicance the enemy team has to deal with as well as still having the massive utility of my QWER.\n\nNow I like this build because it is fun and is a full Hybrid damage, Health, MR/Arm, full CDR and movement build that surprises quite a few players that don&#039;t expect a {{champion:432}} to be capable of pulling off.\n\nThe most popular and most played version of {{champion:432}} at higher ELO seems to be this;\n\n1. Runes;\nFlat AD, Arm, MR and Attack Speed Quints (early game focused)\n\n2. Masteries;\nThunderlords/Veteran Scars (early game focused)\n\n3. Skills;\nQ first\nQ first to 5\nE second to 5\nR when able to\nW last\n\n4. Items;\nStarting\n{{item:3303}} x3{{item:2010}}{{item:3340}}\nFirst back\n{{item:2049}} and or {{item:2055}}\nSecond\n{{item:2301}} and {{item:3117}} or {{item:3158}} \nMajor items\n{{item:3107}} {{item:3190}} \n\n5. Summoners;\n{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}} \n\nThe longest game I&#039;ve seen with a complete build was this;\n{{item:3107}}{{item:3190}}{{item:2045}}{{item:3060}}{{item:3512}}{{item:3158}}\n\nHowever, these are in high ELO games where a high level of teamwork is common. I&#039;ve more recently been looking at a Youtuber that did a 100 games to Diamond challenge in which he contributes his failure to reaching the Diamond goal due to following a Meta based support role rather than a more aggressive carry from support style that he said was far more effective at lower ELO before returning to the traditional role once he reached higher ranks.\n\nHis {{champion:432}} build was such.\n\nMuch like the above build the core is the same.\n1. Runes;\nFlat AD, Arm, MR and Attack Speed Quints (early game focused)\n\n2. Masteries;\nThunderlords/Veteran Scars (early game focused)\n\n3. Skills;\nQ first\nQ first to 5\nE second to 5\nR when able to\nW last\n\nBefore the item build you can watch the videos he put together here to see for yourself;\n100 games to Diamond challenge (failed due to following traditional support role at lower ELO)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCJ_cxEILVw&amp;t=108s\nA game review to help give a decent run-down of the thought processes and the style of {{champion:432}} carry\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhFPARM96TQ\n\n4. Items;\nStarting\n{{item:3303}} x3{{item:2010}}{{item:3340}}\nFirst back\n{{item:3108}}\nSecond back\n{{item:1042}} \nThird back\n{{item:3101}} {{item:1001}} {{item:2055}} \nFourth back\n{{item:3115}}{{item:3024}} {{item:1027}}\nFifth back\n{{item:3057}}\n\nFrom my understanding and after watching his video&#039;s n3ac3y would only build something like a {{item:3115}} if he wanted to take advantage of a lead and this is his fed build;\n{{item:3115}}{{item:3009}}{{item:3100}}{{item:3060}}{{item:3512}} though I guess with the changes to Banner that might not be the case (No CDR/AP)\n\n Otherwise this was the build path he would follow;\n\n{{item:2301}}{{item:3009}}{{item:3025}}{{item:3060}}{{item:3512}}\n\nOne last video that was great to watch;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zr27_tWUhs\n\nFrom watching these videos I am fully aware that I do not have the skills to play at a Diamond level and could not pull off strategies like this consistantly. However, I want to improve so maybe I should jump into the deep end and go for it\n\nThe final build I have here is from Mobafire and seems to have a different theme (more conservative/less aggressive) and is from a Master Tier player.\n\nhttp://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/6-23-time-to-chime-a-magical-journey-to-high-elo-master-446306\n\nRunes, Masteries and Skill pathing seems to be identical to the above build. However, the style of play is a lot more traditional and so is the itemisation;\n\nStarting\n{{item:3303}} x3{{item:2010}}{{item:3340}}\nFirst buy\n{{item:2049}}{{item:3098}}{{item:1001}}{{item:2031}}{{item:2055}}\nCore\n{{item:3158}}{{item:2045}}{{item:2301}}{{item:3107}}{{item:3364}}{{item:2055}}\nAdd for Final Build\n{{item:3190}} {{item:3222}}{{item:2138}}\n\nSituational items/build depending on how the enemy plays/who are your strongest opponents;\n{{item:3117}}{{item:3009}}{{item:3050}}(apparently weaker now with current ADC meta){{item:3060}}{{item:3110}}{{item:3102}}{{item:3143}}{{item:3512}}\n\nSo anyway I hope you&#039;ve found this build guide and those that have inspired me useful.\n\nI&#039;m currently in Bronze 5, but it&#039;s early days.\n\nLooking for players to befriend and hopefully team up and DUO/Flex &amp; 5v5 with so feel free to add me if you don&#039;t give up easily on the Rift.\n\nSee you on the Fields of Justice","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-04T05:53:59.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you enjoy collecting tampons for 40 minutes?
