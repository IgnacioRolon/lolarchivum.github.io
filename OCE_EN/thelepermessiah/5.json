Not only did I place the most wards, but I also took the most damage. A tanky, vision enhancing killing machine. Truly terrifying.\n\nI just wish I could have recorded the match so I could upload a video. Alas I cannot do this. Unless someone knows how to get the game file uploaded.\n\nI had somehow got to Quadra having mostly facerolled their team with an ult to keep them where i wanted them and chased them down with Ghost and Point Runner and then I couldn't see anyone else. I had almost fully accepted that I would not achieve the improbable. Then I looked on the map to see a Jinx in top lane trying to hold back a minion wave from their turret. I did not fear the turret and was completely focused on my task. This Attack Damage Carry would feel my wrath. I ran as fast as I could and stunned her against the wall with my Q then it was all up to the auto&#039;s. That moment of dread when you know you are fighting a losing battle is something almost anyone that has played a Warwick, Vladimir or any other champ that relies on lifesteal or spellvamp knows all too well. I was tough as Iron, but I just didn&#039;t do quite enough damage. The feeling of defeat as I was shut down was almost too much, but with my death Thornmail did my work for me and as I looked upon my darkened screen Pentakill!\n\nHow could this happen? What sorcery was this?\n\nWell many things had to fall into place. For one, having Thornmail was essential. Without it I would have been shutdown and that be the end of it. Another component was having Ghost and Smite. As the only methods for damaging my foes directly being meep powered auto&#039;s and my Q I needed something else up my sleeve and a Cinderhulk enchanted Skirmishers Saber allowed everything else to fall into place. The slow, the true damage and the additional true damage added to my auto&#039;s just allowed the damage to pile up whilst my Thornmail shrugged off most of the attacks of my enemies giving them back a sizable amount of magic damage in return. As I did not have a pair of boots (by choice) I relied on having Raptor&#039;s Cloak for the Point Runner passive and Zephyr for movement speed. Along with Ghost this allowed me to chase down the bulk of my 5 kills and throw some meeps in their faces. I&#039;d also by this point accumulated 180 armour from items alone on top of my scaling armour runes and magic resist runes not to mention my Wit&#039;s End for stealing MR from my targets. Given that I don&#039;t have this recorded I would assume that I would also likely have possessed a combination of red and blue buffs either stolen from my kills or through jungling up until this point. Oh and did I mention that we had recently stolen Baron hahahaha which was only the case because Caitlyn finished it off after I misjudged my smite timing and didn&#039;t quite kill it after having ulted it in the lead up to our ambush at the pit.\n\nThe funny thing was that no sooner had I respawned I was back fighting again and this time managed to get another double kill from Ekko and Jinx. Jinx once again killed by my Thornmail. My chimes collection was nearing 100 by this stage too so my auto's were also pretty savage.\n\nAfter looking over the stats of the game I also realised that up until my Pentakill I was at 4 kills and 5 deaths with a respectable number of assists, but nothing to write home about. I hadn&#039;t even managed a kill in the first 30 minutes of the game. So from Baron at roughly 40 minutes into the game I had gone from 2 kills to 11 with a combination of two double kills and a Pentakill in around 8 minutes including a respawn and running across the map to get back in the fight.\n\nSo I have done it, the improbable rather than the impossible.\n\nI have also recently managed a Quadrakill with Yorick so feeling pretty pleased at the moment :p\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/90904188/201021950?tab=overview\n\nNow to escape Bronze...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-06-08T02:22:59.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the w max is real","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-06-03T05:57:58.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you stacked armor against a team with only 1 ad, this must be bronze 5 or something if they couldn't win that","replies":[{"poster":"TheLeperMessiah","date":"2015-06-03T08:22:19.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that I even managed a Pentakill with Bard would suggest their team just wasn't very good, but I understand the build criticism.\n\nGiven the time I played this game, after midnight, the majority of the players could have been half asleep.\n\nIf I wasn't kind of building against what I thought would be my main threat, Jinx I was in a bit of a build tunnel where I was just thinking about Thornmail and the enemy auto attacks. If I'd had my time again I would have gone with a Banshee's Veil Instead of Sunfire Cape as my final item for the MR and the spell shield. Which would have meant roughly 285 Armour to 165 MR. Or if I was really trying to maintain the balance I could have gone Zz Rot to keep Point Runner and gone Spirit Visage instead of Banshee's to keep my CDR at max reduction. What do you think Wumachine?\n\nThe thing I'm unsure about is the stats on the damage I took which suggests a roughly even split between physical and magic damage. Though I am unsure as to whether this is before or after my defences are factored in.","replies":[]}]}]}
