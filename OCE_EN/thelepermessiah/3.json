I will just unfriend you. There are enough cowards in the real world without having to put up with people who say ff@20 when the enemy are 5 kills ahead.\r\n\r\nI feel like I learn to play better when your team is behind and the victories all the sweeter when you win the long game through map control. A sneaky Zz&#039; Rot or taking advantage of an overly confident enemy that bites off more than they can chew.\r\n\r\nIf you are behind as an ADC, hug the tower and clear the waves and earn that sweet, sweet gold. I know being on your own is scary, but when you are not carrying you need to farm and me babysitting you whilst you wave clear is just wasting the experience you need to do big damage. Don&#039;t wonder alone in the jungle. There is a reason most shooters in Africa go as a group. Big animals will eat up a cocky moron with a gun. I&#039;ll come help you when I&#039;m finished helping Mid or Jg get a kill or get a drag. I&#039;m a support main and I support the team not just one ADC that can&#039;t last hit.\r\n\r\nIf you are a mid laner that goes 0/5 and thinks their Ult will net them a kill against a clearly superior opponent maybe hang back and don&#039;t moan when you get some help from me. I play Ivern as well as Bard and I can tell you a gank from either will help you get kills. I don&#039;t mind if you aren&#039;t the best (welcome to the club), but I don&#039;t tolerate feeders who can&#039;t see that a win for the team doesn&#039;t necessarily mean you need to be MVP","replies":[{"poster":"Tazo","date":"2017-01-16T08:27:23.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're like a mirror, add me, Tazo\n\nJG / sup secondary","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noodle of Power","date":"2017-01-10T05:37:37.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\ni am currently only level 23, but am very passionate about league, and take pride in turning around games that appear to be lost.\nI main support and am trying to branch out into the other roles, with Mid being my preferred alternative. my username, Noodle of Power\nI'm keen, as i am also tired of toxic players and afk farmers, and the like.
