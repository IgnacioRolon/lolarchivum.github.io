I mean, yeah if you afk or leave games you deserve it. But to wait 20 f***ing mins every game just to get into q (depending on how many times u left a game) is pretty bullshit. I'm not blaming anyone here but everynow and then my pc freezes and I need to force shut it down to relog and continue the game. Now I have to wait 20 mins every time just to get into q to finish them off. I don't leave games on purpose. It's either that I get bugsplat or my pc freezes and theres nothing much I can do there. Sorry if this is a waste of time. \nThanks Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-16T23:06:09.983+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"afking is still afking. it's still annoying for the other 4 people on your team. 5 minutes of afking can cause a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-17T00:44:57.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so worst case scenario is that 4 ppl get slightly annoyed and you lose a game\nhow is that worth punishing someone who had no control over their comp not working?","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-17T01:23:38.406+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=lE89joNp,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2014-12-17T00:44:57.532+0000)\n>\n> so worst case scenario is that 4 ppl get slightly annoyed and you lose a game\n> how is that worth punishing someone who had no control over their comp not working?\n\nbecause it saves possibly hundreds of other people from this guy with his %%%%ter of a computer ruining their games. you dc, afk, whatever, for reasons that are in your control, and not riots fault, you deserve to be banned.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2014-12-17T19:57:36.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that it is pretty good at motivating people to sort out the issues that are preventing them from getting into/staying in game. However, I don't think that you should be punished if you do reconnect to the game (I understand that this could be abused through rage quits reconnecting just before end of game, but there is the report function). If you are disconnecting and having to reconnect multiple times in a game, you really need to sort your  ♥♥♥♥ out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-17T00:45:51.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a leaver buster warning fro joining  a game late after it held me in champ select for 10 min \nhow is that my fault if the system glitches?","replies":[]},{"poster":"CooolDown","date":"2014-12-16T23:00:09.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also got punished for 5 games lately for DC too but I think it is a great measure!
