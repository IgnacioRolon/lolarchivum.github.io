Addiction to money, consumerism and ourselves is pushing me to the edge.\n\nLast game I played was the perfect example of it, i was playing adc, For some reason the support banned another person pick which was odd. He picked [a questionable support pick with some other troll like things going on]. The game started with me already being frustrated because of the situation, the [support] was afk/not connecting and the enemy well punished my frustration by ganking me level 2. We couldnt remake because he came back, adding more frustration into this game and causing me depression.\n\nThe answer from the team was to make fun of it and bully in game, gank more, abusse more and laugh at any opportunity. [Support] which was the cause of all of this started to act and talk like nothing was happening and started to take my cs, feed in lane and not support at all. Basically adding salt into my already open wound. When talked in all chat requesting to please report him, the response was incredibly, apparently everything was fine, she was doing a good job and i was the one feeding (obviously after all i was dying and being bullied by a [Jungle], [Mid] and [ADC] that took every opportunity to dive and kill me and then laugh). They were having fun. I got into a very dark place and I honestly wanted to cry, when i communicate them about how I felt and about my frustration and depression, they made fun of me, call me all sorts of names, adding more salt in the wound and creating a worse situation from an already very bad moment I was having.\n\nAt the end of the game i ended up trying to fight until the very last moment because I never given up, the entire team kept on harassing and calling me looser, i got called inting, retard and all you can imagine. I got muted by our teammate [Teammate] because apparently i was annoying him and I was the most toxic player he has ever met, just because i was telling them they were causing depression and that i really wanted to kill myself.\n\nThe result of all that was me being reported and probably banned because of telling my feelings and frustration and the person who cause the whole thing going away with it and not even having any sort of punishment and not even caring about the impact he was causing to someone else life.\n\nOut of 9 people only 1 person actually cared enough to ask if i was ok, 3 of them decided to ignore the issue and just keep with their life, but 5 people out of 9 were completely toxic, bullying, harassing, making fun of, verbally abusing and even reporting me after the game.\n\nIs this game is creating a positive impact to the community? they are responsible for 27 million people every day and all they care is about the money? This is the future of society, the next doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. We are creating toxic people just because they are coming to this place for entertainment, the chat needs to go.\n\nThey are putting as lot of time and effort with the leagues and competitive side of it, but i feel they are leaving behind the 27 million people that make the game. Is sad to realize that a game I put so much time and effort to (around 5 years and around aud$6000) is so toxic and people seem to be aware of it, but not doing anything about it? Is time to wake up, is time to realize that this is creating a massive impact around the world and the impact is not being positive. We are creating the future, but in the wrong way.\n\nThe chat needs to stop, the banning system based of amount of report clearly doesn&#039;t work and people are getting more and more toxic and finding new and different ways to be toxic and go away with it, PEOPLE PLEASE WAKE UP, RIOT PLEASE WAKE UP!\n\nPleas help making league a positive place where people can learn something positive for life, not a place in which is ok to call people retard and do everything you want and its cool.\n\nThanks for reading and please, start by not tolerating that kind of behavior, start by giving help to toxic people and make them aware that is not good and not cool for them to do that, please community I know that we are smart and some of us wants to make the different, do it yourself, start by changing yourself and then helping the others.\n\nPlease understand the impact of your behaviors and words in others peoples lifes and be responsible with it. If you cant do it please dont say anything at least.\n\nHave a great day community and PLEASE STAY POSITIVE! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-02-09T11:34:07.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"because the game is nothing but dicks\n\npick a lollipop\n\nhttps://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB15O5IRVXXXXbtaXXXq6xXFXXXz/6Pcs-lot-Creative-Pencil-Eraser-Cartoon-Cute-School-Supplies-Kids-Prize-Stationery-Sweet-Candy-Lolipop.jpg_640x640.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T07:18:43.581+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"As was stated in the deletion notice (top right notification) your post was deleted under the \"Reporting Other Players\" rules (Name and Shame).

These are people who don't know you, they owe you absolutely nothing, and you expect them to care about you? The world is a harsh place and to survive you need to have some resolve. I don't mean this in a bad way, I truly don't. But, if you were getting so emotional over how a handful of people were treating you online then you seriously need to get away from gaming and take a step outside. Meet some real people.","replies":[]}]}
