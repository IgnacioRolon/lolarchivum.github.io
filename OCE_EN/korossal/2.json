Shyv is good too. And Rek'Sai.\n\nThey're all pretty team dependent because they focus on CC, Peel and Engages and if your team fails, you fail.\n\nPlaying hard carries doesn't exclude you from being dependent on your team it's just easier to win with a few failures on your team if the carry isn't the one failing so if you are extremely good youll probably find you win more playing carries. People make mistakes for many reasons though but a carry making mistakes is far more costly however you cant always carry in solo queue and sometimes tank junglers etc fit the team more.","replies":[]}]}
