I understand how frustrating the situation is, especially since you must have been excited to receive a free Mystery Skin from our Legendary Snowball promotion.\n\nHowever, I checked your transactions and found out that you actually bought Dragon Trainer Tristana before December 23, which explains why you did not obtain a Mystery Skin. This also means that I cannot give you one.\n\nRegarding your request, I see that you already used up all your Refund Tokens. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an extra one. Each account is limited to a total of three per lifetime (one-time use only). Once they have been depleted, we are not able to restore them. Also, there is currently no way to receive more than three Refund Tokens per account.\n\nThis feature was developed to give Summoners a chance to exchange content they regretted buying or purchased accidentally, but we had to limit the number of refunds we could reasonably grant within the game.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.","replies":[{"poster":"Archidon6","date":"2015-12-23T01:16:58.842+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Isn't it really just false advertising?

After again checking the snowdown site, it is even more misleading than I originally thought because the dates mention AEDT which leads you to believe the 23rd is also AEDT. There is no reason that Riot shouldn't give the mystery skins to those who have purchased a legendary skin, especially since it is their fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skyous","date":"2015-12-23T02:10:42.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://puu.sh/m5ucp/ea305423e9.jpg\nThis is the response I was given in regard to the starting times","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wam Bam GG Mam","date":"2015-12-23T02:05:52.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm sitting here at 3pm on the 23/12/15.
