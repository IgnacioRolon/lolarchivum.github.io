You should send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot and they can help you from there :D\nFrom now its basically a waiting game.\n\nHere are some guidelines for submitting a support ticket that will ensure the smoothest and fastest response possible:\n\n> Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you (although majority of tickets are answered within 48 hours), so be patient","replies":[]}]}
