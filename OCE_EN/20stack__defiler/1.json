They had a large ban wave for cheaters recently so the fraud department might be going through lots of support tickets right now. Just hang on and try to be patient; they *will* get to your ticket, it just may take some more time. If you're waiting on a response to your ticket make sure not to post comments in it or it will be bumped to the back of the queue again.\n\nThanks, DTN.\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a1b3153b844387ef52d2ac08b68abe10.png","replies":[{"poster":"20Stack  Defiler","date":"2016-01-15T05:00:45.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah okay thank you !!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-15T01:33:41.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a ticket number for your request?
