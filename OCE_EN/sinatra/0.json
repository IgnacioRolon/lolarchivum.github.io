I want you to try running the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) and tell it to \"force repatch.\" It sounds like a file or two is corrupted or not playing nice. Let's see if that fixes the issue. I would also recommend that you do not restart your computer while it's doing this as you might make the problem worse.","replies":[]}]}
