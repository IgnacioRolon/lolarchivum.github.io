I like champions who are strong laners, have good teamfight, have cc (not necessary) and most importantly, can fend for themself and make solo plays, not needing to rely on other champions to get myself fed or to get myself out alive.\r\n\r\nThis used to consist of Ahri, Liss, Syndra, Fizz and Talon (Basically only when I have AP Damage elsewhere). \r\n\r\nAfter, the Fizz changes, he's dropped out my list. Syndra is a lot weaker now, not quite the laner she used to be, and her stun is a fair bit harder to hit but I guess I could still fall back on her. And now my favourite Mid laner just got nerfed, Lissandra. Haven't played her yet so not sure how she'll be but if she's just no where near as good as she used to be, who do I have left?\r\n\r\nAhri and Talon? lolol. Could you guys suggest some mid laners who fit my criteria?

AD fizz is now insanely strong. build AD and deal tons of mixed damage. add in attack speed, take out tanks with W alone.\n\n\"syndra is weaker now boo hoo\" translates to \"i cant hit skill shots, before i could just DFG R and kill people, now i have to actually hit skill shots but i cant cos i suck\"\n\n\"now my fav mid laner got nerfed\" translates to \"i only ride the OP train. if it aint broke i dont touch it\" in that case, go play riven.\n\nahri is currently one of the strongest mid laners with almost no bad match ups. a bad match up just means she needs to roam down bot for a kill. and with the increased wave clear and mobility...it isnt hard. and in solo queue thats broken. going 0-2 in lane and then just walking down bot for a free double kill because 0 map awareness....bam fed ahri who can just kite for days lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-13T05:02:55.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz does output more damage now if you combo correctly, but old Fizz didn't NEED to. You could start with any ability you wanted to, and still have enough damage to kill any champion you wanted to. Often you weren't in a good spot to start with Chum the Waters, and if that was the case with new Fizz, you'd lose all your damage. AD Fizz is strong, but not as strong as old AP FIzz.\n\nI never complained about the fact that Syndra is now weaker, I only stated that fact to bring forward the point I was trying to get across. I can hit skill shots just fine on Syndra, back then and now. And I never ever built DFG on Syndra, not once. It's fucking stupid.\n\nAgain, wasn't crying about the Lissandra nerfs, was just stating the fact. What? \"now my fav mid laner got nerfed\" does not in any way, shape or form translate to \"i only ride the OP train\". I've never been one to ride the hype train on the stupidly broken champs, never touched Akali, never touched Kat. I've played Riven like 3 times ever.\n\nAhri does have bad matchups, true, not a lot but her worst matchup is played in Solo Queue very often. Yasuo is in every freaking game. And  about the roams down to bot lane that is quite literally every mid laner in the game. Zed, Talon, Kat, Akali, Syndra, Orianna, Brand, Yasuo, Lissandra. Every mid laner has good roaming potential, sure Ahri's is very very good, but she doesn't even have the best roams. She got more mobility but with the damage nerfs to W and mana cost increase on her Q, her waveclear in the early game has actually diminished somewhat.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-13T05:59:04.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"whinge whinge whinge, bitch bitch bitch. thats all you are doing...\n\nfizz does more damage if played properly...instead of braindead \"use any ability first and not worry about messing a combo cos he was broken\"\nyou have no idea about balance...you just go with the most OP thing that takes no skill. and then complain if it gets nerfed/changed. even if the change is a buff to playing CORRECTLY.\n\n\"syndra is now weak\" \"i never complained that she is weak\" RIGHT....ok retard...keep thinking you didnt just say what you just said.\n\nmost played champs when they are most OP....stops playing them after nerfs....YEAH thats not riding the OP train AT ALL...fuck you are stupid.\n\nyas is rarely played since he got nerfed to the ground and has to rely on team knock ups to even COMPETE with other top mid picks.\nand new ahri gets added mobility to deal with his wall just fine. the only thing that makes him \"good\" vs her.\n\nnot all mid laners have the mobility of ahri....AND the wave clear.\nzed sure, but when he loses and is behind he can settle back into a split push beast.\ntalon....to push the lane enough to roam he will go oom....and then he cant roam as easily as ahri. he also only has the mobility on his ult and dash, required for the gank. also full single target with no CC.\nkat, yup, exactly the same as ahri. but has a lot more bad matchups.\nakali, same as kat.\nsyndra....no mobility, oom to push wave, you already complained that she was nerfed.\nori, wave clear good, good vs almost all match ups. good mobility. a slightly better ahri in that sense.\nbrand terrible. no mobility, reliant on combo and landing skill shots. you have already said you are trash at skill shots. and he is slow moving on top of all that.\nyas, great with a knock up support. but lacks wave clear to push out the wave fast enough to gank without losing tower.\n\nahri can still clear the wave just fine. and pushes a LOT of match ups to the tower easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-13T14:54:47.637+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lolol man, how in the fuck am I whinging or bitching? You're the one being incredibly salty and rude lol.\n\nYou do realise that's WHY I'm saying he was broken? No shit the changes were for the better because now he takes actual combo-ing. What I'm saying is before the changes, any jack and his dog could play him and wreck because he took no logic, you're not paying attention to my arguments nor to your counter arguments. The statement about me going with the most OP thing that takes no skill is completely false on so many levels. I do not play Kat, Annie, Riven, Yi, Akali, any of those champions. I hate playing champions like that. \n\n\"syndra is now weak\" is not a fucking complaint, I was stating a fact that was in context to the the topic of my post. \n\nAgain, I do not ever play the most OP champs, I play champions that suit my style, but in saying that, you still always want to pick the stronger champions, and when they get nerfed, it's completely ok not to play them anymore, since they are no longer strong. You could climb from Bronze 5 to Challenger only playing Urgot, and then you could do the same thing playing Katarina and take half the time, it would also be smarter.\n\nYasuo is in a lot of my games, and it's not just the windwall, dodging skillshots is so easy to do in laning phase as Yasuo since he has a shittone of instant dashes.\n\nA lot of these examples are bad yes, but that wasn't the point I was trying to make. What I meant was, if that's your only reason for classing Ahri as broken, then there a SHITTONE more broken champions in the game. By the way, when the fuck did I say I was trash at skill shots? I'd be spamming Ryze and Warwick in Solo queue if that was the case.\n\nDude I made a post asking for some champion recommendations from the OCE Community and you come here literally just looking to be a dick.

How tragic.  A champion in a *team based game* that works best with the team around? Even worse. Am I right?\n\nReally though, Brand's damage doesn't need to be more reliable. His burst is high, his passive is great for bullying and his dueling potential with E>Q>W should not be underestimated, not should his ult as a jungle gank deterrent  and I suppose that is the problem people have with him, they think his weaknesses outweigh his carry potential and is so easy to deal with. He is balanced and tonnes of people don't like that.\n\nAlso, Brand is not slow moving, there are more champions with the same speed or slower.\n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Movement_speed/Table","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-15T08:29:48.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used to love brand and play him all the time. its just with the meta shift he isnt a very good mid anymore. maybe an ok top with the whole shift to tanky AP tops. with ROA/rylias/zonyas/liandries and some MR item...i can see him working fine in that aspect...\nbut as it stands, support brand is the most viable since the nerf to range jungling. (camps resetting faster and more often means he cant clear effectively even later in the game.\n\nanyway, my point was for the OP. brand is a much too difficult champ for such a retarded piece of shit.\n\nbut yeah, brands biggest problem is that he is perfectly balanced and has defined strengths and weaknesses. unlike most of the popular mid picks.\n\nbut he is still slow as balls. the new MS/AP item might not be needed on him for the passive, but it sure as hell would help him with the MS and AP.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-13T06:12:40.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprised no one here has mentioned Annie, strong in lane, massive CC, and can generally nuke a carry for face checking a bush solo.\n\nShe's also strong against most of the strong mid laners at the current time.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-13T06:28:33.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel so cheap tho :3","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-13T11:10:31.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's ranked, you play to win, everyone else plays FoTM champs, so why not just play champs that counter them?\n\nHere i am having Annie as a 7 game, 100% win rate, because even in the rare case i get behind (i swear i've only vsed leblanc as Annie in ranked) i always have the superior CC of the two mid laners and can bring the game back with bush wookies (generally a carry facechecking) and 4-5 man flash stuns.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-13T14:33:59.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm ok...
