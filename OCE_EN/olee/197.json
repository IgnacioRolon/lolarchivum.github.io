Obviously Urgot is the best AD Tank eater\n\nAnyone who does damage based on health or health % malz W does this, i only know him, also brand eats trhough swain if you keep him ablaze it acts like ignite but instead of true damage its magic damage, for any tank give them a liandries torment watch their health disappear","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-16T00:19:21.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I guess Brand is a great tank eater and maybe just Void plus Liandry's for any super tanky front line\n\nKayle is another mid laner that's great at eating tanks!

They will get Qd and they will die. A good ult on a good target can also turn the tides of a battle\n\nSo Morellos and Ignite is like the only thing? If the Swain is fed enough it's seriously not enough\n\nYeah, I find that so hard to do tho, just gotta practice that I guess\n\nI just wish my top laners knew this\n\n100% agreed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-14T23:24:38.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TSM BjergWannabe,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4IkJrxV1,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-14T23:11:10.659+0000)\n>\n> How do I play against\n> \n> Mid lane Urgot in lane and in the mid game\n\nyou play like a bitch. because if not he'll stomp you.\n\n> Mid lane Swain in lane and mid to late game\n\nPoke him pre 6 as much as you can, take ignite, get your jungler to gank at >6 so he doesn't get ahead.\n \n> Diana in any role AS the mid laner. Do I just roll over and cry if she gets fed?\n\nyes, be careful of her level 6 spike. if she goes b and comes back with blasting wand or better she can and should all in you to chunk your hp or kill you.\n\n> Top lane Nasus AS the mid laner from mid to late game\n\nLet your adc deal with him lol. \n\n> Top lane Riven AS the mid laner. Do I just do same thing as I would with a fed Diana if Riven gets fed?\n\nYes, cc her, gapclose away from her, etc etc. although I'd say your adc should be more worried of her than you","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-14T23:42:12.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bitch as in like super safe?

And if she's jungle or top and I'm mid, the fuck do I do? Cry? Should I just start spamming Diana in Ranked? She seems ridiculously strong atm\n\nYah but what if they're not a tank killing adc? And they're on like the other side of the map lol\n\nKK","replies":[]}]}]}
