What&#039;s a good number to have by 20 minutes?\r\n\r\nAlso, I play Mid mostly and I find it incredibly hard to farm in the mid game because everyone is in Mid. EVERYONE.

Average like 6.5 a min. But im just a silver scrub.\n\nIf you are seiging and getting tower pressure then its fine. However if 3-4 waves go by and nothing has happened, just go farm jungle camps like Wolves or Raptors between waves or go to another lane and push it out if nothing is happening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-05T10:04:38.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Around 200.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-05T09:42:12.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg boards bugged and i posted twice","replies":[]}]}
