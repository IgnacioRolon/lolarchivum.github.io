Also, I don't play much Evelynn, so I shouldn't be the one telling you how to play her.\n\nHowever, Nidalee has quite good sustain in Jungle and her clear isn't too shabby as well. With Nidalee, I recommend starting with Hunter's Talisman, Refillable Potion and a normal trinket ward, of course. Starting Q is recommended, then W, then E. Max Q first, then E. Use Javelin Toss (human form Q) and Bushwhack (human form W) to help kite the big monster in the jungle camps, as they stop the target for a brief period of time and also heal whenever you can. \n\nPretty much, you want to be kiting as much as you can during early clears. \nFor melee big monsters, this is a full rotation, start in human form, use Q and place your trap next to it (for kiting after cougar form), use heal if you're not full health, switch to cougar form, then W>E>Q, switch back to human form and kite the monster into your trap then auto attack and repeat process once monster is within melee range of you again. \nFor ranged big monsters, they aren't very tough to kill, so just repeat the same process, but there's no need for kiting.\n(If someone finds an error in this paragraph above, please correct it).\n\nFor runes, go 3x flat AP Quints / 9x flat Armor Seals / 9x flat AD Marks / 9x flat AP Glyphs - There are a few different rune pages for Nidalee jungle, but I found this one to be the most effective for early game (which the current meta is early game based).\n\nFor masteries, use these --> http://imgur.com/6R2IioP\n\nI recommend getting Skirmisher's Sabre into Runeglaive ASAP and getting normal boots then Rod of Ages. After Rod of Ages, upgrade your boots into Lucidity boots. You don't have to wait until you have Rod of Ages to upgrade your boots, but I recommend it. You then build according to the game, but to give some examples of possible items: Zhonyas Hourglass, Abyssal Scepter, Void Staff and Rabadon's Deathcap. If you reach full build, you can sell your Runeglaive and purchase Lich Bane if you wish, but it's unlikely your game will reach that stage in this early game based meta.\n\nYou can upgrade your Refillable Potion into Hunter's Potion if you want, but I rarely do.\n\nStrategies? Land your Javelin Toss. Kappa :) You can also Javelin Toss over walls into camps, then Pounce over, to same some time. Early clears, you should focus the small monsters first on the Wolf, Raptor and Krug camps. DON'T FORGET YOU JAVELIN TOSS AND BUSHWHACK STOPS MONSTERS FROM MOVING!!! SwiftRage\nAlso, once you get Sheen procs from Sheen and Runeglaive, try get every spell you do to proc it. So that means waiting for the cooldown to go then using another spell, to maximise damage.\n\n\n\nAnd for ADC builds, just look at: www.probuilds.net . This shows how a lot of professionals build on champions. Try to look at more recent games by professionals.\n\nGood luck!!! {{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
