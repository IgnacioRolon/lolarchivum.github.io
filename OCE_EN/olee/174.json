{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-19T07:35:20.663+0000","title":"I have never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever been so angry at a League of Legends player","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have never felt this salty or mad towards anyone that has anything to do with a video game in my life.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m red side first pick and this dude is 2nd pick, I call mid and he says he&#039;s going mid, I reiterate that I have pick order over him and when it&#039;s our turn to pick, like I expected, he locks in Syndra really quickly. I was already pissed as hell here, and when my entire team starts arguing with him, he condescendingly tries to justify by saying that &quot;we both pick at the same time, I picked first, &quot;pick order&quot;&quot;. I just knew he understood that&#039;s not actually how it worked, but he was lying, I just knew. \r\n\r\nWe get into the game, I ended up going Thresh, we get first blood as soon as we hit level 2, my adc was great and our top laner had so much pressure, it was all going good, (I was in promos). Syndra, dies, and was half her opponent&#039;s cs, sure, I just let it go and didn&#039;t say anything. She dies once more and then says that she&#039;s afk and she &quot;doesn&#039;t feel like playing anymore&quot; and that it&#039;s &quot;bad luck&quot; for us because she can&#039;t be bothered. I asked the enemy team to report her, (I&#039;ve heard the more reports a player gets the more effective it is), I say that she ignored the champ select rules and that she&#039;s afk and also she said she might intentionally feed, she then types in all chat that we as a team have been collectively flaming her all game (none of us had said a word), and this is when my blood started to boil. She was acting so upset and and sad about all the accused toxicity we&#039;ve been throwing at her and the enemy team believed her and stated they were reporting the rest of the team. EVEN after my entire team had all said they didn&#039;t say a word of abuse to her. They then started to call us all bad and was supporting Syndra and oh my god. I couldn&#039;t hold it in, I flamed. I flamed like I&#039;ve never flamed before. You have to understand, that&#039;s a big thing, I don&#039;t flame, I know it&#039;s wrong, but I couldn&#039;t help myself. I always try to give constructive criticism, or be kinda passive aggressive, but I&#039;m never hostile. It was bad, I don&#039;t do that shit, but I was so angry, sure I lost promos, I&#039;ll get it back, no biggie. I was more mad at how much of a wanker this dude was. And then the enemy team eventually started trolling us, insulting us and making fun of us when we were actually winning before Syndra chucked a tantrum. I don&#039;t know why I posted this but god I was angry. \r\n\r\n/rantover","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-19T07:42:20.399+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey olee,\n\nYa, it sucks when people do that.
