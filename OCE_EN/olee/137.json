This was changed a little while back for clarity/balance across lanes. Although I don't believe there was ever a time where you could run out of the shop range and back in to refund anything. \n\nIf you buy an item and deal/take any form of damage from something like a nid/cait/teemo/jhin trap then this would stop your refund as well. Just in case this could have been an issue you have experienced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-10T11:11:32.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lag?","replies":[]}]}
