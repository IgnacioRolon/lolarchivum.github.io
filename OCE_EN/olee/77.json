He&#039;s a huge dragon with a big in game model, in his teaser he&#039;s like crushing stars and controlling comets and shit, and he&#039;s a DRAGON and we get that? It seems so boring and ordinary! It doesn&#039;t feel like RIto delivered in the slightest with his ult, rest of the kit is cool though!\r\n\r\nP.S I know it&#039;s been a whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile since I posted on Boards. It just felt like the Boards threads got boring repetitive, but I&#039;m back! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-10T06:49:20.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to have you back on the boards man :D\n\nI wouldn't say it's a _\"lackluster\"_ ult. I think it's just that most people are used to seeing champions where their ult is absolutely core in their kits. Some recent examples of this is; **Jhin**, **Tahm Kench**, **Kindred**, **Ekko**... etc.\n\nAll those champions ults almost define them, they are heavily linked to their theme or lore and are very unique. \n\nBut in the case of **Aurelion Sol** it's actually his passive that defines him as champion. When you look at his [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAAnY_L4Pp4) the ability they show/hint at is his passive. The ult is really just there to facilitate the use of his passive, because it knocks them back into passive range.\n\nJust my thoughts on it. We shouldn't judge to early before trying him out for ourselves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-10T09:30:07.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have just been spoilt by all the new complex ults like Kindred/Azir/Jhin/Illaoi, so we are failing to realise that his ult, while not as complex as theirs, is actually far more interesting than a lot of pre-existing ults.\n\nLets look at what it actually does:\nIts a long range skillshot.\nit deals damage.\nIt slows \nIt knocks back if they are within a certain radius of the cast point.\n\nsure it doesn't create a safe zone that heals everything inside afterwards, or allow you to snipe halfway across the map with crits, but its a hell of a lot more interesting than say:\n\nLux's R (a point and click skillshot that does nothing but damage)\n\nGaren's R (a point and click targetable ability that does nothing but damage)\n\nJax's R (some random buff)\n\nthe list goes on and on.\n\nso yea its not as interesting as Kindred's but its far far far from being one of the boring 'old league' ults.\n\nthe rest of his kit is pretty revolutionary, so I'm sure we can allow him one ability that doesn't flip the universe on its head.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-10T10:57:14.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no!
