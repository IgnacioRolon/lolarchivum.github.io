Why is Statik Shiv SPECIFICALLY core on Yasuo? Why not {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} ? You&#039;re still achieving 100% Crit Chance but you&#039;re not sacrificing the early game by having to take Crit Reds in your runes and you&#039;re reaching your biggest power spike, an item earlier. Allowing you to go for a bigger range of items afterwards like {{item:3035}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3139}} \r\n\r\nOr, {{item:3087}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3031}}? Also getting 100% Crit, but you&#039;re getting some more neat stats and a cool active.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not an expert on Yasuo at all, but please, discuss!","replies":[{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-10-19T16:21:48.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"shiv simply works better for yasuo then phantomD. You attack with a mix of Q and AA's ,so the higher attack-speed of phantom dancer isnt quite as important. shiv gives slightly higher movement speed bonus , which charges your passive faster. shiv also provides you with some added magic damage to your purely physical kit , and triggers an AOE , which helps with wave clear , lane poke and team fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-19T15:40:24.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"triforce is pretty good on him. the sheen procs regularly since no cds, the phage passive is really great for sticking which yas does frequently, and the zeal portion is more effective than both of these. im just surprised i dont see double zeal more.\n\n2 zeals = 2200, 20% crit 40% atkspd. 4% more movspd\nshiv = 2500, same crit and atk spd, 4% less movspd, farm-helping passive, which is apparently more valuable than 300 gold and 4% movspd\n\neveryones paranoid about not having that final 20% crit with just ie shiv, more paranoid than just having ie as a crit item\n\ni wouldnt like pd ie on him though, its a waste of 5-10% crit for another 300 wasteful gold. id rather just get shiv then ie, maybe a zeal next or lifesteal/last whisper. it varies per game i guess, but its hard to gauge when you'd absolutely need the triforce with its passives and when you'd need lifesteal/last whisper for damage","replies":[]},{"poster":"ExtremeSniper","date":"2015-10-25T10:22:13.582+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olee, I'll try my best to explain, when you are defending/seiging (Grouped Mid 5) then you will need to stay alert for any fights, so you need Q(3) ready for your ult, and your Q applies shiv proc (waveclear a bit) and the Magic damage on shiv also crits, and when you E, you move which means you charge the shiv faster, you do mix damage which is good so they can't totally build thornmail and sht over you, Shiv is also cheaper and has a gold item involved so it's even  more cheap","replies":[]}]}
