As soon as we load onto the rift, it just freezes and all I can see are my teammates at the shop and I'm not there. And occasionally it also freezes at random points in the game. It's happened twice today and I'm have to force my laptop to shutdown via forcing the power off button, restart again, log back into league and then reconnect to the game and I'm always 5-6 levels behind when this happens. \n\nAlso I don't know if this has anything to do with it but so far it's only happened with Yasuo.\n\nPLEASE HELP URGENTLY.\n\nEDIT: I tried entering two custom games. One with Yasuo and one with Syndra, I think this problem is just with Yas, because Syndra was fine and Yasuo's game did the same thing.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T03:53:28.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting the exact same issues. I think the recent changes to Yasuo in this patch are causing it, as a lot of other people are also getting it. Hope a red jumps onto this, it's just mildly annoying for me (I'm not crashing during game, but always at the start if I'm playing Yasuo).","replies":[]}]}
