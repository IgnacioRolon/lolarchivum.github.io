It makes no sense with the rest of her kit, she's gone from an assassin to a safe kite mage... with an ability that requires you to go into almost melee range to do any damage with. Before you tell me, \"That's the point, a bit of risk for some reward\" no. Ahri already does very little damage *compared to most of the popular mid laners*. Her W's numbers already took a really really big hit and you can't spam Q anymore. \"Oh but you need to risk it and get close if you wanna 100% someone\" Ahri can't 100% anyone anymore unless really fed, which I've come to terms with. I for one just love her safety, can we just go with that? She seriously does no where near as much damage as she used to. Keep the damage nerfs, buff the range, even just a bit. \r\n\r\nAlso, some quality of life changes to her W would be awesome, after an E+Q on her, the W almost never goes off, and the fox fire orbs take so long to to lock on a target now. Her W has turned into one of the clunkiest abilities in League xD","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-27T02:21:20.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The idea WAS to move her from being an assassin to a safe kite mage.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-27T06:04:45.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know...
