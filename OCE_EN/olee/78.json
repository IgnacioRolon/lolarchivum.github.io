Other than that the new phantom dancer reduce the damage dealt by 12% from the last enemy you attacked.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-03T21:12:47.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I question the balance these items bring into the game....","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-11-04T05:48:29.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the item that turn 20% damage taken into bleed for 6s has been nerf to turn only 12% damage taken into bleed dmg for 3s.

No they don't always need to build Zhonya's most assassinations can be avoided through smart play and/or teamwork.\n2. The Armour would be useless against Magic Damage assassins.\n3. Assassins are high risk, high reward, if a Zed was able to kill your AD Carry in a teamfight, then he deserved to, since he made himself completely available to your team for enough time to cc him and kill him since he is squishy as hell\n4. I've seen plenty of Zeds build Maw\n5.
