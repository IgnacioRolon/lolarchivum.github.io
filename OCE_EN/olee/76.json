I'm kinda torn. \r\n\r\nIf he isn't ban worthy as a generally strong champ, is he ban worthy in my specific situation?\r\n\r\nOkay, so in solo Ranked, my go to role is Mid. And my go to champion is Fizz. Now he's banned a lot, so when he is, my second in line is Syndra. And Zed, hard counters Syndra, or so I've heard. I don't know if this is true, but all I know is that I always tend to do horribly with playing a Zed as Syndra. No matter what, I can't pinpoint exactly what it is though, it's definitely not the fact that he can dodge my ult as I almost always leave my Q+E stun till last in my combo, just before I Ult.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is, when I'm playing other champs against Zed, I seem to sometimes do fine and sometimes get rekt. Zeds seem to be 50/50 with their skill level. Sometimes I wreck Zeds, sometimes Zeds wreck me. And even when I DO wreck him in lane, when he roams, no matter how many times I ping or type in chat, some people on Solo Queue just don't listen. \r\n\r\nLastly, EVERYONE plays Zed, and to be completely and utterly honest, I would ban him just so I can verse someone else in Mid for a change. I get really really really bored of versing Zeds in mid.","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-09T03:12:40.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed can hard carry games if played right. You could be ahead, but once Zed gets a triple kill, it's game over.\nI always ban Zed.
