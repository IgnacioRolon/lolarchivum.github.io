Which means that at level 9, her passive still brings her Q up to around about the same damage and the Rank 3 buff actually means when you hit level 6, you have a stronger Q than before but it's just not so dominant earlier than that.\r\n\r\nI guess this just means you gotta play a little safer/more passively until you hit 6 and then you can just cheese all in like usual. (well you don't have to be more passive early but you won't be as much of a bully any more)\r\n\r\nIs anyone else picking up any other massive changes that this will bring? I'm so sad they nerfed my Syndra :(","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-01-16T08:30:44.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well... Yeah... I guess she was a little strong...
