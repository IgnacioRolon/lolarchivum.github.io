Rammus is really good right now, Not sure if Sejuani is good. For full damage AP jungler who is also a little tanky try Diana. Mundo is good now too and he does a lot of damage while going full tank. Maokai is good too but he can't really carry a game by himself. Other than that im pretty sure Nautilus is good right now too. Honestly we are pretty much back to the tank meta so playing tanks in the jungle will probably be the best for the current meta. Ap mages are kinda weak right now because of the nerf to ap items and buffs to MR items, so if you are going to play an AP jungler it is probably better to play a tanky one with a lot of CC who is good at ganking because games end pretty quick right now and ganking junglers will help snowball the game. Oh yeah, Tahm kench and Volibear is really good too, they both have really good clears and Tahm kench ganks aren't bad and volibear is really good at ganking. ","replies":[]}]}
