I&#039;m just running Deathfire&#039;s on everyone at the moment but I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s the best since AOE spells get half the effect from it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-15T19:42:08.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every single spell you land increases the scaling output total of Deathfire by 0.1 or 0.2 for single target within 30 seconds - compared to Thunderlord's.\n\nSo while Thunderlords might go 10-180 flat damage and Deathfire sits at 6 (3 for AOE) - within a team fight you can essentially as Ahri hit a Q on 5 people and have it apply 0.5 (That's a huge ratio) of your AP as DoT [3 seconds]).\n\nSo like Thunderlord's might seem good, but once you're hitting 600 AP and poke 5 people for 0.5 of your AP that's 300 Damage over time total which far exceeds Thunderlord's which is once every 30 seconds. Personally I take Thunderlord's on support annie because of her auto-Q-Auto gaining a per level boost with a proc used to zone each wave and because the other 2 cunning tree masteries aren't really good for her, one is useless as she doesnt rlly heal or shield people and Stormraiders doesnt really seem necessary or useful.\n\nPoke 5 people twice within 30 seconds and you've done 1:1 AP Ratio as Damage over time whereas Thunderlord's only applies in a tiny AOE and is 10-180 plus .2 of your Bonus AD and .1 of your total AP so, bearing in mind for single target spells like Ahri's W (Multi-hit single target) it is applying a 1:0.2 ratio so if you land a few of these during a fight (within 30 seconds) that's 10 Q's and 2 x3 W's which is 0.6:1 (W) plus 1:1 (10 Q's) of your AP as a bleed (1.6 AP Ratio as a bleed effect) and with a 7 second base CD on your Q and 5 second base CD on your W you can easily exceed this within 30 seconds.\n\nCome late game that's 1.6K Bleed which is 10x as good as Thunderlord's (No exaggeration). Plus it's not limited to a tiny area around 1 target but applies on your spells.\n\nSo while you might be happy with a proc every 30 seconds, you never know when fights will start and when they do - having a huge bleed effect far exceeds having a nice keystone until having deathfire would have exceeded it in usefulness by 10 or even 20 times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-15T01:24:01.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Deathfire is actually just straight up shit, it's designed for poke mages really, but even then they are better off going elsewhere.\n\nDeathfire: 6 + 50% BAD + 20% AP\n\nThunderlords: 10-180 (scales by level) + 20% BAD + 10% AP in an AoE\n\nGiven how most games are about snowballing, Thunderlords is vastly superior.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-15T04:02:34.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure but Thunderlord's has a 30 sec cooldown and requires you to hit three spells/autos before it procs.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-15T04:38:02.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes because being able to have a massive out trade once every wave isn't massive.\n\nAlso just as a note, it's 3 procs of spell damage.\n\nFor example, Anivia Q will proc with the Q hitting, and again with the stun meaning an Anivia Q+Q stun+E = thunderlord's\n\nThe same sort of thing exists for leblanc (E>Q>Proc Q) and several other champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-15T07:13:50.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've switched already :P\n\nAnd I was watching Phreak talk about this and he said that it doesn't count DoT damage like Brand's Passive, or Cass poison.

Basically, how you want to choose your masteries is look at all nine of the keystones, and decide which one you want. Don't put points into a tree if you want say more damage or something and then just deal with a sub par keystone at the end. Pick which keystone you want, then get it, then put the points elsewhere. So for an AP mage, if I was burst I would grab the Keystone that lets me get MoveSpeed when I chunk someone, and put the rest of my points into ferocity for some more damage. If I was an immobile mage, I would grab Thunderlord's Decree and put the rest of my points into resolve to grab some movespeed and grab the CDR on my summoner spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-15T04:00:22.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually how I did it.
