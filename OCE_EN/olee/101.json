I might be wrong but I&#039;ve gone on loss streaks before but still had great LP gain since I was still doing well in game\n\nEDIT: I just finished my provisionals, won 7-3 and got placed in Bronze 2 when I ended in I think Silver 3 last season. No complaints, it's all g, I'll climb. MAYBE even to Gold this season, I feel confident enough","replies":[{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2016-01-22T10:32:15.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In game stats have literally no affect on mmr/rank where did you hear such bullsht lmfao.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-22T17:09:25.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh lol I can't remember where I heard it from but I did hear it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-01-21T20:04:02.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like you.
