Add to that it's the biggest patch I've ever seen (it's a beast this one) and of course there's going to be problems with it. Yeah they overcompensated some AD champs, especially crit champs and the ADCs that got changed. Yeah they're gonna have to give the mana changes some tuning. But this is the FIRST patch. \n\nAs far as overall balance, and even for individual champions, PBE testing cannot compare to live testing no matter how hard it tries for one simple reason - the population is not large enough. With that in mind, it'd be great if people would say \"ok I think Graves is too strong\" Instead of \"OMG GRAVES IS SO OP RITO YOU'RE BREAKING THIS FKING GAME OMG I'M QUITTING\". Seriously guys, give it AT LEAST one patch, preferably two or three until you start getting so worried. \n\nMost if not all of the issues people are having tantrums about Riot is very aware of and will never make it into next season. This is what the preseason is for, they roll out massive game-changing patches then tune them in the couple months they have till the next season. Preseason is when the game evolves the most, and thus when the balance shifts the most. I.E there's always going to be balance issues in preseason, report it and get over it, you can't balance a patch like that overnight, nevermind right from minute one.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-15T00:49:07.195+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Add to that it's the biggest patch I've ever seen (it's a beast this one)\n\nPretty sure it's the biggest patch in terms of words, or even subjects (That right hand bar that gives you the links to all the types of changes, yeah that doesn't fit on my shitty laptop screen)","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-15T03:20:20.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah for the first time ever I couldn't be fucked reading everything in the patch loool","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-15T05:07:07.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This comment explains this whole post\n\"TELL ME WHAT EVERYONE HATES ABOUT THIS PATCH\"\n\nif you read it you'd know.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-15T07:10:08.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, , just because I couldn't be fucked reading  the patch, that doesn't mean that I didn't look at all the changes.

Ok let's change around a few of the adc's, that'll be a laugh\"\n\nThe warding change is little short of pathetic, they had a great system before with wards and trinkets and made warding a key element of doing well, and now it's like wtf...\n(I do like the option of a non wasted space sightstone though) \n\n\nAnd the mana change is bs, like who honestly complained about mana last season? Seriously Where did that change come from?\nThe main complaints were \"vayne's op\" \"yasuo's op\" \"juggernauts need a nerf\" \"it's too easy for teams to snowball\" and riot took all that feedback and thought \"we'll take away mana pots! That'll fix all these problems!\"\nLike seriously Mages were the least complained about thing the whole season and so now they all get massive mana gameplay changes? Like why??\nNot to mention it screws up some top champs like kha and singed royally. It was a good system that no one complained about, why was this major change nessesary?\n\n\n\nBut don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining because it's all changed, I was massively for the new summoners rift, enhanced jungling/smite options, new support items, champion updates, new interesting (non brain dead) champs etc etc. \nI was against the HUD update but all the things I was complaining about with that were fixed later on so im ok with it now.

Just about every AD built the exact same items in the exact same order last season which sucked. And while some of the AD's had defined roles and strengths didn't really, or at least it felt like they didn't (I don't AD much)\n\nNow there's something a was a little unhappy about, the removal of Stealth Wards. It feels like they're dumbing down the vision game and I don't like that. I feel like the team that has the initiative and wits to buy wards or upgrade their trinkets deserves the vision. But, I definitely love the slot efficient Sightstones too.\n\nI honestly did not understand their justifications for the removal of mana pots in the Patch Notes, it was wierd. \n\nAnd I don't know man, I like a lot of these changes and even some of my champions were hurt a little in this patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-16T04:54:16.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as why they changed AD champs, I believe it is part of much larger scale changes that are still ongoing, after the Juggernaut updates, it became pretty clear they weren't gonna leave it there, and I don;t think they're gonna leave it here either. No'one really thought the Juggernaut changes were all that necessary but everyone got used to it in the end. It seems like there's a bigger end game (as end game as it can get on a game in permanent development) that we can't see yet because we don't have that inside perspective.\n\nThe item changes honestly were much needed, the ADC builds were so cookie cutter, there were 2 or three to pick from and that was it. The whole idea here is to diversify, make it so you can play the way YOU want, and the way that fits YOUR playstyle, instead of just going and copying pro guides. Heaven forbid they might make some of us actually use our brains to play this game ey...\n\nAs for the mana changes, I believe it was to compensate for the new masteries/refillables or something like that. On some champs I actually feel my mana conservation is if anything a little better than before the patch and all that had really changed on my end was masteries (and vaguely updated runes but no mana there, this is primarily in supp fyi). Now I don't know exactly why they changed mana, and as I don;t play champs like Singed I can't speak for them, but in supp and mid at least it doesn't seem to be having a negative impact...maybe I'm just used to playing with limited mana with the way I play.

The items that these AD champions you're complaining about got, are insane, a little less mana regen in lane is a fair trade, I don't see a lane Kha Zix spamming that much anyway and GP has a mana refund for 50% on his Q. AND from memory, I see lots of Lane Kha's go Muramana anyway.\n\nBecause Sheen had 20 AP on it and to keep the Spellblade procs on it, you needed to build Sheen which needed to translate to the Trinity Force. Gnar has a 50% AP Ratio on his Ult and a 100% AP ratio on Hyper. You're losing 30 damage on Hyper and 15 on your ult. Your Hyper already does Max HP% damage, 30 isn't gonna affect him THAT much, I mean in a scrap you'll be proccing quite often but this is so miniscule I don't see how it's even worth bringing up like, GP also only loses like 27 HP on his W and THREE DAMAGE PER WAVE OF HIS ULT. In this entire patch you found 30 AP to complain about? It sounds like you're reaching. You will not even notice it dude. The 10% CDR benefits SO many more champions than 30 AP. And, I think it will benefit GP and Gnar more too. \n\nYou leave your turret unattended with a Graves he'll do the same thing, a Caityn, a Tristana, a Jinx, a Quinn, a Talon, an Irelia, a Jax, an Udyr, a Sivir, an Ashe, they will all do the same thing. Kog even has AD reduction on his W to gate that. He kills them slightly faster. Slightly.\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't see that post, my bad. \n\nAnd just wait, people will start to realise how strong these new ADs are and they'll pick them up. The problem is, people hate change, and it's doesn't seem like you're the biggest fan of it either. They're too used to playing what they like and what's safe, like Jinx and Tristana. As for Vayne, as long as Doublelift and hi im gosu play League of Legends, I'm sorry but people will still keep playing Vayne.\n\nLeague of Legends is a big game we have so many champions and so many items now. As things get stronger, other things will get weaker that's just how it is and we have to accept that. It would be near impossible to make every single champion in the entire game strong and balanced. It was only weeks ago when Gangplank had a 100% pick/ban at Worlds and was destroying Solo Q in the hands of a good player, now, he suffers a little bit. But, did you ever see Miss Fortune get picked and do well? Well now she's strong as fuck. Syndra was dominant as hell last year, now she's non existent. Leblanc dissapeared for a while. When Fizz, Lissandra and Syndra all got nerfs at the start of this year, they were my favourite Solo Q champions and I was shattered, but I **moved on** because there's nothing you can do about it, endlessly complaining about how much Riot blew up the world will do nothing. I found new champions that I now love and I found what was strong and just went with it.\n\nRiot HAS to change the Meta because when it was the Assassin meta everyone fucking cried. The Tank meta, everyone fucking cried, the Juggernauts, everyone fucking cried, hell people were crying that the mage meta was too fucking boring. Now that it's the time of the ADC's (and it's about fucking time they added a little spice to this role) everyone is fucking crying. People complain about one Meta and when it moves to another one they complain about that one. How else is Riot gonna keep making this game interesting?

In the PBE right now, his W range is going from 600 to 700 and the Death Mark damage is going from 20%/35%/50% to 30%/40%/50%.\n\nHis level 6 is gonna be ridiculous now.\n\nZed is in a better spot than he has been in ages. Go play like 4 games, get used to the combo and realise how fucking great his itemisation options are right now.","replies":[]}]}]}
