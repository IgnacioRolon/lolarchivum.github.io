To take another step forward is to check your computer, keep up to date and spend a day to repair all your drivers and clean out all the junk and gunk on your computer, it'll make it faster in general and less likely for your computer to crash if you don't know what to do a quick google search should help, they're getting more and more simpler now days so even if you got D's on your report card you should be able to do it.\nGood luck and have fun on the Fields of Justice, I hope you may be Victorious.","replies":[]}]}
