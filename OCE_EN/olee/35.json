I'm strictly basing this off of how much each of these champions can offer to their team at any given time, not how much a champion _can_ snowball and carry. Warwick has ONE CC ability but after that, is a lumbering pile of kiteable uselessness, as is Yorick except he has a revive-y ult rather than a CC one. In fact, the same can be said about Illaoi, but, because she has a tone of AOE, in comparison to WW and Yorick's purely single target focused kits, she's a little more useful.\n\nTaric, has a targeted ranged stun on a basic ability's cooldown, that alone makes him amazing. You don't find many abilities like that in League, plus the aura he does provide is NUTS!\n\nEvelynn's stealth alone makes her one of the scariest junglers to play against, you're in constant fear of where she is and when she'll strike next. Sure once she comes out of it stealth, her kit is kind of mediocre, with a measly aoe slow and nothing but damage after that, but her flank aoe initation slows combined with her early game pressure easily puts her above WW and Yorick.\n\nBard has a so much CC and utility for his team, I'm not even gonna bother saying why he's useful. And Janna still stands as one of the best peel supports in the entire game, her kit is great and disengaging and keeping her carries alive.\n\nYeah, Karma is great.\n\nAnd I don't know man, Nidalee, is really good, much better than WW and Yorick if she's going even or is ahead, but if she's ahead, she offers even less than a WW or Yorick can to be honest...
