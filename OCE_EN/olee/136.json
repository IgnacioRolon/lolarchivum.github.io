Help PLS!!!!!!!!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My client is having immense issues at the moment and it is incredibly frustrating. It&#039;s running like literal shit at the moment. \r\nFrom the beginning, as soon as I open up the client and the big &quot;League of Legends&quot; icon appears in the middle of your screen, it sits for a bit, takes sometime to load up, and then the background in a rectangle around the logo turns black and then turns grey, when you click on it, it comes up with this &quot;PVP.net Patcher Kernel is not responding&quot; and then gives you the option to either &quot;Close the program&quot; or &quot;Wait for the program to respond&quot;. I choose to close the program, only for the client to finally open up 5 seconds later after I apparently made the decision to close it...\r\n\r\nThen, the &#039;launch&#039; and login screen are kinda fine, little slower than usual, but fine I guess. I tried to go into a Ranked queue and every 30 seconds or so, my league would disconnect, the client would grey out and I&#039;d get this &quot;Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out&quot;, and then, I&#039;d close the message, and the queue would kinda just go back to searching 5 seconds later, only for the client to disconnect and the same message to pop up again 30 seconds later. I managed to get into a queue the first time I tried and I just completely disconnected from Champ select. \r\n\r\nSo I tried going into a custom game. No queue needed so all I needed was to make a game, the first time I tried, I couldn&#039;t get past the &quot;Create Game&quot; screen it would get stuck on &quot;Retrieving Data from Server&quot; and I&#039;d just eventually have to close the client manually. The second time, I managed to get into Champ select at which point I tried to change a summoner spell and it just got stuck on the &quot;Retrieving Date from Server&quot; message and then onto the &quot;Connection Timeout: The request to the PVP.net server timed out&quot; message. I tried a third time, and this time the same thing happened but not until I tried to lock in a champion. \r\n\r\nMy internet works fine otherwise, everything else in fact is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-30T06:10:08.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"last time this happened to me I got hold of a riot sup and they sed one of my files were corrupt you mite need to uninstall and then install to fix it that's what I had to do","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-30T06:13:36.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I sent in a support ticket, just putting this on here to see if anyone else has a quicker fix to the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-30T06:18:05.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kk I hope you don't need to reinstall 3 hours of waiting later ow I can play and the sever is down lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}
