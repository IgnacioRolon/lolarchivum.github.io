Marin, Faker and Bjergsen. \r\n\r\nFaker is widely renowned as the world&#039;s best player, and the best player to ever play the game, while Marin and Bjergsen are known to be one of the best players today. But, I disagree with this. If you asked me in Season 3, I would&#039;ve jumped on the Faker hype train with literally no doubts whatsoever, he was a monster. But I feel like now, Faker is overrated and overhyped. He is simply claimed to be the world&#039;s best player because he is Faker. I feel like, the best player today, and I was thinking this WAY before he got MVP, is Marin. Marin is super duper consistent, whereas Faker isn&#039;t really anymore. He constantly crushes his lane and makes game winning/saving plays all while shotcalling and being the main voice for his team, that is a really hard thing to do, Faker doesn&#039;t have to do any of that.\r\n\r\nI also feel like, Bjergsen, has the means to beat almost anyone in the world in a 1v1, including Faker, but, I feel like as a general player, he is better than Faker. Bjergsen, this year, has been more consistent. I literally do not remember a single game this year where Bjergsen played terribly even when his team lost, whereas I&#039;ve actually seen Faker play a few bad games this year. And again, Bjergsen does all this while being the main voice for his team and shotcalling. Sure, he&#039;s not the best at doing this, you can see that in some of TSM&#039;s unnecessarily long games in both NA splits, but he still juggles two things at once. Not to mention he consistently crushes lane every game and makes so many solo kills happen.\r\n\r\nBlast me with your hatred! I feel like this is legit though.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-11-01T02:57:01.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree with you. \n\nI'm not really sure I've seen Faker make any massive plays in the later stages at worlds this year nor has he really been playing champs that can. Sure it was fun seeing him 100-0 people are Ryze but I don't feel like that's really what we were looking for. That isn't even to even mention that he let his team down with Lulu.\n\nWhat sums it up pretty well is a guy near me at the viewing party saying, \"They'll ban Zed 100%. Did you see his plays with him?\" I think we're all holding on to the good ol' days when we talk about how good Faker is. The world has caught up and the meta has changed.\n\nWho will take his crown I don't know. Haven't followed the scene long enough but Bjergsen and MaRin sound like good picks : )","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-01T03:37:34.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe if the meta was different Faker would still be at the top, but I can't say for sure.
