I remember playing Kat once and the AP ratio part of my ult damage was in the 4 digits... I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the scaling on it is hugeee.\n\nAnd well if that's case, my solution should still work. If you can CC her during her ult channel, then that means she can't proc her secondary Q damage in the first place.\n\nEdit: Sorry, just checked, you are correct. 25% it is. The 4 digits I mentioned must've been the maximum damage of the ult. But yeah, her Q will normally hit everyone and then the Ult itself will proc the Q on all the other targets.

Hard to target a target who teleports.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-02-25T09:02:56.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And that %%%%ing Shunpo is another thing, it basically a free skillshot dodge.
