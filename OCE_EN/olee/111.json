Sometimes just closing them here can fix it.\n\nFirst try running as Administrator (this probably won't help but it's worth a shot), and if it doesn't work then try restarting your modem/router by turning it off for at least 30 seconds then turning it back on and try loading a custom game. That should work but after that I think you'll need to reinstall League. I've had different issues before which persisted even after multiple scans, repairs and reinstalls so if none of this works you may have to just wait a few days and try again. If nothing works then you'll have to either contact someone who's tech-savvy or Riot themselves at https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T00:47:34.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you been queuing up after your previous games have finished and you're just being blocked out once you reach loadscreen?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-02-11T04:55:25.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-10T23:32:08.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you still experiencing issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-02-11T00:14:04.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I still haven't been able to get into a game, it all happened after I downloaded 6.3, I've sent in a support ticket already","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-10T12:07:49.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt get a bugsplat but something happened to me last night, when i got to the game starting soon part, everything dced,so i checked the net all good, tried to open the client, couldnt even get to the launch screen without the program going into not respond mode, 5 minutes later i launched the client successfully and everytime i log in it says that i cant connect to pvp.net.... i got back in eventually but the game was pretty much over. very annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-02-10T10:35:21.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also recently had a bugsplat that resulted in corrupted files, and the automatic repair the client attempts didn't work for me.\nI did a full repair of my installation and that solved my issues.\nIf you want to try that then do the following:\nWhen you first open the League client you'll see a small question mark in the top right hand corner.
