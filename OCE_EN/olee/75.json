Youmuu's is good for beginners, because it enables you to follow up on your ult and chase ALOT easier, (but personally i use Black Cleaver, for the raw damage).\n2. Combo: Ult --> E --> Couple of AA's (if you feel safe about it) --> and Q, (YOU NEED TO HIT YOUR Q, IT IS CRITICAL). Then warp back to your ult shadow.\n3. To close the gap after they create it you need to, 1. Counter Flash really quickly, or 2. Use your W, (Which is harder). Also, use your BoTRK passive to close the gap easier.\nHope that helps :). \nI Build: BoTRK, Last Whisper, Ravenous Hydra, Black Cleaver, Mercury Treads + (Guardian Angel/Mercurial Scmitar/Randuins/Banshees). {{champion:238}}","replies":[]}]}
