NLR is a good rush on high burst lvl 6 champs with decent AP ratios who dont require the defense rush. eg annie.\neventually. its only really if you need the active, like vs zed or tolan. where having the active will by far increase your survivability or kill potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-03T04:51:33.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So never buy Chalice now? I have switched to Morello's for some of my Mids like Syndra, Ahri and Liss but I still like Athene's on Ori since I feel she makes really good use of Mana Font. I don't know that probably sounded stupid but I always seem to do better with Athene's on Ori rather than Morello's on Ori.\n\nSo buy it first? I hear you and I feel like it's mandatory but then what happens to mana regen? This is why I get so annoyed when my opponent picks an AD Mid lol As one of my team's carries, I hate changing my usual build path.

(swain might start tear for mana sustain and then finish a ROA, same with malz maybe)\n\nmost AD mids get lots of self sustain, either with double dorans or a mid/late game BT. so morello greatly enhances the match up to suit you better. while all they can do is get a maw to help them compete with you.\n\nfinish zonyas early vs zed sure, but it doesnt give a ton of damage boost, just 120 AP. if your champ prefers DFG, get that first then zonyas 2nd. otherwise it depends on how the match up is going, getting multiple PART components of items sometimes is ok, but mostly its not. the faster you finish 1 item the bigger your power spike will be. rabbadons gives a ton of damage, but what if zed kills you with his ult before you can even use half your combo? a zonyas would have greatly increased your fight capabilities there.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-03T23:16:09.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> chalice is purely a \"buy if losing to magic damage and playing mana based champ\" otherwise morellos trumps it for mana regen. because of the changes to the mana regen system. even then, both items are %%%%ty mana regen compared to before. expect buffs to both.\n> the main reason morellos is so much better is the heal reduction. its now the only item in the game that does that.\n\nWTF?!?! Dude Morello is an item you only buy if you're behind or need the grievous wounds passive when vsing someone like Swain or Mundo. \n\nAthenes is preferred over Morello in almost every situation because it gives higher mana regen, defense stats, 15% of maximum mana on assist or kill which can be game changing for teamfights without blue buff or straight up pushing a lane after a successful gank and it's only 1000g for chalice which is a really good item for early game.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-04T04:09:04.498+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"go redo the maths after the change. with the otherall nerfs to mana regen morello comes out on top in most situations without buying more mana regen.\nand the final item is greatly more effective in the case of vsing the AD assassins which is the reference point. \"what to do vs AD mids\".\n\npay attention before touting the OLD way without looking at the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-04T05:10:41.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

(sure higher elo like to copy the pros who dont get lifesteal unless its a rushed bork. so its less likely to have a big impact)\nbut the point of fact was vs AD mids, get the parts to zonyas over rushing a chalice. and for early mana sustain getting the 600g part of morello should be enough and you arent paying for unneeded stats and delaying the mana sustain as much.\n\nand again, its all personal preference. if you really need that 1.5% missing mana and find it efficient thats your call.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-04T07:09:52.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what you're saying it seems like you've never experienced vsing an AD mid that has knowledge about how to play an AD vs AP match-up...
