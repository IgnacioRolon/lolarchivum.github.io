I thought I was better than I was and one day it just clicked. I realised I wasn't as good as I thought I was and started admitting it whenever someone attempted to use it as an insult. I never made any attempts to improve my gameplay yet I did see a noticeable difference in the way I played. I later realised it was because I knew how good (or rather bad) I actually was, it was the way I was thinking that was bringing me down before and is now one of the main reasons I play as well as I do. The first step is admitting and accepting it, after that you should see a difference in the way you play whether you attempt to improve or not.\n\nIf you would rather put some effort in though I suggest you take more notice of what's happening in-game (you could even record your games to watch later). Take note of the mistakes you make and the mistakes your team mates and enemies make then think of ways those mistakes could have been avoided.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-27T04:30:53.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if I have one strength, I watch a lot of pro games, streams, vods and read a lot of League of articles so I feel like I have above average knowledge and shot calling, in regards to that, I definitely know a lot of the things I need to improve on. But I don't know man, I get into a game and it all just kind of goes out the window. Especially when I'm actually doing stuff like fighting, farming, taking objectives etc. As opposed to when I'm shopping or walking somewhere. \n\nPlus Cardboard 7 mechanics.

Currently I'm trying to improve dying less late game, reducing my greed and holding in the urge to try and make a sick play that works in my head but not in game, and yes I'm slowly improving but i have been playing like this for awhile so it takes time. And remember its not always about being better, sometimes if you just relax and let go you play super well and have fun :D so enjoy the game, don't always act like its a job or a competition, cause really who cares about a win or a loss, as long as you played your best and you improved that game and had fun doing it :D","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-27T09:24:32.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your look on this dude!

When you already have mastery of a champ it's a lot easier to focus on improvements outside of a champion, such as game knowledge and stuff like that.\n\nBe perpared though, you will have to play a lot, generally 8-12 hours a day for the best results.\n\nAlso do not duo queue. You're not trying to win, you're trying to improve your general game play, and I generally find this is a lot easier actually playing solo.\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-27T08:55:16.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-27T06:20:21.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn how to properly play easy champs, champs that don't require much mechanical skill, i notice that you say you have cardboard 7 mechanics, so this seems perfect for you\n\n> Plus Cardboard 7 mechanics\n\nI would suggest\n\nJungle: Rammus, Amumu, Rek'sai, Vi, Sejuani, Nunu\nMid: LeBlanc, Akali, Annie\nTop: Garen.

No ones stopping you playing 'fun' stuff, but you're making it harder for yourself if you do.\n\nAside from that, just try to identify mistakes (Deaths, lost objectives or teamfights, missing good opportunities to get an advantage) during the game and work out what you could have done differently. e.g. maybe you shouldn't have taken that fight, or you should've gone back to heal, or you should've warded/looked at the minimap. Or maybe you could've backed earlier to get to your team before they got caught 4v5 or saw the huge wave of 20 minions in top lane and got there before they all got wasted at the tower.
