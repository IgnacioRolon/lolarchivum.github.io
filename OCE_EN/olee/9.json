When I got my first ever account to level 30 back in 2010, I did my promos right away and lost 9 of them. Needless to say that account is still in bronze 5 to this day. But my other account that I just got to level 30 and did the promos is now gold 1. I still cant get my first account out of bronze 5 becuase of the players, and it is the players because I get teams that arent %%%%%%ed and know how to listen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-21T13:36:32.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't make the mistake I did.
