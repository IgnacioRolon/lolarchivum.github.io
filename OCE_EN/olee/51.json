Players like Gosu/Faker/DoubleLift and the like who can pull of some impressive combos and plays. If these plays are successful for them, why not try to replicate them? Players who try to do unfamiliar mechanics will sometimes perform poorly, so what? If you mean that they're cocky, well that's not because they're playing Vayne or Zed or whoever, it's because they enjoy showing off ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T12:12:53.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they want to practice fancy plays it's not so polite to do so in ranked. They should be playing with the mechanics in norms and then taking it into ranked. \n\nThat said, I think OP is referring to the specific brand of player that thinks they're real hot stuff and are determined to let you know and are generally just no fun to interact with in any way and are almost always deserving of reports.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-06T03:56:35.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the only reason they play that champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-02-06T06:27:02.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rofl like last game i played, there was a mundo, nasus, ryze and blitzcrank on the enemy team, and we had the best tank killing adc in Vayne and also quite a good kite-y tank killing control mage in me playing anivia and this vayne just splitpushed ALL game and took every chance she got to solo multiple enemies and just failed every time","replies":[]}]}]}
