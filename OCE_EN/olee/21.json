There was notice, 4/5 days ago Riot announced Ocean Week. Maybe if you actually checked anything (like the announcements both in the patcher and in-client and the news section of the website) you might have known about it. And chances are, when Ocean Week finishes, the free rotation that was cut short will be back, as has always been the case with such situations.\n\nOh. Yikes, my bad man, didn't see the part about the Ocean week champions taking over. I kinda only skimmed over it briefly haha","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
