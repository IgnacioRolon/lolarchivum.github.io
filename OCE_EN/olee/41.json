I often get multiple CS when I only go for one.\nBasically all you need to know for her is you E on someone (bomb them) then Q (attack speed boost) and go to town on them.\nIf they try to escape you W (rocket jump) after their bussy. On the other hand if things go badly you rocket jump away from them, or if that's down you can always just ult them the hell away and casually walk off.\nAlso your W resets on kills/assists so if they're all low you can just jump from champ to champ killing them all..\n\nFor Jungle, who do you usually top lane as? When I'm stuck with JG I pick Tryndamere or Yi since I have a lot of experience with him in the top lane and they both jungle well.\nOther than those two maybe Warwick?
