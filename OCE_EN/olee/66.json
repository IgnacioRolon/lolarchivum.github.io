I mean sure it'd take longer to ramp up the damage but I always have Mana problems with Ori and this way you get more survivability and more overall AP. And you don't have to worry about running out of mana. Ori was always more late game anyway IMO.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"EJ21","date":"2014-12-21T14:41:13.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave Seraphs for Ryze and Kassadin tbh, but I could work if your jungler won't give you blue buff i guess but would stick to Athene's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-20T09:29:46.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not recommended. u just need to grab blue. building seraph is recommended only for champion requiring so much mana usage during teamfight. dont do  dat %%%% on ranked plz.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2014-12-20T05:25:57.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats why i said its very situational, but once your get 5 items on ori your always stuck for a good 6th item and they rebuffed morellos im pretty sure to have 20% cdr instead of 10","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-20T05:17:45.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then you'd giving up on lots of AP/Burst or at least delaying it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2014-12-20T04:58:25.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"definitely a better item than morello but its extremely situational i.e. your versing an ad laner (most people build morello and tear)or your in a farm heavy lane against a veigar or jayce or if your versing someone like ahri, syndra, kat where you need the extra mr and shield spam from harass you need athenes but its such a strong item IF you can stack proficiently and you cant go past the ap buff it gives you once you get seraphs and deathcap it just depends if you can afford to delay your power spike,","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-20T05:02:45.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=oVh0AZZq,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-20T04:58:25.125+0000)\n>\n> definitely a better item than morello but its extremely situational i.e. your versing an ad laner (most people build morello and tear)or your in a farm heavy lane against a veigar or jayce or if your versing someone like ahri, syndra, kat where you need the extra mr and shield spam from harass you need athenes but its such a strong item IF you can stack proficiently and you cant go past the ap buff it gives you once you get seraphs and deathcap it just depends if you can afford to delay your power spike,\n\nDoes Seraphs give any Cdr?
