Even when someone on the enemy team blames one of their team mates, I purposely go out of my way to correct them. Sure certain unfortunate circumstances in games happen and you could most likely point at one champion as the cause, and, you might be correct. But I find that wasting your time blaming your team mates is pointless, it achieves nothing unless you&#039;re giving them advice along with it and you&#039;re being nice about it in general. My kinda mindset is, &quot;It MIGHT&#039;VE been that guys&#039; fault, but I&#039;m probably never gonna see or play with him again, so there&#039;s nothing I can do to fix his issues, so, what could I have done better?&quot; and I find that to be really good.\r\n\r\nBut, sometimes, I can&#039;t. I just can&#039;t. This only happens to me very rarely, very very rarely, but in a game I played recently, I couldn&#039;t bring myself to NOT blame my team mates. I just literally could not find it in me and I just got so frustrated at them and it tilted me. Sure I didn&#039;t play perfectly, and of course I did look at what I could have done better, but I still couldn&#039;t even focus on that. Like this team was just, oh boy. And I tried to give them advice and tried to coach them a little, and I&#039;m SUPER nice on the Rift to be completely honest, especially when talking to team mates but they just weren&#039;t listening.\r\n\r\nDo you think it&#039;s fair to sometimes, even without saying it to your team mates, but just thinking to yourself, that your team is just bad this game. That&#039;s it, your team is horrendous and there&#039;s nothing you can do about it.
