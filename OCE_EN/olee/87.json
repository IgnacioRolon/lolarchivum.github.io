MMR also determines how much LP you gain/lose for a W/L.\nHigher win% = Higher MMR = More LP gained per win and less LP lost per loss.\nLower win% = Lower MMR = Less LP gained per win and more LP lost per loss.\n\nIf you're a good player then you will fly up the ranks until you reach where you belong and if you're a bad player then you'll be punished severely and climbing will be nearly impossible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanir","date":"2015-01-23T08:25:54.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your \"rank\" ie 10 in gold 5 annies captains or w/e\nis actually completely irrelevant because you have to fall so hard in mmr to actually lose a div\nIts pretty much\nOh im gold 5\nbut im losing alot sitting quite often on 0 points but to actually fall I pretty much have to be silver 5 mmr\nif you were sitting low or your mmr was low, you will be placed sigificantly lower than where you ended up before season 5 because you wernt actually there you were way lower mmr wise.\nThis is why you see plats in mid/low gold games (most of the time the higher elo you get the less likely this is actually an mmr problem and more a player supply problem esp on a smaller server like oce.) golds in low silver games etc. etc. etc.\n\nYour actual div/bracket is for bragging purposes only ( to an extent) when you get high up in a bracket ie div 1 to actually get there you have to gain alot of mmr, this is why you can start gaining very very little EVEN 0! now this can happen at any div but its the same principle; because the system is trying to fix ur mmr to be at a level where you should be to get promoted to the mmr number they set as the target for the next bracket ie (bronze>silver>gold>plat>dia>mas)\n\nalso this works the other way\nif your mmr is significantly higher than your bracket you can skip divs.\ncut w/e doesnt apply to you","replies":[]}]}
