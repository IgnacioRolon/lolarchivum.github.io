(many new players make this mistake) when Q has very nice base damage scaling. \n\n\n\nBuild:\n\nI try to have it so that on my first back i can at least get a Tear of the goddess (Most people don't build a tear on him but i like it) so that it can start stacking straight away, and his ability set causes it to stack really quickly, \n\nThe next item i get is a Rabadons deathcap. (if on my first back i have $1600 or more i will get a needlessly large rod first instead of a tear because the extra power early is nice) \n\ni then get boots tier 1 \n\nthen i build a Nashors tooth (starting with the daggers and AS items side of it) (most people don't build a Nashors on him, however i still have faith in it, it gives you AP AS and CDR, the passive does not work with your soldiers, however it is very good for taking towers)\n\nnow boots tier 2\n\nAfter i have those items, the others are situational, if I'm vsign a strong AD champ ill get an hourglass, if I'm doing really well ill get a Ludens echo, otherwise you can get a Liandrys Torment or a Rylai's crystal scepter if you need some HP or a void staff if there are lots of tanks or they are building lots of MR\n\nthe last item i get is archangels staff (upgrading the tear) \n\nafter i have full items i finish all the loose ends like tier 3 boots, upgrading trinket, getting elixir etc. \n\n\n\nPros of this build:\n\nlots of mana early to poke heaps (tear)\n\nhigh damage earlyish for poking and taking towers (Rabadons)\n\nlots of attack speed when lanes are starting to break up and there are more enemies wandering around your lane (Nashors) \n\nlots of AP at late game (ludens/hourglass etc)\n\n\n\nCons of this build:\n\nNashors passive does not work on your main source of damage, its only useful for taking towers/inhibs so it isn't the best value for money \n\nyou miss magic resist early by not taking athenes holy grail \n\nyou dont get quite full cdr which wastes your passive a little bit but Nashors AS makes up for that \n\n\n\nTips:\n\ndont use your W at lvl 1 unless you can get at least 3 AA's on the enemy champion, its much more cos effective for damage to wait for lvl 2 and do a WQ combo and get 2 hopefully 3 AA's off because of the slow, \n\ndo not use your soldiers for farming/last hitting, Azir's normal basic attack is instant, its the nicest AA in the game for last hitting, so make use of it and dont waste mana with your soldiers. only use the soldiers for minions if you need to clear the lane fast or are missing heaps of last hits.\n\nyou will get more AA's off your soldiers if you summon a soldier on top of someone AA them and then use Q on them after they leave the circle rather than just WQ from a distance, this works best against melee champs, if they arent melee WQ from a distance is much safer. \n\nif you do a WQ combo for poke in lane, try and position yourself so that when the solder finishes its dash there are minions around it, this serves 2 purposes, 1 if they walk out of the circle you can AA a minion and possible still get them (cos the attack range protrudes out of the circle) and 2 after you have poked them you can use the soldier for getting minions.\n\nwhen attacking a tower don't just spam all your soldiers on it for damage, think about if you need one to WE dash away from the turret if you get ganked, if you see the enemy jungler in another lane and all enemies are accounted for then feel free to use all your soldiers, \n\ndo not assume that your passive tower will make your safe, people WILL come in behind your tower if you summon it in enemy territory, many Azirs think \"okay iv summoned a tower and now I'm safe from behind\" that will get you killed, map awareness is still needed, \n\nyour R starts slightly from behind you so even if you are level or directly on top of an enemy they will still get hit by it.\n\nyour R gives you and your teammates movement speed if you walk through it, i dont see many Azirs (myself included fully make use of this feature) \n\n\nCounters:\nZed (Zeds R is slightly longer range than your R and has a quicker cast time, so every time you try to use your R to get away from him, his R will hit first and you will waste yours) to play against this, you need to place soldiers early in the minion lane to prevent him from last hitting, this will make him use his Q to get minions from a distance which means it will be on CD most of the time and he will have less energy for his combo when he decides to engage.\n\nBig poke champs, Ziggs, Xerath, Orianna etc. (Azir has to stand still for a solider to AA, this offers a perfect window for them to hit you with a long range poke spell. also your spells are slower than theirs and they dont have to stand still to do damage) to play against this buy boots earlier than usual and when you do have a soldier next to them try to move yourself between AA's also poke them less and just focus on not getting hit instead.\n\nYasuo (Yasuo's R is a blink and wont be blocked by your wall, also he can dash in Q AA and dash out before you can reposition your soldiers to a defensive position, also his dash has a small CD so if he tries to dash over your wall and fails cos it pushes ppl back, he can just use it straight away again, unlike other champs who have to wait for the CD) to play against this, put your soldiers in the minion wave and when he dashes in to get you Use your E to the soldier in the wave and you will dash into him knocking him up and giving you enough of a shield to escape without too much dmg, and only WQ him when he doesnt have his 3rd Q active because you have to stand still to AA him and he will hit you with it.\n\n\n\nEasier lanes:\n\nKatarina (you have all the knock ups you want to interrupt her ult, save your R until she uses hers, also she is melee so you can harass the shit outtta her)\n\nHeimerdinger (your WQ combo outranges his turrets, use this to destroy them before engaging on a heim who has just lost his main source of dmg)\n\nTwisted Fate (Tf has no dash so he cannot avoid your WQ combo with ease, you outrange him and while his Q is high dmg and long range it is slow unlike zings/xerath etc. so you have time to AA and then move away, also you have many knock ups to cancel his ult if he tries to use if while you are near for some reason. Also if he throws a gold card at you, you should have time to put your R down to stop him getting too close while you are stunned, this could buy you enough time to get away when the stun ends)\n\n\nAnyway thats my 2 cents i hope it helped, he is a very difficult champ but is very rewarding, if you do decide to play him good luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-23T00:25:55.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=mx0FATYU,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-22T09:19:22.822+0000)\n>\n> I can give you mine, i don't build quite as conventional as some but it works for me.\n> \n> \n> \n> Runes:\n> \n> 26 AP\n> \n> 4 MR\n> \n> 10% AS\n> \n> 5 Armour\n> \n> This page is for comfort in laning phase, MR and armour just for a little defence, a decent amount of AP for poking and the AS gives you just enough AS to get a 2nd AA off a soldier after you Q someone before they leave the circle \n> \n> \n> \n> Skill order:\n> \n> Get W first (you cant get anything else) \n> \n> Then put a point in Q\n> \n> Then put a point in E\n> \n> Max Q first then E then W (getting R whenever possible of course)\n> \n> This is the skill order because putting points in W DOES NOT give you more dmg only cdr.
