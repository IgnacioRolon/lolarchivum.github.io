But talking about keystones Thunderlords is very good on him as well you can proc it off q, w and 1 hit of your passive and they can't stop you procing thunder lords. but on alistar support you mainly just want to be a massive wall for your team so bond of stone would be the one you go all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risque","date":"2016-01-24T15:53:46.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the +5% cdr just before windspeaker's is too big a deal to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-24T21:16:26.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legendary Guardian is pretty sick too doe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-01-24T07:29:40.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Bond of Stone would be better but I forgot to change masteries for a few matches and had Windspeaker's Blessing and it wasn't that bad.
