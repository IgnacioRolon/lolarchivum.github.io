Unless you're ulting Maokai... But why the f*** would you be ulting Maokai anyway xD I'm still a really big fan of AP Fizz and I really miss it. Albeit it was slightly broken before changes, I just hope this makes AP Fizz at least decent again.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-08T11:43:36.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP fizz can't kill straight tanks that have high (or even moderate) MR even with the ult, whereas AD fizz is built TO kill tanks, and because of bullshit bases, can also kill squishys.\n\nAP fizz's main fall off is that he used to be able to kill anyone any time he had DFG or ult, now he can only kill them with ult, and be slightly annoying without ult (i'm talking non-fed laning phase fizz).\n\nAD fizz is still the main pain in the ass, AP fizz is manageable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
