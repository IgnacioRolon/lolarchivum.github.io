Sure every team should have one almost every game but it&#039;s always seemed like more of a support item. It provides a great aura and great team utility but it&#039;s concetrated tank stats are kinda meh and it confuses me as to why you&#039;d build it on J4 or Reksai","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-08T06:23:47.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's not the best, the item is just more team oriented, and as long as you're not a sole diver (Someone like Olaf) and will regularly be peeling for your squishies over taking down the enemy squishys it's fine.\n\nWhile it is a \"support item\" the thing that people don't understand is that support items are mostly that for being team oriented, which you can buy on anyone.\n\nAnd yes the stats are lower, but on a full tank that doesn't really make too much of a difference (- 50 MR/-100 Health) this is generally better on a full tank, as the support has less gold to spend overall, and letting the support be able to get the better tank items can be better in a fair few scenarios.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-07T22:49:33.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree anyone outside of the pros or maybe even ranked 5s shouldnt be doing that. reksai has decent sustain in the jungle to allow for a locket to be a decent item as he will hardly be engaging teamfights let alone without his team. anyone doing it is just copying the pros and is probably gonna feed. other than all of this i think the nerf to its aura makes it a bad item especially for junglers","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-08T00:06:59.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cq5KAXEG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-07T22:49:33.634+0000)\n>reksai\n>he\n\nSHE!\n\nTRIGGERED","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-08T02:27:42.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kylar Alice,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cq5KAXEG,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2016-02-08T00:06:59.345+0000)\n>\n> SHE!\n> \n> TRIGGERED\n\npeople getting triggered on the internet\n\n[TRIGGERED]","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-08T02:34:17.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cq5KAXEG,comment-id=000000010000,timestamp=2016-02-08T02:27:42.218+0000)\n>\n> people getting triggered on the internet\n> \n> [TRIGGERED]\n\nxD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-07T23:43:32.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've rarely ever bought this item in general, even on supports, let alone junglers...","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-07T23:53:12.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tURtL3s,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cq5KAXEG,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-07T23:43:32.588+0000)\n>\n> I've rarely ever bought this item in general, even on supports, let alone junglers...\n\nIt's a very useful item to have when vs'ing double AP comps or when there is a particularly fed AP champ on the other team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-08T00:11:26.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyway J4 and Rek'Sai typically stick near their allies, or they stall the enemies long enough for their allies to get close to them.
