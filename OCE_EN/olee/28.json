When she was super op back in the \"ban kat and akali every game\" days I complained about her, when she showed up once every 50 games I complained about her and this new tank akali is the worst rendition of it. Pinks don't really matter with tank Akali, she barely uses her stealth, it's all about the fact that she is SO hard to land cc on because of her 74 dashes, all the while being difficult to kill due to her decent tankiness and insane self healing and has respectable, non relenting and incredibly easy to land burst. \n\nIn theory, if I saw an Akali first pick, and was able to then pick my team's 5 champions and dictate their builds to them, the Akali would be rendered useless, but this in Solo Q, where people don't listen and it's also where people, well, don't listen, it gets really difficult to deal with her. \n\nAnd no matter how much an Akali is camped or wrecked in the laning phase, she just always seems to find away to get back into the game. ALWAYS.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-03-16T00:28:59.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am an Akali main and I approve.\nTell you what man.\nThere is a way for you not to face Akali anymore in game.\nSimply add me in game and play with me xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-15T09:11:50.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one likes Tanks that can 1v4 and get a quadra.
