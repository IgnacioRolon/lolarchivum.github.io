But I'm looking to get Fizz, LB, Xerath, Karma and Ziggs.\r\n\r\nIn your opinion out of my current Mids, who is the safest first pick? And when I finally expand my Mid lane champion pool, who are very good safe picks all the time that I just don't own yet? \r\n\r\nTL;DR What are some safe first pick mid laners?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-03T10:47:25.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karma, Karma, Karma, Karma, Karma.\nIf you truly believe, you can carry as Karma support!\nBut this is mid lane.\nShe is pretty awesome against a lot of other midlaners. The fact that she can heal herself massively and shield herself make her a somewhat safe pick against a lot of champs, as long as you can react accordingly. Also, it is super fun to be able to kite with your speed increase, snare and slow. Ult at level one? Pretty good, but don't overrate it. It does good extra damage on your Q, for example, but not a lot of it. It spikes up a bit at level six! However, it can ALWAYS be used to do things like hit Qs that ordinarily would not hit. There have been many times I have ult-Q'd between a gap in minions, so that my Q would not touch the enemy, but still hit due to exploding at the end.\nKarma can wave clear, though not as good as other mages. \nShe has some good teamfight potential too. A shield for everyone on your team? Ult-q people to near death, omg rito pls nerf? Karma has both of those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-03T03:57:18.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top safest picks are Ziggs, Xerath, and Ori.\n- Heal/Barrier makes baiting kills in 1v1s/1v2s/2v2s easy. \n- Do extremely well in farm lanes. \n- Good wave clear.\n- Good poke.\n- Level 6 pop all in potential.\n- Hard to gank.\n- Able to setup ganks easily.\n\nOnly problem is if you pick them there will almost always be an assassin picked against you so being shoved under tower and leaving the enemy mid to roam is something you never want to happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2014-12-03T03:27:31.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia.

Syndra and Ahri are also fairly safe first pick champions.\nI would say in your future midlaners, Fizz is definitely the most slippery. He has to get close to do damage, but when you have 2 gapclosers, one of which includes a brief invulnerability, you won't really be dying to ganks any time soon.\nYou might also want to pick up Azir, as he can deal constant damage from extremely far away, also while having an 2 possible escape abilities (his E and his R).","replies":[]}]}
