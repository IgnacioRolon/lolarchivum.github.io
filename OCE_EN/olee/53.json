But please, unless said AD Mid champ is a 11/10 perfect counter to their mid laner, don&#039;t pick them unless someone else has locked magic damage elsewhere on the team, or someone has SAID that they will play an AP champ. It puts your team in an absolutely horrible spot come mid to late game.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-07-29T13:34:04.118+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"better to play around this kind of a dilemma than 1 where you have an afk/feeder/troll, or 2, or more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-07-30T02:26:03.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Itemizing against the enemy team is a must, there is nothing wrong with a champion making you build/play differently. And communicating with your team and picking around what you have is also another thing that is required to win.. I mean they can be very strong picks in certain circumstances, but most of them fall off the later the game goes (with regards to teamfights anyways)","replies":[]}]}
