More specifically, Vlad and Malz, I know they were meant to really strong, but, I just don&#039;t find their playstyles/new playstyles enjoyable. Malz with the new voidling focus is just not something that feels enjoyable, and Vlad&#039;s massive low mobility-backline focus-do zero damage tanks is not something I enjoy. Veigar feels absurdly strong but again, doesn&#039;t inhabit a playstyle I&#039;m used to.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I&#039;m in LOVE with the new Cassiopeia. So much mobility and even though not buying boots feels wierd, you definitely feel the power of skipping boots for more damage items.","replies":[{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-08T07:27:00.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although she didn't recieve any direct changed the new gunblade is super strong on katarina.. you can literally 1 shot enemies faster than a renger with hextech qwe cause hextech scales with ap and has a base of like 250 dmg, I also like velkoz's changes, they make him so strong!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-10T12:02:51.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that base was 400 on the pbe. be happy still not broken","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-05-10T08:04:20.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strong enough to make it a priority first item build?","replies":[{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-10T11:42:52.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I am currently messing around with it and in most cases getting it first item gives the katarina player an insurmountable lead which allows her to snowball the whole game.
