I understand the loading screen issue but where the hell did I mention that I dc in the loading screen? I go from 0 to 100 in the loading screen in literally 5 seconds or less. The issue is, my internet is shaky, it'll sometimes cut out for no reason and then come back on two seconds later. And even though I technically only dced for two seconds, I still have to try and reconnect and it's just impossible to do that with this client","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-28T04:34:49.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1 get beter wifi \n2 I have gone dc in game and the load screen and it reconnects near instantly","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-29T05:56:33.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't just ask someone to \"Get better wifi\", there are these newfangled things called \"Contracts\" which indicate you're not allowed to budge out of it, until the time has worn off, or unless you want to pay the full fee, which would be in the near thousands.
