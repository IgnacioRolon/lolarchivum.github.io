Also, tie him in with a support with lots of cc or \"pulls\" Like Thresh, Blitz or Naut and his relevance boosts up immensely. If you could pick against a Morde really early on, I think you'd be fine, but you don't always get the luxury in Solo Q.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-09T09:51:00.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The main three ADCs in YoloQ right now are very much Anti-Brawler.
