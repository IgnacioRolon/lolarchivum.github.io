You can figure out the rest, my point is that even when Fizz, or anyone for that matter counters you, if you take advantage of how they counter you you can use it to your advantage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-24T19:52:55.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon could 1 hit anyone in 0.25 seconds I don't think many players can respond that fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-25T06:59:15.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not literally 0.25 seconds.... and plus Fizz has 0.75 seconds of invulnerability at the press of a button","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-25T07:18:54.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My friend who recently got master with talon can use ult run like 1/4 of the map jump on an enemy and kill them in less then 0.25 seconds dealing over 1.2K damage then bleed and ignite a fizz might use e to go invisible.
