Like I'm not saying I could run an LCS team, but I used to shotcall for some of my 5's teams and I also watch a lot of pro play and kinda take on the strategies. So in solo ranked, I always dictate my team. (In the nicest way possible). And they usually listen to me! I call which lanes to push, which turrets to take, which objectives to prep for, who to target. And it works SO well. It kinda gets cumbersome at times tho and I kinda feel like it sometimes drains the fun out a LITTLE bit. But grind grind grind right? hahaha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2015-03-12T12:45:48.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont forget dragon timers when you dont see it :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-13T01:01:43.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah yes I do record it!","replies":[]}]}]}
