Most of the advice will be about positioning and understanding the enemies cool downs, but if you want specifics, choose a few replays.

Grab the small raptors too. Eventually you might pick up a small lead, maybe even if it's just a ward. It all helps. \n2. **Don't get pushed in past 6.** Within reason, push up your lane (put that extra ward money to use). If you're stuck defending your tower you can't walk out for half a second and pick up a cheeky kill elsewhere. I mean, you could try gank anyway but you'll probably lose tower and that's usually not worth it.\n3.  **Check both sides of the road before you ult.** It's all well and good that you know where the enemy is but make sure at least someone on your team team is near to back you up if things go wrong. If you're still figuring out TF's 1v1 power this is decent precaution.","replies":[]},{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2016-03-27T10:38:51.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ayy a TF player like me. Yeah same with my I've been doing terrible playing Twisted Fate as well :(.
