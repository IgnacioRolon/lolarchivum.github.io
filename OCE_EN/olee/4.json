Draven seems like the root of a lot of the toxicity, but Volibear was rude for blaming Leo.\nA lot of ADCs won't own up to their own errors though, and will blame supports, which I hate. I have been blamed by people when supporting when they have had  horrible plays resulting in their deaths. However, I have gotten my unranked friend with 50 wins fed against low silvers. While I do make bad plays here and there, and sometimes feed horribly, I admit they are my failures. I do blame the ADC sometimes as support though, where I deem it appropriate. However, I think we all need to admit our own failures to properly succeed.\nAnd also, we need to point out other people's failures in a constructive way, rather than through flaming. If you can get a player to improve a tiny bit on the spot, rather than insulting them and lowering morale, you will have a better chance at success.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saqib","date":"2014-12-29T12:09:28.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly Promotion series is the worst......
