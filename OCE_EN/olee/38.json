Maybe some, idk but they're just champs I feel are really ban worthy.\n\nAnnie, point and click stun and harass. Impossibly to cs badly on, can set up ganks and roams easily. Point and click stun and or Tibbers is almost impossible to dodge. Very little counterplay. Plus in teamfights, Tibbers+Stun on 3 or more targets is gg.\n\nRiven, beats like, basically 80% of top laners and I don't remember the last time my top laner didn't feed against a Riven. Mobility, Knockup, Strong AA's, Shield, Execute. She has basically everything, and it's not exactly like she's terrible in teamfights. Ultimate outplay champion.\n\nNasus, no top laner ever understands that he has to be kept down and harassed. And when they do, and the Nasus doesn't get stacks, all the enemy team has to do is find somewhere for Nasus to farm safely and then stall the game out. And then late game, unless I was lucky enough to get a Kog'maw or Vayne, he's unstoppable.\n\nFiora, some kinda deal with my top laners not being able to deal but except when she ults, there is literally nothing that can be done. Although, she's not SO bad because she's ridiculously useless when behind and if her ult didn't hurt she's just walking trash but I still feel she's ban worthy.\n\nSwain, HOW DO YOU EVEN PLAY AGAINST THIS DICKHOLE.\n\nUrgot, when Urgot hits a target with E, his Q's HURT and have RIDICULOUS range. He's kinda untouchable in lane. Becomes ridiculously tanky, reliable, deals a shittonne of damage to squishies and tanks. Not to mention his ult on the right target can win them the teamfight easily. I've seen an Urgot kill a full health Support Nautilus with three Q's....\n\nDiana, is not as bad as the others I feel... When she gets ahead, she's unstoppable, but when I get the opportunity to counter pick her, I do fine. It's just when she roams, she has great ganking potential, lots of moblity and can get to a oneshotting stage very quickly. Super snowbally.\n\nZed, is in my opinion the least ban worthy of all of these, it's just a personal ban because he's played often, and I don't lane too well against Zeds. I usually don't ban him because I play him sometimes, and if I'm playing Lissandra (which I do a lot, 2nd most played this season) I'm completely fine and comfortable.","replies":[]}]}]}
