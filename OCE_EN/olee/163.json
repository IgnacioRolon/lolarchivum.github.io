But holy crap, I just witnessed it and it was annoying. Jungle Tahm and Support Bard, they were a duo, no proof but they took the same summoners were always together and all their trolling was in sync. They both took Ghost+Smite and when I asked them, they replied with, &quot;i&#039;m a smurf trust me I&#039;ll carry&quot;. Bard didn&#039;t even enter bot lane and our AD Carry was forced to 1v2 all lane phase. Bard and Tahm went on an invade and gave first blood. Bard was soloing jungle camps and getting executed in the early game. They weren&#039;t the usual &quot;I&#039;m just gonna take Clairvoyance and Clarity and run into the enemy team&quot;. They were using their abilities specifically to troll, and in some ways, were playing the game as normally as it&#039;s meant to be played every other time.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bard would ult me when I was getting chased by 3 enemies so they could catch up. Bard would ult 3 people who were about to get caught in the middle of Panth ult. I was running to lane to help out in a fight, I even took homeguards, I was watching the fight and when I realised I wasn&#039;t going anywhere, I realised that Tahm ate me and ran back to lane and just spit me back out into fountain and was laugh emoting the whole time. There were also a few instances where Tahm ate me and spat me out into the enemy team.\r\n\r\nWorst thing was, if only ONE of them was trolling and we had a decent and serious 4th member, we could&#039;ve easily won that 4v5. Their team wasn&#039;t very good apart from the Fizz, but that could also be just because he was fed, I don&#039;t know.\r\n\r\nBut like, this kind of stuff should&#039;ve been accounted for when Riot created these two champs, like, there lots of kids who play this game and trolls are prominent in this game, they didn&#039;t even anticipate it?","replies":[{"poster":"T S","date":"2015-09-30T21:38:38.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure they realised while designing these champs that there would be trolls, but their ultimate decision was that the existence of players like that shouldn't limit creative and innovative champion design.

The difference with Thresh's lantern and Bard's Ult or Tahm's Devour is that the other involved player has a choice. You can click either click the lantern, or don't click the lantern, your call. You can't choose whether you get Bard ulted or Tahm Devoured or not. If your ally wants manipulate your champion's state in a negative way, they're gonna do it, because they can and you don't have a single say in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-09-30T10:31:15.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about {{champion:34}} ? or {{champion:53}} plus then there's {{champion:59}} and {{champion:48}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-30T21:47:03.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:12}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-10-01T07:15:20.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Level1Pentakill,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=HsMJVmG4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-09-30T21:47:03.536+0000)\n>\n> {{champion:12}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:27}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:6}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:115}}\n\nit's harder to troll as those champs but yeah heaps of champs have the ability to troll in some way","replies":[]}]}]}]}
