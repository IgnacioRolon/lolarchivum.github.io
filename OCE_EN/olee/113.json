RitoExplanationPls!!!!!!!!!!!!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ability Power items with CDR: \n-Athene&#039;s Unholy Grail\n-Morellonomicon\n-Lich Bane\n-Nashor&#039;s Tooth\n-Will of Ancients\n\nAttack Damage items with CDR:\n-Trinity Force\n-Deaths&#039; Dance\n-Essence Reaver (Thirty fucking percent)\n-Youmuu&#039;s Ghostblade\n-Black Cleaver\n\nNOW. At first glance, you see that list and think &quot;What&#039;s this guy on about?  There&#039;s 5 items for both damage types?&quot; Sure, that&#039;s true BUT let&#039;s look into this further. Athene&#039;s and Morellos are never built together, because while you&#039;re busy trying to get your Athene&#039;s with that measly 60 AP after you've just built your Morellos, your enemy Mid laner already has a Deathcap. You only need one for Mana Regen choose either or get RoA or Seraph&#039;s. Lich Bane, Nashor&#039;s and Will of Ancients are all niche items, designed for specific TYPES of Ability Power champions. Kayle and Diana are the only two champions I can think of that commonly build Nashor&#039;s, and even then I&#039;m not a huge fan of it on Diana. Will of Ancients as far as I can remember is basically just built on Vlad. And Lich Bane caters to Fizz, TF, Ekko, Kass, Nidalee? Sometimes Diana if you&#039;re into that. So if you&#039;re TF or Fizz, GREAT! Your item path is MAGNIFICENT this season! Lich Bane and Morellos are common on both and CDR boots are too. But if you&#039;re Ahri or Ori, well if you want 45% CDR, you&#039;re gonna have to sacrifice your AP Scaling Blues or your MR Blues which you SO desperately needed against that Leblanc. And bye bye to your Sorcerer&#039;s Shoes because it&#039;s Cooldown boots only for you my friend!\n\nBut why is 45% CDR so important? Why do I HAVE to achieve it EVERY SINGLE GAME? Answer is: You don&#039;t. But Zed and Talon do, without having to sacrifice defensive runes or boots, and without having to go out of their way at all. Ghostblade/Death&#039;s Dance/Cleaver seems the most likely build path for these two champions (And other AD Assassins if there were more). This lets them achieve 45% CDR WITH EASE and they can still go Mercs/Tabis/Mobis for boots and they can STILL go scaling or flat MR blues AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE MOST UNFAIR THING ABOUT THIS IS?!?!?!? THEY ARE AD CHAMPIONS WHO WILL ACHIEVE 45% CDR WITHOUT BREAKING A SWEAT AND THEY STILL DO A SHITTONE OF DAMAGE WITH THEIR AUTOS TO CHAMPIONS, MINIONS, MONSTERS AND TURRETS. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY EXPLAIN PLSPLSPSLPSLSPL\n\nEven Marksmen can achieve it so goddamn easy with Reaver/Death&#039;s Dance+ Any crit item or Reaver/Tri Force or even Graves or Lucian would work with Cleaver to be honest.\n\nAnd THEN they decreased the Armour that you got from Zhonya&#039;s, they removed Mejai&#039;s CDR and gave Maw MORE MR.............\n\nCan someone PLEASE just explain the logic behind this because I&#039;m seriously struggling to find it.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-11-11T06:58:43.251+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its Riot and they are controlling the Meta. \nWhaddiya gonna do","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-11T07:07:24.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, guess I'm playing like, 4 mid laners this Season, howzat for champ diversity rito lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-11T07:03:28.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know i feel ya","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ashii","date":"2015-11-11T08:35:59.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's really quite simple, if you'd bothered to think about it.\n\nFirstly, the number of items is due to the sheer diversity of the AD champion pools needs. There are four archetypes that build either some or mostly attack damage; bruisers, assassins, marksmen and juggernauts. Each of these archetypes is intended to prioritise different stats, but unfailingly each of these archetypes contain champions that want CDR in their build. A \"one fits all\" item with cdr would be awful for obvious reasons, and I wager wouldn't make you happy anyway.\n\nSecondly, the reason for the inherent inefficiency of the smorgasbord style AP CDR items (morello/athene's) is because mana based ap mages need their abilities gated by cooldowns or mana costs in order to be tuned correctly. If it was viable to purchase both morello's and athene's and spam spells all day without heed to their costs and not do sup-par damage in any given window of time then pretty much every control mage in the game would be completely broken. \n\nInevitably, AP champs out of all the roles still sacrifice the least (with possible exception of current juggernauts) in order to purchase the items they desire. There is a wide selection of items, and I can't think of a single champion who is unable to fulfill all mana/cdr threshold requirements without still being able to incorporate utility choices like zhonyas into their build.\n\nRegardless of all this, it seems a bit rich to be complaining about this right now when it has been forever weighted in favour of ap based champions for item choice diversity and only now has the gap been bridged. Suck it up, you've got it pretty good.","replies":[]}]}
