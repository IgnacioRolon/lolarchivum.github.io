The last game I played, my ult played up on two instances. The first time, I used it, there was no damage, no terrain, no jump, no animation, NOTHING, but I DID press R and it DID go on cooldown. The second time, into the late game, I used it, it worked as normal, but this time it DIDN&#039;T go on Cooldown and I was able to use it literally immediately after.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-10T11:38:22.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See if you can re-create it in a custom just to make sure it isn't a one game/lag kind of thing.\n\nIf you can, check [over on this board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), and check if it has been described.
