I definitely feel like I can play her pretty good, but because she's such a versatile champion, I fear I may not be using her to her full extent is all. Could anyone offer up some tips?  \r\n\r\nMainly just with teamfighting and deciding who to ult and when to ult.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-05T08:43:30.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh, nobody goes mid w/ {{champion:127}}  anymore..\n\nIt's mostly top {{champion:127}}","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-07T06:04:27.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-04T21:48:17.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there TSM BjergWannabe,\n\nLissandra is a great champion so I commend you for picking her as your go to champ. Since you haven't really mentioned what you are capable of doing or lacking I will just put down some general comments in regards to teamfighting. \n\nBasically. In teamfights Lissandra has the potential to crowd control the enemy carries because of her e, she can move through the tank line very easily. \nWhen ulting you need to consider the situation. In most situations I believe it would be best if you ult the enemy teams carry, such as a Vayne etc. Not only will this do damage but it will generate a good amount of cc for you and your team to pick up the kill or at least burn a flash/cleanse/qss. \n\nLook at the enemy builds. If the enemy team has people with QSS, cleanse or a support with Mikhael's try avoid using your ult on them straight away. Either target your ult on a champion without cc cleansing or away from a champion with Mikhael's. If you do go against a champion with a cc cleansing ability try getting them to waste it with your w. If they are a decent player this may not work but it's still worth a shot. \n\nYou can ult yourself for disengage. If you are being ganked and our outnumbered but your e or flash are on cooldown, ult yourself to buy some time and give yourself invincibility then use your e once the cooldown is over.\n\nI hope this helps, I can't be certain because I don't play Lissandra much myself.\n\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-04T23:20:13.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if I ult a carry in a teamfight, they will most likely be in in the backline, and if I'm in the backline, I will die. What I've been doing, is E-ing or flashing into the very middle of the fight and very quickly casting W into Ulting myself.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-04T23:59:48.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you run Zhonyas?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-05T00:52:26.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do, although my generic build when I've got a balanced run of the mill enemy team is Morellos-Boots-DCap-Void-Zhonyas.

It really depends on the need of your team. e.g. sieging or all out team fights. No point making the plays if your team isn't interested in following up.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-05T03:09:46.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm ok. Say if I had an initiator on my team or someone who's got a lockdown ult for the 29/0 Vayne like a Vi or a Warwick, maybe I could Deathcap then?\n\nAlso, I'm not good at League maths, or Maths at ALL to be honest, if I got Morellos-Sorc Shoes-Zhonyas. What would be the best next item in terms of damage dealing? Void or Deathcap? It would probably depend on enemy team huh? If I saw some magic resist items or some MR items STARTING to be built up then maybe Void would be better? Or if I saw all armor/health maybe a DCap would be better then?","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-05T03:17:47.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically what you said.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-03-05T04:06:29.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Righty!
