Who&#039;s as keen as I am?\n\nI&#039;m personally super keen on pretty much all the changes! Really excited for Brand, Malzahar, Cassiopeia, Vel&#039;Koz, Anivia and Syndra! Also, these dragon changes are gonna shift the meta SO hard I reckon.\n\nThe two things I&#039;m a little iffy about at the moment, are the two new AP items, the Hextechs. I just feel like the active effects will feel super wonky and be super out of character for most champions, visually and practically.\n\nAlso, in competitive play, I&#039;m sure well defined team comps will become a very important thing and grabbing the correct, specific dragons will be super important while denying your opponents&#039; desired ones will also be quite paramount. Although, I feel like Solo Queue, especially in lower elo, the Fire Dragon will be the absolute most important one, since all anyone does is fight.\n\nAgain, thoughts?\n\nEDIT: Patch **_6.9_** I can't change it anymore :( My bad lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-04-21T12:59:03.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not keen...
