And so everyone jumped on the Morello's bandwagon and to be honest so did I. But ever since I did I've been having major mana issues with champs like Syndra and Ori, issues I never had with Athene's before the changes. On the occasion that I DO build Athene's, even though the maths proves that Morello's gives more, I FEEL a lot more sustained on mana with Athene's. \r\n\r\nI think I might go back to Athene's. Except for champs like Lissandra and Xerath since their passives keep them pretty topped up on mana and the extra AP and Grievous Wounds would benefit them pretty well.\r\n\r\nAnyone else feel this way?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-28T22:41:21.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've typically always taken Morello's over Athenes.\nI just like it more as an item.

I really like to gank for my team even if the jungler is already doing so. Which requires lots of wave clear and lots of abilities in the roams.","replies":[]}]}]}
