The only Mid laner that&#039;s been released since I started playing League was Azir... I find Azir ridiculously boring. Good for this current meta since Sustained Damage &gt; Burst Damage against tanks but boring and quite weak I found.\r\n\r\nBUT THIS GUY HOLY SHIT I LOVE HIS KIT MORE THAN ANYTHING EVER. This is the ONLY champ that I&#039;m certain I&#039;ll be buying outright ON release. \r\n\r\nHow does everyone reckon his ult work? Do you press R at a certain time and place and then return to that place 4 seconds LATER? Or just press R at any given time and return to wherever you were 4 seconds ago and hope you return to a good spot?\r\n\r\nBut srsly FINALLY!!!!!\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/champion-reveal-ekko-boy-who-shattered-time","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-14T05:41:34.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll have an evanescent copy of yourself following you at 4 seconds distance (and a thin thread linking his path to yours).
