Advice?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I used to play League 20+ hours a week, which was great! I had the time to and I loved the game. It was around that stage where I climbed from B5 to S5. Now I find myself lucky if I get 10 hours in a week. And since having less time to play, I find myself not being able to climb and have been stuck in S5 for the looooongest time. It almost feels like I have to relearn the game every time I jump back on. Is anyone on the same boat? And how do YOU guys climb?","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-12T11:19:20.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">feels like I have to relearn the game every time I jump back on. \n\nme too!, well kinda\nI main garen, so there is not really much to relearn, so i just jump back into ranked. \n\nHow do i climb?

Just focus on improving. There are a few things that distinguish silver 5 from Gold 5 (in my experience.) Maybe watch some league tutorials. How to marksmen. how to top.. How to attack move.. Objectives.. Even mechanics. Maybe learn a new role and focus on that role as much as you can. What are your main roles now?  My main acc was gold 5 and climbing very quickly but then I went on tilt but it's sitting at silver 2 at the moment still climbing.

But I suppose to could go back to watching some stuff and reading about some stuff on the train! That hadn't crossed my mind, thanks man. \n\nAnd I've been a mid main for a while now. Ahri is my main champion by miles and miles, she is my first pick go-to and my go-to when I don't know WHO to play. She was the champion I binged on to carry myself from Bronze 2 to Silver 5. But I play lots of other mid laners, although no where near as much as I play Ahri.","replies":[{"poster":"Nogalokey","date":"2015-08-12T12:24:05.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man, I eat at my desk so I can watch some league streams or youtube videos. Yeah I was like that with teemo. If you think you have ahri down pat, start experimenting.. I played teemo from my first 50 games to 500 games..  I learnt the game with him and then moved on. If I play teemo I feel i have the skill permanent cause I learnt him so well. So i can fall back on him.. My advice is learn a new role like jg","replies":[]}]}]}]}
