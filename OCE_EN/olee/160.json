I worked my way up to Silver 5 and didn&#039;t move from there for a while. Then, I had a really hard trimester of Uni and stopped playing for about 3 months (game or two a week if that) and then, jumped straight back into Ranked, and got demoted to Bronze 1. (It was a fucking horrendous idea lol) From Bronze 1, I went down to Bronze 3 and then, straight back to Silver 5 from there.\r\n\r\nSure, it&#039;s only Silver 5, I&#039;ll be the first to admit that I&#039;m not that great at this game, my mechanics are like a pile of what ever&#039;s left of a city after 7 natural disasters just hit it. BUT, say what you want, I still climbed from Bronze 5 to Silver 5 and then again, from Bronze 3, to Silver 5. I still got out of Bronze which a lot of people on here ask a lot of questions on how to do. Biggest piece of advice I can give you is.\r\n\r\n- Don&#039;t blame your team mates. \r\nThis is literally THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND. Blaming your team mates gets you no where, absolutely no where at, all. It&#039;s no doubt that some or most losses can blamed on team mates, of course, it IS a 5v5 game, so if something doesn&#039;t work out, it can&#039;t entirely be one player&#039;s fault, which means, believe it or not, you&#039;re at fault too. And even if you played well and your team mates didn&#039;t, the fact is, you will never be able to improve your team mates&#039; game play, you&#039;re never gonna talk to them again and the chances of you getting into another game with them again and remembering them in the future is low, so blaming your team mates is futile. Only when you focus on your own mistakes can you improve. You can&#039;t do anything about your team mates&#039; gameplay, only yours, so why bother blaming them? Instead, take a second to think after the game, think about what you could&#039;ve done to prevent that loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-10-22T04:39:33.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
