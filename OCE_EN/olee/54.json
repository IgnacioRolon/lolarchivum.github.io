In this way it's great for large groups of people on League who you might want to play with and can instantly message but perhaps don't know in person. Example, there is someone starting a Teemo Main's club on these boards at the moment.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cyrup","date":"2016-03-17T02:40:38.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I see it, clubs are a little like permanent parties. When you log out, you are instantly auto-joined to the chat when you come back online; connecting you to your other friends where you send messages (which remain there for awhile) easily. Unlike parties however, they don't allow you pre-determine or set up people in match-making for a game. In this case you still have to set up a match the normal way.  {{summoner:4}}","replies":[]}]}
