There was only NA for OCE players.\n2. Riot announced OCE around mid 2013, with promised goodies (such as OCE skin) and free transfer.\n3. OCE became a thing.\n4. People mass transferred to OCE for free, but there was no OCE skin, instead everyone got a free Pool Party Ziggs and the champ if you don't have them already.\n5. People ask/cry/demand for the OCE skin but no response, after a while of angry and joke posts, it was assumed that OCE skin was no more.\n6. Ocean Week came and re-ignited the hopes for OCE skins, but the event apparently didn't feature such things so the hope soon died out.\n7. Then out of no where, just yesterday, Riot finally announced the arrival of OCE skins. It would come with half price instead of free.\n8. People then hop on the forum asking for it to be free.\n\nHonesty, I think there is a reason to why they're asking for half price, considering there is a high possibility that the team was in fact, doing this while having the budget/capital pulled out due to their unsuccessful launch during the OCE server establishment. \n\nNot to mention, it's like having a delivery man who's 2 years late due to many complications, and instead of maybe praising him for keeping the promise and letting it go, you push him down and beat him up because he has the audacity to ask for 5 dollars for the package.\n\nSure what's free should be free, but who else was actually expecting its arrival before yesterday? Idk about you but this imo is just too overboard. \n\nFirstly, OCE is not a big region, so it's understandable that we do not get more than 1 or 2 free goodies. Secondly, we already got free stuff, being the Pool Party Ziggs (and the champ if you didn't own him), and Ocean Week. Then half price on this OCE skin. So is it such a bad thing that requires an outcry? I think the whatever team's dedication on delivering the skin requires more attention than people asking it to be free. \n\nBut it's just me.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-30T08:12:21.914+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":">Not to mention, it's like having a delivery man who's 2 years late due to many complications, and instead of maybe praising him for keeping the promise and letting it go, you push him down and beat him up because he has the audacity to ask for 5 dollars for the package.\n\nAre you kidding me?\n\nIf a delivery man was 2 years late with a package and expects you to pay that is ridiculous.\n\nHell a lot of places will give you refunds if your shit is taking to long.\n\nFact is all things considered this skin is pretty meh for something that is meant to represent our region, and they expect us to pay for it.\n\nI mean realistically it represent the cultures that believe in shit defined by the stars or similar, this isn't just OCE, but several cultures around the world.\n\nIt's honestly kinda pathetic.\n\nNot to mention, Riot is giving this half price for us to charity to try and ease the backlash they know they were gonna get for this.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-30T08:34:38.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=aAQsNNj3,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2015-09-30T08:12:21.914+0000)\n>\n> Are you kidding me?\n> \n> If a delivery man was 2 years late with a package and expects you to pay that is ridiculous.\n> \n> Hell a lot of places will give you refunds if your shit is taking to long.\n\nI think this is one of those cases I would personally ignore the time they took.\n\nBecause well, if a package is 2 weeks late, that's BS and we ask for a refund.
