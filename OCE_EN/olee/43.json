We monitor 24x7 and look into each incident where something appears off. We are also aware that some players look to use unfair advantages in game, and we look at all angles when a disruption occurs for only a few players, while the rest is running smoothly.\n\nI promise we will investigate this incident and determine rootcause. We don't see anything widespread ongoing but I do understand that you had a terrible experience in your game and I'm sorry for that. I know it's extra painful when you were about to get a victory.\n\nTL;DR - our team is investigating and taking action as needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-21T01:54:16.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reply and acknowledgement is much appreciated :-) It's enough to know you guys are at least looking into it :-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-21T02:12:58.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hay @Cochese.\nSay hello to\n@Spui \n@Moonsugar \n@Wolf Fang \nand @Swizzle \nfor me :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lemewinks","date":"2015-06-21T07:04:14.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this still happening to anyone, just got kicked from a game and i can't reconnect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jezman90","date":"2015-06-21T01:14:20.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had the same issue.
