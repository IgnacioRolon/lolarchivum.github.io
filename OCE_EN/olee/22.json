Like, I can cancel my auto animations on Ahri no worries, not that it makes a huge difference on her anyway, but I only do that through right clicking on the champion and then right clicking on the ground as soon as the projectile is fired off. I DON&#039;T know how to Attack Move or any fancy stuff like that.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently in Silver 4, and climbing, slowly, but climbing, and I feel like I can maybe get to gold by the end of this season, MAYBE. (Hope that doesn&#039;t sound too arrogant). My question is, always trying to avoid ADC as MUCH as I can, never playing it, or champions that rely on it for that matter, how much is  not knowing how to effectively and properly kite/stutter step gonna affect me moving forward?","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-05-14T11:58:14.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Self plug - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/tTVITxxq-a-newbie-and-general-mechanical-guide-to-league?comment=0000\n(That's my guide on general mechanic's)\n\nBesides that, it wont affect you unless you really wanna get a higher rank.

You can easily get away with having one or two roles you suck at as long as you can play a few different ones. Decision making and map awareness are much more important than mechanics in silver anyway, I doubt it would be an issue til like diamond or master as long as you're playing champions that aren't really affected by it (I'm plat and my mechanics are horrible, especially with ADCs).\n\nMaybe try a more caster type ADC like ezreal or graves in case you have to play it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. Good luck getting to gold!","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-15T07:31:01.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man!
