And it doesn't work on Physical Damage abilities right? Only AA's?\n\nThe easiest way to remember how it works is that Life Steal is an on-hit ability. This means that auto attacks, and any abilities that specify that they apply \"on hit effects\" like Ezreal's Q, will apply the effect of lifesteal. Typical, this life steal is only on physical damage done from the attack, but there are some odd outliers, like Warick's Ultimate that explicitly state that life steal applies and does magic damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-03T04:52:01.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Life_steal","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2014-12-03T05:00:56.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"A champion's basic attack, abilities that apply on-hit effects, and abilities that modify your next basic attack all benefit from lifesteal.\"\n\nWot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2014-12-03T02:44:02.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh ok--- it is like per centage you take from your damage, example you have 8% life steal, you hit some one with 100 damage then u recive 8 health back.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-03T03:52:33.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lifesteal applies to damage dealt after armor. So if you hit someone with 100 damage after it's reduced by armor (assuming 8% lifesteal) then yes, you'd get 8 health back, however if you hit someone for 100 damage before armor then you'd get less back, depending on how much armor they have. One thing to note in that example though is that the difference will be so insignificant it probably doesn't matter if it's damage before or after armor.","replies":[]}]}]}
