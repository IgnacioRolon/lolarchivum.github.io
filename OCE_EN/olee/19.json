You can't _force_ someone to \"listen\" to **you** specifically. If they don't listen, that's to be expected. It's soloque.\nIf you'd like to make calls, I'd recommend creating a Team instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-11T00:11:22.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't mean to sound like such a dick when I wrote this, I was just frustrated, my apologies. Yeah I used to have a Ranked team which had a Diamond mate on it and he mentored me in shotcalling. After a few games I started to take over and we found ourselves winning decisive games quite often. Stopped it and nowadays I can't find anyone keen for it and I have issues with using comms in my current living situation.\n\nAnd I get this, it is 100% their choice, but sometimes it's just SO obvious and they just don't see the best way to go and it's ridiculously frustrating. Most of the time my team actually DOES listen, provided I'm doing well myself and I'm adamant about my calls but still staying really nice. Just sometimes the game can be finished in next 5-10 minutes, and there is a clear cut definite path to victory and they choose draw it out and throw. So frustrating duuuude, there's always that one player or two who cares more about their personal score than the victory","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-06-11T02:35:56.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know your thought process but I do know that from what i have seen 90% of players have no idea how to make calls in this game at every level.
