People saying \"why are you so bad for xxxx division???\" Y'know, just being real jerks. So he then moves onto ranked to practice the character and role. The person you had, the Plat smurf, maybe they aren't confident in top lane or playing Renekton?  I think some of them have their reasons, I'm sure it sucks, but we can't really do much about it unfortunately. :s Sorry you're having a rough time in any case!","replies":[{"poster":"a dozen midgets","date":"2017-06-04T08:50:03.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya its hard to jump into a game when you just wanna play and have fun but then you're getting your but kicked.

Sharing an account is a big no no but if it's their own individual account, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Frustrating I know, because I get a lot of high plat/diamond smurfs in gold and it's the same thing. My lane goes from \"this is pretty easy\" to \"ok this is pretty challenging and I can't make mistakes\". I was high plat last season and have since dropped to low gold so it's obvious when I get someone that is smurfing","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-05T05:26:41.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">2 out of the three games I played last night I laned against the same Plat smurf\n\nGet a smurf in my game?\n\nQueue instantly so i can be up against the same smurf.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-05T05:45:47.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually took a 5 minute break lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-05-05T05:13:09.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chances are none of them were smurfs.
