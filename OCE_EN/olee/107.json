I love how you handled it, but honestly, man, I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one. For some champions, four stacks is simply just too easy to reach, not to mention you also get max Fervor of Battle stacks at 4 autos if you're a melee. And once they have max stacks on either of those, (and me most playing mid lane) it's EXTREMELY easy to burst me down with 3 or 4 autos, and sometimes, yes I'm being legit, two autos have 100%ted me. I like the fact that you have to work hard for the item to reach it's full potential and when it does, it's very powerful, I can live with that, **that has counterplay**. BUT, when the item's full potential is THAT easy to reach, and most of these champions having no problem at all closing gaps. \n\nI'm afraid I have arrived at the conclusion that Guinsoo's is legitimately overpowered. And you have to understand, I don't say that about that many things, I find the counterplay in as many things as I can and try to be as positive about playing around strong meta picks and strats to the best of my ability, but Rageblade on some champions is simply too strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Kenlith","date":"2016-01-23T04:38:08.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the upvote haha but you have to see it like this, if there is an ad champ 2 hitting you, catch him when he is alone and blow him up before he realises anything, build {{item:3026}} or {{item:3075}} as these are the strongest items against auto attack champs, I play tryndamere a lot as such I know how to counter auto attackers, warwick is the same, you'll start to see it from my view as there is no really over powered champion, every champ is kinda equal in a sense, I played morde jungle and did just as well as the adc who could 1 shot, {{champion:51}}\n\nAnd for the rageblade, it offers no defensive bonuses making it easier to kill the champ that has it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-01-17T22:20:53.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The efficiency of the item is at max stacks?

Ok, I've only laned against a Guinsoo's user like once, and in lane, it's such a strong zoning tool, as soon as the enemy laner starts autoing the wave, you basically cannot stand anywhere near it or them anymore. But, I was more referring to teamfights, you can't just disengage when the Guinsoo's user has max stacks because you'd have to disengage just about every teamfight because like I said, some champions reach max stacks WAY too easy.
