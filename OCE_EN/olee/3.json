{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-01-28T12:05:55.657+0000","title":"Please discuss Patch 5.2's effect on Mid laners with me","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So obviously, patch isn't actually out yet, so none of us can say anything final until we play on it. But my god all of this feels really massive. Let's talk specific Mid Laners champ by champ. \n\n**Ahri.** Technically, this was a nerf and a buff, but it overall feels like a buff. Even though the 20% damage increase was removed from her charm, they at least increased the damage on it as they did with Fox-Fire. They also gave her more utility on her Q. It kinda feels like Ahri won't be so much of an assassin anymore but a kite-y teamfighting Mage. Previous Ahri was incredibly dependant on her charm to zero someone out, now that's not really the case anymore. Of course the removal of DFG would hurt her but I think building her Morello's into Deathcap like all other mages would work just fine. On paper, on a personal level anyway, she feels like one of the stronger mid laners coming out of this patch.\n\n**Fizz. **They nerfed his Q HARD. And they did the same thing to his W. Like, ZERO AP ratios on it?! Now, the 20% damage increase that they added to his ult is really nice and I think that overall, his damage will be higher to the targets his Fish hits. And since it can only mark ONE target and plus with all the devastating nerfs to his Q and W, Fizz kinda feels like a Zed now. Hit one person with Chum the Waters, blow them up, be useless. And on the rare occasion that your fish hits no one? Well... Yeah.... Fizz feels like he took a really big hit in this patch and I'm not entirely sure if he'll still be viable... That makes me sad :(\n\n**Lissandra.** Now, I don't know anyone but me who rushed a DFG on Liss, but for anyone else who did, they'll know how strong it was. I did this since big scale teamfights didn't really happen until later on in the game so I generally just wanted to Ult the priority targets and blow them up. And with DFG the roams and the assassinations were massive. Even your laning opponents would drop like flies and snowballing into the late game was easier than normal. With the removal of DFG, I feel like Lissandra is another one who took a blow but at least her actual numbers remain untouched, and I'd still wanna play her lots, but I'm not a fan of the ROA build. I don't like that item on any midlaner to be completely honest. Would a normal Morello's into Deathcap be fine?\n\n**Syndra. **Not much happened to Syndra, I was never a fan of DFG on Syndra because it felt so unnecessary. The DFG was absolutely NOT needed on Syndra to blow someone up. But I wanna talk about her Q and Stun nerfs. Her Q nerfs honestly felt fine. I never harassed all THAT much with it anyway and the damage on it even before the nerfs felt really lackluster in the early levels. But her Q+E is the big one. I've barely been able to land these, obviously you could just call me a scrub \"git gud\" but I use to always land them, and then being able to land close to none?.... I just really hope the slight buff they're returning to the stun makes it hittable again. If the stun is fixed, I feel like Syndra would come out of 5.2, a really good pick, like she's always been. Because at the moment, she feels IMMENSELY clunky.\n\n**Nidalee.** I don't have much to say about Nidalee as I've never played her. But people are saying that is currently one of the stronger mid laners. Anyone?\n\n**Zed.** The nerfs to Zed didn't really feel like they were too bad. Just hurts his split pushing a little and his dueling with Death Mark on cooldown. BORK and Ghostblade are usually core on him anyway and I feel like he won't be coming out of this too bad.\n\n**Akali.** These nerfs feel like they won't do anything.... Like, it feels like she's still to be the most op pieces of sh*t on the planet.\n\n**Annie**. I feel like she too took a massive blow. I've only played Annie mid once so I can't offer too much but what do you guys think on the Tibbers/Molten Shield buff? It doesn't feel like it'll do anything huge...\n\n**Azir. **Azir didn't actually get a buff, but with all these champs taking massive blows, I feel like maybe Azir will be stepping up to the plate as a super duper strong pick. Thoughts?\n\nI know I wrote ALOT but when I read the patch, it just really got me thinking that's all. I'd really love to discuss this with people who actually care about this and know a lot more about it than I do. It'd be great if people could offer up some thoughts AFTER that they've played these champs too.","replies":[{"poster":"rxdicalaliviyaah","date":"2015-01-29T06:48:55.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite worried about Akali honestly. \nShe's only \"one of the most OP pieces of sh*T on this planet\" if she does well early game: her jg makes sure to camp and help her out and her roaming lands her some nice kills.\nOtherwise, she gets extremely behind; she's just one of those champs who either snowballs so damn hard or drops off really hard. \n\nI guess she hasn't been nerfed too much... but since she's already countered so much and has such a squishy build, I really feel like they couldve at least kept the distance on her dash. As for the E not going to be able to proc her Q passive anymore, it's not too much of a nerf in general, it just makes it harder for the PLAYER because unless you make sure you get that AA in, a HUGE chunk of that \"OP\" burst damage is gone. \n\nThis is coming from an Akali main, of course I'd feel bad. After all you never know, little things can make big changes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Giacomo","date":"2015-01-29T04:24:59.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats gonna happen to {{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-01-29T04:42:18.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Giacomo,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=yxAG7yse,comment-id=0009,timestamp=2015-01-29T04:24:59.285+0000)\n>\n> whats gonna happen to {{champion:7}}\n\nShe'll rise up to be the best assassin now I believe.

If you know you can get something out of a gank, no matter how early it is, that is a good thing. However, more often than not, to execute a level 2 gank with the setup you have described you are giving your opposing laner a CS and level advantage when you make that gank against people who quite likely are not in position for it. In addition, you are sacrificing a lot of your early game power by changing those runes to movespeed on every midlaner in existence. If your enemy laner pings that you have left the lane too, the other laners may prepare for your presence. At level two, no one on your team should be tower diving to secure a kill if needed, lowering your chances of getting gold and xp out of that gank even more. It sounds like you are tipping the balance of power over to the enemy team. You say you have been doing this at an elite tier level, but you are Bronze V and seem to only play Pantheon, according to the match history shown on LoLKing.\n\nMeanwhile, you tell me to try something new. Well, I play AD Lulu support, jungle Karma and mid Gangplank from time to time. In addition, I have tried many off-meta picks like bloody support Sion and ADC Lulu.\nLulu... everywhere.\n\nWhile this ganking from level two idea of yours might work for you, its working in Bronze V, which is not reflective of the rest of the ELOs.","replies":[{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T11:51:36.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol you autistic %%%%%% stfu you're embarressing yourself\n\n\ni rome map from lvl 2","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-29T12:03:24.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Devil God King,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=yxAG7yse,comment-id=000a000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-29T11:51:36.490+0000)\n>\n> lol you autistic %%%%%% stfu you're embarressing yourself\n> \n> \n> i rome map from lvl 2\n\nI am sure Rome is nowhere near Valoran.\nTo be honest, the only person who ought to feel embarrassed (please invest in software to check your typing for mistakes) is you for both your poor grammar and your toxicity. I could be wrong, but you aren't holding up your side of the debate well. All I'm getting is \"stfu\" and \"autistic\".

If I am autistic, however, and you see all autistic people as idiots, I would like for you to contrast how you are speaking to how I am speaking.

I think having the missing health damage on his autos not always on is good. Also, if you are going to be taking heaps of damage for being low on health, I think you kinda need to not have grievous wounds if you want to try and survive. All in all, that was a healthy nerf. The change on his ult doesn't bother me. In fact, I am glad they included that. I don't like Fizz, but the change on his ult means that Fizz is still gonna be viable, and no changes to champions should make them unviable.\nHowever, it confuses me a little that they changed his ult like that after getting rid of DFG, at the same time that they remove Ahri's magic damage amplification on her charm. I think Ahri might need a little bit of damage tweaking with her bonus charm damage, but let's see how she fairs once the patch is in, because I could be wrong.\n\nI'd like to see what happens with Nidalee and her play rate. She is a champion I like to see. I feel like her changes will make more people try her in the jungle, as I have heard has happened a lot, yet I have never seen. Even if she isn't a jungler and is a midlaner though, the changes for her hunt, if used properly, can help her get between lanes faster if she wants to pull off some ganks, as midlaners should.\n\nFor Annie however, I feel the removal of DFG can hit her hard. However, her utility remains as good as ever, if not better. I don't like the changes in values they made for her shield though, and I see myself picking up an early second point because 10 armour and magic resist isn't gonna make me feel safe enough for those times I need it. Let's talk about what it does on Tibbers though. The armour and magic resist on Tibbers is something I am indifferent about. I like the speed he gets though, as sometimes I really need to have him somewhere and he isn't there!\n\nI want to mention mid lane AP Trist...\nRIP.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-01-28T12:50:16.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slim Chaedi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yxAG7yse,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-28T12:36:09.364+0000)\n>\n> They hit a lot of assassins hard, yet didn't do much for Zed when they hyped up his incoming balance changes. I want to see something more for Zed next patch. I don't play Zed, and I don't think I ever really have though, so I'm not too familiar with his workings and ratios to give a good comment. I see him getting more play now that a lot of the AP Assassins have suffered though. This bothers me a little bit.

Except, he doesn't have an easy way out like Zed does... I don't know.. I don't think I'm gonna be playing Fizz anymore nor do I think I'm gonna see many Fizz's now.\n\nYeah MIDalee's actually being banned in the LCS as of late, I'm gonna have to check that out.\n\nAnd as for Annie, I feel like Tibbers speed buff won't be utilised by anyone since the E is normally just there to charge her stun","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-28T13:00:07.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use the E to charge the stun a lot too, which I do think is its main purpose. However, after placing Tibbers you still want to charge stuns and it can be useful to reposition Tibbers, especially if another stun is coming up. I want to see how it works in game though. I'm wondering how strong the movespeed change is gonna be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
