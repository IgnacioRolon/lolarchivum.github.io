Rabadon's is now core, no matter what.\n2. There will bring actual diversity in builds game to game and player to player.\n\nHowever 1 thing i notice personally, Archangel's staff when fully stacked is probably going to be the biggest AP item aside from rabadon's so a lot more late game power houses (think Orianna style) are going to be happy with this change overall, especially those that like a RoA and a Tear.\n\nOf course i think these changes aren't necessarily final, and will probably change once they hit the PBE from a long enough time.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-24T09:21:12.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm Hello Cass huh?!\n\nI perosnally don't like Tear on Ori she needa that cdr man!
