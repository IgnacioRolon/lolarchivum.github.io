However, Championship is  limited skin and won't be coming back anytime soon. Although, there is a rumour  it will come back in a bundle with the other championship skins.

The only other option is to obtain it through mystery gifting or hextech crafting. The skin is definitely worth it though. I have every skin but Championship so I am pretty hyped if it becomes available. \n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-28T03:25:26.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't champion ship riven only ever supposed to be available through getting 100% right in the worlds tree now","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
