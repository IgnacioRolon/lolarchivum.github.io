There are a few just wondering about them, but as far as I could see there are none trying to gather information on how rampant it is. I play almost strictly ARAM due to time restraints in my personal life and it has affected me vastly. Every game contains any number of BOTS and you can tell they are bots because of their predicable pathing. They move in a straight lines back and forth with next to no reguard for where enemies are. Usually getting a couple luck kills and ending up with upwards of 20 deaths. \r\n\r\n      I love this game and think Riot does a great job in all aspects of them game from Champ developement and balancing, Interesting game modes and have shown that F2P can be done and made profitable and fun.  I just wonder if this will be the thing that causes me to lose interest. Playing a great game and going well into the possitive for KDA and having 2 of your teamates just keep throwing themselves to the enemy. I love the IP system, but I believe that this is the reason that there are even bots in this mode. If there were no rewards then there would be no bots. I dont want them to do away with IP in ARAM as it is the primary way I get IP, but how else do we rid League of this plague? \r\n\r\n     I would like this to be a constructive thread,  focusing on solving this issue, and perhaps trying to open up a dialogue with RIOT on how they are handling it. As a customer service I would appreciate, as Im sure anyone experiencing the same problems, feeling like there is something constructive going on and with dialogue opened perhaps the community could help as well. Feel free to sound off on this and thank you for taking the time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-02-19T23:47:06.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Umm, ARAM stands for 'All Random All Mid'\nI like the idea of bots coming in, but it's weird.\nBecause think if they were all the same bots all the time, then it's just AM\n\nBut i still think  it should go live :D","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-19T23:54:16.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you may have misunderstood the post.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kyoukocola","date":"2015-02-20T06:32:29.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this problem in ARAM as well. posted about 3 months ago.

Usually it's just people setting up accounts for sale, levelling them and maybe farming IP. Honestly, short of reporting them and Riot permabanning their accounts, I don't see any effective way to deal with them. What I do is report them for \"assisting the enemy team\" with the description \"potential use of gameplay bot/AI\". It's not ideal but if everyone bands together to report them it should be 'red flags' to Riot that they're using a bot.","replies":[{"poster":"SethShadowbane","date":"2015-02-20T06:24:31.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I report them as well, but it's so rampant that it leads me to believe that a ban on an account that is free and they are botting to lvl anyways makes it a low risk proposition.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-20T06:30:15.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's really only two other things I know of that could happen though, one being IP ban, which is easily circumvented if you know what you're doing, and the other is legal action by Riot, the chances of which are pretty low. Basically unless Riot starts taking legal action against these individuals it's going to be low risk.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-03-06T06:32:11.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And once we remove ip rewards from aram they'll flood norm 5v5s......","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-20T06:56:51.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you posting from an NA account the the OCE boards?\n\nAlso, ARAM is where bots tend to run rampant, and sadly there's not much can be done till rito can actually be bothered to even half check that people seem to be on 24/7.\n\nIt also tends to be more in the lower levels.","replies":[{"poster":"SethShadowbane","date":"2015-03-05T17:40:26.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, no idea how I ended up on OCE boards.","replies":[]}]}]}
