And seem to get the same game, game after game. Where top is overly powerful, everything ether lags, or mana just vanishes and sudden death. Every attack or shot 100% without fail misses.  Attack speed movement speed and money generation comes down to it knees when near this person. And before u jump out and say lag, my ping and fps is quite normal.\r\n\r\nWhen one takes a look at the scoreboard even more weirdness, particular the guy in the screen with 7 minion kills and 8 deaths yet is lvl 13 and plenty of items. Another great weirdness is lvl jumping, one min the guy ur vs is the same lvl, then next min hes 2 lvls higher with no addional kills. and wham ur full mana is now empty without casting a single spell or ur cooldown has tripled.\r\n\r\nThis keeps happening game after game, unless one plays at a really obscure time.\r\nIts a shame I'm not sure what is going on but it has destroyed the game. I invested good time and money and nothing is being done, mentioned or action a pond. \r\n\r\nI for one have lost the love for the game because of this *weirdness*.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T23:51:01.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">action a pond\n\num\n\nAnyway, that Thresh has eighteen bloody assists. It would be weird if he was under-levelled without items.\n\nAnd you have extraordinarily high ping. Are you certain that it couldn't be that?","replies":[]}]}
