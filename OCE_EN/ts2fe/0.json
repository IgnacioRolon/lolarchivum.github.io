I'm about to give you a little lesson:\n\nMages are traditionally in mid lane because mid lane is the smallest lane in the game. Mages (again, traditionally) have weak escapes until the League Of Mobility champions came and ruined the game's meta. Mordekaiser is a melee mage.\n\nThe reason why you wouldn't want to do Mordekaiser top is because it's a big lane, Mordekaiser has no escapes or movement speed steroids. He's already slow as a boat. Unlike the 355 movement speed ass of a champ known as Pantheon. Whenever I'm jungling and there is a Mordekaiser top, I see it as a free kill waiting for me. Because Mordekaiser already pushes lanes hard with his Q, W and E. \n\n%%%%%%ed champions like Pantheon already beat the %%%% out of Mordekaiser early on in the game because of Mordekaiser's health costs.\n\nStick to Mordekaiser mid. This is also the reason I pioneered Darius mid.
