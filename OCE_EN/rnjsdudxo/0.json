I currently have 293RP and I REALLY wanna get bloodmoon Shen skin which is 750RP. However, even if I purchase $5 of RP, I recieve 450RP which makes my total budget of my account 743RP. U know how desperate I am TT. Once I play LOL in Korea server, I have the same problem like this and my friends said I can recieve the small amount of RP if I cannot buy stuffs due to this. So I have a memory that I recieved 20RP from inquiry and got Ezreal skin in Korean server. Is it possible to get the most valuable 7RP for my lovely Shen skin..? I believe u and purchase 450RP now;) Thank youuuuuu!","replies":[{"poster":"xEternalFeederx","date":"2019-11-22T05:28:22.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure they were doing that if you drew them a nice picture or something a few years back, dunno anymore","replies":[]}]}
