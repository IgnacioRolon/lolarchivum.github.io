If I was supporting and my ADC got caught by a condemn I'd rather have time to react with a shield / heal and cleanse them out with Mikael's. Now they'll just get bursted before I even notice.  I like that it deals the damage first on minions though.

What is Riot thinking? Legacy Cursor removed because they felt like it? It doesn't feel or look nice at all and I changed to the old one the minute I realised I could. These patch notes on champion changes feel unnecessary too. The Vayne wall damage was completely un-needed as she's already plenty strong and doing perfectly fine in the current meta. Why give Xerath so much early pressure with his ult? The Bug fixes we've been asking for for years still haven't even been considered yet. What's going on with Warwicks incredibly loud death sound? Simple things are being messed with that doesn't need addressing and the more important simple things are being left out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Griswold","date":"2019-07-31T02:04:36.397+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I rarely get motivated enough by any of your changes to actually bother posting, but I can't let this one slide. No siree. \r\n\r\nYour context given for the removal of the Legacy Cursor makes it seem arbitrary, as though someone in development just said, \"Hey this thing's old, lets get rid of it!\" A lot of old, veteran players like myself do not find this explanation even remotely apropriate or satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere was a very good reason that I, and I suspect many other players never swapped over to the new cursor upon its inital release. Familiarity. The Legacy Cursor is something I've been staring at for 7+ years, my brain is very comfortable watching it move across the screen, and adept at pointing it accurately at my targets.\r\n\r\nThe first game I ever play with the new cursor, it was extremely awkward and distracting. My brain couldn't stop pulling its attention towards this new, shiny, out-of-place looking thing that was buzzing about the screen. My click precision felt clumsy and obscured, like using some novelty mouse cursor from the early 2000's. Overall, there was this inescapable sensation that something was both wrong AND missing. I swapped back to the Legacy Cursor the next game and never touched the new one again.\r\n\r\nNow you are ripping away my ability to choose in a change that stands to affect only the oldest portion of your playerbase, the people that helped give this game its now critical-mass to begin with, and the only justification we're given is, 'it's old and you throw out old things'.\r\n\r\nNot cool.\r\n\r\nI'd be more understanding if it was because of some sort of wild spaghetti code that was somehow breaking the game, or some other form of removal via blatant necessity, but the context provided is barely even a reason at all.\r\n\r\nPlease return the Legacy Cursor to us, for he was taken too young.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\n\r\nGriswold.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mahakala","date":"2019-07-31T09:05:50.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How dare you cancel the gauntlet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DuskGlade","date":"2019-07-31T06:38:35.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls bring cursor back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cpt Jax Parrow","date":"2019-07-31T04:25:15.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never felt the need to comment on a riot post before no matter how happy or upset a change made me until this very moment.
