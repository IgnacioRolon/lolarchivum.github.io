You and your team will be constantly playing from behind because 1 person connected 5 minutes into the game. And although it's not impossible to win, it decreases you and your teams chances of winning quite a lot which isn't seen as competitive or fair.

No one enjoys having a disadvantage. However, I think 20 odd LP is a lot to lose though and might need to be toned down because some people may legitimately be unable to join for numerous reasons, and that's unfortunate but it shouldn't impact the team.\r\n\r\nHowever in normals, connecting late puts you in a disadvantage for sure, however the results of a loss aren't as impactful to the team as they are in the ranked environment.\r\n\r\nSomeone would have to join late in ranked games quite often for this change to negatively impact their league experience. Suffering a punishment of LP for connecting 3 minutes late shouldn't be a huge deal or common. And as i mentioned earlier, if it is common look for a fix.

(I wasn't able to directly reply to your comment).\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world you shouldn't because it's unfortunate and unpredictable, none of you or your team mates should be penalized for a connection bug within the game. However Riot is pretty good when it comes to disconnects, loading screen is delayed to ensure a disconnected player has enough time to re-join, that and personally it's very rare for me to receive a game crash. Regardless I have never been unable to re-connect to a game after a crash, but perhaps i am just lucky. \r\n\r\nHowever, 1 loss isn't the end of the world. And if you lose multiple games and lose a ton of LP because of this new system, it may be an issue you have to look into rather than riot. Maybe repair your client or look into troubleshooting internet connection issues. \r\n\r\nBut this whole system is looking after the team or victim of a disconnect, rather than the person who is disconnected. You might get frustrated that you lost LP because you didn't connect due to a bug splat or something, but imagine how the other 4 team mates feel when you finally connect after 5+ minutes of being AFK and you're all playing from behind with an increased chance of losing. \r\n\r\nThis for me is more common (it's an un-common occurance, however it is more common than myself not able to connect), finding team mates who never join or join late and i'm forced to change my play style and adapt to a disadvantage I personally have no control over. \r\n\r\nRegarding the amount of LP, yes, this is based of your mmr.

This effect isn't too big when you're at the twentieth minute of a [possibly] horribly losing game but when someone's just given up hope and throwing themselves at the enemy team because the remake vote didn't get through at the third minute, well it's probably going to be the longest 17 minute period you've played LoL through.\r\n\r\nI think it's important to have the \"No first blood\" condition, which is also a condition for Early Abandon.

You can't fix this by giving the winning team LP anyway, as they would all climb, whilst the other team won't lose LP despite the fact they were losing anyway.\r\n\r\nI think the punishments should be reduced, as the player loses 20 LP, for what is most likely either a client or server bug. If it is a problem with the technology of the player, this should be easily monitored by graphical settings/ FPS rates seen throughout games that given player has played. If the settings are low and/or the frame rates are really low, its due to the hardware, not the software.\r\n\r\nI think Riot is onto something here, and whilst it isn't perfect, they've definitely put a lot of thought into all of this, and are taking a step in the right direction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JaffacakesPizza","date":"2016-05-20T06:53:09.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After 4 years,\r\nits finally here!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaisa","date":"2016-05-20T01:29:46.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is to stop the other team feeding you one kill to stop a remake?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chickenfeed","date":"2016-05-19T22:13:38.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again the Howling Abyss isnt included.

Have 2 notifications, one after the 3min mark, and if there is an agreement to a remake, then the next call to confirm the remake will come after the 7min mark. That way you can nut out the AFK's to the people with connection issues.\r\nThis system would work better if Riot did take out the deaths and kills aspect of it, that shouldn't matter whatsoever if there really is an AFK in the game.\r\nSo I completely and utterly agree to many of \"Soviax The Llama\" responses and Riot for trying to creating this AFK system for the gamers, yet I also believe that it should be placed in EVERY game mode, including Arams and other games, besides Classic Rift. Though Riot would need to eliminate the death and kills score, it's not needed in my opinion, people will find a kill just to continue the game to get an easy win.
