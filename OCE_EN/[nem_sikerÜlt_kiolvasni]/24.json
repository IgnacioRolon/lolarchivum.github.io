Rumble is red ranger, kindred is yellow ranger, Shyvana is pink ranger, and fizz the blue ranger. This means that there should be a green or black ranger. If the current super galaxy team are meant to fit into their own roles on the map respectively, then the last ranger (if rumble is to stay as the current red ranger) could be a support role champion, like karma (green ranger) or alistar (black ranger) with animal components in their design. Karma could have snakes and alistar a bull. I have also noticed that all the current super galaxy skins are also junglers, so in this case the black ranger could be evelynn (seeing she hasn't received a skin in such a long time) or elise.
