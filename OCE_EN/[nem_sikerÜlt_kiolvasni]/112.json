When I am playing the supporting role with Thresh I apply relic shield as a starting item, I naturally try to help my ADC by getting last hits on enemy minions but for some reason I am not able to collect the gold when the minion is on the relic's specified health for gold income and health return to the ADC. I must hit the Minion or monster with health below a normal basic Thresh attack. \r\n\r\nIf these issues could be resolved that would be wonderful.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n SCOREGASM{{champion:412}} ","replies":[{"poster":"HerpMaDerp","date":"2015-07-17T10:26:29.535+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"The 'problem' you have with Thresh and Relic Shield is an intentional mechanic as the shield was designed for melee champions...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snickers","date":"2015-07-19T06:53:31.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is a confused soul (hehe) as he doesn't identify as ranged or melee, the Relic Shield bug/intentional bs or whatever it actually is will probably be here to stay for the foreseeable future as he's still very competitive.
