Also when are wolves getting a buff to meet the standards of the rest of the jungle camps, because wolves do basically no damage compared to the other camps, and maybe all I want is a tip in the loading screen to pop up sometimes like 'beware the raptors' just as a friendly reminder, that maybe it might not be the best idea to try to take raptors when you're below 1/4hp.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2017-02-01T08:11:03.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didnt the top singed player(mastery score wise) get banned for playing singed sup with smite, and now its okay?","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T11:12:44.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get banned for picking certain champs?","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2017-02-02T20:37:18.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people got banned for playing Olaf when he was very underpowered at the time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SuckMyDuck","date":"2017-02-01T04:32:51.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"SIon mains FTW\r\n{{champion:14}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-14T12:30:29.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just thought of the best idea.
