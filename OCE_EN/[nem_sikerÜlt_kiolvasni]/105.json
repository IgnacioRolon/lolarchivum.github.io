It's good to see great things coming to OCE. However, I feel like there should be a way to make pre-set scenarios as well in 'Practice tool':\r\n\r\n* Where champions start. (whether alive or dead)\r\n* Neutral camp active or on cool-down. (alive or dead)\r\n* Cool-down's ability timers.\r\n* Time of game. (To determine if Major neutral camps is available at current time)\r\n* Neutral buffs are currently active on champions (Red and Blue buff, smite bonuses, amount of dragon buffs and/or the Baron Buff)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso not adding to the pre-set scenery list but if it was possible to reset champion levels and skills that would be great as well as some people would like to practice laning phase last hitting or jungling off-meta or meta champions.\r\n\r\nThankyou for reading over my comment and I hope that this idea will be considered in your next meeting.

I never really found it to be something that they focused on, despite it being such a basic and fundamental skill. I personally find that my map awareness is absolutely horrid, which is something i should and probably can just fix myself, however this seems to be a problem for many players. Due to this I feel that tutorials should focus more on the fundamentals of the game, then have this mode focus more on the skills, it should hopefully also provide a way to help improve accessibility for new players without sacrificing  the depth I know Riot is so fond of.This is just how I feel though. \r\nLooking forward to this mode, I always love trying out things -often stupid and so impossible in a PvP game- in custom games, this would help with that on top of skill improvement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mistforge","date":"2016-10-14T22:06:42.898+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really excited for this.

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion.
