I have a complaint about the DiscountBot. I think that the bot should be updated to take into account amount of play time and amount of skins on that champion. I got an udyr skin, but already have spirit guard. I also got prestigious leblanc, but i have played her maybe 3 times? It was the same situation with tf. SKin for him, barely play him, not interested in playing him. i was really hoping for headhunter rengar, a thresh skin, and a graves skin. But i was throuroughly disappointed. This is purely feedback for future Your Shop releases. I believe that the bot could be improved greatly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KinG paceR","date":"2017-05-19T00:42:32.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yah the shop isnt working lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Tasty","date":"2017-05-19T00:16:47.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep working now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Tasty","date":"2017-05-18T22:59:29.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep wont open","replies":[]}]}
