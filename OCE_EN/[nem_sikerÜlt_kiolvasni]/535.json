Can't help but feel like oce is screwed wait 2 years for server skin then find out we have to pay for it. i have a smurf and main both have all these runes and now u say its half price permanently i literally bought all these runes 2 weeks ago on my smurf.... its not even easy to farm ip half the games u play someone trolls u and when u get mad u  get reported and whenever i play and troll because some1 has trolled me no1 reports me and every gets mad at the person that gets trolled its actually a joke this reform system breeds trolls, if u troll nothing happens if u get angry at a troll your \"toxic\". Even when your not being toxic people just abuse other people for doing bad when theyre doing bad as well... then you defend the other person and cop abuse and reports as well.... its slightly better people play solo lanes at least you can't get trolled by laning partner as much but when your adc + support and the support afks and its a 1 v 2 lane and people abuse you and say its your fault u get dominated i think u have a right to be angry and if u vent your anger you are reported and the troll wins its awesome how this system works.","replies":[{"poster":"King Icy","date":"2015-09-30T03:05:15.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} More pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeazzellTV","date":"2015-09-30T03:41:38.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Man Speeketh The Truth, yet RITO is an American based company so why would they care as long as we play and give them money for RP now and then they don't give a f*** if we are abused, threatened or made to feel bad, we're just little oce. Yesterday I got super abused by a malphite who took mid and forced me to play support. He then abused me for every thresh hook I missed and made no comment on all the ones I landed, I muted him but I could still see my team arguing with him constantly as they pushed our nexus he made sure every one else knew it was there fault, end of the game I didn't even bother reporting. Why would I, at best it will warn him and he'll go do it again ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Eplox","date":"2015-10-01T05:02:12.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are so many people complaining that there is a sale?
