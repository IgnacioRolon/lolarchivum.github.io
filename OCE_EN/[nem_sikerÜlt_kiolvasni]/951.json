We did not qualify for MSI (lost at Wildcards) so you can't get the gilded regional Summoner Icon for 1 IP. You can however get the gilded regional Summoner Icon for 250 RP.\r\n\r\nTo use an example, if Korea wins MSI then players on the Korean server will get the gilded regional  Summoner Icon for 1 IP. Every other region can purchase it for 250 RP.\r\n\r\nYou can also get the MSI 2016 Summoner Icon in the store right now for 1 IP. The other region ones cost 250 RP.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sneaky Adolf","date":"2016-04-28T14:38:01.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's no surprise that we lost...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-28T05:11:49.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummer!
