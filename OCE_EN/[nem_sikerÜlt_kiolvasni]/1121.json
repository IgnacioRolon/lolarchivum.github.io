It can take a fair while to get the transform (relative to game length) and due to the increased gold income you often have an item or even two completed by the time you get enough orbs for a transform, loosely forcing you to take one form over the other depending on item build. However, in such a fast gamemode the 4 minute transform timer (if you got blue transform and want red or vice versa) feels too long and too punishing to wait for in a fast game mode such as this.\r\n\r\nConcurrently to this, it is a lot harder in this mode to force one transform or the other compared to SR. Since there are more champs close together you cant reliably say, \"Oh I want red kayn and I'm 95% of the way there, I'll gank toplane to finish the transform I want.\" In this mode its really hard to actively force one transform or the other and the 4 minute wait is significantly more punishing in this.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"zHaydos","date":"2018-08-29T02:11:54.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like to see bans being implemented however it still being blind pick, just to get rid of champions that are overpowered or that are very common, and that's not just in NB but in most rotating gamemodes, take ARURF for example, you can get screwed entirely because someone happened to chance on a broken champion (e.g. {{champion:24}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:37}} )","replies":[]}]}
