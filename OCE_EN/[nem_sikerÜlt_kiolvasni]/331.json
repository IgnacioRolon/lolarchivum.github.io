Right now at this moment my MMR would have dropped significantly. I have many losses now, not one win since 6 games and there will always be either one or two people on my team who will not comply to a simple request by the team and I know for a fact that this will not happen in many of my other games leading to an easy game or a close win. I know that how I play is how I play every game and that i HAD a 65%-70% winrate for every support game I played but my games seems to have those really low mmr players. What im  trying to ask is, could u check whether it is honestly just me and that im doing something wrong or either the system has lowered my mmr dramatically to the lower rating/lower rated players.\r\nThx Riot\r\n \r\nYours Sincerely, Lhuka ","replies":[{"poster":"Laxiliary","date":"2016-03-09T03:27:50.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea upvote, I'm srsly questioning some of the players in my match up.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-03-09T06:56:28.468+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreeded.

Easiest way to solve it is just winning because the more your win the higher your MMR will be so you will stop being patched with lower ranked players 'idiots' OR, it is because your loss rate is low so you are being matched with what Riot thinks you are. The system has bugs but they are not easily fixed and might not be fixed for years to come so you just put up with it and try to climb ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lhuka","date":"2016-03-09T18:10:15.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"winning what exactly,Norms or Ranked.
