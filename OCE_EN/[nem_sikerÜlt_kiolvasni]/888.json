How many games do people feed or afk or quit etc Yet if you do well and get say 27/3/15, but you lose the game because your team is on 1/15/0.. You won't rank up because your team was useless or afked etc. ELO doesn't work.

If you start utilizing the death recap as a general guide to gain advantage over your enemy, and not definite figures, then you would not be asking for them to remove the feature. Information is knowledge, and knowledge is power in the right hands. Will a better, more updated death recap improve your gaming experience? Maybe, but very insignificantly.

In all my years of playing, I have never once thought about blaming the death recap as the reason for why I got outperformed and outplayed.
