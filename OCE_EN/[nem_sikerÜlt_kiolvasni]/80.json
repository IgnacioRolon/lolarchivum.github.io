Starting with the { and ending with the }, add the following line under \"name\": \"General\"\r\n                        {\r\n                            \"name\": \"SnapCameraOnRespawn\",\r\n                            \"value\": \"0\"\r\n                        },\r\n\r\nNOTE: All values in these settings are binary with 0 = no and 1 = yes, so knock yourself out having a play with other settings but first **save a copy of this file directly into your League of Legends folder** in case you make a mistake lol That way you can copy a 'good' version over top of anything you mess up.\r\nFor the camera snap on respawn thing, make sure to copy/paste *everything* between the two { }, including any blank looking lines and spaces or it wont work. Be sure to check that the text you have copied into that file matches the format of the text already there or, like with the spaces and {, it will not work. Save and close and then go to the properties of that file and make sure the \"Read Only\" box is selected (this stops the game from changing the settings). \r\nBe aware though that any changes you make ingame through the gui (ingame settings) will not save and will be in effect for that game only (that's what making the .json file 'read only' does, only YOU can change those settings and only by opeing the .json file yourself and doing it there, neither the game or even running repair can make changes to your settings), so if you want to make any permanent setting changes ingame after that, first *uncheck* the 'read only' option, make the changes ingame or in the file itself, save and then make the file 'read only' again. \r\nHope this helps =) ","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-09-21T16:52:19.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, if you make your ItemSets.json file 'read only' too, then running repair will not erase them from inside your client. \r\nYou can also save these .json files onto a flashdrive and install them onto any PC you wish to use and have your settings on the fly wherever you wish to play. Just remember to leave things how you found them. So save a copy of the *original* .json files into the League of Legends folder on the borrowed computer so that you can copy over your own when you are done =)  ","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-09-22T00:57:20.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY :O editing it to 0 with read only has finally made it not snap back!!!
