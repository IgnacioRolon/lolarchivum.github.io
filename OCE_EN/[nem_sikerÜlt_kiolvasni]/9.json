She really only has burst if she has/sets up access to her full combo. Without her ult she's all poke, which evidently they did tune down.\n\nI haven't played enough of her in normals to come to any concrete conclusions (and bearing in mind gameplay is not my area), but I haven't found her ult all that problematic. Yes it does a lot of damage, but it also has a lot of counterplay, which is more than I can say for some other ults.\n\nSo I guess the question is, do you think it should be nerfed just because it's higher than what most mages get, or do you think it should be nerfed because it's problematic?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nihiru","date":"2018-12-18T01:41:15.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The Tiamat changes of increasing the cost greatly affects top lane champions who relied on it for their primary source of waveclear, whereas other champions who have reliable waveclear at a cheap cost were barely affected by the change at all. Because the item was mainly early-mid game, champions such as J4 must stay in an abusive lane for an additional 125 gold without any changes to compensate his already awful top lane clear and will go oom much faster. Surely the great minds at the riot balance team know this, and wont let j4 stay as a garbage top laner for another year","replies":[{"poster":"itsJono","date":"2018-12-18T11:46:01.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot arent worried about non-toplaners when it comes to this change. j4 is, has and always will be a jungler primarily","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-18T02:59:50.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes I wonder if riot buffs a champ for high ELOs, come back a season later and nerf them for low elos, then buff them for low elos and go back to buff them for high elos just to keep the game fresh.","replies":[]}]}
