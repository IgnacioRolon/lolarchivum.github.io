You have a team of 5 players , so that you can function as a unit. For a normal game, its still rude and inconsiderate to waste peoples time with poor choices , but so be it , normals are meant to be for fun , but for ranked , its really inexcusable to not put some thought into what your actually selecting. Simply put, some champions are just not made for certain roles , not effective anyway. And its not just about picking a team full of power picks , but also how those champions compliment and work together. Just because a PRO picks a odd pick , like yorick mid , doesnt mean you should too. Not unless the rest of your team has picked all the same , and your versing the same lineup as that pro did. While a \" blitz + ali \" bot lane might function , that still leaves your team short any ranged ADC , unless you somehow fit them into another spot. And not having a ranged ADC is a big weakness alot of the time.\r\n\r\nIve played games with odd team compositions , but they should still be put together with at least a general strategy in mind. I once lost to a team with 5 support champs. They simply werent beatable. They all also took the tower defense spell ( i forget what it was called ) and all healed/buffed/debuffed ect eachother and us constantly , while chain linking that tower protection spell so we couldnt push effectively.  \r\n\r\nPicking a random champ just because you want to doesnt make it the right thing to do. Its a team game , you win and lose as a team , so you should be thinking about how your pick benefits the team as a whole. AND thinking further ahead then just lane phase , but how the team will work when it comes to late game 5v5 fights. If you dont want to think like that , then you should NOT be playing ranked games at all. Ranked is designed to be competitive. If your not going to put some real thought into it , then your not really taking it seriously , and just wasting yours and your teammates time. Stick to normals and play for fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crepr","date":"2015-09-16T13:18:33.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvote, this makes perfect sense.

Once you think they're okay to have a decent game with again, unblock them and, like FB, can't block them again for another 48 hours (to give them a chance, might be 1 bad game). It's like using the school class to punish the loud kid, the more ppl block him/her, the longer the queue time, the more likely - hopefully - they would want to reform.\r\n\r\n**2 - Like an honour band, there should be a toxicity/leaver band in loading screen.** Toxicity could be a %, when it's going up, red, going down, blue, constant, yellow. When it reaches 100%, insta-temporary ban. \r\nAnd/or a ratio for how many afk's/dc's, so 1 in every 100 games (1:100).\r\nThese bands can warn players of repeat offenders and encourage those trying to reform.\r\n\r\n**3 - In post game lobby, when reporting, it should be a multiple selection, rather than just one.** I understand this is probably to categorise them into simple niches, but sometimes a player can be equally \"Unskilled\" and \"Intentionally feeding\" and \"Verbal Abuse\" and \"Refusing to communicate with team\" all at once. There should also be a counter to the later being \"Refusing to respond to teams communications\". Hmmm. Also a \"kill joy/party pooper\" for all those \"it's just a game/norms\". Lol. Jk.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with those in the comments that say \"sometimes some people deserve to be told off in game\". No, I don't think so. Even when it's not directed at me, I feel anxious and annoyed at arguing in the game, and it puts off _my_ game, then _I_ do bad and they start yelling at _me_. A simple \"please don't do this\" or \"You could do that better, this is how\" is best I believe. They either take it or leave it. If they take it, the team is better off, if they don't, then mute them and warn players that this particular team member is not to be relied upon. Raging at someone just shows your insecurities about your own game play. \r\n\r\nThe pre-game lobby \"reject\" button, is a great idea, although would become redundant if the 3 pointers are taken into play or the \"Intentional feeding\" ban works. Plus it's redundant if you still have to play the game, like CadoAzazel suggests, seeing as in the post-game lobby, you can report them instead. What would be good is if there was another 30 second slot of time before the champ swapping time, where, if one team has 4 votes against the troll, it opens up the chat and vote to the other team, and they can vote and decide to forfeit the game as well. This will avoid the \"their team pick is better\" dodge. \r\n\r\nLong post, sorry.
