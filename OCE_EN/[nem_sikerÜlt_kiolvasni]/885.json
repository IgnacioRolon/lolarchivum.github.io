Are we making it and putting it on us or printing it on paper?\r\n\r\nIf there were some examples that would be handy :^)\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"hehe nice meme","date":"2017-01-31T13:27:53.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Your entry must be made by you, submitted by you, and made for this contest: this is about YOU showing YOUR artistic talents specifically for this contest\"\r\n\r\nYour page says the guns were commissioned, so if you're using jinx make sure it's only the parts you made! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-01-24T20:50:33.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey you are meant to become a homeguard.
