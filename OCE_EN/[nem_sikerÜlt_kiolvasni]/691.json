I have one question. Why are you keeping urf away from us when its what your player base enjoys the most? If u have it as a gamemode that is always up, i'm sure more people will be pulled into the game. You may want people to play norms and ranked and that's fine, I understand. But at least have the rotating gamemode be ROTATING. There has been Poro king for 4 weeks and i understand the Christmas theme so sure. But ascension for 2 weeks!? And if Poro kind is out for 4 weeks for snowdown then there better be 4 weeks of U.R.F for April Fools day. But knowing Rito there will most likely not even BE U.R.F for ONE WEEKEND when its April fools. So please Riot listen to everyone who wants urf back.
