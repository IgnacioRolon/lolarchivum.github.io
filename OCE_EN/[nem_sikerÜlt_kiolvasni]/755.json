They all took ghost/heal, had gibberish summoner names, bought no items, and repeatedly charged into towers to die. \r\n\r\nIt not only makes the game less fun, but makes it difficult for players to test out whatever build or strategy they are investigating because all the balance between teams is screwed up if 3 players aren't playing properly.\r\n\r\nCan you please take steps to prevent these bot scripts completely?
