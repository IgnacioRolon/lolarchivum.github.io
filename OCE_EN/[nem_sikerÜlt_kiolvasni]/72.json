However, there are still many old in game models that do not match the quality of the splash arts.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, when a player(customer) is drawn to a skin and the player really loves the splash art, he/she then proceeds to look for the skin spotlight or buys the skin but only to find disappointment in the quality of the 3D model, then it would be a problem.\r\n\r\nBecause:\r\n1. Players may become discouraged to buy some of the skins.\r\n2. Higher expectation leading to higher disappointment.\r\n3. Base model looks better than some of the skins. Hence, no need to buy them.\r\n4. Having one good skin is enough, no need to buy other skins that are not as good.\r\n\r\nTherefore, less profit.\r\nThese are some of the factors that would affect sales and diversity in skin utilisation.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen, Riot likes diversity in Champion selection, build paths, tactics etc. I believe skins should be too. Instead of people always using premium skins. I'd love to buy and use different skins on a champion if the other 3D models are nearly as good.\r\n\r\nWell, if the expense is higher than the potential profit, then don't worry about it.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, thank you for reading.\r\n\r\nTL;DR In game models do not match the quality of splash arts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-04-08T12:27:06.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see the pink fur is staying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordZernack","date":"2016-04-12T04:18:49.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I Think They Should buff {{champion:33}} he currently sux","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordZernack","date":"2016-04-12T03:40:36.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"BloodyHell Why Dont You Change {{champion:44}} some more","replies":[]},{"poster":"FiddleMeDiddle","date":"2016-04-11T22:41:29.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"this is gayer than aids. lmao so good much troll","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mrsandwich","date":"2016-04-11T09:51:30.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why is he called \"the shield of valoran\".
