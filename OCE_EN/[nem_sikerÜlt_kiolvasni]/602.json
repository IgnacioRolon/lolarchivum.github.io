Three times I have been in this predicament and in some cases my opponent has had no runes, and by the way its been in ranked and unranked games while playing mid.This seems to be an unfair advantage to those of us who spend alot of time and money on this game.As for ranked. Why dont those of us who have been playing this game for years be placed in seperate rank levels to those who have only recently joined.Cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lulu is my Waifu","date":"2016-07-26T10:26:38.270+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://gyazo.com/4a17bd140f6a7a4d6998f349bef7966d","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BallsD33p","date":"2016-07-26T10:23:46.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are these going to be put into the entire project web page? like additional branched off sections from the original project segment?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ash10","date":"2016-07-26T10:04:57.450+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:4}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"hey im cloud","date":"2016-07-26T05:53:51.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"come on riot{{item:3070}} making me stay up all night waiting for my project skins{{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-07-26T05:40:29.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not Project: {{champion:17}} ?
