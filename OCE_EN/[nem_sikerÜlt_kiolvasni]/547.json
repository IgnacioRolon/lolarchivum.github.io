Come on. Although I do watch them, I don't go for any of the lcs, lpl or gpl. Not even in the opl. But when it's international you have to go for your home team. So I ask you, who did the reporting for this?\nIn what world is this \"second\"?  \nhttp://prntscr.com/89rfyv\nIt clearly says first place. At most TIED for FIRST place. But due to the Chiefs starting with C and DFM starting with a D. Chiefs actually hold FIRST PLACE.","replies":[{"poster":"Amildheadache","date":"2015-08-28T05:35:11.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because of the head to head score , DFM beat the Cheifs in the match between them.

They are finally showing the world aussie bois can play league at a international level. I think that beating BT is a milestone in its own right.. Well done Chiefs, keep doing what you do best!\r\n\r\nIf the made worlds maybe aussie gamers would get some well deserved respect!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-28T05:13:19.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprisingly even matches. with the round-robin effect in place (A beat B. C beat D. D beat A. B beat C etc)\n\nThat being said I've seen better plays/teamwork from high Diamond NA/EU streamers than i did from the \"best of the rest\". Kinda disappoint.\n\nDark Passage, winners last year, absolutely terrible. Diana with the classic \"rage splitpush\".\n\n\"DIANA!
