All the ADC can do is stay as close as they can to the support at all times, and pray that the support is competent enough.\r\nNot to mention thats a 2v1 situation.\r\n\r\n_\"DW guys, Assassins are balanced as long as you always outnumber them,\"_ is hardly a valid argument. especially when you consider the meaning of the word 'balance'.\r\n\r\nPlus what if you don't happen to have one of the two most banned supports in the world?\r\nWhat if you have a Brand or Lux \"Support\", or a support like Braum, who has very little in his kit to stop a Zed immediately assassination an ADC.\r\n\r\nAnd this isn't about me moaning, I don't even really play ADC, I'm a mid laner. It's just me bewildered that they think ADC's have this entire tool-kit at their disposal to easily deal with shit like Zed or Talon.\r\n\r\nAlso, regardless of your positioning, if a Zed really wants your ass, it belongs to him!\r\nWith Ghostblade, Edge of Night, 2 fairly long-rage dashes, untargetability, a get-out-of-jail free blink, and a flash, he has hella more tools at his disposal to get you, than you as an immobile squishy, do to get away.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not saying that ranged damage dealers should be tanky, I'm just saying \"No\" to riot thinking that they have all these anti-assassin tools.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-10-11T11:38:45.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"if a Zed uses everything to get to you, one polymorph, knockup or cc from the support and he's immediately done. If he uses everything to jump you, lets say he does. He's now confronted with cc, an adc who's had their health more than doubled thanks to shields, and now he's outnumbered without cooldowns to escape with. Zed's w only works once, and his ult works once, if he uses w>ult to gapclose, well he's not got anything left to get out with.\n\nYou could have Faker on Zed, against a bunch of Silvers, but if the silvers group up, the tank buys locket and knights vow, the support has shields and cc, and everyone crawls turtle formation down mid, the very best outcome, would be dying to kill the adc and that may not even work if the tank has enough hp to donate.\n\nand again, Adcs aren't supposed to have tools to survive assassins in their kit, because they aren't supposed to 1v1 assassins. It's why supports and peel tanks exist. In a teamfight an adc is worth a considerable amount more than an Assassin. So much so, that lategame teamfights, going 1 for 1 with an adc is often worth regardless of the difference in kda.\n\nIf you give Adcs a whole bunch of in kit survivability, on top of supports who already buff adc damage, provide cc, shields/heals, movespeed, and the Tank Gargoyle+Locket combo. Then that would be the definition of unbalanced. \nBecause what does an Assassin/Diver/Fighter do then?\n\nThere are a plethora of tools to protect adcs and squishies from Assassins in the meta. It's just those tools aren't built by the adcs themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-16T09:03:14.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, that requires actually having a Lulu, one again, one of the most banned supports in the game.\r\n\r\nMy whole point isn't that ADC's should be able to 1v1 assassins.
