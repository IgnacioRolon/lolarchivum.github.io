Point being, if you're improving, you should really be able to *see* that this season, so even if you start a bit lower than you'd like, you'll have a much better idea of your improvement.\n\nPositional matchmaking will also alleviate a lot of the drama that occurs when players get autofilled.\n\nI'd also strongly recommend focusing on one thing at a time. Look at ranked as a ladder (there's a reason Riot uses that analogy a lot). Instead of placing your metaphorical rungs so far apart (one rung per rank), add rungs between those high points in your climb, it'll make things a lot easier and you'll climb a lot faster. If a rung is unreachable from the one you're on, you're not going to go anywhere.\n\nIf your CS could use some work, make that your first rung, then maybe you could put lane pressure, wave management, vision control. Even if you're only making small improvements, they will work towards increasing your overall skill. Set and work towards smaller goals you can achieve *now*, and the big moments will come on their own.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"x Pickle x","date":"2018-12-05T07:54:33.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just installed the v8.24 patch but still no Neeko or skins etc... any updates?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revs","date":"2018-12-05T04:50:11.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When are the server transfers going to be available again :/?

Say, how about you display the radius when you click on the spell, rather than just the range you can place it. And with the deployed spell radius, you should add these for Kog'maw and Veigar, since it's unfair that their skins show the landing position a lot clearer than others. And Lux' ult especially.. Oh my god, give that an indicator already. Xerath's q has one, but the hitbox on Lux' ult is impossible to assess..","replies":[]},{"poster":"IBarry","date":"2018-12-04T19:47:01.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First.
