This is an initative, not the answer. Change starts from us. If you feel that this will have no impact, THEN THIS IS FOR YOU! Mental health isnt a subject to brush off, nor is this a point to feel that Riot are in there for the publicity. \r\n\r\nRiot are well aware of the issues that plague the title both within and outside the game (looking at you reddit) but to rule with an Iron Fist on anyone that says anything negative is counter productive. On the vice versa, doing nothing (like not punishing toxic players, or people that give up) also results in nothing. \r\n\r\nHaving a network that promotes healthy life choices, especially for your mental state, is the right direction to promote a healthy community. Dont flame the Yas that is feeding mid, maybe be positive and give some helpful tips... yes you will lose LP, and it SUCKS!!!! But Flaming will only tilt more, it doesn't fix the problem. No-one will get better if all they hear is that they are trash, and you wont get better if you keep vsing players that are not skilled (sure you will stomp, but then when you rank up you will get stomped). \r\n\r\nI support this and would love for the community to look into this as well.
