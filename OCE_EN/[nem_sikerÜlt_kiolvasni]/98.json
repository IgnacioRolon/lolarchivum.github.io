It's why tri brush is a great spot. It maximises your ward coverage (Multiple paths converging on the same spot makes it more likely someone will pass) as opposed to a ward inside baron pit which is more a desperation ward than anything else.\r\n\r\nIf you've set up your wards properly then you'll have a good idea of where everyone is anyway, or after you've played a while and get used to the play patterns then you'll be able to estimate where people are, and at that point you'll know if they're heading towards baron or dragon.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RipperRopper3000","date":"2015-07-21T20:37:33.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"Uhhhhhh why would you make the Dragon and Baron timers shown to both teams automatically?

When someone can't though, if you sneak a dragon, it means you now know the time of death and you can use that knowledge to get every single dragon after that.

But overall a great concept.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that with baron/dragon timers and team summoner/ult timers now being displayed in game and in the new hud that soon the same will be true for enemy summoner/ult timers. I don't think it'll be 'dumbing down' the game because it's the same thing as a teammate communicating this information to their team through voice comms or through (the clumsiness) of typing it in chat.
