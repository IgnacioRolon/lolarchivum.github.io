Diversity in the bottom lane is fine but you don't seem to understand you don't get diversity by swapping out the meta for a new meta you get diversity by expanding the bot lane meta.

Let me hit riot balance team with some #logic.\r\n\r\n\"First, we're putting some strength back into the kits of a number of crit marksmen, who have been facing stiff competition in bot lane.\"\r\n\r\nWhy would you try and give us this Bull when you didnt change, the champions themselves, The runes and you didnt even change the items. What you did do is nerf lucean because you are under the impressions somehow that he was stomping botlane, NO, he was not he was winning late game because of his passive and ability to use black cleaver for armour pen. THAT WAS WHY HE WAS GETTING PICKED HEAVILY, BECAUSE YOUR NERF THE **** OUT OF ADC AND MAKE IT A BRUISER TYPE OF META. I think maybe you knew this which is why IE was changed to true damage.\r\n\r\nHonestly in my opinion I think if riot balance team is commited to this change then what is needed is additional ADC items for example, items that would prioritize things like, CRIT, HEALTH, ARMOUR, MR. I think more diversity in those directions would be a good direction in the way of the role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MountBicephius","date":"2018-06-27T00:24:34.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about instead of inappropriate name detection, you make inappropriate gameplay detection? It's really fun when someone wants to die on purpose 8 times and they explain in chat that they are doing it on purpose. It's also very fun when someone rages in game chat and then afks. I think everyone would prefer if you focused on that part instead of worrying about someone having a gross name that people won't like.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-27T10:33:22.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The change to summ name detection is a tiny change that just supplies more feedback for player reports (a good thing). It's hardly stopping other things from being improved and put in place.\n\nAfks/DCs/RQs are consistently punished by LeaverBuster. Chat is consistently punished by the Instant Feedback System (you only have to look through the Player Behaviour board, which is only a minority of punished players at that). Gameplay punishments are a little trickier and slower to take because the behaviour is harder to detect (where do you draw the line between intent feeding and mad tilted and making bad calls in any given game) but those punishments do happen.\n\nThe name change isn't +1 to name detection and -1 to everything else. It's *only* a positive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sonan","date":"2018-06-27T08:07:15.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forget filtering the summoner names better, delet all those corny loli clubs already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonan","date":"2018-06-27T08:04:19.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shields get nerfed last patch, and now the two recent reworked champs have anti-shield perks.\r\nLux shields are still aids regardless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enacra","date":"2018-06-26T21:42:02.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Um...the jungle...","replies":[]},{"poster":"CastingDeath","date":"2018-06-26T19:40:42.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey I am First!","replies":[]}]}
