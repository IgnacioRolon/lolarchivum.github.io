But if you do believe that trolls are online or that you lost because you think are unskilled then its ok. You can just wait for the kids who have to go to bed at night so you have a less chance of little kid ragers and trolls cause they are humans 2 they need sleep. Also if you think you are unskilled dont be scared making mistakes is the first step to progress by knowing  what you did wrong and learn from it. If you face against people who are beating you in lane think of what they are thinking/doing and see what you did that was a mistake so you can improve and make it a habit.
