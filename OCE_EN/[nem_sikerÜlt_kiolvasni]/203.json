Extremely disgusted Riot, you've had every other game mode 3 times since URF was on last. Rotating game mode? URF is now Yorick, he's never on rotation. You clearly know that URF is immensely popular, because every bloody time you post \"Rotating game mode queue is now live!\" the top comments are \"URF???\".

If it was on too often then it would become extremely boring. The thing that makes you want it so bad is because it isn't being given to you every week, and if you got it every week then you wouldn't appreciate the game mode as much. Also Riot said that URF was still only going to be on a couple times a year and you complaining about it in their posts isn't going to change their schedule.","replies":[{"poster":"HugoeBeestlee","date":"2016-08-26T06:56:47.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude everyone is complaining that we haven't had it for 4 months, not that we don't have it every other week.
