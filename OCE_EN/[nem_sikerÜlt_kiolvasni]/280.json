It good to see you are hard at work on this issue. It's going to take a long time to figure out. I have two suggestions for you;\r\n\r\n1. In the same way after a match how you are shown that you received a 'Teamwork' or an 'Honourable Opponent,' it would be helpful to show if you received a report such as 'Verbal Abuse' or 'Refusing to Communicate.' This allows people to receive feedback and take action (reform) a lot earlier. \r\n\r\nIt provides them awareness into behaviours they may not be entirely aware of and can show them where the socially perceived limit is i.e. how much toxic is 'too' toxic. This would allow players to make changes to their behaviour before having a punishment be involved, before they are chat restricted or have their account suspended etc.\r\n\r\n2. How much are you looking into the surrender system? By not being able to surrender before 20 minutes and requiring 4/5 people to agree, it's creates a sort of mini 'Prisoner's Island,' where the toxicity, verbal abuse, afks etc. all just continue to escalate until the game is finally over. This negativity is then carried over by these players onto their next game. If a game starts out badly for whatever reason and everything just goes to shit, it'd be much better for the community if those players can just be allowed 'out' to then have a fresh start for the next game.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping you take these suggestions to heart.

By slowly and intentionally introducing a very small minority of negatively behaved players and keeping them chat restricted during their path back to ranked play, we don’t disrupt the queue and players can compete in a more relaxed atmosphere as they work to reform.
