An utterly blatant money grab, making it impossible to unlock content which is locked behind an atrocious pay wall.

Good going, pummelling your scuffed game even further into the ground.\r\n\r\nOh and by the way, I just came out of placements on this account with fresh MMR, 7W - 1L to be placed in bronze III, pretty disheartening.

Skins are already money grabbing bullshit. But they are also fun and give something to do while also giving money to a game we love playing. I'm willing to pay 10 bucks for a skin of my main and I'm willing to grind for what is essentially a gold chroma. You already have those expensive bullshit skins in the hextech gem crafting ones but even then those are geniunely good skins and it is possible to get them by occasionally buying stuff? With a little luck and you can stockpile them over a couple of seasons. Instead you've introduced bullshit. 140 dollars for what is essentially a chroma.

Anywho lesson learned the thing I liked about the skin wasn't really the skin itself but the fact that u had to complete the missions everyday to get it. Like it was a reward for logging in every day and doing the missions which set it apart from the other skins since there was a grind you had to go through to get it. \r\nI'm all for prestige edition skins but I honestly feel like the yearly prestige edition skins are enough for the game. The problem with prestige skins for every event is that it kind of saturates the market and the skins have less value. Add the fact that you can 'unbox' the skins makes it feel as if the players who went and jumped over and through the hurdles to get the skins are hard done by. \r\nI'm not sure if this is a \"cashgrab\" like a lot of people seem to think it is and to be honest I don't really care but for me the first prestige skin was a way for me to play with a goal in mind. Sure it was a bit of an addiction for a few days, having to log in and put in a couple hours but at the end of it I got my skin and I was happy that I was rewarded for the dedication. \r\nIn an ideal scenario prestige skins would be hard to get, exclusive (not unboxable or purchasable) and a reward for the people who put a lot of time to grind the game. I mean if you don't reward those people then wtf are you doing??","replies":[]},{"poster":"meaningOfLife42","date":"2019-01-15T07:26:58.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot games: Parent\tTencent (2011–present){{item:3400}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gosuicide","date":"2019-01-10T18:11:37.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fun..\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyclonedabeast","date":"2019-01-11T07:07:37.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"could there be a prestige blood moon Syndra pls! also can they be cheaper the prestige skins I don't have the money to them but I really want to","replies":[]}]}
