Black Cleaver is essential due to how well it synergizes with her kit, the Health, CDR and AD all benefit her, not mentioning the passive Armour shred which can be applied incredibly quickly to multiple targets with her tentacles.\nTrinity Force also gives the Health, CDR (now we have max to slam the enemy silly as often as possible, without loosing runes slots to further increase her AD and Health) and AD along with attack speed, Mana (so she never goes OOM), movement speed and the spellblade passive makes her a commanding presence in both lane and team fights.\nSterak's Gage from a lane bully into a team fight monster with devastating amounts of AD and Health, destroying the enemy team and shrugging off enormous amounts of damage.\nDead Man's plate makes her even more of a tank with its Health and Armour along with the movement speed and damage from the passive for initiating on the enemy team or catching and destroying fleeing heretics.\nSpirit Visage makes her impossible to kill with its Health and MR along with the passive's synergy with Illaoi's passive for the health regen.\nBoots help Illaoi catch those mobile opponents who could otherwise easily kite her go Boots of Swiftness for the particularly mobile opponents or Mercury's Treads to minimize the effectiveness of the champions who like to lock her down before she can unleash the power of the kraken.\np.s. Hitting people as Illaoi is great fun, do it often and make sure you spread the love.\ne: p.p.s The cons with this build is that there are some wasted stats in the 10% CDR on Spirit Visage and the Rage passive on Trinity Force. But this is more than made up for by the other stats on those items.","replies":[{"poster":"EShadeSlayer","date":"2016-06-19T11:58:11.050+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like your style, i hope he picks you XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-06-20T03:45:30.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are there not circumstantially better items than stacking the passives however?

Nice way of putting it. Trinity Force is the major outlier here, so it is probably the item to change, you could go for the more common alternatives of Titanic Hydra or Guardian Angel but, in thinking about it further, going Youmuu's Ghostblade or Death's Dance are also good alternatives. Youmuu's for the burst and further movement speed or Death's Dance for the sustained survivability in teamfights. One thing to note though is that Death's Dance's passive conflicts with Sterak's Gage's passive b delaying the activation of it. Really if you don't mind missing out on the Health, movement speed, Mana and Phage passive Trinity Force provides its situational how you build the last item, but having as much CDR as possible is advised due to Illaoi's reliance on activating her tenticals.\r\np.s.

These items are necessary for some damage output and survivability however there are several items that are situational. Warmog and Thornmail if you are possibly tanking. Titanic Hydra &  Deaths dance for beefy sustain dps. Maw of Malmortius and Banshees if facing many Ap characters Or Aegis & Face of the mountain if you are supporting. Illaoi is too much fun because she can do it all and do it well so I believe there is no best build just the best situational build because illaoi is so versatile.

Spirit visage boosts illaoi's healing from both the ohmwrecker and her tentacles, as well as a good amount of health. The Ohmwrecker wouldn't be expected by anyone, but it allows Illaoi to chase down her targets when they hide under turrets using the movement speed as well as dive them with ease because of the active on the item, not only this, she gains 10% cdr meaning she can use her w and q more often to get more health back. For even more movement speed, Mercury treads are a good option due to the passive making it harder for her to be kited as well as giving her magic resistance. The Black Cleaver is her main damage item, shredding her opponents armour working well in conjunction with her ultimate. Deadman's Plate further increases her movement speed, and give her some armour, but if she leads a fight with a max stacked deadman's on her 'harsh lesson', she will deal a ton of damage to any opponent. Finally is Sterak's Gage, it give her a bit of damage, but due to lifeline she is able to survive for longer during team fights allowing her to use her ultimate and use 'harsh lesson' enough times to heal of the damage she received.

The Dead mans plate allows Illaoi to slow an enemy which helps allow Illaoi to use test of spirit on the enemy. Black cleaver helps with big teamfights as the tentacles give a stack to enemies (I think). The spirit visage allows Illaoi to have great sustain and essentially making her unkillagke during teamfights as the healing from all the tentacles plus the bonus from Spirit Visage is too much to contain for the enemy. Even if the enemy team can lock down Illaoi, Deaths dance allows her to live longer and gives her a chance to use her 'slam' to regain health (again with the spirit visage) to help turn the teamfight around. Steraks gage adds to the tankiness of Illaoi and lets her live longer (like deaths dance) in a teamfight. I'm actually thinking of starting to play Illaoi just because of this build.","replies":[{"poster":"EShadeSlayer","date":"2016-06-19T11:52:13.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah BC does apply from tentacles, it applies from Physcial Damage, its the reason i always get it 2nd or 3rd item on MF, amps her Ulti so much","replies":[]}]}]}
