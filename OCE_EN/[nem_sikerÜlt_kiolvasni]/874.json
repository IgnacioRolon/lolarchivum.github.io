Codes are region locked at this stage so they can work on each individual server. The way these codes work is that the % of OCE codes in the wild (per server number) is the same as that of NA, so the same % of players will receive codes.","replies":[{"poster":"AimAssist","date":"2018-10-29T14:41:12.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah ok cause one of them was saying that theyve got codes that work for OCE/NA only, so I thought they were the ones that worked in both. Thanks for clearing up the confusion!\n\nBut does that mean that their quota for OCE codes is less cause they also get NA codes to split over the total amount of codes they receive?\neg: OCE streamer gets 30 OCE codes and 20 NA codes as opposed to NA streamer with 50 NA codes straight, assuming they have the same channel size/codes given according to that","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-10-31T02:12:38.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the OCE program we've made sure there are a few more OCE-centric codes (so this doesn't include the NA codes) in our partners' hands than the usual allotment in order to ensure Oceanic players aren't at a disadvantage when it comes to the chances of them receiving a code (as we have a smaller list of content creators giving out codes here). So while the pool of content creators you can go to for codes are smaller, the percentage vs server size of codes that are available to you are the same.","replies":[{"poster":"AimAssist","date":"2018-11-03T20:30:37.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow nice, I think letting bigger channels/streamers having codes for other regions overall would be pretty cool, maybe you guys are already doing that but that would be nice cause often they say their codes are NA/EU only so it feels really bad not being able to enter/not getting anything even if you did or even win","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-11-05T06:07:30.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good suggestion! We're looking at ways to open this up in the future as we know that just because you're an OCE player you don't necessarily watch OCE content, but at the moment it's limited to two regions per streamer as giving streamers enough codes in every region isn't possible. Watch this space though, we've got stuff in the works here ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fear lnoculum","date":"2018-10-26T21:01:22.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yooo my bois Jaysea Ninetales and DaSticks made it on there ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stince","date":"2018-10-26T03:04:27.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell yeah this is lovely!","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoNameAvaliable","date":"2018-12-28T05:22:50.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-zephyr}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pretty","date":"2018-11-05T19:29:29.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see many giveaways by the list of content creators here.
