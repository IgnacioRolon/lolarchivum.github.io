King has solo'ed triple kills that he should of never come out on top of, Mechanically King is a much stronger adc and one of the best i have seen most of the kills Raydere obtains are from his team have u ever seen Derek solo a fed Hec with a Kalista and come out on top or have 3 ppl move on him and come out on top. Other adc's in the opl have even given Raydere a run for his money. Watch some of Kings highlight plays compered to Derek's and u will see what im talking about If u swapped King to Cheifs and Raydere to Direwolves u would defently see how Raydere trully stacks not saying his is a bad player he is a great basic adc he plays his part very well in the team. But the skill lvl between King and Raydere is completely different the games King has falling short in is due to him going out of his comfort zone and Raydere only ever picks champs he is confidante with in a champion match.

Only two players from each team can make it onto the roster, so given the choice of only two Chiefs, they're picking Swip3rR and EGym due to how far ahead they are of their competition compared to Raydere.\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.lolesports.com/articles/opl-pros-theorycraft-all-stars\r\n\r\nOf course, that shouldn't stop you from voting for Raydere!
