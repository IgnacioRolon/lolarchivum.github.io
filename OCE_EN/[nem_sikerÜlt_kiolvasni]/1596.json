The new kit makes her more of a high risk/reward pick which is great, but the problem is that those champions are particularly difficult to balance because they typically either have the power to snowball like crazy or they simply lack the strength to do so, how do you plan on finding a medium point?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-05-30T09:12:49.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems like it will be infuriating to play against. Another character than can leap a mile onto your back line, do significant damage, has excellent disengagement, and isn't some squishy assassin? I say this as a Rek'sai player, those tunnel entry cooldowns seem like they will be a bit too much. Not being able to leap quickly back into a tunnel you engaged with has been the main punisher to making bad engagements or taking too much aggro, and now with the new ult you may not even be burning your tunnel cast until you want to leave. It's a recipe for very high survivability on a character that sounds like it'll be popping enemy carries all day long.","replies":[]},{"poster":"matman555","date":"2017-05-29T21:32:54.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Aurophilic Aura","date":"2017-05-30T06:06:32.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just... wow\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HolagramXS","date":"2017-05-30T01:46:55.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is this out right now?\r\n","replies":[]}]}
