Aurelion Sol does indeed have the power to wipe all of Runeterra out in a single blast of cataclysmic starfire, but he dares not both because of the crown upon his brow bending his will, and the fact that for each defiance he levels against Targon, another star winks out. So while yes, the power levels seem incongruous, the point is that Aurelion Sol is fighting with a tiny, minuscule fraction of his true power so he collateral damage he might cause won't destroy his grand work of millennia, while at the same time allowing himself an opportunity to work free of his bonds.","replies":[{"poster":"Juicy Tentacles","date":"2016-03-18T13:04:59.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying too hard to be deep and mystical.\r\n\r\nIf you'd been playing since before they stopped caring very much about lore you'd know that the Summoners (us) use binding magic to set the power of all entities on the Rift to the same level.
