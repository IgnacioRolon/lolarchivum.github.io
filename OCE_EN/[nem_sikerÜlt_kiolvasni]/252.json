Teemo has always needed a slight buff - everyone knew that. But scattering his schrooms around the map - and getting the odd kill when Teemo is not even in the fight (I.E. a fleeing enemy on low who runs over one)has been a part of his somewhat limited team utility.  Halving the time that schrooms remain on the map reduces this likelihood somewhat, and is not compensated with the very small buff to the schroom, which is realistically already countered by the INCREASE in arming time, which means it's harder to get involved in team fights.  My main objection is the halving of the duration of schooms.  I think overall it hurts a weak champion more than the slight buffs he received.  The other changes I can accept, but reducing the duration is very, very harsh on Teemo, particularly now that people can use Sweeper Lenses (or pink wards) to clear his schrooms.  I humbly ask that this duration time be reconsidered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veckor","date":"2015-08-06T04:09:14.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I personally think that the new HUD is okay, you just need to get use to it like anything else.

It's an item for tanks or for mid game because it requires you to already have damage to use it. The attack speed is underwhelming if you don't have ad or aren't an on hit tank and the cdr isn't that great if you don't have damage items yet or aren't someone who doesn't need damage to be useful. I think that wit's end should build out of stinger instead of the recurve bow because wit's end is also in the same spot as stinger in that it's an item best suited for tanks but with not enough incentive behind it for tanks. It has natural damage that is strongest in the early and mid game but it's build path isn't good enough or give enough utility/defence for tanks to get and doesn't scale well enough for carries to get. Also sated devourer champs don't want to get it because by the time they have sated devourer the item is redundant. I think the item would be much more useful and fit it's niche better while also giving my favourite item more options if it gave 10% cdr and built out of stinger instead of recurve bow. Also negatron cloak doesn't have many options right now either so stinger plus negatron would be a cool build path. Just my 2 cents though :P\r\ntl;dr Change wit's end recipe to be stinger + negatron cloak instead of recurve bow + null magic mantle + dagger.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-08-05T12:52:20.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It got buffed recently","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YouCantPhazeMe","date":"2015-08-05T00:04:06.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you for continuing to update the HUD.
