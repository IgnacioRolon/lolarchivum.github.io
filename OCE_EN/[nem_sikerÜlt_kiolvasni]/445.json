Yorick has a very unique kit in that he is the only champion who summons a creature with every single one of his abilities. On the other hand, for Ryze they really only changed 2 of his abilities and they arent particular complex. They couldve quite easily just not done this rework and still wouldve had to postpone yorick. But they decided to release this change and i think it is kinda cool","replies":[{"poster":"hyojeong","date":"2016-06-30T07:41:04.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUWHYYY RITO!
