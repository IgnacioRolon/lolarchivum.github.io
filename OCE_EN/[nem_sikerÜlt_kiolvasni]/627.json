If this ranked thing comes out for a while, i doubt people would start to waste anymore time in ranked, as alot of people play the current solo queue and already use up alot of time ranking up on that to even get a better elo, so i think people wwouldnt really want to waste more time onto playing the flex queue and waste more time, this system here that you guys are adding in will just ruin playing ranked, why not just add in the same ranked system from Season 5 rather than add something that'll make people waste more time on it to receive the full reward, whereas in season 5/6 people only had to play one ranked queue and received the full reward from that? i think this new ranked queue thing will ruin league's ranking system and stop people from playing ranked for a while as it'll waste people's more time to even receive the proper rewards. i know Riot considers peoples opinions but they need to consider the peoples play style and not add something into that game that will ruin the fun of trying to reach a higher elo to get the proper rewards, rather than introducing a new system that'll make people have to  waste more time and more work to even get anything rewarding.

League of Legends players are so precious, and by the end of it i'm sure most people had gotten used to it (that were complaining about dynamic queue before). All it does is divide the playerbase into two types of people - people that play with their friends and people that want to \"solo\" carry. I dont understand the need for a solo queue at all, seeing as this is a team game and pretty much every team orientated game apart from league has a queue where you can queue up any amount of people. Encouraging solo queues encourage a solo mentality and hence where I think the toxicity that league is so known for is known to bloom. It doesn't make sense to encourage a solo queue in a team game where the efforts of all 5 are what pulls the W out, not just one hard carry where everyone that queues up thinks they will hard carry.
