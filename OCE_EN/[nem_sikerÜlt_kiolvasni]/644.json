You're trying to combat short-term, in-game behaviour issues (stemming from pre-existing attitude problems) with long-term, marginal at best rewards.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the promise of a single random skin after several months of good play isn't going to stop idiots causing issues constantly during individual games.\r\n\r\nIf your stated goal is to improve toxic player's behaviour in game, the rewards and punishment need to be in-game.\r\n\r\nIf flaming/swearing/noob-calling etc. is not desirable, anyone who says that in game gets a ban for a day.  Simple.  It will stop those people and the consequence of their behaviour is IMMEDIATELY shown.  Or failing that, make players simply rate their teammates and opponents post game for a moderate IP benefit.  Toxic players will, over time, be found out and reported IRRESPECTIVE of any new account creation.  While these same toxic players will no doubt abuse the review system, inherently nice players will still show over time as nice and the effects of one toxic waster kid won't tarnish an otherwise good reputation.  There will be some early stage teething issues until the toxic players are found and removed, but longer term it's fixed.\r\n\r\nLikewise for AFKers, do what blizzard is doing and matchmake leavers with leavers.  Or if you don't want to do that, anyone who AFKs gets a day ban.  \r\n\r\nGranted this might cause people - toxic players - to quit and you lose some marginal revenue but those who remain will enjoy it more and spend more money.  I play less LoL now than ever because OCE is the most toxic region I've ever had the misfortune to play on.\r\n\r\nPeople simply have absolutely no fear or consequences to acting like dicks.  You didn't bother introducing a tribunal and as a result the region is the most horrible online experience I've ever had.  Sort your shit out or the thousands of us playing at low ELO will just leave and take our cash elsewhere.  The solution is NOT hard to implement, it's just the willingness to fix the issue is lacking because you're more worried about high ELO poster boys instead of the faceless masses.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-04T02:19:30.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jezzibella,\n\nYou bring up a few interesting points about banning people immediately and also rating teammates and opponents after each game.\n\nLets break that down into two discussion topics.\n\n**1. Banning people that flame immediately**\nWhile I do agree that immediate punishments are definitely more impactful, banning someone immediately following negative behaviour has two problems that I would like to talk about.\n\n* how will you decide what constitutes as negative behaviour and what doesn't?\n* Banning people doesn't stop them from just logging onto another account and causing more negative experiences for players. (This is why we are trying to implement punishments that don't go away unless you play through them while being positive. e.g. chat restrictions)\n\n**2.Rating team mates and opponents**\nWe actually have systems in place that help us highlight both toxic players and positive players in our game!\nThe report and honor system do just this after each game you can say if a player was positive or negative.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this.","replies":[{"poster":"spanishpear","date":"2015-03-06T23:39:52.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need a tribunal in oce.

It only punishes players who consistently dc/afk/leave matches. So if you have random crashes once in awhile or a power cut or huge storm or something you won't get hit by it. But if you consistently leave then you will get punished by Leaver buster. \n\n> Whether a player DCs or intentionally leaves, it's still a ruined experience for 4 to 9 other players in the game. Although it isn't the player's \"fault\" when they unintentionally DC, it's even more unfair to penalize up to 9 players per game while a player figures out their connection issues.\n> \n> If you DC from the game because of League of Legends server stability, Leaverbuster won't affect you and won't count those games. If you DC from a game because of your ISP or hardware, please fix your connection first before playing more games.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Awesomeman001","date":"2015-02-02T07:40:23.126+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if the toxic player had a premade team?
