You want to penalise those who have come to the game later so that you can have MORE. You are not content with enjoying them, you want them to be 'more special'. Are you one of those people that don't like immigrants moving into their area because, 'this is a nice neighbourhood'? This is selfishness, capitalism and this is childish.

It is in fact also an opinion. You might say my statement is an unsubstantiated opinion. But that would not change anything because every post before mine are only 'opinions' (which you are so fond of), not 'substantiated opinions'. \r\n\r\nYou say my assumptions are 'stupid'. That adjective makes no real change to the meaning of your labeling of my 'comments'. I think you mean that I put forth unjustified assumptions; assumptions without good reasons to believe their truth. No I didn't, as you noted, I merely posted comments. I did not post a well-considered argument with all my reasoning. It is a pitfall of internet forums. It would really debunk my assumptions, if you provided evidence to the contrary. Maybe you know the OP. \r\n\r\nAs for the assumptions themselves I stand by them. First, I asked a rhetorical question about immigrants to highlight the tendency to exclude or marginalise certain groups to maintain some advantage for a more 'powerful' group. I never stated that OP is xenophobic. But I do say, there is a lot in common here. \r\n\r\nSecond, her obsession with values is inherently capitalist. In this situation, the groups are defined by 'those who have legacy skin A,B,C' and 'those who do not have legacy skin A,B,C'. 'Those who do not have' play in the same virtual games with 'those who have'. Skins are a cosmetic that are a sign of status to others as well as a source of pleasure (beautiful, centre of admiration, play better, appreciation of account value etc...) The rarer and more unobtainable the skin the greater the pleasure of possessing one. \r\n\r\nSo skins are great things to have. For the OP, she is no longer purely concerned with how useful the item is to her. She will always be able to use that skin in a game (unless banned or taken). Even if Riot gave everyone the same legacy skin that she has for free, her ability to use the skin will only be marginally impacted. More such skins in circulation, might mean more people ahead of her in pick, using that skin and denying her use of the skin. \r\n\r\nBut that is not her concern. Her concern is not with the use of the skin. It is with how Riot re-releasing the skin will decrease the value, prestige and rarity of her skin; of her object. Now this is the foundations of capitalism, according to Marx. OP is mystified by the 'objective' market value of her skin and is totally is unappreciative of the value of her ability to use the skin in a match. In LoL, this idea of 'market value' might be more clear as the 'prestige' when using a certain skin. It is the OOOs and AAAHHHs other players type as they look at you. Or for some collectors of skins, perhaps the dollar value they can get on ebay for the skin or the entire account. \r\n\r\nOP wants to say that if Riot re-released legacy skins, that this would be very unfair to her. I bought this skin and its worth a certain amount. More such skins will depreciate the value of my skin. This is unjust. It is like taking something from me that I deserve. She ignores the unfairness of excluding newcomers from legacy skins. By her own standards, this exclusion is very unfair. While she is annoyed or even inconsolable because part of the value, not the thing, is taken away from her; there are scores of new players who never even had the opportunity to buy one of these legacy skins. It is like the Friar on horseback remarking to his horse-less servant that it is terribly hot and uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nMaybe OP thinks that they somehow are more deserving than the newcomer of that skin. They was there since beta. The newcomers just hopped on the bandwagon. OP has played non-stop since season 1. The newcomer just came in season 5. I have a relationship with this game goddamit. A relationship going much further back than some newcomer. I deserve to have some rare, valuable and no longer obtainable in game souvenirs...to remind me of the good times I've had. \r\n\r\n-It is not logical you deserve something more than other players because you have been around for longer. Whatever you deserve, has been bestowed upon you from your experiences in the game.\r\n\r\n- If we are talking about fairness, it seems a little unfair, when what we deserve is based on when we were born or when we stumble across something in our life that other people have known about. \r\n\r\n- To preserve OP's skin's value, we exclude others. The argument to preserve OP's skin's value is fictitious. It has a weak claim based on fairness and it is costly in that it seeks to deprive others of pleasure. \r\n\r\n- In my view at least, this line of thinking, of 'me first' and 'screw everyone else' is a symptom of a child.
