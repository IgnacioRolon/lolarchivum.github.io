I'd even say I like it, but it's definitely not on the level of something like Star Guardian or Dark Star. Part of that is that is Victorious skins are essentially 975 tier in a time when most of the new skins we get are 1350+ tier. Part of that is that the Victorious aesthetic doesn't appeal to me as much as the others.\n\nMy only real gripe with it is the wings. I know they had mad trouble with the wispy ones but I liked them way better than the knock-off Galio ones they went with.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a free skin so I can't be too mad about it. Aatrox *did* have a big impact, it's a 975 tier skin, they have a much more limited timeframe to make Victorious skins than they do most others, and they essentially have to force the theme onto one of a small set of champions.\n\nBut that's my entirely personal opinion.\n\nAs for Thresh and Braum, Thresh may have been tentatively disqualified because he has a Championship skin, I don't know what the process there is (or if there even is an established one), and Braum most likely had his new skin in the works at the time so they may have moved away from him for that reason when there were other viable options.\n\nI also don't really follow pro-play except for semi-finals and finals so, I'm not really the best one to make comment on which champions were viable options :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Riimuru","date":"2019-10-25T11:06:35.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eww another skin that looks horrible\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"AshenMoon","date":"2019-10-25T08:50:19.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems riot doesn't care about the skins they give for ranked rewards anymore :/ I can buy a sub 975 skin thats better than the past few years victorious skins. :/ riot should consider fixing how they maintain the player base.
