If the stun follows the knockup then it should be \"stunned afterwards / when they land\"\n**In addition to** the knockup does not indicate if they are **concurrent** or not.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-10T05:21:49.938+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think most people gave up caring after they made QSS not get rid of Zed's ult.\r\n\r\nPeople are starting to realise that you cant argue with stupid.\r\n\r\nand Riot is proving to be... well...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2016-08-10T01:40:04.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish they'd stop screwing around with Sona.\r\nOf course the additional cooldown was going to break her, but you don't need to nerf all her other abilities into the ground to compensate.\r\nJust admit the free cooldown was a stupid idea, and roll it, and the changes since it was added, back, then find a better way to balance things.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ovary","date":"2016-08-10T03:01:40.285+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It really isn't a matter of JUST champion strength.
