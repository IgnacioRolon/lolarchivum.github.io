Now if MMR takes into account KDA when you have a 5+5+5+5+30=50 vs a team 20+20+20+20+20 = 60 game there gonna be some serious feeds happening if that game lasts more than 20 or people wont surrender your P(KDA -ve) is almost 100% if you apply yourself. \r\n\r\nSo as this often occurs apparently playing with people of different skill level is a part of peoples learning, however if your in the division of gold and playing against platinum due to having high mmr and this is why you cant progress learning isn't the point if this person is good enough to be matched against platinums under the current system then their rank should reflect this and not be forced to carry 4 golds against 5 Plats.\r\nEssentially with this system one must not just win their own lane but everyones lane. The equivalent is to play bots by yourself with 4 on your team set to basic and the opposing team set to intermediate, and you have your self the equivalent of a high win streak promo game. \r\nmathematically it could be argued that you're returning to your skill level but this would only be the case if it was 1v1 competition like chess and you weren't your own catalyst of imbalance.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-05-16T04:24:34.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically the matchmaking system doesn't work and unless you find 4 other players that are good communicators and respond to pings and don't cry and afk out and have some skill you will never progress in the ranked system as it exists today.  the initial placement series is a good example and imo is broken but its not my game to change. I don't think it is fair that if last season you placed in gold and this placement all you had to do get gold the first day was win a high % of your 10 games.  basically all this achieves is keeping the same bunch of non conformer non team players in the lower ranks and never allows a player that is half decent to get a good match making experience. sou you now go ahead and bag me out because you don't agree be my guest.","replies":[{"poster":"YossarianLives","date":"2015-05-16T05:48:29.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But isn't that how it's supposed to work?

But because my mmr only increased by a tiny amount in that time my first three b4 games where full of b5 players and all it took was one troll teemo who decided to duo mid and feed in the third game to knock me out of the league because i had to dodge one game because i recognised a troll pulling me to 0 lp (because at that mmr you literally get like 10 lp for winning) \r\n\r\nAnd i know plenty of other players just like me, ive got mates stuck down here in b5 that were in silver or gold last season.\r\n\r\nIts not that your getting matched with shit players and you just have to make up the skill gap. The lower the mmr of the player the more likely they are a feeder or troll, and trust me there is an elo hell, its down here at the stupidly low 300 mmr mark, down here you are guaranteed a troll every second game, hell i know some of the trolls personally and have conversations with em because ive played with and against them that many times, take this one troll anastasia whos calling card is feeding as a janna then asking the enemy team to honor him helpful for promoting them hes been in 20% of my games, or take this guy called anarch, whos calling card is he pretends like hes schizo and does random shit and calls everyone a schizo dog autso and threatens to murder them, which as youd expect can push a team into full tilt.\r\n\r\nBut its not just here, there are trolls in every mmr i get that, but the really bad ones are always low mmr, because of simple facts, if you troll the game isnt going to think your some godlike player, its going to think your shit and make your mmr accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf the mmr systems idea of balancing is to lower the mmr of your team, well guess what, that actually lowers your win rate rather than equalizing it.\r\n\r\nThis isnt a single player game where theres 9 players stopping you from reaching promotion. The mmr system shouldnt treat it like it.","replies":[{"poster":"WS7dbiY8FR","date":"2015-05-17T16:32:12.331+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To summarize what im saying is, rather than match you with players lower than your mmr to fight players at the mmr of your team combined.\r\n\r\nIT should just match you with 9 players of equal mmr.\r\n\r\nSure itd make elo hell a lot worse, but itd also make it easier to climb out of.\r\n\r\nAnd itd make leagues a more true representation of what your skill level is, because you wont get that gold 3 with the mmr of a plat 3 come in and carry you so hard that you make it to promos, your gonna have to do that work yourself because your teams only as good as you are, hell you could be matched with a b5 with gold mmr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Impaired","date":"2015-05-19T03:49:47.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But.... this guy's argument is that people DO match with those of their MMR - gold 3's on a winstreak playing with plat 4's on a losing streak, in theory they should be the same but a plat 4 has been plat 4 longer than a gold 3 has been gold 3\r\n\r\nif that makes sense","replies":[]},{"poster":"WS7dbiY8FR","date":"2015-05-17T16:32:45.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and as i speak my ranked queue just popped and anarch is in my game.\r\n\r\nHeres hoping hes in a good mood instead of a trolly one.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gangplanked","date":"2015-05-16T02:17:00.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ahaha litttle bit much dont u think\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-05-18T08:48:53.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about none ranked summoners(30 who dont play ranked and summoners under lvl 30)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icy lock","date":"2015-05-17T01:13:16.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i kinda though it was only a rating system (basically the old elo system) which granted you a specific amount of points based of your kda and whether you won or lost. This system matched you with people of your elo by using this rating. it also effects the amount of points you get as if you have a high mmr, it seems to effect how quickly you gain points or how little you use, for example: if someone with a plat 5 mmr is demoted to gold 1, then the'll earn the maximum amount of points. but if someone has say a plat 3 mmr in diamond 5, they will earn 8-10 points.
