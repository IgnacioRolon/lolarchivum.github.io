I have been tutoring a few brand new players into playing and the tutorial is not expansive enough and not using complex enough mannerisms to effectively show people how a normal game of 5v5 is structured.\r\n\r\nI believe it should be an informational cinematic with the added ability to spawn the summoner in as an ideal practice champion at each stage of the explanation in each stage of the roll being explained, by choice of course; being forced to do tutorial elements is always the worst imo. Maybe this would be too forceful and daunting for the younger players and should be separate from the regular tutorial as a more advanced option.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously no easy task and no-doubt has been brought up in-house multiple times, but, I'd like to know if the riot dep. is looking at this as, as big of an issue as I see it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Wardeninetwo","date":"2016-10-15T06:00:46.218+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this - there is practically no manual for this game anyway and it's an unreasonable expectation to demand players seek tutorial material elsewhere rather than an integrated experience.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-03T02:54:07.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only reason i learnt how to play like im not a skrub, is because i has a sibling to tell me to go mf bot(not mid) and not to get more than 1 hurricane (this was sometime during season 5 btw). make a better turorial, and finally, in the tutorial, they tell you to get a thornmail as ashe, instead of a dmg item","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hebbie","date":"2016-10-18T04:59:17.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with all of this. But also, if you add a finely-tuned tutorial, new play players will be impressed by the amount of effort put into the tutorial, that they will be inclined the depth of the game as they progress. That s probably nonsensical, but in a metaphor; the tutorial is the stepping stone to League. More people will try to hop across the stone if it looks stable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakescape","date":"2016-10-16T09:00:58.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A tutorial is not going to help someone play any better than if they were to play the game for a few games. You learn as you go, and there are a lot of things that a tutorial can't teach such as common sense, game knowledge, when to go in, when not to, champion limitations ect. The reason why players struggle is because the game has a lot of depth and knowledge required to play it properly, not the tutorial.\r\n\r\nIt's not an issue at all in fact. You can teach someone the basics of the game but the basics are only like 5% of what the game is and the rest is theory and practice especially when it comes to champions. It's not 'unreasonable' at all to expect people to get help from elsewhere. There are MANY MANY places people can go to learn about the game and even certain champions, Youtube being one place. Spending time and effort on a tutorial that will pale in comparison to actual practice or a detailed Youtube video which is what the tutorial would be, would in the end be a waste of resources.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PaleBlood Ronin","date":"2016-10-14T07:56:53.700+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"with 4k just a way to increase the size of the health bars and minimap icons would be a god send.

Combine this with the fact that I don't even play that much to begin with, and I really couldn't care less about my champion levels. Just play whatever you feel like playing, and don't worry about champion mastery levels as long as you feel like you can do well with them.
