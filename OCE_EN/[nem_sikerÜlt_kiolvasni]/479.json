If recall was implemented as \"just another skill\" (i.e., with a cast time, and an effect that plays once it's done), and Riot introduced some mechanism or effect that suddenly forced all previous or current animations/casts to complete, it might cause a problem such as this.\r\n\r\nEven worse, there would be nothing obvious to the developer writing code that they're about to affect the recall action, unless they knew exactly how the recall action was implemented (and on a code-base as large as Riot likely has, that's a very small chance indeed).\r\n\r\nTo be brutally honest, the reason all you can see is an apparently obvious bug is because you've never done any large-scale software engineering {{champion:112}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Zooky2000","date":"2016-03-16T12:17:41.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, but at the same time I don't have millions upon millions of dollars in budget and literally thousands of people willing to code and test the game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gintoki Sama","date":"2015-12-31T08:52:07.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bring championship riven back omg!
