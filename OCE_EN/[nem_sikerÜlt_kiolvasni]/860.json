Thank you for the update and reimbursement! Personally I'm content with this response except for one thing... Can the loss be removed from our records because we didn't 'play'?

Teams aren't carried forward between tournaments, meaning you create (or remake) a team each time. Because of this, win/loss is self-contained to each tournament, so with every new Clash tournament your new team's record will begin with a clean state at 0-0.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Record of your team's performance won't be stored, but it doesn't mean you can't keep tabs yourself for bragging rights ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Shadow Entrancer","date":"2018-05-29T01:43:43.856+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for the clarification, didn't realise that! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sarth13245","date":"2018-05-29T02:32:21.110+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its great how the riot members really care and are making a compensation for all of us + Bring back URF :) it's such a fun gamemode.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-05-30T01:04:40.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who'd you get the most enjoyment out of?

Taking into thought Lock in and scouting phase. We're not even in champion select by 9:30. That means for most people either studying or working, we will get maybe one game in before it's even like 10:30 or closer to 11pm!\r\nI get that you can't start class at 5pm in Australia but surely even 6pm AUS time would be more acceptable and would give people from NZ time to at least get more than maybe one game in","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-03T03:15:43.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that AUS has a wide span of timezones. 6pm AEST (Sydney time) is *4pm* in WA, so while that might be better for NZ, it's much less so for a significant chunk of people over there.","replies":[{"poster":"Kostly","date":"2018-06-05T04:06:23.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I mean I do get what you mean. But it's still really feel's bad for us in NZ, because from what I remember reading about clash (And I could very well be wrong so don't hold me to it) is that you can join later..?\r\nSo it's like, wouldn't it be fairer to the entirety of the NZ playerbase to start a little earlier and still have AUS players join later. \r\nIDK just how I see it is that by making it so late for the New Zealand player base, it's super feels bad for most of the New Zealand League community","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-05T07:00:35.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't join later. If you aren't there for lock in phase you don't play that night. If you lose, or don't make it for one night, you can play the next day, but you won't be able to reach the 16 team bracket (the \"big leagues\" of your tier) or get the biggest rewards.\n\nIt sucks, and depending on schedules it might mean that some people may never really be able to play clash, but you can't accommodate everyone, it's just not possible, so the best option they have is to accommodate as many people as possible. Since it's a recurring event, there's every chance that some people who normally can't play will eventually see those opportunities.\n\nIt should speak a lot that just as you are asking if it could be pushed back, there are people asking if it could be pushed forward.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"HHHHHina","date":"2018-06-04T05:38:16.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey riot, my friend has already got the clash Orb but I have not got yet.
