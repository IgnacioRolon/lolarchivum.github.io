If you bought it thinking it did, we're happy to return your RP for you. Sorry for the confusion here.

However, I would have purchased the bundle regardless whether it came with Gatekeeper Galio or not. The other skins look just as great as the Legendary Skin, and that's saying something. Especially Enchanted Galio! (such a massive difference!) A big thanks to the art team for making Galio's lesser skins look just as great as his Legendary Skin!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2017-03-22T05:17:01.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, that Enchanted Galio is pretty ace. I can get on board with running around the Rift as a faux Blue Buff. What do you think of his rework so far?","replies":[{"poster":"Staruniva","date":"2017-03-22T05:48:55.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had a chance to play test him yet, but from I've seen, he looks and feels better. Flash-ulting and ridiculous healing were the only things the old Galio could really use to be noticed in team fights, and when you're without your ult you feel pretty useless. Losing the ridiculous healing is saddening, but I can still do flash ult plays (now flash-W or W-flash) AND offer more ways to contribute to team fights than just that. I can't wait to get onto the rift and make sick plays while saving teammates along the way!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Staruniva","date":"2017-03-22T00:00:28.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ah, so the banner itself was incorrect.
