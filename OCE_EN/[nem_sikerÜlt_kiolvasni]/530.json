Losing rank due to reports and gaining extra rank due to honours isn't a balanced and unbiased way to play.\r\n\r\nThe ranking system is there to demonstrate _rank_, not how favourable of a player you are; if someone falsely reports you on the enemy team after they lose, you'd lose points for not doing anything wrong. Alternatively, the honouring system becomes a bartering tool of sorts - the phrase \"mid or no honour\" would become commonplace. Allies may also report you for an accidental kill steal or something of the like. Heck, I've had people report me for spamming after a well-deserved \"wp\" or \"gj\".\r\n\r\nThis system, while different, is incredibly poorly thought out. Under this system, ranks would be determined by how friendly and favourable you are, and ignores skill and game-winning plays in favour of personal bias; two players of equal skill could be in two different ranks due to one being a funnier person, or the other person is deemed not funny enough.\r\n\r\n**Putting your rank into the hands of an unaligned third party is not the way to run a skill ranking system**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Troll Of Destiny","date":"2016-01-15T03:27:26.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then all we are doing is proceeding to bury the problem. which is the people, not the game.\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EpicMealTime","date":"2016-01-19T14:18:14.052+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm waiting here, but seems like rank isn't resetting :(\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adstar2016","date":"2016-01-19T14:27:33.740+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"because on January 20 00:00 AEDT we’re opening up the 2016 ranked season!\" It's an hour and 26 minutes past this time and there is still no ranked queue, pretty disappointed in Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CraftWarrior","date":"2016-01-19T14:21:41.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its 12:22am and the update isn't out yet ?
