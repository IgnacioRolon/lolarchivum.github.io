I am wondering if there is any slim chance that I would be able to trade one skin for the other. I have unfortunately and stupidly used up all my refunds. The skins are both 1350 rp and I payed the full price. \r\nI will be very grateful if you even consider this request.\r\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Gnarchos","date":"2017-01-19T23:40:58.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol hell no, riot wants money bruh","replies":[{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2017-01-20T00:34:31.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically they won't be losing any money nor gaining.
