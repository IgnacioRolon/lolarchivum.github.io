I'm sure you don't get dishonoured, but I didn't want to risk it, so I surrendered\n\nTo me just these 2 things that I noticed don't belong in Practice Tool\n\nThis is possibly bug related, I couldn't attack turrets after reenabling them, and I somehow lagged throughout the session, and was d/c after I left, had trouble reconnecting.
