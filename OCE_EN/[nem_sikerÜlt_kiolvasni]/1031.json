There is a lot of potential for more inter-university competition at all levels.\r\n\r\nThe next step to explore more of this for us is to work directly with the clubs to come up with a way to ensure a great experience for every player. We'll provide more updates as that progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"DanieI Morcombe","date":"2016-06-04T15:04:09.941+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back when I was in silver, UQ hosted a tournament between UNSW and UQ, which decided which university would win the 'state of origin. The tournament consisted of a knockout tournament starting from the UQ bronze vs UNSW Bronze, then UQ Bronze vs UNSW silver, then UQ silver, vs UNSW silver ect.. This tournament was a huge success in the fact that there were no cheaters or smurfs. UQ and UNSW managed to achieve this by hosting the event day as a 'Social Event' where everyone participating in the games or spectating would PHYSICALLY come in to their respective universities. Of course specators were not limited to physical attendance to watch the games, however the better experience was made by joining the crowd of supporters at the university. This required more effort to manage but created a more enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone participating. Due to physically attending the event to play the game, the UQ LOL club was able to meet the players, assossiate them with the account they were using and make sure everything they were doing was by the rules. The words I would use to describe that event would be 'Magical', I had been given a glimpse of what it was like to play professional league of legends and I was emersed in a group of people all with similar love of league of legends. Even though the tournament was structured differently to how riotgames will structure their official tournaments, riotgames should copy the way UQ ran the authenticity and encouragement of following the rules so that a lower tier bracket can still exist in RiotGames official University Tournaments.\r\n\r\nThe year after that, I reached diamond and started to play with more serious teams in the UQ tournament scene, which I was ultimately inspired to participate in due to the previous tournament I had described. The University 'State of Origin' tournament that year was different, very different. There was no encouraged attendance to the Universrity campus to join the viewing parties or to compete in the tournament for both universities. This caused many issues and disputes between the teams. The University which we were competing against, (which I won't mention which uni it was but it was in NSW, the scum) had a player in their bronze team who was exceedingly more competent at playing his champion and manouvering his team around the map, than anyone else in his or our University teams up to the diamond teams. The NSW universities bronze team, whith their 'star' player managed to beat our UQ Bronze, Silver and gold teams only to be beaten by our platinum team. This player was 100% a smurf which is an assumption built up by the preceeding evidence and the fact that his entire match history of his account since it was created showed no stats of him playing 'shaco' or 'victor' at all or any other champion at such a high skill level before suddenly being able to perform at a platinum standard on the day. The reason this managed to pass through the 'checks' and 'gates' set in order to stop this kind of unfair situation to occur was because the universities no longer supported the in-campus attendance for participation or spectating of the events. If riot games is to organise another university championship, and is interested to include a lower tier bracket in order to cater for the other 90% of the player base's interests, they should enforce that the Universities League of Legends 'Social' clubs make it compulsory for attendance to their 'Tournament Social Event' . This not only will reduce the chance of people using alternative accounts to 0% but it also 'Socially' bonds the clubs members together which is the whole point of having a University LOL club anyway.
