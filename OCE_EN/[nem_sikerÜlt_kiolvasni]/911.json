I was trying for a while to organise something along the lines of a tournament, but it's practically impossible. The real issue is that the school is only ready to provide so much, but 10 computers and a few hours of time per week is just not enough for a proper tournament or even a regular gaming schedule.\r\nI suggested an online varitation, but that was rejected too, since the school wants to, you know, actually invite the students to play together in a form of a club, rather than simply game from home, and I would accdept this option, if it wasn't so damn limited. Like, why would you even try, if all that is possible to squeeze out of them is one or two games per week, without any forseeble improvement or expansion in the future. Even a proper tournament would take at least a term to fully run.\r\nAnd this is not even covering the issues with the skill level of the players and organising matchmaking. The idea is that it should be \"possible for anyone to join\", but that is either unfair or blatantly stupid, considering how major the skill difference is. Again, I suggested the split into two leagues, the \"beginner\" and \"advanced\", but no, of course that would mean that not everyone is allowed here and there, and there may be extra problems, so again it was just outright removed from the option list.\r\nWhat else left? Runes, masteries and champions. For all of the above, players either had to play with their own accounts and earn them properly, or if some moron who just began playing the game and decided to join in the upper echelon, they would be given a leveled account. My proposal was that again, by splitting the players into two leagues, the restrictions for more professional players would be unnecessary, and for the others, it would not make a huge difference, but of course, \"that limits the accessibility of our club\", blah, blah, blah.\r\nI can only applaud that some school actually agreed to such investment, but this is an example of why it doesn't happen more often.{{summoner:3}} \r\nIf there are questions, comment and I will most likely reply","replies":[{"poster":"ViktorWooten","date":"2017-06-22T08:17:55.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your dreams are huge!\r\nHonestly 10 computers a few hours a week would be a great start. Perhaps it's a case of just getting the ball rolling and seeing where it goes. with everything that goes on behind the scenes at a school getting more than a few hours will be really hard, but it's still a great opportunity! \r\nI would see those couple of hours as a chance to learn, share, discuss and strategize with the bulk of the actually playing being done at home. You could even use it as practice to prep for an online tourney if you have a competitive team.\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2017-06-22T12:38:01.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, that the tournament has been organised previously, but the initiative literally dissipated into nothing over the next two years.

Because right now there is a \"Games Tournament\" club, which includes practically everything related to games. If enough people are interested, then the initiative could be driven further. But again, this also depends on the fact that there would be enough people to make up the club and to lead. As much as I would enjoy managing the club and all stuff related, one person is just no enough for such scale.\r\nHowever, if you have any further advice, I would be glad to hear. You and Viktor have already helped me by mere encouragement :).\r\n\r\nP.S. I might have attemped something like this sooner, but after pretty much everything I suggested was declined, I kinda flipped out and decided to throw the idea out the window for the time being.\r\n\r\nP.P.S.
