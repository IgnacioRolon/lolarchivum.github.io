If you wanna play with your cats go play with your cats. If you wanna play LOL then play LOL. Nothing worse than trying to have a game and someone is afking or not even really paying attention. Gets loyal players frustrated and makes them feel like they are just wasting there time playing. I know a fair few ppl who don't play anymore because of tools like this! Please don't be encouraging this sort of behaviour as it ruins the gaming experience for gamers who actually want to game, Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-18T08:32:14.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright Mr Negative Nancy, it's a game, people are here to have fun, if you're not having fun don't play it, don't deny others the chance to have fun......What about things like Ultimate Bravery?
