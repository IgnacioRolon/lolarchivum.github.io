I always get very distinct feelings from seeing these three, and it's good because though they all have that technologically advanced feel, they're all unique.\r\nI always see Battlecast as heavy, iron, industrial, burning machines of destruction. Apocalyptic mayhem and crumbling cities with fire and explosions.\r\nMecha is sharp edges and cool metal with lots of colourful energy effects. Suits of power used to take personal grudges to a behemoth scale and likely create a few craters in the land.\r\nPROJECT immediately makes me think towering sleek metal skyscrapers, neon lights through the rain, shiny chrome and secretive ACCESS DENIED messages. Like a secret organisation is watching you over your shoulder.\r\n\r\nNow, lets pit them against each other!","replies":[{"poster":"SolustoL","date":"2015-09-11T17:29:20.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"great comparison summary between the three types of skins,i fully agree..\r\n\r\nwhat skin to throw my cashish at first ..uugh choices","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kaze Ronin","date":"2015-09-11T05:00:58.213+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"How come no project yasuo icon? :(","replies":[{"poster":"SolustoL","date":"2015-09-11T17:44:43.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what? seriously! do you need an icon for everything nowadays?\r\n\r\nicons should be something that coin cannot provide\r\n\r\nworkhard/playhard=reward\r\n\r\ncoining it is easy yup\r\nbut there needs to be some remnant of earning your deserved icon/reward\r\n\r\notherwise whats the point of player skill\r\nit makes it redundant\r\n\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-10T23:54:59.472+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":5,"body":"So basically a guy made a really bad ass skin, but you guys had to make it s**t so you didn't have to put in as much effort in the rest of the skins. They're a disappointment. So many things could've been done and you make them all boring. The only reason I've bought them is for their op effects.\r\n\r\nYou made Zeds ult almost f*ing invisible and muted. Lucians abilities are harder to dodge aswel as the rest of the champs.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: chromas. Literally you guys choose 3 colours (even if the colours are stupid like a blue dragonslayer that isn't much different from the original.) Have you guys had a proper look at the bard chromas? Vayne? Out of all badass colours you made Vayne into a slightly lighter blue, red (most dominant/badass looking) and a leaf. Bulbasaur if you will.
