With the bot 2 towers locked out, the arena has been transformed from a circle to more of a single curved lane, with the aim being to control at least 2 out of the 3 remaining towers in the lane.\r\n\r\nThe two towers outside the respective team's spawns is ridiculously easy to hold both by respawners or by moving the short distance between towers. This pretty much leaves the top tower as the deciding factor. The team that can rush and capture it at the start of the game just has to sit the team on that tower (with maybe 1 hanging 1/2 way between top and mid tower to defend mid). Now the other team has to siege the tower while their points counts down, which is very difficult if the other team has blindpicked a better team fighting comp and has a bit of waveclear.\r\n\r\nWith the old dominion, if the enemy team is better at teamfighting and is holding top, you could scatter and cap the bottom 2 towers, forcing them to split up to respond to you. Now, if they enemy has a better team fighting comp, it likely means that they will take top first, and hold it until they have an unbeatable lead, if not to the end of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViviBlueMage","date":"2016-05-27T02:04:24.566+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Far out it's about freaking time OCE got the dominion queue.\r\nOnly took you guys 4 years, 9 months, 24 days. \r\nWish it went longer than 3 days. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-05-27T02:35:34.119+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":6,"body":"About freaking time indeed.
