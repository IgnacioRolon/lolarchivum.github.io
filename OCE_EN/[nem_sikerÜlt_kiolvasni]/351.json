I highly doubt people is most elos will be able to get this sort of surrender in ranked.\r\n\r\nA unanimous surrender is hard to get, even when your nexus is on 1hp and your team has been aced there is always one person who'll say no as a joke, so I don't think it'll be a big deal and the only times we'll really see it is with 5man premades. This surrender at 15min thing is a nice touch that probably won't ever be used but it was still worth adding.","replies":[{"poster":"HasagiSoryeGeTon","date":"2017-02-23T04:45:03.093+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"i just used it in a game just like 5 minutes ago, its useful\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2017-02-24T02:29:07.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh I think it will occur quite regularly.

We have not been able to /remake because they are connected but cannot surrender because they were connected until after the three minute mark. Then we have to sit around for 17 minutes and wait for a surrender. Though more commonly we will open a lane and let the opposition push the nexus down. \r\n\r\nActually I would prefer <3min to do /remake, >3min but <15min /surrender but requiring a unanimous vote, and >15min the usual requirment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bubbah","date":"2017-02-23T03:26:33.404+0000","up_votes":13,"down_votes":11,"body":"I logged in just to tell you you're dumb as fuck","replies":[{"poster":"ƒáte","date":"2017-02-23T03:45:52.818+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":8,"body":"I logged in just to tell you to stop judging other people's opinions.Other people are not you, they have their in-game values and you have yours.
