Lets hope DN don't get the best of Chiefs tonight. Happy 4/20 btw blaze it up\n\nedit: nah chiefs played like complete poo lmao, not even close to the performance they showed in opl, they may be doing us proud at home but goddamn they're doing bad in IWCI. they're coming last and they're making horrible decisions, Whiffer just counterpicked himself into a Lissandra by picking Kassadin. He couldn't join fights and kept leaving fights for easy 4v5s for Detonation, I knew Detonation would win before but yeah DFM are NOT at the bottom of the standings, they are 5th opposed to Chief's last spot. Alistar's early pick was really great but Chiefs still had an early advantage that they didn't push because they wasted their teleports so early to try to save Swiper who was already going into a re-active role playing as Maokai, another pick that brought them down, if they picked Trundle and someone with either earlier presence (syndra could have melted her early game) or push power (twisted fate and azir were open) they could have easily pushed that early lead, also, sp00kz not joining top lane to win the first tower race and having the gold advantage of 4 people getting the extra gold (due to gold given to champions around turret when it dies), everyone fell back and it was just 1 person on the turret to Detonation's 2/3 because their jungler wanted to counterjungle blue side, which still gets him gold while sp00kz had already completed a counterjungle clear for enemy blue side and had no where to get gold from, so he runs back and picks up a scuttle and then dies in his jungle when he gets back like man if u'd just stay for turret and back, you'd get an extra amount of money, not be dead and still be able to lanetax when whiffer had to go back from liss' poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-22T22:38:54.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Hot Pope,realm=OCE,application-id=pEj6Ee6n,discussion-id=PujFV0No,comment-id=000900000000,timestamp=2016-04-20T04:30:42.605+0000)\n>\n> edit: nah chiefs played like complete poo lmao\n\nThat game was a disaster in all departments.
