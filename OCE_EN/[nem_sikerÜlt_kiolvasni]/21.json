I feel this is bit stupid and really can limit Ornns early game build paths.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he also can't choose which item manually and has to communicate with the team to change item slots that they can upgrade the one they want is maybe not an issue in an elo where people talk but down here people either ignore you or have all chat disabled.\r\n\r\nI might be the minority but I feel like a few QOL changes would be nice. Like if you could choose or hold off and not upgrade you items immediately or at least pay a portion of the cost to swap the upgrade. \r\nWith teammate upgrades if you could select them I feel that simply replacing Ornns \"mini shop\" to let you pick which item to upgrade would just be a bit more streamlined. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso if I'm just a massive idiot and missed something that does allow you to pick choose then any flame is accepted and appreciated <3  \r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathToSJWS","date":"2019-01-12T01:53:15.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard there were going to be conqueror nerfs? is this true and if so why? do you want an even larger tank meta? imagine conq nerf games. garen every game \r\nruns through whole team pentakills","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeathToSJWS","date":"2019-01-12T01:51:27.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nasus buffs were a mistake\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonan","date":"2019-01-11T05:23:21.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"24 Nasus Q stacks in aram??\r\n2000 stacks won't be a problem now ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doctor Yas","date":"2019-01-10T11:43:05.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**when does 9.1 update come Like what day specifically 26th of January some people say ??**\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-10T12:26:54.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It already has.
