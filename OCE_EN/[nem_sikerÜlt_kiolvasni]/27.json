Why are they rare? As long as these skins are obtained in a way similar to their original release, I think players could feel comfortable about it. I think I have some reasonable solutions below. They can also be integrated into the Hextech Crafting system by having the events _unlock a chance to open/reroll_ that item, rather than straight up unlocking that item itself.\r\n\r\n**Giveaway Skins** were created as _event-specific skins_. They function as a marker of _participation_ in an event. The solution here seems reasonably straightforward - recreate that event.\r\n\r\nUsing _PAX skins_ as example, redistribute again at future PAX events. Instead of creating individual codes for each champion, you could also create a single random-chance code which gives attendants a random PAX skin.\r\n\r\n_King Rammus_ was for Closed Beta players, but could also be for players who have provided a lot of significant testing feedback or community contribution over an extended period of time.\r\n\r\n**Achievement Skins** are similar to Giveaway Skins as a mark of participation, but with added significance as a marker of _demonstrated skill_. These have a similar possibile solution - create a new opportunity to demonstrate that skill, possibly with a higher threshold.\r\n\r\nThe _Season Reward Skins_ for example could be re-used for future season rewards, restricting to the uppermost tiers as an additional bonus. Such an implementation seems fair to me - get Gold for the corresponding season (relatively easy) or work harder in a later season to reach a higher rank if you missed the first chance.\r\n\r\n**Previously Sold Skins** are a bit trickier, because they were intentionally created to be limited edition items with a _small time window_ for purchasing. But I think there's a reasonable solution using the Hextech Crafting system. Periodically, allow the _Reroll into Permanent Skin_ option to output a Limited Skin _coupon_, giving players the option to purchase that skin for RP.","replies":[{"poster":"RA63ING F1R3","date":"2016-06-17T22:55:18.191+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe if you want to make people still feel special about their skins give them a border of some sort(like with the project skins) to show how long they have owned the skins for","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-18T01:28:41.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RA63ING F1R3,realm=OCE,application-id=pEj6Ee6n,discussion-id=JsWEEQPR,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-06-17T22:55:18.191+0000)\n>\n> maybe if you want to make people still feel special about their skins give them a border of some sort(like with the project skins) to show how long they have owned the skins for\n\nThis is actually something that Riot had done before for certain Limited Skins that they've made available again.

I've only ever seen Victorious Jarvan once, in a TT game on a team with Victorious Janna and Elise. I was super impressed while I was getting destroyed!\r\n\r\nThe higher barrier is a good start to keep them special. But even including the standard (or other) \"first edition\" treatment we did when we re-released limited sale skins, I'm just not sure that it's special enough for something that takes so much commitment to the game or displays how long you've been playing.\r\nStill, we can have the discussion!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loughlin","date":"2016-06-17T21:10:56.059+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they should add voice chat in NORMAL.
