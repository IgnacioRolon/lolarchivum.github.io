You don't deserve a reward! Easy as that!\n\nI had some games with people last night who really wanted the summoner icon unlocked that they just went in game and sat at their fountain and let us win. (There was 1 1/2 hours left on the timer). They expressed their concern in all chat and decided to take one for the community. And instead of us reporting AFK, we Honoured them for being an Honourable Opponent. The community needs to come together and be crafty to beat these challenges. In this event the fight isn't amongst us Summoners, We're playing for each other here when a community reward is given for a challenge. Now another TT map is up, let's find a way to get this challenge done!\n\nLet's go OCE! We can still do this!
