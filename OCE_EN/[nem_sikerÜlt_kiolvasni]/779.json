Then, everything changed when Riot attacked and removed the Crystal Scar from custom games. Only a good game designer, master of all things the community wants, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A few months passed and my brother and I discovered a new game, an amazing game named Overwatch. And although its great, it has a lot to learn before its ready to be more fun then hide and seek. But I believe League of Legends can become great again. \r\n\r\nps. bring back crystal scar so we can have fun again","replies":[]},{"poster":"Armin Arlert","date":"2016-10-08T23:45:02.733+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey riot, I understand we don't have the player base like other regions to bring in extra modes like Dominion, but could we add the mode into the special game rotation on the weekends please? \r\n\r\nDefinitely Not Dominion is fun, but its definitely not the same as Dominion.
