One of the most prominent cases is with vayne where you can fire a bolt, cancel the animation and the bolt will literally impact with no damage and, in some cases, reverse itself right back to her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Coz Its Shounen","date":"2016-10-05T00:18:42.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:136}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3153}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"fastrob","date":"2016-10-04T22:11:50.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keen for the Candy King but is that a Poppy lolly Lollipoppy in the background","replies":[]},{"poster":"CleverEgg","date":"2016-10-04T21:31:12.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please release Guaidian skins faster!!My money cant wait","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Oppa","date":"2016-10-04T21:10:05.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they release the Star Guardian skins sometime this week {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]}]}
