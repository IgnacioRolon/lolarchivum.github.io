This applies to Toad --> Blue --> Wolves --> Birds. Vice versa, Golems --> Red --> Birds --> Wolves. I don't believe that there is enough opputunity for people like me, who don't have proper runes yet, to experience a proper game of jungling without being laid back early (e.g. no ganking, execution :( , being counter jungled and etc.).

I highly recommend that mode, it allows much better team compositions and much less fighting over role which makes the game a lot nicer.\r\n\r\nAs for jungling, if you're having trouble then take sustain junglers like Fiddlesticks. Fiddles doesn't really matter what runes you take, just start W, point in E, W, Q, W, R, W. Max R > W > Q > E, and you'll be fine. Start Blue of course, take whatever smite modification item you want, slow is nice, build a revolver, upgrade smite mod into the AP item. You'll be fine.\r\n\r\nWarwick is good too, take attack speed runes, mix of armour/health yellows, cool down blues, mix of armour and attack speed quints. His passive means AS is pretty powerful.
