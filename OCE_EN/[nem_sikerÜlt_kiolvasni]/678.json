Pro players often play high skill cap champions as they are some of the best players and can make those champions work. Alot of champions that are considered \"troll\" picks is simply because they are incredibly low skill cap champs that unless overtuned will never be stronger than high skill cap champions in pro play. These champions however are essential for low skill players and beginners as they offer an easier skill cap to pick up and are ultimately stronger in a situation where you lack the mechanics to pull out someone like yasuo or zed","replies":[{"poster":"BOSS Achilles","date":"2017-02-17T16:21:36.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to disagree here. Low skill cap champs are still great. Sure they are easier to pick up but they are alot harder to master simply because you can't be good but just knowing your champ. To be truly good on these champs you have to understand all the other champs, how your champ synergises with others and how you can make up for your lack of freebies. Take pre-rework Ashe for example. I loved that champ and believe I mastered it over the 5 years I played it. It was really hard to play Ashe by myself as people didn't know what the capabilities were. But as soon as I found a duo who played a champ that can make up for Ashe's lack of mobility, we climbed to challenger playing Ashe only. To this day I still believe Ashe was one of the strongest champs in that area but pros were too scared to try a different strat. Ashe ADC was meant to be more of a support and allowed you to run a tankless team. Yeah high skill cap champs allow players to flourish but if you played (the way you should be playing LoL) as a team, these low skill cap champs can prove alot more effective with the right strat. Teemo is a great champion and has a great element of cheese. Not sure why pro teams don't try it since it's something so unexpected you're not too sure how to shut it down....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2017-02-17T09:41:27.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So do we need half the roster to be these low skill champions?
