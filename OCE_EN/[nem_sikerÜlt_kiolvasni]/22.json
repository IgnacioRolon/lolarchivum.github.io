To be honest, for the past couple years its seemed as if all the fun is being taken out of league as you try to make it a more *professional* game. You released different modes and maps to encourage different types of game play a fun events in the past, but now its just re-released content for a measly 2 weeks out of 2 months on average. You release more champions, but generally its been much of a muchness for the past 2 years with no major break through's. a couple changes have affected the numbers of the game, what with mastery changes and the like, but the game hasn't changed for a LONG time. You say that alternative game modes are better in short bursts, which is true if you simply looking at the more serious gameplay element. But many people don't play league to be serious, these are the people who go to custom game to have fun and play hide and seek and various other custom games which are based on a smaller map. As someone previously mentioned on here, you retired Dominion when you removed the game queue for it on OCE, but you buried the body when you remove it completely. \r\n\r\nFor the small hope I have inside me that Riot hasn't lost all of its sense of fun and joy in the past, please, please find some way to host silly or non-serious games in some form regularly. 2 weeks in a blue moon is not enough for people who just want to have a laugh and relax. In fact these types of games thrive in a custom environment and not in matchmade gameplay, so it doesn't have to be serious and well maintained. If it can work 90% of the time in customs, then people will be happy. \r\n\r\nAs some ides for how this could work, Perhaps have a dedicated smaller arena so that we can still enjoy some of the custom games that even on OCE are still regularly hosted such as hide and seek, and in the past, teamfight arena(but considering the retirement of dominion, i can see that you guys don't want any branching out from main product. sad, i know, because its costing and going to cost you players in the long run)\r\n\r\nPerhaps allow the flavor of the month game mode(such as doom bots/URF ect) to be played in a custom environment. That way it allows communities to still enjoy your content, and if certain aspect get broken then it doesn't matter. People will share information about whats broken and avoid the mistakes. Hell, put up a disclaimer for people to sign saying that they cant complain if somethings broken on it. \r\n\r\nIf you look at many many other games in the DOTA style (I refuse to call them mobas) and other popular games that have long term players, they always have regular fun content. Lets just list some for reference (non mobas so riot fun police doesn't get pissy). Hearthstone has tavern brawls about 4.5 days/7. A certain moba that sounds like s'right has daily alternative game modes.\r\n\r\nAnd these custom game modes always teach some skill or another to players without the seriousness of Summoners rift normals and ranked. ARAMs taught how to dodge and better aiming skill shots (and this was way before the actual map made for it) Hide and seek, depending on the team you were on, made you better at (obviously) hiding, duking, using vision to your advantage and escaping if you were a hider. If you were a seeker it really encouraged proper teamwork elements, even when some plat+ players would join who never played before would be a terrible seeker because they became so solo focused and weren't good at working duo play. Now these are just examples, but this type of fun used to be a priority at riot, but now its just new skin woo, new champion who is just a mix of the abilities from other champions thrown together woo, new icon woo, there's no change in play from league and it stagnates for older players. Many of my friends have quit league because it doesn't change and there's no fun, there's no place for non serious play or off builds or anything anymore, leaving just optimization of the strongest champions until you miss something else broken then optimize them.\r\n\r\n...don't let me get started on the build limitation of so many champions. I recognize the need for champions to not be able to build and change their method of play based on build because on the unbalanced nature of that ability and unfairness it can bring in a serious ranked environment, look at ez and so many that were changed because overall its just too hard to balance correctly. I can understand, but I don't have to like the railroaded nature of builds right now.\r\nSo this is an insane rant and I apologize to anyone who actually read it.
