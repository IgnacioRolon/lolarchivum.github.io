The other balance piece is the starting time which was decided so that it can be most accessible for digital viewers as well as live (from New Zealand viewers through to Thailand).\r\n\r\nYou are totally right that the tickets are more expensive than they have been in the past, and we believe it's worth it. Running live events is extremely expensive and for us to be able to create these opportunities for players to experience live league of legends in Oceania, we need to push towards sustainability. This pricing is a step towards this and we still believe that there is good value for fans.\r\n\r\nI hope this extra context lets you understand our rationale and we will be keeping an eye on how things are tracking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HentaiOnichan","date":"2018-05-29T15:13:50.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also not to mention the biggest deal here is for 2 days.
