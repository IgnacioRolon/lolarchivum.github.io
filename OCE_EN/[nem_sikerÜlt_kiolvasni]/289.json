Riot if you gonna turn this game into a politics shit hole you will drive away hardcore fans like me. I swear if Riots keeps walking down the path of trying to change people's political views through shit like this, it is gonna drive the hardcore fans away who play this game to avoid this shit in real life. Riot do not become a political game machine because if you do, this game will die just like \"Bully Hunters\" who virtue signaled and that product was a complete and utter failure. If this happens then goodbye my league experience. DO NOT BECOME POLITICAL VIRTUE SIGNALING MACHINES LIKE YOUTUBE. I'm tired of whatever politics this is shoved down my throat all over social media, news and real life. if this type of \"thing\" continues into gameplay of league of legends I'm just straight up quitting league. An example would be \"Killing minions is too cruel so we are going to that mechanic so people pat minions on the head to get gold and you can't kill the enemy anymore because it is too violent\".

If you read the comments section there are people complaining about how minor a stance that riot is taking. Let's look at what riot is actually doing here, they are raising awareness for a day of inclusivity. Nobody is mentioning politics or shoving anything down anybody's throat. If you can't handle even the idea of people different from yourself being celebrated maybe it is time for you to find a new hobby? I'm sure riot won't mind losing you, there are plenty of old-school players who welcome riots efforts to make their game less of a toxic wasteland of homophobic, transphobic and biphobic garbage. {{sticker:sg-ahri-3}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Free Facials","date":"2018-05-19T15:40:27.342+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"Damn son, you were attempting to take the high ground there for a moment, then you degenerated into labeling people with a different opinion to yourself as \"trash\". \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of people out there are accepting of alternative lifestyles, but who still acknowledge/enjoy P in V as the normal and evolutionary imperative.
