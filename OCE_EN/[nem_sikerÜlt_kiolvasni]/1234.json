Chiefs have to be the team to get there, and when they do I look forward to seeing them progress past the group stage. When Oceania has secured that round 2 start at worlds by constantly dominating in Rift, the other minors (and maybe NA) at MSI AND their stage 2 rivals, THEN you can THINK about starting to talk like that, but I still wouldn't.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-07-08T20:22:31.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Way to take a joke buddy","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2018-07-08T05:41:10.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets go OCE!

Not as a Legacy fan (because I'm not) but as an OCE fan who's always believed we can do it so long as the teams focus and don't get carried away by \"easy\" wins. The whole tournament was pretty to watch, but for them to do what they did and show that our third seed is still a good team speaks volumes for this season and the future of OPL! Looking forward to the rest of the split!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vHaze","date":"2018-07-06T07:09:55.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"dire wolves ez world champs ","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2018-07-08T06:24:12.060+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they make as many mistakes as they did, and chiefs by comparison make 1 for the tournament that was detrimental, AND Chiefs were the only team capable of grinding Mineski to  dust, even after their level 2 cheese tactics did so much work, I'd be seriously suprised if the Old Guard don't ace the rest of the OPL and show up in their place. Dire Wolves are still far too cocky and Shern reliant, and it shows not only in their gameplay, but in the way they talk.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brown Man","date":"2018-07-10T03:46:59.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When will the rp be sent to our accounts for getting tickets early?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-07-12T01:42:57.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be done now!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AKTM","date":"2018-07-11T22:59:39.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:11}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghost R","date":"2018-07-10T14:31:32.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oz Oz Oz Oi Oi Oi{{sticker:sg-lux}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Relivia","date":"2018-07-09T09:50:42.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does anybody know if all the the photos/interviews from the event be posted here somewhere?\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"JamesLoop ","date":"2018-07-09T08:26:22.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WILL OCEANIA BE ABLE TO DEFEAT THE KILLKOREANS??~!?!?
