I hope the biggest changes are to come in the Preseason, but honestly I just wish they would stop balancing things only around the championships. As Brofresco once said, \"Only 5% of the player base is truly affected by these balance changes\". There is a number of champions who are at their weakest point right now, and there are some who are just way too stong for the good of the game. For instance, some of the weakest champions right now have been stuck in such state for a good 6 patches by now, if not more and they are practically impossible to play, just because there are so much better options and they are never picked as a result. These include ones like Poppy, Kalista, Lulu, Nidalee, and a bunch more. On the other hand, glad that Yasuo got nerfed, but he is strong not only because of his tank off-meta build, and the patch dressed it very slightly. Tryndamere too, is now number 1 in my ban list, because his ultimate alone allows him to stay toplane for the entire duration of the game, while to take him down you need at least 3 people. I will not be posting here the entire compilation of all the OP and underpowered champions, but please in future look at the things from a perspective of an average player please.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-09-10T05:20:15.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I see comments like this for the hundreds of times always imagine:\r\n\r\nRiot: LOL No. Get gud scrubs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-09-09T22:02:53.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU GUYS TOOK DOWN CHAMPIONSHIP ZED!?!?
