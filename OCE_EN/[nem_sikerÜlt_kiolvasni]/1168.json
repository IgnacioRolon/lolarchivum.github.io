Ip is being converted into blue essence, but so  existing blue essence doesn't lose its relative value u will multiply it by 6.5... meaning we currently earn roughly 6.5 times as much ip as blue essence. We will not earn blue essence after each match. We will just get a champ shard after each level. And those champ shards will now disenchant for 1/3 the value they used to? Please tell me i have missed something here. Based on this we will not earn anywhere near as much blue essence as we do ip.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunaswift","date":"2017-11-08T14:48:24.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same question, riot pls??? how could I gain blue essence now?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CastingDeath","date":"2017-11-06T20:20:06.244+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the champions tab description:\r\n\": bonus Attack Speed at level 1.
