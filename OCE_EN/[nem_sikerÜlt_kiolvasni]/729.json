Blah, blah, blabbidy blah.\"_\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, and I do fret **MY OPINION** because opinions are like assholes everyone shows them, but yours needs to be thoroughly examined... In my opinion, from a perspective of putting myself in the Riot Developers and the Staff that have been put on this task, because they get paid to do such a thing... They have done decent so far.\r\n\r\nAm I concerned about compensation? Kinda, sorta... Everyone would be butt hurt if they gave us like some Hextech Loot and called it a day, or a refund on all the IP ever, which would be funny... But I doubt Riot, even though they are a business, would be so harsh and cruel. Optimism is a quality I have.\r\n\r\nAnyways the point I am trying to get across, is everyone is so narrow minded on incredibly early in the process changes that wont be here for at-least! At-least 4-5 Months ~ ish. They wanted to get to us early because of this volatile change. But everyone who has made an angry post about there resentment towards Riot for the way they are treating this community, are just silly and rushed to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nRiot work there ass off just so the community has bloody entertainment for 3 hours a day, and so that Pro's can make a living off said entertainment. The initial team that was founded by Mark, etc, etc you know them all... where extremely passionate about this game, and probably still have a soft spot for it, considering how much success they have made off the game.\r\n\r\nPeople should just realize that they want GOOD QUALITY feedback. Not fuck you riot, compensate me.\r\n\r\nThey will, calm it. \r\n\r\nBut anyways RITO has done it again, long live URF and Merry Snowdown. I do believe this looks really awesome, I do like the direction of this, as it streamlines League and makes it easier, considering we can change everything on the fly. Im interested to see if any existing Keystones will remain.\r\n**\r\nOne of my ideas to Riot / Questions is will there be number changes across the board? Or ways to make up for the changes that are happening as this will effect the entire meta, and will probably shift it a lot more than most pre-seasons. I am hyped.**\r\n\r\n_~ Candlewick Out._","replies":[{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2017-06-30T10:24:04.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure this will just push the game further into the tank/assassin meta, further alienating carries.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Newguy73","date":"2017-06-01T22:36:21.336+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"What happens to all the IP that i have saved up to buy runes, is it all refunded?","replies":[{"poster":"MurkyWaters","date":"2017-06-02T00:50:48.292+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said in the video they will get back to us on that but they WILL be some kind of refund happening (Items etc.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"InfinityCorp","date":"2017-06-01T22:45:07.695+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"How will this affect builds or off meta picks that rely on the raw stat boost that comes from the current runes and mastery system to work? \r\n\r\ne.g. I play a fair bit of Rakan Jungle and need the attack speed that I get from runes and masterys in order to clear the jungle early and remain relevant in the game.

Current Runes can be used to boost an early game in an unfavourable matchup,Top or Midlane. Due to lack of base resistances runes provide these so you can survive poke, or being able to at least trade effectively.\r\n2. Current Runes are vital for some roles, eg. some junglers need armour runes to be able to survive jungle clears with relative health to be able to gank, except graves lul.\r\n3. Current Runes are one of the biggest influences in Bottom lane, a tankier rune setup for certain tanky/engage supports allows them to take punishment and survive poke lanes etc.\r\n\r\nPlease Read this, and take into consideration what removal of base stats provided by runes will do to certain match-ups in roles; AND I can't stress enough how much impact it will make on unfavourable match-ups.

Granted I believe it will take some time figuring out that some would be OP from the get go (Overheal on Rakan would make trading impossible, Bloodthirster Overheal means you have something close to a 400 Shield and Berserk would make Vayne do % max health true damage almost every second).\r\n\r\nBut, there's one thing I absolutely adore; We now have infinite Runes and Masteries. Riot doesn't add any more Runes and implementing a new Mastery means removing an old one to replace it but now with this system, they can just add it like a new champion with only having to balance it. Say they want to rework Thunderlords into the new masteries but they want it to do a small AOE thunderstorm instead of the normal single target. Done, just throw that bad boy on the PBE and then test it (and balance it for once) for the current meta. \r\n\r\nThere is one issue that I think is going to be the most annoying is trying to find the right mastery that suits you, what your team needs and the champion you play. Example; What's the point of grabbing overheal on Darius/Illaoi when you have no allied healing? People might grab it without thinking because Darius/Illaoi only heals for missing health.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is balancing to specific champions. Jhin can just Auto attack once with Berserk and, after 3 seconds, he gets 15% bonus AD and 24% Bonus movement speed on crit. Another is the fact Perxie would make it so that say Braum, Rakan or Lee Sin jumps to a target he gives them a small shield which Perxie would Immediately return because you're right there.\r\n\r\nIn short, I like the changes but we all better be ready for the shit storm that follows with balancing issues and finding the right combination of Keystones and Runes to be the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LordCreep","date":"2017-06-01T23:44:50.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"ERMAGERD!!!!!!!!!!!!
