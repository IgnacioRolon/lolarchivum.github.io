WTF are you on riot? 4 years I spent on this game playing with my higher ranked friends eg diamond 1~2. And you go place me and 1000s of others who don't deserve it ? Maybe if you stopped making so many %%%%tyy LCS comps, and pointless skins. You'd be able to pull your heads from out your asses and see the problems,  the people, the ranking, the depression that is caused by your %%%%iing %%%%%%ed elo system. The one where you can get caught between leagues eg s5 and b1, you can get caught in a loop that screws up your mmr by losing 5-10 games  and then winning 1 and staying in s5 and restarting the loop, making you get placed with worse people who ultimately ruin the game for you and making nearly impossible to climb. Bring back the elo ladder FFS. Reset everyone's mmr and let them go. Because atm the way things are Dyrus can play 1 game and already be diamond. Like if they're in diamond theyll be able to get back there??? Reset this mmr it's stupid the way you've set this game up. 4 years I lost to this game and all I can show for it is bronze because you set the ranking wrong. And ive made a alt account to reset mmr. I got to s2 and I was vsing plats. Reset everyone's mmr and let them actually have a fresh start. The pros will get back to where they are, and if they don't you have new pros from the reset anyway.  \nPS fix your bruisers, they're making the need for tanks pointless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Diamond Booster","date":"2015-01-14T09:45:21.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:31}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-01-12T22:05:23.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is always a risk that external applications **may cause game (or system) *stability***, contain malicious code, or a variety of other potential issues.\r\n\r\nBecause game stability is the last thing we want for a server that already has bad enough internet speed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IcyFlame","date":"2015-01-11T23:30:41.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ffs why you wonna effing ban rek sai what abour the people that bought him ur just gonna start trouble idiots -.-{{champion:421}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:54:43.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Still not happy about how you guys burried Lolcam into a dark basement, set out to do some hard labour for menial tasks and no pay.","replies":[]}]}
