However, it can also be interpreted as someone who is exceptionally skilled in any sort of field as well as someone who has knowledge in art and musical execution. \r\n\r\nJhin is a virtuoso in the sense that he see's art in the way he kills. As you saw in the trailer, when the male was shot and the tree grew out of him it was Jhin's mind seeing art in the killing he does. Similar traits are seen in the \"Meet the Pyro\" video posted by Team Fortress. \r\n\r\nI understand his kit doesn't really match the true meaning of virtuoso but its a plausible explanation. Jhin is a marksman, that takes time to set up the perfect shot but his \"execution\" of killing (relating to the term of virtuoso again, I know I'm sorry) is his own form of musical art.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkPatch","date":"2016-01-13T01:00:58.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He looks really good!
