In a gamemode in which burst damage wins, Teemo relies on damage over time and blinding the enemy (Did we mention blinding doesn't stop you from using skills and skills have 80% CDR? Hm..). Having a Teemo is essentially inhibiting one slot from a potential Jax, Katarina, Jayce, Evelynn, Ezreal, or just about anyone else with decent burst potential, and replacing it with a champion who will a) AFK after setting a bunch of mushrooms and hoping the enemy will step through them enough to die, or b) Actually be a part of teamfights, but realize he's naught more than .5 seconds worth of cannon fodder.
