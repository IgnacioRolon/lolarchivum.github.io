I am not an Aatrox main nor do I enjoy playing against him (passive healing with Spirit Visage makes him a monster late game) but I am disappointed with this change. His whole theme is this unkillable darkin that wants to run at you and slice. Also Rito wanting to force changes to champion's themes because of pro/high elo players seems like a slippery slope to me. Whats next? Remove Tahm's devour or make Lucian's R one wave only?\r\n\r\nTldr; not a fan of Aatrox R change. Either revert or nerf him but please don't ruin the theme.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nidalee AimBot","date":"2019-07-16T19:39:59.708+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"R.I.P leona,","replies":[{"poster":"HøneyBadger","date":"2019-07-16T21:15:32.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Big time.

Leona was never broken, and was hardly even played.  I guess you're going to see her less now.  Also, Lux's cooldown refund was a great reward for hitting an amazing combo, maybe you could have lessened the cooldowns instead of removing them entirely.  Now I have to look for a new tank and mage support, except all of them have been nerfed to make Yuumi look better","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-23T12:49:28.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W is more of a buff imo and feels like there are much clearer reasons to use the W at a particular time.  Personally, I think taking away from her already quite high base damage and moving that strength into tank stats (since she's a tank and all) makes a lot of sense. Overall I would call it at worst a rebalance and not a nerf. That said, I don't play a lot of Leona (though I do verse her plenty).\n\nAs for Lux, that's exactly what they did. Her R cooldown is significantly lower at later ranks and the AP ratio went up, so overall I'd call it a buff to her ult. The Q and W were problematic in lane. She was just way too safe for what is far closer to a kill lane than any other enchanter support. And tbh, the nerfs aren't even all that big, certainly not enough to warrant changing mains if perhaps a new FotM. A good Lux is still going to thrive. For the record, I both play and verse *a lot* of Lux.\n\nThat is naturally just my personal opinion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TDK 95","date":"2019-07-18T07:59:03.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So am I supposed to build Tahm rageblade and nashors/wits end every game now? I don't understand making it so he can't apply his passive with **any** ability. At least keep it on Q or W.
