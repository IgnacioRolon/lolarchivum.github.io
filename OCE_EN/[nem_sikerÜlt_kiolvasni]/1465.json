I join a game normal everything is going fine but when i spawn level 1 I click to move and it sets my move point  in the pool of the enemy team. I can't change when im going and i just keep heading to it. (I can recall and do other stuff that will let me move my champ somewhere but i cant auto attack so after my teammates yelling at me i left then rejoined and it was fixed. Anyway 3 games later i DC in the loading screen just before the game and im at 100% I click reconnect strait away and go back into the loading screen goes fine then i join the game and right away im kicked for pro longed inactivity <?????????????? and with that comes a 20x5 min way thanks :( \r\nPlease fix I haven't got to wait for leaving or afking for like 200 games and this wasn't my fault i don't even know why i DCed. I will pay the time for it since i still wanna play but the reconnect then kicked thing has happened 3 times to me now and is a also happens to my friends sometimes.","replies":[]}]}
