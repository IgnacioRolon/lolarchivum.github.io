I Would be more than happy to pay for the bag, how much would it cost?\r\n\r\nI am an avid League of Legends player and it would mean heaps to me if you guys could sell me a bag at the door. I wont bee able to meet at Hoyt's Cinema Warringah Mall until approximately 6:10 PM. Im fine waiting around until the current game has finished, could I come and ask the Staff? \r\n\r\nThanks Heaps, TRIPIN.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OreeO","date":"2015-08-07T12:25:37.479+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully Braum's burgers wont be too overpriced....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gilsta","date":"2015-08-07T08:23:28.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"should be awesome to watch!","replies":[]},{"poster":"oldogs1","date":"2015-08-08T03:27:04.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very excited for this event in Sydney today.\r\n\r\nMy friends and I bought tickets and are about to head off to Luna Park to enjoy some rides before the (hopefully!) five, amazing games.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch to whoever is responsible!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Stips","date":"2015-08-07T08:36:20.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to go, then i fell on a grate yesterday and have 5 stitches in my knee","replies":[{"poster":"elmatto1","date":"2015-08-07T12:07:52.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyyyye","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"72O","date":"2015-08-07T10:45:31.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"giant {{champion:17}}, giant {{champion:17}} !! lol, i totally died when I saw it. :D :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-08-07T10:08:20.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not many comments ._.
