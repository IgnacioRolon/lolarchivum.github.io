Always hopeful that instead of focusing all their efforts on _**absolutely** **urgent**_ fixes like: _\"One of Yasuo's skins now no longer faces the wrong way when channeling Rift Herald\"_. That there might just be 1 line of text that says _we have fixed this actual gameplay problem:_\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Nrz4fekIU\r\n\r\nBut every 2 weeks for the last year, I have been disappointed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Random Lord","date":"2017-08-15T06:54:10.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I am a lover of all the URF related things, the whole idea behind it where it came from and the glorious skins, icons, and login screens that have been born through this game-mode.  Although the last two iterations of this game-mode have left me quiet unsatisfied for two reasons; The lack of custom games; the not-so-random random champion selection.  Noted the later of these two reasons I have only heard through rumors.\r\n\r\nCustom games, the backbone of fuckery and casual gamers' enjoyment (or at least for me).  Now in previous URF runs my fondest memories where of me and my friend 50mins into an URF custom game playing a game of reactions with our Ults on {{champion:45}} , a terrifying game indeed.  Why Riot would want to deny someone this right is beyond me, but it has left many fun times unseen in recent times.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which is unseen recently have been the hidden broken champions.  Now I didn't think this would be a problem when the announcement was made for ALL RANDOM URF, then as i played the living shit out of it i noticed i saw the same champions all the time.  I later heard that the \"random system\" was actually percentages that where increased depending on how often a champion was played.  Now weather or not it's true i have no idea but it does make sense after playing for so long.  Now i see the merit in this strategy but it isn't always ideal, as there are often times when i play and simply want something fresh, yet I am constantly stuck with {{champion:105}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:266}} ect. And that, that makes me sad especially when i know the hidden OP's exist as i found with {{champion:28}} in my first URF.\r\n\r\nBasically this whole post was just for me to complain about the little things, I would like to say though that you have done this a few times now and made me sad, as I am sure most would agree that the new Doombots was far from the countless hours of fun had from the original split pushing maniac frenzy of abilities that was Doombots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Murasama","date":"2017-08-14T22:45:10.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Missing the urf emote, tried to spam it the other day and it didn't work :c","replies":[]},{"poster":"flash3245","date":"2017-08-14T22:41:38.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there should be an arcade jinx hahaha would be an awesome skin {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fuhqyoo","date":"2017-08-14T06:41:00.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what happened to the Aatrox re-work that was discussed so long ago?
