Instead, we got what seems to be a cool looking Kassadin skin with a last minute recall animation slapped on to just say \"hey it's oce related now\".\r\n\r\nI still can't believe this was the design chosen over 2 years. There were so many other concepts like a Rugby themed skin (which is heavily popular in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa etc.) that could've actually represented our server and on first glance by anyone in the region could've been actually identified as an OCEANIC skin.\r\n\r\nWhen Thailanders see the Muay Thai Lee Sin skin, that's actually a skin they see on first glance and go \"hey, that's our server skin\".\r\n\r\nWhen Latin Americans see Ghost Bridge Morgana, they can identify it from a childhood fairy tale that was told.\r\n\r\nShow this skin to your average Oceanic player and I can guarantee you that a very small percentage of them will identify it with our server skin. It's just a very poor design.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, you guys actually have the nerve to charge our own \"server\" skin to your own players where EVERY OTHER SERVER has gotten their one for free (and multiple ones at that, so the Ziggs debate is useless in my opinion).\r\n\r\nI mentioned this before but I've spent quite a bit of money on this game (well over $1000AUD) so the cost doesn't affect me at all. I just think it is a poor bloody performance and an embarrassment to even call this the Oceanic skin after 2 years of development.\r\n\r\nYou say you don't want to set a precedent but you already have and you are clearly bending it to a playerbase that has waited YEARS for their skin. I'm sorry, but in all honesty this shows that this skin was one that was already in planning for awhile with the full intention of being released for 1350 RP but with the Oceanic theme slapped on at the end.\r\n\r\nYou can say all you want about a 50% discount and charity, but we're only getting a 300 RP discount compared to OTHER servers (the skin will be 975 at release and we're getting it for 675 for 2 weeks ONLY).\r\n\r\nHonestly I'm really disappointed, if you guys want to keep reinforcing that this is the best result you came up with after 2 years, I personally will not buy this skin or anymore RP in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2015-10-10T04:58:59.725+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The Medical Services/Research category won the server vote so the donation will go to a cause in that field. \"\r\n\r\nMore information please?\r\n\r\nI'm all for giving to charity but, because of the negative recent events between Au and NZ, I'd not feel comfortable at all 'donating' to a charity that solely benefits Au. \r\n\r\nThe funds received need to be spread proportionally, and to clearly defined charities. \r\n\r\nP.S.

There's always been a very tight bond between the two countries, one that was strengthened further by WWl and WWll and the creation of the ANZACs. There's always been a pretty free flow of people going back and forth between the two countries. Up until 1981 you didn't even need a passport to travel between the two, you just got on a plane (or boat lol) and went. You still don't need a VISA (work permit). If you wanted to move to Au or NZ you just went there, found somewhere to stay, got a job and got on with life. \r\nRecently though the Australian Govt has been treating NZ 'overstayers' in the same manner as other nationalities, which kind of flies in the face of the fact we (Kiwis) don't actually have to do anything red-tape to stay, work and live in Au. \r\nAt last count there were an estimated 75 NZers in Detention Camps around Au and these guys and gals are getting treated no different from anyone else. And that's kinda sad and contemptful considering the special relationship between the two countries. \r\nOne young bloke being held in 'detention' in a prison committed suicide after being told he was being 'sent home' to NZ.
