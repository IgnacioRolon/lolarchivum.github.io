Perhaps that will change in the future... (after everyone has emptied their pockets to buy him).\r\n\r\nBut then again, what would I know. 'Nobody knows how to counter play him yet' ...

So i don't think mid is the ideal place for him, (unless he can get really really fed before they hit lvl 6)\r\n\r\nI'm certain Jhin will inevitably become my main bot lane ADC (i like to play champs that are interesting rather than strong, otherwise i would have picked up Vayne ages ago) but when it comes to the mid lane i think ill stick with my Azir :3\r\n\r\nmy congratulations to everyone involved in the making of Jhin though! he is a marvellous and unique design, both with kit and quotes/looks. He rival's (if not overtakes) Jinx as bot lane's most interesting and fun personality. Not only is he interesting, but he opens up some much needed insight on the lives of Zed and Shen as well. \r\n\r\nkeep it up riot!\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/OpGVNp0","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WinterFreak","date":"2016-02-02T11:27:49.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i played him we spent the whole game making jhincredible puns","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"cody macfire","date":"2016-02-17T22:09:12.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG!!! {{champion:202}} IS H20 DELIRIOUS!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"AskiKa","date":"2016-02-10T00:25:56.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin has a clear weakness, reload, lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TROLLO","date":"2016-02-03T15:37:36.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So is this new champ an ADC? because thats too much for an ADC, slow effect, stun and increase of movement speed?
