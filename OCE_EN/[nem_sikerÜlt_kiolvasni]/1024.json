How much more are people going to hate Yasuo (who did absolutely nothing wrong) because you updated masteries? He got nerfed because the fervor and aa speed builds with a mallet were getting to you yes. But you took away that damage now, only gets the bonus ad on his ult, still does less than used to with fervor now (~1/2), but anyway to the point. You're adding a mastery for 35% hp shield if malph presses r, people hate yasuo because he has an ulti that works with (Only with cc, not like he can instakill all from nothing, he has to set it up.) which is defined as a suspension (even though says knockup in tooltip, but whatever)\r\n\r\nBack to real point. So, people hate yasuo because \"oh no massive (1 aa, problem solved plebs) shield appears for 510, and if he gets 7% shield ontop he gets (lv 18) 644 hp shield for ulting 1 enemy, ulting 5 will rack up a nice 1179(plus, if hp is bought). It's not really that bad (for people who arent idiots, but the fact is most people are, and have a need to complain), but it might be perceived as \"making him tanky\". How many nerfs are you people going to throw at him because people cant handle the simple fact that yasuo is;\r\n\r\nA: actually one of the squishiest champs in the game, he only has the shield and w because he would be useless without the utility, he has high utiliy to make up for his lack of any tank (thats why people buy some tank items, to help captain squish)\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\nB: **the** most cc susceptible champion in the game. Point and click will murder him and his family in under a billionth of a second.\r\n\r\nBut still, despite this people whuss about him being op, so what are you doing to him? Halving his hp scale, throwing in negative shields and chucking a 2 hp per sec bleed on him to satisfy these people or what? Because, despite is sounding bad and \"oh no-op\", logically it isnt that bad, but people don't think too logically, they think \"Oh man 1179 hp shield for pressing r? how broken is that\", they dont think \"Oh, what an idiot, even a .25 sec cc will screw him, and jumping into a 5v1? damn ain't he a nut.\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Awsome34567","date":"2016-11-01T23:02:50.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure hard crowd control is things that makes some1 stop moving completely. e.g snare,root,stun","replies":[{"poster":"Oiprocs Knah","date":"2016-11-02T06:08:14.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"snare and root are the same thing and they arent hard CC since you can still attack.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Seongjoon","date":"2016-11-02T06:09:08.026+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Champions either have crowd control abilities or they don’t, making Oppressor a pretty ‘yes or no’ mastery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gain a shield for 7% (+7% for each nearby enemy champion) of your maximum health for 4 seconds after hitting an enemy champion with hard crowd control (30 second cooldown)\"\r\n\r\nWat?
