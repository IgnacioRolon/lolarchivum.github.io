Made her mana costs extreme, Increased the costs of tear, reduced shields. increased mana costs and gold costs. Riot, Some people like to play support. I really enjoy it. But you are making it so that AP supports are totally useless. They have no sustain, no items and no gold. This is getting to the point where supports are irrelevant till 15 mins and then they are behind for the remainder of the game. I love my Sona, I played her alot and now, I cant even use her mid lane... you guys need to stop breaking everything and focus more an a game wide balance. You're forcing another Tank meta and gutting everyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Ham the Rabbit","date":"2018-06-23T17:14:47.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The team with more Ornns will win","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DayLight V","date":"2018-06-12T21:18:38.146+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand the shield nerfs but why nerf shield duration and forbidden idle at the same time. I'm gonna miss feeling almost relevant stat wise on Support.\r\n\r\nFor Janna with the shield decaying its gonna be really easy to remove it making the ADC lose the bonus AD.\r\nFor Karma you needed a long shield duration for R + E combo to feel like the shield and mini shields weren't wasted if you used them to give MS to team to reposition in fights. Now if you use them to deny burst (rather than to shield burst) or for the MS you are losing about 80% of your mid-late game effectiveness. Since all you have left is a small Q poke and sub par delayed CC E root.\r\n\r\nI understand shields shouldn't last the whole duration of fights and things like lulu having a 6s shield every 5.5s doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nI'm not liking the direction league is headed where its becoming directed to people with elite reaction speed.\r\n\r\nI play on 50ms and I struggle compete with those on 0ms ping.\r\n\r\nAll champs and items these days are becoming more and more skill reliant. Easy champs/items need to exist too for the players with good Macro but not Micro or players forced into off role or even just because some people enjoy outwitting their opponent over out playing them. Not all players aim to be flashy, some aim for consistency.\r\n\r\nI'm just salty my favorite supports are likely to not be meta anymore, I'll be back on tanks. Atleast there is always Taric to fall back on.\r\n\r\n{{champion:43}} ","replies":[{"poster":"You Pawn","date":"2018-06-13T02:11:27.823+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Earth to RITO Durrrr.

Oh and you will no doubt nerf the tanks CD'S next patch so being Supp will no longer be useful or needed.\r\n\r\nSHIELD - We are there to protect our team mates but you want to let us get abused even more because our Shield is has less duration.\r\n\r\nHEALTH - Omg that's right we don't need health do we RITO, once again you guys drink or take to many drugs when you consider these nerfs or buffs.\r\n\r\nI know lets just make this easier. Just don't have items and bring back the Mastery and Rune systems but, with more of each.\r\n\r\nBonus - Then you don't have to worry about screwing the items and the game further and you wont have to drink or take drugs to do stuff.\r\n\r\nReport Rito ffs >/> Once again do you even know wtf your doing what a bad Game Dev man just like the rest of them.\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slice n Dice","date":"2018-06-12T23:18:25.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are the {{champion:119}} bug fixes????

Maybe because most of them are details I don't pay much attention to.\n\nTalking about brand new content, Veigar had a double stacking laugh for a while.
