When partnered up with strangers, the chances are that at least one of them will troll you for some reason; that's not Riot's fault, it's an issue with all competitive online games. A randomised team will always be at a disadvantage against a pre-made team.\r\n\r\nSo, why not introduce a 1v1 queue alongside DQ?\r\n \r\nThat way players have  a way to pursue individual glory and improvement without having a trolls interfere with their experience, and a more constructing alternative to trolling if they are inclined to. This will give players a chance to improve and display their own individual skill, and having that outlet could improve their team experience in DQ because they will be more confident in their ability.  \r\n\r\nThis is all just my opinion though, it's your game Riot, I'm sure you'll do what you think is best for its development.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-15T03:22:13.411+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Trouble with a 1v1 queue is that then people would only play lane bullies in that game mode, and it wouldn't be the utopia that you think. it would just be an unhealthy game mode. League needs more than one player per team so that games can have diversity. Why else do you think we have 130 champions now? Because Riot wants us to have game diversity. The whole idea of League is to work together as a team to take down your opponents, not individual power. While individual power can sometimes determine a game's outcome, it is often not the deciding factor. Generally, it is the macro-play (team-fight/objective timing) rather than the micro-play (placement in skirmishes, csing, etc) that wins games, and macro-play is all about the team, not the individual. Without your team, you couldn't possibly win. Only once you play with a group of people, and actually make connections with them, to see through the screen and past the character, and realise that there is another person there, can you truly win. Because life isn't about the small victories and losses, it's about winning overall.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-15T03:22:40.027+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That got really deep towards the end sorry guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Mrs Buvelle ","date":"2016-04-15T08:57:39.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah that was cool <3","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-04-30T19:45:47.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That moment when the apology has almost as many likes as the deed. :O","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"pvtmatchsticks","date":"2016-04-15T13:38:19.118+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't say that playing with friends is more fun then playing alone.

It cannot be denied, the people who get treated like utter trash by the supposed \"superior\" players get banned more than the \"superior\" players trashing that person until they retaliate, then they take their premade party on to report and ban that person, a number of times I have witnessed this is unreal, and a number of times the people who caused it get off the hook scot-free, only twice have I ever witnessed a rightful ban. \r\n\r\nPeople just get up and go, around season 4 when you went from focusing on players to trying to make it super competitive, is when this started, about a year later, people started realising and leaving, you focus too much on competitive play and not enough on casual play, this \"competitive play\" is mostly the reason people are so god damn toxic in this game. and that's a fact! \r\n\r\nAnyone who played at the release of this game could not possibly disagree that this game is a former shell of its self.\r\n\r\nThe vision is a lie.

A game is meant to be fun! Not a pit of cursing, which is what forcing such heavy competition unto the game caused. The sandbox is a step away from this apocalyptic paradox you have caused yourself, but trying to force more competition into the game, might as well remove all modes except for ranked. Urf is the only mode I have seen since this nightmare you brought unto your own game where no one cares about if you stuff up, it is the only mode where people are not competitive cussing bags of trash.\r\n\r\nEver since this game started to live up to your standards of \"competitive play\" it has just declined in its experience.\r\n\r\n**TDLR:** your vision of \"competitiveness\" is what has caused this game to fall from its once glorious state, into a cess-pit of toxicity, trying to make the game competitive is a leading issue in the problem you most want to \"resolve\". \r\n\r\nYou wanted a competitive game, and so you got it, a competitive and toxic game.","replies":[{"poster":"Derpy McMuffins","date":"2016-04-15T14:03:58.135+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't agree with all of that, but I agree normals shouldn't be (overly) competitive -- more like a \"friendly\" in any other sport.
