You have now taken a ramp up champion (Q passive) and turned her into a champ that is never going to want to be anywhere near a fight for fear of getting 100-0 when defensive summoners are down. Now don't get me wrong, I think a nerf to it is needed, because yes, it isn't meant to be a point blank ability, but those numbers, that's not a nerf, that's death to ever using the ability unless you are attempting a mid-long range snipe, so if this ability is going to stand at having such a massive damage reduction at close range, then this needs to be done to the other global ultimates too, like Ashe's and Ezreal's. Because as far as I understand, the only range reduction to Ashe's ult isn't damage, its stun duration. And Ez's is only reduced by how many champs it passes through?
