If you're not warding, you're not doing your role as a support. if you're KDA is low, you have the wrong type of support for your team composition, or engaging when you should be peeling, etc.\n\nWhat I hate about the grading system is it doesn't take into account fed lane overflow. Can have a perfect kda for 20 minutes, but when that fed top laner starts getting around the map it drops to 3 or 1 or something. As a support you notice you could go top with jg and help pull it back a bit after 2 kills maybe,  but that requires coordinated efforts that you just don't get in solo queue, and if you do, the adc will play as though you are there and feed, then blame you for not being there.\n\nIt's a hard life, but ya gotta suck it up sometimes. Not to mention that even as a support, it takes the champ you are playing and incorporates CS. So if you're playing a morg or karma etc, which can also mid or top with some tank support options, your grade is less, because you have no CS.\n\nIf you're the support role, CS should never be a factor in your grade.\n\nThat said had a fun darius game as support yesterday, went 1 1 3 with only 37 CS and got an A so....","replies":[{"poster":"shadowblade299","date":"2017-11-15T06:46:46.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to buy sightstone and my adc flames me for not shielding and then if i buy supp items (eg locket) they flame me for not warding...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nitzi8","date":"2017-09-27T01:31:32.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please have your previously used runes/masteries load when you choose a champ. \r\nAlso in Normals please have a function to select a position in!
