Picking up EU West soloqueue salters does not give a great impression for this team, who retained their solid jungle, mid and support players. Similar to last season, if the opposition can find ways to shut down Looch (or if he gets himself self-banned by Riot again) then there will be no coming back. Should finish bottom half once again.\n\n**The CHIEFS ESPORTS CLUB:** This is the interesting team for me. After losing three core players, a lot of people will think well they are donezo. But I think this team will surprise viewers. Babip finally gets a chance in the OPL when he should have been given one by rivals Legacy, and Destiny is probably the best support in the competition now that EGym has retired. The wily Frank Li has picked up the superb Ry0ma to take Swiffer's place, and I think he will manage just fine considering his good performances last season at SIN. Expect to see this team in the grand final.\n\n**DIRE WOLVES:** A couple of changes here and Dire Wolves are slightly weakened, but will it make a difference? With Phantiks leaving the team entirely to take up a coaching role on Chiefs, i think it will. It will be up to Shernfire to control things, now that top lane is not so much a determining factor in the current meta. Will the young acquisitions hold up to their reputations? Only if they continue to improve (let's buy some control wards, Cupcake!). Top 3 team for sure, but will they win the split? It's hard to say, I'm going to go with no.\n\n**AVANT GAMING:** Another fresh look team with some truly young talent, this team has the potential to surprise. For the first time, jungler OnIy will get some solid laners to work with, Blinky was much improved in 2017, so it all comes down to whether Frae has the mechanics to match it with the best. We all know that he has a solid macro understanding, and if Jayke can help out with the shotcalling, this team has potential. Top laner Pabu will need to avoid wasting time on social media and trolling low elo scrubs on twitch.tv during broadcasts, and instead focus on his role and macro play (check LS for a load of top lane VOD reviews). If he can do that, he might be able to remove the moniker \"dumb as bricks\" and actually develop into a superstar.\n\nOverall Predictions:\n\nChiefs 1st\nDire Wolves 2nd\nOrder 3rd\nAvant 4th\nLegacy 5th\nSin 6th\nBombers 7th\nTectonic last","replies":[]}]}
