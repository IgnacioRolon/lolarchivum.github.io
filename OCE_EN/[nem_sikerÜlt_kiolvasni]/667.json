But about the first streaming today. It went for two hours with around a total of 17 minutes of game time. I know with the stream today there were some technical difficulties,  but what will happen will they have a rematch? I see that as completely unfair as that 1 single game can make a difference throughout the round robin. And what about the audience I personally feel everyone was disappointed, angry, frustrated will there be any compensation for this? Anyway I was enjoying that game. (Chiefs were winning) #WeAreChiefs #IAMOCE. Thanks anyway not trying to be negative just was so pumped for the Chiefs and the tournament. :\\ ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Abela","date":"2015-08-26T06:07:53.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What chance do the Chiefs have?

BKT looked great in group stages but DTFM were out classed. Since then the Japanese team has improved - Kazu is on the line up full time currently and he is there brains. Adding Yutapon to the top lane gives them a mechanical top and Ceros / Rokenia are really solid carries, I think they will show they are on the right track but I don't know if they are there. The Bangkok Titans still look solid - G4 and 007x are both dangerous players. Dark Passage however will be the big threat the Turkish team looks amazing and I cant wait to see how OCE stands up.\r\n\r\nAre they the favourites, probably not, but as far as chances go, this is our best shot to make worlds. As far as Oceanic teams go The Chiefs this year have proven they are our best shot to be able to come out on top.","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2015-08-26T07:42:10.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think if the cheifs perform above and beyond what we would expect from them they can make it to worlds but i dont think they have the confidence to go up against fnatic and skt","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-08-26T07:28:07.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not going to lie here: it's not going to be easy.
