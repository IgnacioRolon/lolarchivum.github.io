Showing off the preview of how it's supposed to look on release is nice and all, but it's worth nothing when the system that promised meaningful tasks with some reward is used solely for events which all boil down to selling more new stuff to the players. The mission system was made to give players an incentive to play for a reason other than getting a higher rank, and instead it's only used to either promote another one of money-making events, when the original promise has not even been met yet. I really feel like the only reason that mission system was released in such raw state is because whoever was working on it had the deadline until VS event launch, so it was released anyway. At the moment it's not fulfilling any promises given to the players before it's release, and I can only pray that this will change.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-28T01:22:59.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What sort of missions were you looking forward to?

Even the most basic things, like playing a certain role or scoring an objective would be welcome. We did see some of it during the VS event, but it all went away with it, and even then there were many possibilities that were not utilised. If your question is how would I like it to be setup, there could be a basic rotation of daily missions with small IP or key shard rewards, with a number of weekly ones with higher requirements and better rewards. So many other games have done this, and it's a rather effective system that benefits both, players who don't have much time to invest into the game on a daily basis and more hardcore League players too. Honestly, this seems like a rather simple solution, and I'm surprised that Riot didn't go through with something similar.","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2017-07-28T06:41:24.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe I'm going a little overboard with rewards for the missions, but getting like a guaranteed key or some essence per week shouldn't throw off the balance, since people still have to invest time into getting those bonuses.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Crowned Jungler","date":"2017-07-28T04:06:20.338+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"MLN","date":"2017-07-28T13:17:45.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just joined!

Same thing you said applies to every champion that has some sort of a following and people who main the champ. But he could really use one of the mini-reworks Riot has been handing out recently, just because for any regular player he is too risky of a bet to play regularly without learning the ins and outs of the champion and doesn't seem worth to pump tons of hours into mastering him, when there are so many midlaners who are just straight up stronger in normal play than him.
