Why is Lulu's Polymorph still in the game?\r\n3. Why are shields still as good as they are? (perhaps shorten their duration and amount so those supports require some skill to play)\r\n4. Why are turrets still so easy to take? (increase their armour to prolong laning phase)\r\n5. Why is TP still so strong? (nerf it in a way that we see top laners prioritising ignite instead)\r\n6. Why do champs like J4, WW, Skarner (bruiser junglers) still have to go Cinderhulk-Tabis-Bramble Vest and not Warrior-Mobis-Dirk in most games?\r\n7. Why is % health damage still a thing?\r\n8.
