They have never really cared for low ELO, now that they are sticking permanently with the dynamic queue and the team rewards, along with no change as to how easy it is to get into ranked, they are pretty much forcing players to either get queued with bad players, or make a team.\r\n\r\nI seen a post a couple of days ago that someone with a level 28 account was asking for advice, for enough as he is only level 28, he has only been playing for a few weeks, maybe months at best. 2 more levels and all he has to do from there is purchase the minimum required champions and head straight into ranked, no questions asked, no test to show he is capable of actually performing in ranked, or performing at all, and Riot just lets them join the 'highest skill' level queue like it is nothing.\r\n\r\nI get why you are doing this, your high ranked players stream, join your competitive competitions and generally get more players joining and therefore more of an income which you need, but eventually all the players who get stuck in low ELO long enough will just end up leaving and there will be no one left to join your game and spend money, unless that is your plan, get as many new players as you can join to spend as much money as they can as soon as possible and not plan on having them stick around.\r\n\r\nYou quoted above **_\"We know the dynamic ranked experience has been painful for the highest skilled players for the last few months. We remain focused on improving it and agree the current state is unacceptable.\"_**. From what I read on your post, there is almost no mention about how it is for low ELO players.\r\n\r\n_**High MMR adjustments\r\nHigh MMR queue times\r\nSolos, duos, and trios battle a five-player premade**_\r\n\r\nThose are not the issues, if you are good enough to play at high ranked, almost all the players at high ranked should be able to play well together, whether regardless of premades or solo, or anything in between.\r\n\r\nThe main issue we are facing is not high ranked, it is low ranked and how matchmaking matches your MMR. That is if your personal MMR is 1000 and you join a 4 man premade, your team mate will be MMR let's say 1500 and in the extreme case if you get matched against 5 solo players, they will also be 1500 MMR. In a 1v1 situation the 4 man premade on average will have ZERO chance to win. The problem here is that the first 10 minutes or so IS 1v1 or 2v2 with at least one roamer.\r\n\r\nI have matched against premades before, completely smashed their mid or top laner like they were nothing but bots and by the time the team fighting starts or on of their team was able to roam, it was too late. Most notably I have been Nasus top and around the 15 minute mark pushing second tower with 4 enemy players _trying_ to defend, and losing. The enemy top laners MMR was that much lower than mine that in lane, in a 1v1 fight, they stood NO CHANCE and by the time the rest of the team tried to defend, I was able to hold of 4 of them at once. Whether I got kills or or took towers is not an issue, the fact I held 4 of them in one lane allowed my team mates to have a virtual 4v1 situation, therefore taking free CS and towers in the other lanes.\r\n\r\nThe same goes the other way, I have been matched with premades and they fall in much the same way. 2 games ago I had a premade mid/ADC/support. My top lane opponent was 6/0 while I was 1/2 and apparently it was all my fault she got fed and the reason we lost our game, nothing mentioned about our premade bot lane going a combined 2/16 for the game. Or the best one ever, getting matched with a 4 man premade. I got some 40 kills, they got 5 combined and were well and truly out of their league, I got the same loss and same LP loss that they did.\r\n\r\nEven a simply 2 man premade in a match with 8 solo players will stand that much less chance to win in ANY queue at any skill level or rank, but more so at low level given that players down the dumps don't play as aggressively, roam as early or care as much as they do at top ranks, nor are they able to even defend as well and therefore when players do start to roam, it is too late.\r\n\r\nLast game I played, SIX MINUTES into the game I noted we are going to lose, 8 minutes in we already lost the first bot lane tower, 4 minutes later with the enemy ADC in the top lane, we lost that tower, and that was all she wrote. In that game the enemy mid and top were premade, our bot and jungle were premade. I was hard countered top Nasus Vs. Panth, yet if not for Ashe I would have won my lane. Our bot lane asked in champ select \"Can I go top?\" some 5 seconds into champ select, and failed in game. A premade/solo (and the ADC being the important role in bot lane), vs. 2 solo players, who did you think would win that lane? The 2 solo players, their own personal MMR would have been higher than the solo/premade player and it was evident by them losing the tower only 8 minutes in.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - There needs to be a change to MM/MMR at lower ranks up to a point. There needs to be some data collected and some testing done to prove what I am about to say.\r\n\r\nUp to a point in ranked, the MMR needs to be matched SOLO VS. SOLO, regardless of whether the player is premade or not, it needs to take YOUR OWN MMR and match against other players WITH THE SAME SOLO MMR. Since you don't want to put the solo queue back in, you need to stop boosting premades MMR at low rank and just let them fight. Quite a fair few low ranked players only join teams with the assumption that they will win easier, or have only just joined a team and don't actually know how to play well together to be able to benefit from being in a team and therefore, simply get matched against players whose are able to win in the critical lane phase that much easier that no matter how well you group after that, it is too late.","replies":[{"poster":"Nuff Nuff","date":"2016-06-01T04:28:03.172+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, before you starting having shots at riot i believe you should look at your recent games, look at what the meta is and go from there\r\nrather than:\r\n1) blaming your team mates because of the possibilities of the dynamic que and because your premade team lost due to role selection.\r\n2) looking towards whats meta and what youre building and building against the team youre versing rather than building the same items (ive looked at your history)\r\n3) blaming riots MMR/and match making system, and people who get into rank straight up regardless of skill level is a thing solo que players or players of ranked have been have dealing with for years.\r\npersonally for me who started off in the same league as you (S4) to now climbing to (Plat4) due to looking at the meta and dealing with teams based on builds i believe that is a way to progress rather than complaining on a forum.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Laidex","date":"2016-05-31T23:27:56.954+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo! \r\nFor high ELO games, you mentioned that you would try to tune back the priority on role selection, possibly even giving some players a third role they didn't chose.\r\n\r\nI wonder how this will affect LCS players, or challenger players. They have quiet literally no interest in playing any other role than their main role, and the only place for them to practice ingame mechanics is dynamic queue.\r\n\r\nSo summing up I feel like being more lenient on roles might be bad for the top tier of competitive players.\r\n\r\nP.S.: I think it's great that you share what is going on inside Riot's decision making.

Due to the nature of high mmr (being the top <1% of players) there will always be way fewer players there compared to the rest of the mmr levels.\r\n\r\nWhen we added Role selection, this added another layer that matchmaking had to take into account before finding the right game for players. Right now it needs to do 3 things\r\n\r\n1) Find a fair match, in terms of overall MMR\r\n2) AND have players on one of 2 roles they picked\r\n3) AND have players in similar group numbers\r\nThe longer the queue time went on 1) and 3) would get worse and worse. Matches would get less fair in terms of MMR spread and groups would not be similar.\r\n\r\nThis compounded with the low population at high MMR means two things happen;\r\n\r\n1) Queue times are significantly higher\r\n2) groups of 1-3 vs groups of 5 happen more frequently\r\n\r\n\"1 in 1000 from bronze to plat compared to 1 in 150 from Diamond +\"\r\n\r\n\"We’re going to intentionally make a trade-off here: Scale back on guaranteeing specific roles in order to better ensure high quality matches get made in a reasonable amount of time.\"\r\n\r\nSo TL;DR is High MMR players have been complaining a long time about high queue times. We are putting in Auto fill mode which removes some control they have over their role select to ensure they get fair matches in shorter times.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-01T11:30:16.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Awww will you look at that, Riot are saying something on probably the ONLY post here of someone who said they like the new queues, and now I have a chance to reply to a Rioter, which will no doubt either be deleted or ignored.\n\nFirst, let me rant, than I will be nice and explain.\n\nYOUR DYNAMIC QUEUE SUCKS HARDER THAN A HOOKER ON CRACK! In ALL the previous seasons I have played, NEVER EVER have I had games that are so bad, never have I had issues where I feel the need to come here after ALMOST EVERY GAME and post some nonsensical crap to try and get my point across, the dynamic queue DOES NOT WORK! And looking at all the posts here, most of the players feel the same way.\n\nI have been stating since the start of S6, this queue system is being rubbish, will not and is not working and you must, yes, MUST implement a way to allow players to gain and lose LP based on YOUR OWN PERSONAL GAME, give players a real fucking incentive to actually play ranked, to play this game and to actually try to win rather than doing what I do. I no longer play for real after a certain point in the game, I just fuck about whether I am going to win or lose, I see the game is over one way or another and so far, EVERY SINGLE GAME I have played in S6 since my first 10 games I have called each and every single one of them as to who is going to win and got it right.\n\nMost recently I almost pulled a Nasus split push, took down 2 whole lanes and both nexus towers on my own and got within 2 hits of the nexus, well, 2 Nasus hits. When one of my team tried the same approach, they got as close as the inhibitor and died miserably. As close as I got to winning that game, I was still right from the very beginning, we will lose and we did.\n\nOK, rant over, let me try and be nice.\n\nOut of all honesty that I can possibly muster for this game, I will be 100% in saying this season is by FAR worse than every other season I have played. I spend more time on these boards posting than I do even playing. I have previously made it to Gold and better with nothing more than Teemo top lane, I finished that season on Gold.\n\nYour old system was a little better than this system, but I have noted in the past that NO system that implements a chess like MMR rating will ever work 100% when there is more than one player on each team, it just cannot happen, ever. Mathematically there is no way of doing it, trust me on that, please. I may sound crazy, but when it comes to numbers, I know what I am talking about.\n\nWhat you need to do, something I have suggested way in the past and something I keep posting now since the start of this season, the start of dynamic queue and the introduction of team rewards. You CANNOT give more rewards to premade players, you will only force players to make groups just to get those rewards and this is probably the reason you have the rewards, to force players to group, and than with the increased 'premade teams' you can use those stats to back yourselves and say it is all working and it only needs some fine tuning.\n\nI can almost guarantee you that without the team rewards you will have far less players grouping. I have never seen so many premades in this game, and the majority of them are bad. It used to be in the past, the team who had the better premade wins. Now it is whoever has the worst premade loses. I am not even the one who first said that, I am stealing it from someone else, and it is true, you get 3+1+1 vs. 3+1+1, whoever is the worst 3 man premade, loses the game.\n\n_**You MUST implement a system that gauges YOUR OWN PLAY and gives you an LP gain or loss based on that, not on whoever wins. **_It was a jackpot to begin with, now with the boosted MMR matches being more evident, you are only giving players worse games. Yes, you can have the same chance of getting a bad team than others, but lets face it and lets look deeper into it. What you need to research on is this: How many premade teams are winning when you premake a team more than a certain percentage?\n\nThat is, You get all the stats on premade teams, look at how many times the same players are premaking teams, let's say I premake a team with the same 8-10 players for over half my ranked games, how many wins do I have against someone who has only 'premade' a team with random players for most of their ranked games? You may be surprised and see that those who just randomly take whoever to premade vs. those who premade with the same players don't actually win anymore game, I know this as I have been through it, take some random dude who played one good game, than lose the next three and realise they only played that one good game when you bother to check on their history.\n\nI have played in ONE good premade team this season and only a handful over the time I have been playing. Since I don't have any real life friends who play this game, I cannot get into a rhythm with the same players and build some team skills, or get players who play the same way I do. You don't really have an option to find players who can play well with you.\n\nI take you back to my WoW days. You join a Guild, you find X number of players who you play well with who are on at the same times you are, and viola, you start to do well in both PVE and PVP, why, because you can talk to them regularly outside the instances and get to know them as people therefore making it more worthwhile to try and do well each and everything and go above and beyond for them, rather than, as someone said, see them as a commodity that you will only trade up when you find someone better.\n\nI had some 15 players on my friends list this season, that is down to none since most of those players were either not on when I was, never accepted an invite, or only played 1-2 roles / champions good a handful of times and overall made my gaming experience worse since I was in an MMR boosted premade team and when I went against someone who wasn't premade, they personally were at a higher MMR than I was, making life difficult.\n\nThe only time premades REALLY work is when it is 5v5, because the boosted MMR is, not really boosted since you are all premade. The moment you get one person singled out, game over. But I bring you to the attention of one, if not THE best game I have ever played. Some time ago I chose Yi jungle, got grouped with a 4 man premade, can't remember the enemy comp, but let me tell you they sucked BALLS. I got some 40+ kills and less deaths than all of my team, close to 1 million damage and 250K player damage, but still lost, why? The enemy team was better than the four I was playing with.\n\nI am thinking the old system took my personal ELO, matched with the 4 of them, averaged both teams ELO to be the same and I was personally that much better than the entire enemy team and smashed them, but because the other 4 on my team were that much lower ELO than the enemy were on a personal ELO that they just couldn't keep up and I couldn't virtually take on 5 players solo.\n\nAs I said being the third person to post on this earlier today:\n> Up to a point in ranked, the MMR needs to be matched SOLO VS. SOLO, regardless of whether the player is premade or not, it needs to take YOUR OWN MMR and match against other players WITH THE SAME SOLO MMR. Since you don't want to put the solo queue back in, you need to stop boosting premades MMR at low rank and just let them fight. Quite a fair few low ranked players only join teams with the assumption that they will win easier, or have only just joined a team and don't actually know how to play well together to be able to benefit from being in a team and therefore, simply get matched against players whose are able to win in the critical lane phase that much easier that no matter how well you group after that, it is too late.\n\nOr you implement this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jhxwn6yi-MgSEbO2F-J-rq5EWxZM8ujr4W3o3S36vgs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA system that allows players to gain and lose ELO based on their play. It gives those who can actually play a real chance to rank up and those who just tag along for the ride, to rank down, putting players where they personally belong. It also gives you a REAL reason to give 100% in each and every game, even those where 4 of your team rage quit. Yes, that has happened to me. It was quite hilarious actually being in a real 1v5 match. But for that what did I get? The same as the rest of my team, the same LP lose that the 4 quitters got. You tell me, how is that fair?\n\nI can go through each and every game in my list and tell you exactly why I built the way I built, why I got the score I got, actually I will answer that for you now, it is almost the same answer each time. I build to counter my lane to give me an advantage, allow me to farm more, get more kills, win my lane, STOP MY OPPONENT and therefore give my team the best possible chance to win, but when my team fail, like losing towers under 10 minutes, or feeding hard, I try to build what we are missing. That is, if the ADC is rubbish, I start to build more damage to try and compensate for them not doing any. But I can still go through each game and tell you WHY I did what I did in that particular game and why we lost and prove to you that in most of them it was not anything I done to make us lose.\n\nI will give you one example on my last game. Our designated 'mid' decided to take jungle and screw over our actual jungle who had to take mid or else, we could try 2 jungle and no mid, it may have been better than what was to come. Bot lane had a Garen 'Support' who ended up taking CS and A> Built no boots and B> played like he was a fully farmed top laner. 99% of his games are Garen, Trynd, Renekton or Xin and this was his FIRST ranked game, about 130 for me. Just more proof that players join ranked for shits and giggles with no real understanding or enough skill to play ranked. To top it off, he had previous games with someone of the name LCD****, in this game he was grouped first time I can see with someone named LCD****, same first 3 initials. You know what that means? I know you do.\n\nI am out of characters here, you know what I mean with the above, I know you do, but you all refuse to listen.

From my experience I believe that if you guys are using ML algos and can't come up with a solution then optimizing and end corrections ain't gonna solve it either, maybe fix it a little (10-20%, like putting a band aid). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, here is a new idea.

Consider each player currently in queue as a vector of (role, tier, toxicity). \r\n2. Show players to view the universe of players in queue and vote for who they want to select for their team.\r\n3. Each vector has a \"time score\" associated with it, which means if i vote for 4 players with high skill, and exact roles which I don't want to take, then I will also be able to visually see how much time each player will add to my queue time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a example of it. Say I am a (Plat 1, Mid, Non toxic) player. When i queue, Riot shows me what are the available number of vectors (basically, the summarized view of all 'in-queue' players) based of the 3 dimensions above. So if i am feeling in a competitive mood, i will select the players sitting on the higher end of the distribution KNOWING the amount of time it will add to queue time. Similarly,since the number of players of my vector (Plat 1, Mid, Non toxic) will be very few in number, the \"time score\" associated with selecting me for a game will be quite high as well.\r\n\r\nBut, if i just wanna play for fun, don't care about role / toxicity / tier much, then i will select players who are ok with any role,are potential toxic, 1-2 tiers below me etc.\r\n\r\nJust to add, a premade of 2, 3 will be considered as a single vector as well.\r\n\r\n_**This type of model will allow the Player to VOTE for their own team while choosing whether they care about Skill Or Toxicity Or Role, or any of the above 3 in any subset size AND keeping in mind the queue time tradeoff they have to make for a better experience.**_\r\n\r\nI will enjoy having a brainstorming session with someone from your team who sees value in such a system, just to refine the idea and make it more transparent.

Minutes 5+: System continues looking for other groups of similar MMR, but makes them eligible to to be put into games against teams of higher MMR solo/duo players.\r\n\r\nThe 'protection' part is if the latter occurs: if the premade was put against a team of solo/duo players and wins, for their next game put them against even higher MMR solo/duo players. You are doing this already, but I think it should be raised exponentially until they lose (basically, it's a hidden 'premade' MMR). The goal here is to ensure players in premades lose 50% and win 50% of their games either because they're against equal MMR premades or because they're against exponentially-increasing MMR solo/duo players. The premade MMR need only be very temporary; 24 hours is enough to accommodate team membership changes (one player drops, another is added, but the premade still faces much higher MMR duo/solo opponents on that night if one or more members has a high premade MMR), but not so long as to prevent playing with one group of friends one night and another on another night.\r\n\r\nThis might not be very good consolation to the solo/duo players that get stomped until the premade MMR hits a decent place though, so I think solo/duo players that just lost to a premade should have a significantly reduced chance of coming up against premade teams the immediate game following (I'd go so far as to say they will never be queued against pre-mades two games in a row, and that doesn't seem unreasonable). Like the premade MMR, you don't want this to be a particularly long-lasting effect; the point is to encourage players to \"get back on the horse\" and have another game knowing that they're highly unlikely to be stomped in the next one. These players should also be prioritised in the queue system over players who have not been up against premades -- that is, their next game should start really quickly for preference, so that bad taste of defeat is gone quickly.\r\n\r\nNote: at low MMR, solo/duo players *may* be put against premades for their first game, and there's no window where they can't be put against premades; you don't want people to game the system by dodging at a set time.\r\n\r\n**High MMR**\r\n\r\nSolo queuers do what they do now; choose two roles and, as above, you can reward those who choose under-subscribed roles or who get their secondary role choice.\r\n\r\nQueueing duo, each person selects two roles they're willing to play, but those roles should not be in conflict (that is, a duo team needs four total roles -- two primary, two secondary, none in conflict). This gives your matchmaking system the widest option to get these players into a game and you can still reward players who choose under-subscribed roles or who get their secondary role choice when brought into a group (as above).\r\n\r\nQueuing as a 3-man or 4-man, each player should have to select **one** role (no secondary) that does not conflict with others on the team. Then, the team should press a 'Looking for members' button that builds a 'party premade' *before* matchmaking commences; that is, the matchmaking system looks for solo/duo players to fill those slots. The party premade system allows players to talk strategy, share voice chat info etc before actually being thrown into champion select. This encourages the group leaders (the 3-man or 4-man that pulled the group together) to coordinate with the 'fill' player(s) knowing that they may be up against 5-man premade groups. It also gives the solo/duo players who have joined the larger group advanced notice what role they've been given and, if it's their second choice, a chance to discuss their strengths and weaknesses (they may be able to swap roles if the group is willing or, if not, they will have gone in with full knowledge).\r\n\r\nQueuing as a 5-man premade is obviously straightforward as it is now; they've built together on the party screen anyway.\r\n\r\nImportantly, in the matchmaking scenarios below, the preference is to make games from 5-mans, then party premades (3/1/1, 3/2, 4/1), then solo/duo players; the idea is to foster a higher level of competitive play from high MMR individuals.\r\n\r\n**Matchmaking for high MMR solo/duo players**\r\n\r\nMinutes 0-5 after pressing 'Play': System looks for 3-man or 4-man groups that are 'Looking for members' of around the same MMR (each minute progressively widens the MMR). System also starts pooling solo/duo players into teams of 5 and matches them against other teams made up of solo/duo players -- a game will launch if the latter is found while waiting on the former.\r\n\r\nMinutes 5-10: System continues looking for valid 3-man/4-man groups, but also pools solo/duo players into teams of 5 and makes them eligible to be put into games against 5-man groups that were initially formed through the party screen (i.e. 3/1/1, 3/2 or 4/1). Note: the 'Premade protection' system above would be in effect here.\r\n\r\nMinutes 10+: System continues looking for valid 3-man/4-man groups, but also pools solo/duo players into teams of 5 and makes them eligible to be put into games against 5-man premade groups (worst case scenario). Note: the 'Premade protection' system above would be in effect here.\r\n\r\n**Matchmaking for high MMR 3-man and 4-man groups**\r\n\r\nNo time limit: System places these groups in 'Looking for members' status (MMR window progressively widens the longer it goes on). The longer a group is in queue, the higher its priority with pulling solo/duo players into the party (i.e. a 3-man group that has been in queue for 5mins has a higher priority to pull a solo player in that has a valid MMR, even if there was another 3-man group waiting that has a closer MMR to the solo player). Once the party is full and ready (after talking strategy, champions, voice chat, whatever), only then can the party leader press 'Play'.\r\n\r\nMinutes 0-5: System looks for 5-man groups of similar MMR regardless of if they were established through the party (3/1/1, 3/2, 4/1) or 5-man premades (MMR window progressively widens).\r\n\r\nMinutes 5+: System continues looking for 5-man groups, but makes this group eligible to be placed against teams comprised of solo/duo teams (who have been queueing for 5 minutes or more, as above).\r\n\r\n**Matchmaking for high MMR 5-man premades**\r\n\r\nMinutes 0-10: System looks for 5-man groups of similar MMR regardless of if they were established through the party (3/1/1, 3/2, 4/1) or 5-man premades (MMR window progressively widens).\r\n\r\nMinutes 10+: System continues looking for 5-man groups (continuing to widen the MMR window), but makes this group eligible to be placed against teams comprised of solo/duo teams (who have been queueing for 10 minutes or more, as above).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bluegills","date":"2016-06-01T15:46:25.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yay more 5 man premade ranked players against solo players.\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}]}
