As someone who has mained many champs including xin this is a gigantic nerf. Just to name a few things: his heal is a shadow of its former self till around lvl 16, his crit every 3rd auto is nerfed massively, no armour shred, q damage down most stages of the game by a tonne, e flat out nerfed 80 damage, as buff moved onto e meaning he needs to use only gap closer to proc it, slow on e is now 0.5 from 2 seconds, shitty w ability, do i need to go on. Hides a gigantic nerf inside a \"rework\" gg riot on destroying another champion that didnt have pro play or insane win rates they just bored.","replies":[{"poster":"Just The Cook","date":"2017-09-26T07:31:04.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, Xin hasn't been in the best place for awhile now and this has done the opposite of helping him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"santaclawzer","date":"2017-09-29T00:40:24.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look man ive never been upset about any reworks and part of that is cause i dont think ive ever mained a champ pre rework BUT this wasnt designed to buff xin zhao. This was meant to increase his complexity by a slight bit and stop him being a champ with barely 2 real ability's. Your probs right this is a nerf and its gonna be cleaned up if it is, but understand that your champs in the proccess of being made actually interesting to play with or against, cause at the moment xin is probably one of the most basic champs in the game.

The q is like 35 base (from 75) and 25% bonus ad from 20% ad. His w is like a 90% bonus ad scale TOTAL and the r is only 2 sec and the slow is like 15%, the e attckspeed maxes at 20% less.\r\n\r\nKnow what, never mind, his ult is screwed with guinsoo.
