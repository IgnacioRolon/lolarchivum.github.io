I don't really like urf much at all, but I'd prefer that over these modes, not to mention people are essentially begging for Doom Bots. Crystal Scar is a terrible map with only terrible game modes, I think it's time to erase the Dominion code Riot, or at least archive it forever. I'm loving the rotating queue, and I hope it never goes away, but I don't think many would complain or even notice if you never used Crystal Scar game modes again.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-07-12T01:30:09.501+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No Pls :(\r\n\r\nCrystal Scar maps are my favorite. They are the fastest, most action packed modes which make them League's hyperbolic time chambers when it comes to learning a champion's dueling/teamfight mechanics and positioning. I learned some of my best SR champs playing Dominion on NA.\r\nI find Urf rather dull because its just spammy gimmicks and no one really cares about the outcome, which is I suppose why others like it so much.\r\nDoom Bots I can get behind as a fun challenge of a mode, but it's length of engagement is limited once you can easily beat the max level bots.
