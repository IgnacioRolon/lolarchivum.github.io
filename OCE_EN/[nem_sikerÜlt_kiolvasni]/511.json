You are answering questions people have been wondering about for a long time. My Only complaint is that this is only once a week and you're answering like what. 3 questions? I feel like you could easily expand and just answer some questions that aren't as intensive, and can be answered with 1 paragraph as opposed to 8.

So why not have the ability, while in queue or something, to nominate a champion ban. That way, when the queue pops, you can remove some of the time spent picking bans. I know this isn't really a viable option as a lot of people like to counter ban and force certain picks in higher ELO but I thought I'd just throw it out there as an idea. Maybe 5 nominated bans then 3 real time counter pick bans when the cast gets real massive? I dunno, that's up for Riot to decide.\r\n\r\nAlso I was wondering if it would be possible for a slight change to dynamic queue? I'm talking about Primary and Secondary Roles. Some of us are fine with playing two roles but some of us don't really want to play more than one, or aren't too crash hot at lanes other than our main. Personally I'm a Top main and while I can play other lanes ok, I'd rather not risk my, or my teams, LP when playing a lane I'm not 100% certain with. I realise the meat of this issue has got something to do with queue time but to be honest, I would happily accept the ability to nominate only one lane I want to play and wait 20+ minutes so I can get the lane I'm good at or want to play. Even if you allowed people to still nominate two lanes but give us the option to nominate only one if we can only play one lane. It'll at least stop the people in Ranked who get into a game only to dodge because they didn't get their primary. Or say, \"Give me jungle!\"\r\n\r\nEither way. Thanks for taking time to read this and I hope my ideas at least come off as somewhat helpful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shira","date":"2016-05-27T08:27:10.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-05-31T10:06:00.090+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":13,"body":"when u fking fked staff members dunt answer to my emails i already feed up with yas shits, why 2 emails to match making team and nobody answered, why we have to team with the shits we reported and blocked tell me mother fkers","replies":[{"poster":"SSG Deadshot","date":"2016-06-03T03:06:19.890+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason they dont email you is because no matter how bad someone is no matter how much you hate someone they dont deserve to be cursed at like that the game eula states this when you update the game dude and it says that in the loading screen it's common sense and is just being respectful that there are younger people playing the game.
