The game doesn't need an execute like that, it's obscene.\r\n\r\nWhy add *more* lethality items? Don't assassins already dominate enough?\r\nI know flashy plays are all that matter, not skill, not planning, but at least *try* not to further alienate anyone who isn't a tank and/or assassin.\r\n\r\nYou've also officially killed off half the supports in the game too with this patch.\r\nWe won't have an ADC/support lane any more, we will end up with disgusting duo lanes between champions who were never meant to lane together.\r\n\r\nAlso, the new Thresh skins are terrible.\r\nThey don't look like Pulsefire skins, they look like a beta version of a Program skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkKnightAinz","date":"2019-11-20T11:53:57.525+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a support main I hate this.

A 20% health execute? Once its taken, there is no outplay potential, there is fight, then blow up before you can make an escape or play. \r\n\r\nEverybody here seems to agree, and not just agree but be completely overwhelmed by the stupidity of this entire patch.
