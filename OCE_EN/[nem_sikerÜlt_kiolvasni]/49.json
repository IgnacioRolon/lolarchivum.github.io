ADC's need a steraks shield so badly in a bursty meta.  Frozen mallet yasuo will suffer, but that's all for the greater good.\r\n\r\nWhat I cant work out is, why we think shojin isn't going to give us a blatantly overpowered permanent helicopter Jax, Alpha once per second Yi, and Riven with no CD on anything if she has anything to hit.  \r\n\r\nThe item seems to drive several skirmishers from decentish to broken.","replies":[{"poster":"freestyler1","date":"2019-02-06T23:02:11.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"blatantly overpowered Jax and Riven, this was more so the case with old ER buddy","replies":[{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-02-07T00:04:15.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old ER was less stat efficient for them, they really didnt want that mana, but they can use the HP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Techno","date":"2019-02-06T03:45:09.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essence reaver was already a thing and personally spear of shojin is a bit worse generally (better in certain matchups as it contains hp instead of mana and mana on hit)","replies":[{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-02-06T16:13:34.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but this will give the right champions far more CD reduction than old Essence reaver  did.  Admittedly at the cost of an ulti, but Jax can fairly freely ulti, and Yi tends to do so at the start of a fight anyway.  It would be a big sacrifice on Riven, but possibly worth it if it his someone, in order to play in urf mode for a while.\n\nRenekton is another fairly likely user, as he also wants to ult at the start of an engagement and has CDs that he really wants back, and fast.  Better on him(statwise) than old essence reaver at its peak.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"juzzykuzzy","date":"2019-02-06T07:21:23.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not gonna lie, what pissed me off is that they said Infinity Edge was \"updated\".
