Personally I think it's just going to bring back the hyper carry days because there are now so many champions available that have that hard peel and can work with a hyper carry. Be better to just implement the 5 bans from the start, so it forces teams to diversify as 3 picks before banning again still gives the teams their core for anything really. Jungle and bot lane will likely be the first lanes picked time after time, as picking a mid and top early gives way to much time for counter picks, This feels like a gimmick, a gimmick that is diverting attention from development of the client, the endless bugs and lack of returning features.
