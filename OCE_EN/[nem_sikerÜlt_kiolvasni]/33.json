In a 40 minute game you:\r\n- only placed 14 stealth wards, no vision wards.\r\n- only dealt 1145 damage.\r\n\r\nYour awesome K/D/A likely propped you up to an A grade, great job there. But I'd consider buying more vision granting items for your team (sightstone, vision wards) and if you try to apply a little more pressure in lane (land those Starcalls!) you should see a decent increase in your total damage output, and free up your bot lane carry to do more as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒáte","date":"2016-08-20T09:18:11.948+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA 14 STEALTH WARDS IN 40 MINUTES HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA","replies":[{"poster":"ƒáte","date":"2016-08-20T09:21:16.498+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry.

As such I personally don't see any problem with it being extended. _(I would much rather have a 15 minute banning phase, than play a 40 minute game against Yasuo/Zed/Vayne/Katarina etc etc.)_\r\n\r\nas for the extreme scenario of needing 11 champions to play (12 really if you include the enemy team's pick) i don't think this will be a problem at all.\r\n\r\nFirstly because most people gold and below (the majority of the player base) just have 1 champ that they play, and when that champ is banned, they rage and then go afk anyway. So it doesn't matter if you have 1 ban or 100., they still have no one else to play. and as for plat and above, they are much smarter than to ban 10 champs of the same role.\r\n\r\nSecondly because the chances of it happening are a million to one, and it is impractical to remove a feature that will help 99.9999% of players, just because theres a chance that 1 person in a million **might** have a bad time. \r\n\r\nThirdly, i don't even think that having your 10 main champs banned will even be a problem at all. Im a mid laner. Aurelion Sol, Taliyah, Azir, Karthus, Syndra, Anivia, Twisted Fate, Kassadin, Lissandra and Galio (my main 10) could all be banned and i could still have many many many options left open to me. And I'm just a silver player. The only people who will be affected by this are the people who only ever play the same champions over and over again, and those people are already problematic. \r\n\r\nFourthly, Its completely in your control Riot! if you dont want 10 mid laners banned, then consider taking Yasuo down a peg so he isn't banned all the time, or maybe Kat? or Zed? or one of the numerous other problem assassins? if 10 champs of the same role are being banned, its becasue theres a major problem with that role, so if you make sure than the champs and the roles are balanced... there shouldn't be any problems!\r\n\r\nas for needing more champions in order to play ranked; this is a good thing, the main reason for being stuck in bronze is that you jumped too early into ranked. needing more champs just increases the time before making that fatal mistake. (also 20 champs is a much nicer number than 16) ","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2016-08-19T07:38:29.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Props to you my friend, I could not agree more {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cucked by      S","date":"2016-08-21T13:34:21.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make some good points about the banning phase and tbh shifted my view on the 10 ban change (originally was against it), though I wouldn't say high most elo players have a huge champ pool. :P I one tricked Syndra from Bronze 3 to Plat 2 promos and I'm still going well.

My main and first issue would be more closely related to the **shen rework** than the runes themselves but ohwell. Energy runes are kind of overlooked. they are there and I've purchased many because when I played energy champs I wanted the ability to have an extra cast of an ability or 2 per fight and trade. Shen now is the only ninja or energy champion with 400 Energy, this makes Energy runes completely useless on him. Akali and zed you want damage output, kennen may have a use for extra energy, and lee has too much else to focus on. \r\nIt was especially useful and only useful for shen with 200 Energy to have increased energy pool or energy regen so that taunts weren't once per so many seconds out of battle casts. so if he leaves a battle with 0 energy, with 10energy /second (which with runes can only become like 13/second if you dedicate way too many runes) you get to cast his 180 energy dash 1 time per 18 seconds. considering the ability has a cooldown of like 6-9 seconds late game its kinda dumb. either adjust energy and energy costs and pool or modify the runes to either not exist or work at all.\r\n\r\nI Own 3 2% Spell vamp runes, kinda useless, kinda always were but you have been phasing out Spell vamp so if you count things that actually say the have spell vamp, you get MoM, Quints and 2 % on a mastery. kinda dumb imo.\r\n\r\ntime spent dead runes still exist, wtf is that. barely even significant enough to use them. spell vamp is  even more useful then that.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"3KWhisper","date":"2016-08-22T04:33:18.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls no changes to {{champion:55}} i mean unless her damage is in a shorter time period than 2.5 seconds im cool :P\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"dslxk","date":"2016-08-21T05:10:51.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i happen to have discussed this on boards before and decided 8 bans would be awesome.\r\n10 bans would be good too but i wonder what impact it would have in the long run. certain champs will be permanently banned every patch for sure.\r\ncan't wait","replies":[]},{"poster":"U Wotachu","date":"2016-08-21T00:47:25.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear Rito, (friendly player common terminology)\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you saying that on my other account, that I have had since season one.
