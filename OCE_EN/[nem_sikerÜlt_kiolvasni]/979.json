Just been playing the game lots.\r\n\r\nIn regards to rng, look up the different cheat sheet and champion chances of rolling so you can start to bet on  strategies instead of just doing it randomly.

Are you claiming your daily orbs?\r\nPretty fair time frame IMO. If they kept it open long enough for everyone including those who don't enjoy playing it or don't play it often at all to also claim _every_ reward it wouldn't be fair to those who do enjoy playing the game and completing each mission as they'd be stuck waiting longer for new ones.\r\nI'm sure you can still claim most of the earlier ones.

Adding in champion stats was a nice start, but now you need to add in what champion abilities are affected by what stats (i.e add a little physical/magic damage icon next to the damage value) and the ability to preview ability damage numbers (and maybe stats) before purchasing someone. \r\n\r\nYou should also be able to right click on items to see what they can build in to. You should not need outside sources or trial and error to understand what does what in the mode.
