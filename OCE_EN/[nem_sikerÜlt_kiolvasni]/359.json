Until they found the \"Meta\"Champs of URF... after that week, all I've seen are those Champions (Riven, Ez, Wu, Jax, Eve, Hec, Zed, Sona, Shaco if they aren't banned).. too many champs made it disappointing and to me, quite boring... A constant battle of trying to figure out new champions and seeing who could overcome who but nope, no one.\r\nYou'll are gonna complain and say \"Why not ban them\".. Well think about it. Main champs to ban, Eve, Shaco, Hec, Zed, Sona and whoever the last one would be (most likely a stupid ban). Then people like Riven, Wu, Jax, Nidalee, Ez, Morgana and Leblanc etc slip through EVERY GAME, making it repetitive. Maybe if riot made is 4 or even 5 bans per team, people would actually TRY new things for the WHOLE time URF is out.

I found myself wanting to have 5 or 7 bans so I could remove the flatly broken champs so I wouldn't have to worry about it when I wanted to try a NEW and SLIGHTLY LESS OP pick.

For example TF can wreck an ezreal just as long as they are good at picking the yellow card. In the norm jungle everyone plays the same people (Sejuani, Lee sin, J4) every game because its the META you complain about it getting boring because people found the META champs but the same thing happens in norms once the new patch META champs are found everyone who wants the best chance to win plays those main people. The thing is though people play the champions they find fun regardless and it doesn't mean you're gonna lose instantly. during urf I discovered AD blitzcrank and honestly it was so fun and I ended up out doing a Fed AP blitz. Just cause there are meta champs doesnt mean you cant win. Just like normals it depends on your team comp and how well you make decisions. urf was literally made as a fun joke that ended up being probably the best thing to happen to LoL in a long time. It is relaxing and fun regardless of whether you lose.

No i did not, and i agree, there are counter picks as i have said in my statements. yes, Normal games also have META Champions, and counters to those, as they have COOLDOWNS and not all the U.R.F buffs. And yes, U.R.F can be fun when playing new things, as you said yourself, AD Blitz, but every enemy team consists of those top 10-15 champions. There is a large difference between both Normal and U.R.F, U.R.F having low cooldowns, etc etc, and normals being more balanced, as no buff can necessarily make a champion strong and snowball in the early game, other than kills. I have those fun games, and i'm not saying that U.R.F is a bad game mode at all, i'm just stating the fact that people in the community are straying away from 'trying new things'and experimenting, i'm not at all blaming anyone or the game mode, just simply implying my thoughts.\r\nI'm glad you raised that as i didn't notify that in my above statement.\r\nHave a good one <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SantaClawz","date":"2015-04-12T12:18:59.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ur either forgetting Galio or somehow u don't think he is OP","replies":[{"poster":"Hope Devourer","date":"2015-04-14T09:57:55.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't list them all, but yes galio was another person who was quite OP During URF","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WarHogs","date":"2015-04-11T03:17:58.183+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"URF fridays or weekends would be fun :)","replies":[{"poster":"ActionPoohole","date":"2015-04-11T08:03:03.665+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"why even bother... just make it permanent?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-04-11T08:11:15.157+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"no don't make it permanent\r\nif anything should be permanent it should be doom bots","replies":[{"poster":"7 Year Old","date":"2015-04-11T09:31:12.116+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol wut?","replies":[{"poster":"FREE FUWUZID","date":"2015-04-11T10:38:07.853+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"NAH, make poro king permanent, because that was SOOOOOOO fun and i think that it was the VERY BEST GAMEMODE EVER!!!\r\n\r\n(sarcasm, incase u didnt figure it out)","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-04-12T00:44:38.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As if you didn't like poro King, I thought it was more fun than urf.

They said URF is like a chocolate, you have it as a treat every once in a while, and it tastes nice. But if you were to have it every day of your life, you would get sick of it and not eat it. URF is the same, it's fun for a while, but it's really taking away from the core aspect of League of Legends, the MOBA with team-play and strategy. Everyone hates Riot now for removing URF, but think of all the good things Riot does, like refunding the difference of RP if you bought a champion/skin full price and it goes on sale. Riot know how to run their company, so stop complaining about \"Wahhhhh(inset tear of the godess spam here) URF is gone, I'll quit League!\" Life goes on.
