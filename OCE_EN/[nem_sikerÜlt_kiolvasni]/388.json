","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-19T04:14:55.790+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a female, I can honestly say you're being way to sensitive about it. It's a video game. If a parent thinks or knows that their child will be influenced then talk to them about it, make sure they understand it's FANTASY. Because that's exactly what it is. The population of this game is largely 15+ and can think for themselves. If a child doesn't understand that it's fantasy they shouldn't be playing the game.\n\nBoob armour is inaccurate and impractical yes BUT it is an expectation because of a historical misconception, it is not sexualising to give them boob armour is is simply meeting an expectation of a trope, to argue that Sejuani/Leona are sexualised in any way just for that is honestly just bending the facts to fit your argument. It's like saying I'm sexualised just for HAVING two fat sacks attached to my chest. \n\nAnd I think you'll find that those were simply the champions he thought of off the top of his head rather than all he could find, because there are plenty more like {{champion:131}} {{champion:84}}{{champion:114}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:10}}. You also say to consider the 80 female champs but there aren't that many female champs, by my count there is only 42. Of that 42 only 31 are humanoid enough to even be considered sexualised. Of that 31 only 9 of those are arguably sexualised. Of that 9 only {{champion:22}}, {{champion:51}}, {{champion:21}} and {{champion:37}} are sexualised for no reason within the span of their lore. 4/127 does not make an argument, nor does 4/42 or even 9/42 make an argument.\n\nAnd it is less about sexualisation and more about setting unrealistic standards, which applies just as heavily to the male champions. How many guys do you know as muscle-y as {{champion:201}} or {{champion:86}}. There is an incredibly long list of MALE champions that are set to unrealistically high standards but you aren't going off about those. I'm as against sexism as the next person, but take your criticism where it matters and away from the fantasy, and try remembering that it's GENDER equality, not WOMAN equality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ScrubCloud","date":"2015-11-24T01:35:25.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut the hell up, who cares if their sexualised or not.
