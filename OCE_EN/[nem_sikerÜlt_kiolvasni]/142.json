I am a high school teacher inner city Melbourne and would love to set up an ongoing tournament within my school and against other schools. I am well aware of the logistical issues you would encounter within schools. However I do believe this is a great opportunity for Riot to build their player base from grass roots and also equip young gamers with the right attitude in regards to toxicity and how it is not welcomed. I would like to partner up with Riot and with their help hold tournaments or in an ideal situation a high school based LCS type program. I am happy to communicate with you directly with this as this is the quiet time of year and would be great to plan how we could do this in 2018.\r\n\r\nI forgot to mention I have partnered with Riot in the past to host high school based tournaments at a previous school with great success","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2017-11-03T01:41:01.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi scabboy, thanks for reaching out! The logistical issues you mention are not new to us, and we've managed to help a few schools in Victoria in this regard already :) We are happy to start the conversation and work together with you. With the support of teachers like yourself, we hope to drive the program forward and unlock this opportunity for more students across Australia, New Zealand, and eventually the world. \r\n\r\nI've just added you as a friend in-game, where we can exchange contacts.

(maybe get your rioters familiar with League terms, the rioter doing the workshop didn't know what inting (intentional feeding) was haha!)\r\n\r\n- The computer monitors were square, something I and many others weren't used to and the game felt a little weirder because of it. everything felt a little smooshed and a bit odd, although this is a minor complaint.\r\n\r\n- The location was great and having food stalls around made it a good place to sit and talk between rounds about what could be learned from the last game and other strategies. the location was also easily accessible, if you couldn't get there by car or bus there is a train station near by making it easier for people a little further away to get there no issue.\r\n\r\n- The Riot staff were very nice and welcomed all of us. they were all friendly and did their best to help where they could if someone was having technical difficulties. the Star Guardian Lux and Freljordian Taliyah cosplayers were nice too handing out how they described 'swag League merch' also offering a group picture.\r\n\r\nI hope this feedback helps with any future events with schools you guys do, i was there on the Friday so these issues may have not been the case on the Saturday, however i wouldn't know. I'm looking forward to see if next year this will be happening again, it would be a shame to stop it everyone had a great time. despite the criticisms i really enjoyed my time and thank you for doing this for us students, don't get to really do much things we want at our schools but you gave us this opportunity and we are thankful.\r\n\r\nThank you i hope this proves helpful!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2017-11-03T01:48:22.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback :) I'll pass it on to the team.
