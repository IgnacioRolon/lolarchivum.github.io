How can you expect anyone to agree with what you've done?\r\n\r\nGetting an S and an S+ on the old Attrox was much easier and much more enjoyable than trying to get good with his new mechanics. It's not satisfying or rewarding. I remember in the last Attrox game I ever played before his stupid changes I went 8/0 and got an S+ in a ranked game and made them surrender at 16 minutes. I will always hate this new Attrox and I guarantee you if there was a poll the community would overwhelmingly agree.

(safer game play, sounds like ADC surely). BUT with the ignite buffs i don't see TP nerf as balancing since tanks are mediocre right now (cc' champion coming back to meta tho). feels like Riots push to make this game more broadcast-able on tv (kills and teamfights early) to gain popularity because some thinks league is \"dying\". its not, it just hit it's middle-age, where players who want to be playing already is or they have quite due to the last 3 season (\"FUN\").\r\nmage changes? imo mage changes made them stronger, tankier and more reliable overall(more mana cooldown). perhaps they didn't want mid to be a perma \"shove n' roam\". (lane interaction for greater broadcast-bility)\r\naatrox...now thats the ONLY sad thing i see here. so many season in exile, finally back to meta for a good 2-3 patch (due to his decent/safe enough laning with heal and insane 2 item powerspike) make him a god of 1v1,1v2 and sometimes 1v3. boom, changed. you still have to take his winrate with a grain of salt since NO champion gets release with a positive winrate. would be a certain indication for broken-ness if there were. aatrox is oppressive early with his damage. it doesn't matter if he can land it, you are not suppose to. you are suppose to make you opponent know they CANNOT 1v1 trade with you due to the insane qqq damage. but im gonna say that old aatrox definitely was far superior in every EVERY aspect, lore and gameplay. now his a fool who says \"champion name+ bad joke+ come+ i kill u\"\r\nyes league if becoming simplified for the sake of wider audience. but it's what it needs. remember 88% of the player base is not lcs pros,(or in some cases a edgy adc main who cries on r/leagueoflegends everyday) they are you everyday average joes. i have not had such fun with the game since season 5 and im kind of glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"UNSTOPPABLE BTW","date":"2018-07-21T01:45:44.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what i will say about some of the issues you brought up:\r\nundo TP nerf; crippling a playstyle even when unnecessary.\r\n\r\nbring back aatrox; he has hit a balance breakthrough, minor nerf(to old aatrox) can see him viable and not broken nor garbage.\r\n\r\ncrit changes: right direction but overdone and awfully executed. make crit items 150 gold cheaper and 5% less crit so:\r\nadc WON'T be able to do the cancerous SHIV and EDGE build where they can either half health you with 1 auto or clear a wave with 1 auto.(and roam so early for a adc)\r\ninfinity edge will be able to double 25% crit to 50% and 50 to 100. this way adc won't spend gold on the 20% bonus crit chance they WONT utilize(conventionally anyways).(if they choose 30%+30% crit and double with a infinity edge.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xord","date":"2018-07-19T09:02:48.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd rather play Warcraft 3 than play LoL in its current state. banner removal was sad enough, but if that meta was something people enjoyed and disliked, then bring it back as a seperate game mode that people can devote themselves to. thats right, I'm talking about BMB. bring back Black Market Brawlers. make a 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1 gamemode where you can farm creeps for items and have them automatically upgrade into component items instead of opening a shop, this is the coliseum mode that people keep memeing about when they mention battle royale. you dont need 100 players in one server to play a battle royale.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UNSTOPPABLE BTW","date":"2018-07-21T01:06:00.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mages one shot everyone botlane.

Yes, he had top winning rate on top lane recently because Wukong main players figured out to do so, I recall you said you have a  rework plan on him and when is that going to happen? Riot if you want us to play Wukong as a Bruiser then rework his kit and give him sustainability and second damage source! You also nerf TP just because bot lane adcs were using it for farming. Do you even realize how important is TP to Wukong for farming, reinforcing and counter strike?
