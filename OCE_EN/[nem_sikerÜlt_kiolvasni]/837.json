Knowing when and how to use that crit was something imo that differentiated good ashe players from great ones.\r\n\r\nsigh and her Gold whoring build has gotten nerfed too XD","replies":[{"poster":"Phase Wolf","date":"2015-05-14T04:22:49.591+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh didn't realize that we hadn't evolved past the evolutionary stage that makes us realize that new doesn't mean bad. My mistake. better get back to sun bathing and hibernating like the reptilian beings we apparently are. Thanks for the reminder. P.S. This is a joke and clearly you're to stupid to understand that this rework is a good thing and that Ashe's old kit is completely out dated and shit house.

I for one am looking forward to this change that will make for exciting and gripping game play. still I would like to know the answer to my previous question(as if all champions that can cause frost could make for some brutal plays e.g. {{champion:20}} {{champion:22}} combo would make that lane combo for days).","replies":[{"poster":"Electrobuzz","date":"2015-05-14T04:59:00.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's better for her Q (basic attack slow enemies) is now her pasive","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Penny13","date":"2015-05-14T04:59:48.513+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One guaranteed crit, that's all her passive gave. Once you go to lane, you get literally ONE CRIT. Then nothing for over 5 min. \r\n\r\nThat's essentially a guaranteed crit with a bigger CD than anything in the game, unless you're willing to not auto attack. Maybe you get lucky and your opponent goes afk so you can super-freeze.\r\n\r\nHow about Team fights, are you gonna wait 3 sec to let your passive start building again? Do you ever have 10 sec to build up a crit mid-fight? \r\n\r\nWhat happens late game when you have so much crit that 1 in 4 AA crits is normal. That's one crit roughly every two seconds with potential for more. By time your passive was off cd you could have crit again anyway plus the damage you'd get from regular AA's. \r\n\r\nI get the sense that you didn't actually play old Ashe very well, since you seem to have no idea how her passive works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RadRed609","date":"2015-05-14T07:03:58.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really? because the thing i always hated about her was how useless her passive was at all stages of the game.\r\nIt gave you 1 crit every, 5 minites? or every time you returned to lane.\r\nUnless your opponent is super nice and freezes lane for you. which is unlikely if they know what they're doing.\r\nNot to mention how useless it is mid-late game when you're going to crit every couple of AAs anyway. Having the slow be your passive and a proper damage ability instead of the shitty passive is way better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Penny13","date":"2015-05-14T05:00:44.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously, the only time you were even ABLE to use it, was the first auto attack.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WinLaneGroupWin","date":"2015-05-14T07:32:04.797+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"im a faggot","replies":[]},{"poster":"DrMattie","date":"2015-05-14T07:50:14.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ashe was already an OP Slowing,stunning Bitch.
