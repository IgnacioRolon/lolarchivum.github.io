I feel like the problem with him is that his resource generation is too fast. With increase in damage from it on his abilities, I feel as if this is really too strong.

Not only is the damage produced from his abilities great, the heal is very strong as well.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure a Vladimir with only Spectre's cowl, Ruby crystal and boots of swiftness shouldn't be able to 100-0 an Azir at any stage of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Librain","date":"2016-05-05T08:32:37.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? I found him to be really weak :(\r\nSome of that was just getting to know the changes - finding out half-way through a turret dive that I can actually knock myself out of pool was a... painful discovery. \r\n\r\nThe damage on his Q, W, and R are all down. The healing on his Q is down. The new E costs more health than the old one, and I'm not sure it does more damage than a four-stack E used to, plus doesn't give him the healing boost any more. With so much less healing and no spellvamp, all his baseline sustain (not including the heal from his ult) comes from his Crimson Rush, which gives him a very, very narrow window to act in. \r\n\r\nIf you aren't in a position to take advantage of that 2 second window then you are actually in a significantly worse position, both damage and sustain-wise. It forces you to act when your cooldown wants you to act, and if you can't then you lose major damage and sustain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OSGproject","date":"2016-05-04T07:13:49.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm...
