I've lost so many fights because of my Garen spinning in place while getting hit by rangers. The fact that he moves while spinning on rare occasions makes it all that much more frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2019-07-25T09:29:47.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree I've been avoiding Garen because of this.

Spending time and money investing in a unit, only to have it taken down to a tier one is beyond frustrating. The item only works 'effectively' on attack speed champs and lowering it's chance only makes it non effective on anything but attack speed.\r\n..maybe it the shirk status wasn't permanent it might solve the current issue we all face? But I still vote to 'change it to something else.","replies":[{"poster":"MaSheen","date":"2019-07-26T13:51:52.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shrink*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CNU2i","date":"2019-07-24T23:20:09.602+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Badkid007","date":"2019-07-24T20:51:41.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mord buff {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Böngs","date":"2019-07-24T18:03:43.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gunslinging Gary's sitting in the corner smiling","replies":[]},{"poster":"S4MUEL","date":"2019-07-24T15:51:51.627+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"Can you please talk to the people who can do something about this and get them to cap the amount of damage you can do at the end of a round down to 20 because it feels really bad to be at 29 hp and then someone comes along and just takes you out of the game.
