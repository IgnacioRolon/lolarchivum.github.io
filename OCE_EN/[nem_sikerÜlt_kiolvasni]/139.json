Each game you win a slightly larger amount of xp than right now, but the first win of the day bonus is decreased to around 300xp to compensate.\r\n2. Each game you win essence, like what it used to be with IP. Only a small amount (25-50ish) is fine. This is being compensated by the leveling up bonuses so although it is smaller than what it used to be it still is enough to make an impact. \r\n3. When you level up you receive a blue essence amount that is comparable to 5 games worth in the old system, in addition to your champion shards. This means you are getting significant amounts of blue essence when you level up, and considering the amount of games it takes to level up this is an amount well earned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CheekY BastaRD","date":"2017-11-21T03:35:29.219+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"50 Blue Essence just isn't enough.

New champs get released literally (Kayn and Ornn for example) just over one months apart. So I'm really not sure about not giving BE after games. I'm sure there's a lot of other people who are in the same situation I am in. Hope you would listen to our voices and make some positive changes in the next few patches.
