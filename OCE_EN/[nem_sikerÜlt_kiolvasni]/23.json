After Lunar Revel I think, they made it so players don't have to pay to get missions and rewards. The last time I seen them introduce a pass was in Arcade Week, which I had a blast with it, but now the worlds pass is crazily rewarding. So much so, I wouldn't be at all satisfied without one.\n\nThe only thing I'll complain about is that after getting all the tokens I could possibly get, I'd need around a measly 40 to get a chroma..\nHowever people with the pass would have almost 10 weeks to get all the tokens they like, and probably get nearly all the rewards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sonan","date":"2018-09-28T07:38:04.492+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"360 tokens in total? A sad tease.. Why can't I just have a single chroma for all the time I would spend doing the missions? It's not like I get the border with it. If I wanted 40 tokens to get that chroma, then I would be able to get 10x the loot if I bought the pass to get that measly 40 tokens.\r\n\r\nWhen will token drops from hextech chests be enabled again?

I just received 5 tokens from the 'Go SKT!' mission (which is among the Week 1 missions), instead of the 10 tokens that were listed on here. This leads me to believe that Riot has mislabelled every mission 3rd from the top in Weeks 1-6, so what should happen is this:\r\n\r\n* ALL missions in Weeks 1-6 that you get the whole week to complete give 5 tokens\r\n* ALL missions in Weeks 1-6 that you get a short period (2-3 days) to complete give 10 tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lowers the total from 360 to 330, how BS this that? I actually liked the Odyssey event, but then they followed it up with this crap. NOT a happy camper. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}  ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-05T09:19:34.617+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The tokens listed should be correct.
