For example, if you have Ghost Poro and Ultimate Hunter, but decide to swap Ultimate Hunter for Taste for Blood, no matter what it will replace Ghost Poro first, forcing you to redo both runes.\r\n\r\nSolution: If you click a rune to re-open the rune-selection list, have the replacement fill the slot you clicked on. It's more intuitive and saves you the hassle of re-selecting both runes when you only wanted to change one, which in turn could let you squeak the change in before time runs out in champ select.\r\n\r\nOriginal post by Mystery Ninja on NA","replies":[]},{"poster":"islesofurth","date":"2018-08-31T03:21:14.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FFS RITO stop making champions look other champions when using certain skins.\r\nGankplank as Lucian & Ezreal as Talon......
