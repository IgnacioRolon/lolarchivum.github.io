I try the new client every now and then (mainly for practice tool) and hate the new client. The designers have gone way over board just like when they did the HUD and made it way less practical in order to make it look fancier.

Once the update hits worldwide, it unlocks some really cool level-ups in that Rioters can deliver features much faster - there's a [more in-depth FAQ about it all here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/230175788-League-Client-Update-FAQ)","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-27T00:39:56.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you want teh game to be less laggy or not, cuz this is what they are trying to do","replies":[]}]}]}
