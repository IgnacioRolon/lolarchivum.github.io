Give him mage 6 and Seraph's Embrace, not to mention a built-in Ocean 2 (with an easy in to Ocean 4), and he can delete the entire enemy team in no time flat--with the change of his star-level advantage, he can instantly delete units which used to be counters, e.g. instantly deleting crystal units that used to survive his shots. This might be the intended function of Veigar's ability, but it has the consequence of majorly buffing him beyond healthy levels.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true given the repeated nerfs to Ionic Spark (not to mention the general ineffectiveness of poison since no poison unit has backline access so no poison unit can apply their effect before Veigar gets his spell off).\r\n\r\nIt's admittedly difficult to guarantee you get a Seraph's AND a T3 Veigar, but if you DO get a Seraph's on a T3 Veigar, you can't lose. I'd recommend like...doubling his mana spell cost, or something to that effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Turtle Fish","date":"2019-11-22T22:56:00.562+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was really hoping they would do something about preadtors... sigh","replies":[{"poster":"RBree2","date":"2019-11-27T22:12:26.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, predators are kinda busted.
