But you get the money you paid for an event that didn't happen back! Wow, so generous! This is a classic example of placing too much importance on basic things. So what, they gave back money that was spent on something that didn't happen? Oh, big deal! There's a big difference between compensation and a refund, that being that compensation is when you _**give**_ a reward for troubles, whereas a refund is where you _**give back **_ for an incompetent service/product.
