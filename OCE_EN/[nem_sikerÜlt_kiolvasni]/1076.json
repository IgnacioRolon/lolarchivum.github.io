Reverting the arm-up time I feel is really important in those close duels that usually end up 1 auto attack either way. Also the reduced cool-down on mushrooms I feel do adequately compensate for the shortened duration of 5 minutes, overall changing Teemo's play-style to something more healthy.\r\n\r\nI feel to unlock Teemo's full potential lies within his \"Move Quick\" ability. I feel with most champions these days having a gap closer or dash, even Teemo vs Ryze's snares is a difficult task to deal with. \r\n\r\nSo I would propose most importantly Teemo's \"Move Quick\" on activation removes snares and slows. \r\n\r\nAlso I feel it is necessary to add an additional mechanic to \"Move Quick\", so during the time activated, when you hit enemy champions with auto attacks this increases the duration by 1 second up to additional 3 extra seconds, making for total \"Move Quick\" time of 6 seconds. Giving good Teemo players some more utility and outplay potential. \r\n\r\nI might also add in a slight 2% increase in movement speed granted by the passive which I feel would give enough of edge to orb walk in and out of skill shots, such as side stepping Riven knock up on third Q.\r\n\r\nIf Riot team reads this would be very happy to hear responses.\r\nThis written from one of Teemo's biggest fans and top Teemo player in oce!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jïnx","date":"2015-10-15T00:07:01.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XKjGvjY9pg\r\nRekt\r\nMakes you {{item:3070}} everytime","replies":[]}]}
