FNC initiated the fight and Incarnati0n's Azir have a {{item:3116}} which slows everyone he attacked and balls was standing in the front and his Q hit multiple targets in that fight and what happens after that is huni got dunked and everyone else except sivir got dunked.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-05T06:13:18.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, my intelligence level is way lower then yours.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
