I was planning on watching the games just before bed.. logged in for a few games... and well.. no point watching now. I appreciate why you would want to announce the winners but if you linked it to this page people who wanted to know could find out just as easily without completely spoiling it for people who couldn't watch it live for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nThanks, keep up the good work :)","replies":[{"poster":"WeirdyBeardy","date":"2017-04-17T11:52:09.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Theskitz, sorry that we messed up your plans! We really wanted to celebrate the victors right after the games finished, make it a big splash, but totally get that it can't be avoided in the client - we'll take another look at the way we do that for future comps. I know you already know the winner, but I'd still say the games are well worth watching :)","replies":[]}]}]}
