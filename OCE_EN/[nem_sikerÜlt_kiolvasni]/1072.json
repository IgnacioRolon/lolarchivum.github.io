I will say I live in South West Sydney, and it detects my location as Hornsby in North Sydney (which really isn't near me lmao) and that every suburb around me has data but mine doesn't.\n\nUnder my results, when I go to give ISP and location feedback, when I select my suburb the tool just wants me to pick an alternate location because there is no data for my area. Kinda pointless to have a feedback button if it doesn't actually let me give feedback don't you think? If I try to view my suburb without the feedback button (by just picking a location to view that area) much the same it tells me there is no data and to pick an alternate location.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saben","date":"2017-10-24T09:45:29.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, there is another comment here with the same issue I have, but when I press the link it just comes up with this:\r\nUnrecognized Account\r\nThe Lag Report does not recognize this account.
