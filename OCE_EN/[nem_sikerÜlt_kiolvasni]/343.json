For the person playing Zed. It wasn't fun for anyone else though. \n\nSure there are lots of people who won't abuse it and make the game unfun for everyone else, but there are also enough people who would, to ruin it for everyone.\n\n___\n\nURF was much the same. URF (in whatever form it takes) *isn't and can never be a balanced game-mode*, and that's really not the point. Within hours of the game-mode going up, we were seeing the same 5-6 champions *Every. Single. Game.* But why don't we just play whatever we want and let them play that way? Well, you can't, because the enemy team has picked from that small selection of extra OP and picking anything else will see you steamrolled over, losing your game in 10 minutes or less.\n\nIs ARURF exactly what we want? No. If ARURF the best compromise to allow people to enjoy the game-mode without a small percentage of players ruining it for everyone else? Yes.\n\nSure you may not get to play exactly the champion you want, but there are very few champions who *aren't* some degree of crazy fun in URF. Given that we also get rerolls, and they don't have to permaban champions like Sona, I'd say they're doing the best with what they've got.\n\nAlso, Riot doesn't *have* to bring URF back in any form. They have absolutely no obligation to do it, and it costs them money to update a game-mode that also doesn't *make* any (directly at least). ARURF is still the same core experience, and if the alternative is nothing at all, because regular URF just isn't healthy or sustainable, which would you prefer?","replies":[{"poster":"Tronthepom","date":"2019-10-09T05:58:49.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might want to rethink the way you phrase your words, you attack me in the last sentence however it doesn't matter. Riot will never listen to their fan base and I get that everyone picks the same champ but just introduce bans, why is it up to Riot to decide what fans think, fans complained alot less about regular urf than they do arurf, wonder why that may be?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-09T11:58:44.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My intention wasn't to attack, so apologies if it came off that way. Riot has an obligation to their community, but URF isn't their core game, I was simply trying to put that into perspective.\n\nDroves of people did complain about regular URF, and more than that people simply *left* when it was over. Entirely. Quit the game. This was still the case after they introduced bans.\n\nThere are more complaints about ARURF because ARURF has been around longer than regular URF was. It's cumulative. At the time, there were threads upon threads of complaints about the state of URF, it was why they tried making it a weekend type event rather than a week-long one for a while, but it just wasn't enough.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it's simply impossible to please everyone. The best they can do is find a compromise that pleases *most* people and remains a healthy queue and game-mode.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BB Wild Andrew","date":"2019-09-27T03:34:02.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Darkness BT","date":"2019-09-25T04:07:43.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AGREE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ayuumi","date":"2019-09-25T07:39:27.305+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fake Ashe changes, why would I J>PQ if I have an AC?
