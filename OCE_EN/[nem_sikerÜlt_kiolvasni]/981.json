I think you guys could have at least made it that QSS cleanses debuffs like slows and CC but then Mecurial scimitar removes things like Zeds Death mark, then as you said tanks wouldn't really be able to pick up that item to counter someone like Fioras ultimate, since its a pretty expensive item and not worth it for them, and ADCs can pick it up to have some kind of counterplay to all that damage, ADCs already have a massive target on their head, at least give them some more tools to help them survive certain death.","replies":[{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-05-19T21:49:04.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build {{item:3157}} .
