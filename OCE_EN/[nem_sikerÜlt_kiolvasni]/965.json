Riot has no obligation to be handing out cosmetic items, that have no effect on matches, to it's player base. And you are not really missing out on anything. All items involved are for Hextech crafting only! No icons, wardskins or champion skins - just bonuses to make additional crafts. Please don't complain about small things like hextech promotions. As you said, \"Riot games is a company\" and they need to \"make money\". Them giving out free chests every now and again is already a big loss to their sales.
