I went to worlds at Sydney and walked out 3 hours in. They played from a youtube video, which had constant issues they made us sit through the 30 min countdown when they could have skipped it. We eventually got through the pre-game events and then halfway through the first game it stopped so they attempted to get it to continue buffering and the person using it obviously doesn't know league and we ended up starting up again in the second game! (and this all took 3 hours and for someone who had to drive back to Canberra I'd had enough) It was horrible and they only good thing was that they refunded mine and the rest of my groups money bar the $1.50 booking fee so I got popcorn for $1.50.
