Not only do you have to find some way to get xp and gold to be useful, but you almost always have to do it away from your AD, who is likley the reason you are behind in the first place (usualy because they have no respect for your cooldowns). The itemization is really boring, there are very few support items that I look forward to getting in game, and some that I actively hate having to build, just because the game neccesitates it. I hate doing 90% of the work towards a kill or a teamfight to not only have my team not recognize me, but to have the game itself not appreciate my contribution. Esepcialy when my job is to be bait, or a distraction so my team can get objectives.\r\n\r\nFix gold and exp sharing, make the support items share rewards better on kill or assist (do it on the rank 2 items so otherlanes don't try to co-opt supports and ruin everthing like they always do). Give the support items some decent stats, so I don't feel like I'm buying items for someone else on the team.\r\n\r\nRemember that I am playing. I am one of the five people on this team.

Like say, a Blitzcrank pull is quite obvious and rewarding. A Braum Shielding against something like an Ashe ult is obvious and well seen, but in the midst of battle, lets say you've used all your abilities to the best of your ability (see what i did there) and you've got...lets say 4 actives, Face of the Mountain, Crucible, Locket and Redemption. People Won't really notice these effects unless it is strongly affecting them (as in all actives used on them.)\r\n\r\nI do think Redemption is a great item, because now it allows the support the ward river, and maybe walk (not even) half way to use the active to help kill or heal a teammate in the mid lane, or a fight in the JG somewhere, so you don't have to get cough with your pants down by a lee sin. Also helps if you say, tanked the shit out of everything with Braum or Alistar, and died due to that (not many would see it as tanking but a mistake) and what else can you do while you wait for that 40 seconds to go down? Give your teammates like what, 150 or more health? That's a big percentage depending on who you give it to...oh wait, the radius so large that you get a heal, you get a heal, everyone gets a heal!\r\n\r\nBut Giving stats for supports would be god and all but...No really other lane does the kind of thing a support does (like warding, because who needs vision anyway) so they wont be looking at what YOU did most the time.

It is playable, but the amount of early game damage they have over you is one of the reasons why people will play so passively. Particularly if your support has opted for an early passive gold item; you simply just don't have the damage for a good engage.\r\nAlthough it does make for a very interesting one if you do decide to go in, making you think harder on positioning and timing, it can pay off when you know you have the capabilities to protect your ADC when it comes down to it.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the idea of Riot implementing trinkets was to take the pressure of warding OFF the supporting role. I have been supporting since late Season 3 and I kid you not, non stop every ranked game I played everyone will nag me to buy a vision item of sorts. The trinket implementation was fantastic as I could easily tell people to \"use their trinkets\" for early game play instead of them being furious at the support for \"not warding\". Now I know there is an item called sightstone {{item:2049}}  that has also been implemented into the game, but I also like to play my supports a little differently and that works for me, but not everyone. I wont normally buy a sightstone on my squishy supports {{champion:40}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}} as I can purchase much more effective laning items for my ADC and rely on a rotation from me and my ADC to use our trinkets.\r\nThat said I DO buy sightsone on my tanky supports as it gives me the early game of HP advantage, but that's simply the only reason why I get it.\r\nBut lately I have been seeing the return of the \"support not warding\" due to my favourtism towards playing the squishy supports because of the sightstone item.\r\n\"\"Is Sightstone in the right place as a mandatory 800g first buy? Are there other adjustments to the vision game that would be good both for the experience of playing support and the game in general?\"\"\r\nI know a lot of people will argue that it is a \"core\" item for any support, but I still disagree. Forcing an item to be obligatory to a role will push people out of playing it.\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, gold income can be a crucial factor to the lane, especially if the lane isn't going too well. The support will suffer the most forcing them either to roam to gain gold (which isn't a good thing to leave a struggling ADC), or eventually being killed repeatedly because of the lack of items or bad team play despite being a good player.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Need to have the right mindset, good engage/disengage choice making, don't be pressured into buying a sightstone, and hopefully have a good lane so your gold income doesn't suffer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eclipzse","date":"2016-11-15T05:14:49.215+0000","up_votes":20,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Support Main for the past couple of seasons and achieving my highest solo rank via the role, these are my opinions;\r\n\r\n* **Gold income as support**\r\n\r\nAs a support, your best source of income(aside from taking kills), is a long lane phase, because that allows the passive income from masteries or items such as spell thieves, to actually make an impact large enough for you to be relevant come the transition into mid game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is only the case for the most recent ranged support meta and less relevant to the likes of tank/utility supports who can rely solely on their cc or utility without losing too much from lack of items. \r\n\r\nIn the case of winning lane early, but not taking kills and getting a first tower fall at 11 minutes, the support won't even achieve first item (not counting Sightstone). So this needs to be addressed. An interesting idea that was posted was to give supports passive gold generation when nearby allied champions via an item or mastery. This coupled with our current income should allow us to transition into mid game easier and incentivize grouping, such as the jungler stacking your lane to help take first tower and then grouping with your mid laner if you're not that far ahead, or maintain pressure with your ad in the bot lane if you're sufficiently far ahead.\r\n\r\nOther ideas included upping the gold gain from masteries or items and Cheaper support items (however that would break the economy so to speak). Either way, I feel supports are in need of a raise of income.\r\n\r\n* **Recognition of success as support**\r\n\r\nWhile it's true that supports don't gain the same amount of recognition other roles get from stats, such as kda or achieving a multikill, a supports impact on the game is almost as notable as a flashy play by any of the other roles. If you are able to consistently hit that cc, or deal a lot of damage, or shield your ad from harms way then you will get recognition from your allies. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn saying that, more stats in-game wouldn't be a bad idea. Something as simple as tracking assist streaks, damage denied via exhaust, a spell or keystone, even if limited to some kind of \"savior\" award for protecting your carry from damage equal to x% of their hp. Vision is also a large part of the supports game, if you could include some kind of tracker in-game for wards placed vs wards killed, to properly highlight a support maintaining vision control to secure objectives, it then shows everyone in-game how thorough your supports vision control has been. Alternatively, a stat for \"Enemy Champions seen by a ward in the jungle\" to show effective and efficient ward placement and avoid supports spamming useless wards in their fountain. \r\n\r\nPost game stats would benefit from seeing how many times/seconds you landed CC, vision uptime, Keystone damage denied / healed from the likes of Windspeakers, Courage etc.\r\n\r\n* **Itemisation**\r\n\r\nThe latest changes to Aegis definitely took a step in the right direction for adding more diversity in a supports itemisation. \r\n\r\n\r\nSightstone is still definitely a must, as vision is still vitally important to the success of a game. However, sightstone feels like it may be lacking now in contrast to other mechanics in the game. Trinkets for example replenish over time. Sightstone could definitely do with some love just to reaffirm it's position as the supports must-have item. Whether it's as simple as replenishing wards over time, or scaling with level to have more charges / allow more wards placed at higher levels, it needs some kind of attention (the latter option being my preferred).\r\n\r\nIn the instance of scaling ward slots + wards placed per level, 3 ward slots and 3 wards placed from levels 1-10 are sufficient for lane phase and transition into mid-game. From levels 11+ an additional ward slot would be beneficial as ward control becomes a lot more prevalent and your vision is likely to be denied, then at level 18 and potentially six items (including ruby sightstone), you have to sacrifice an item for a control ward, instead of this, letting sightstone have an additional ward slot and placement would be beneficial. At level 18 and fully upgraded sightstone, 6 ward slots and 4 wards placed would allow for that last additional item (especially if gold changes are added) and the ability to maintain extended vision control over longer periods e.g dancing a major objective.\r\n\r\nWith the new items taking the place of the generic Aegis rush, we see a little more diversity, which is on par with most other roles. Builds are mostly accepted into the meta, with slight changes to accommodate each circumstance, e.g rushing Knight's Vow, then taking Face of the Mountain over Lockett because the enemy has a larger burst potential vs AoE potential. At this stage of the game, I'm happy with where support items are barring sightstone.\r\n\r\n* **Are supports properly served by pre-game choices (runes/masteries/summoner spells) in terms of their effectiveness?**\r\n\r\nPre-game choices in any role are relative to someones play style and their own opinions. Mastery changes have emphasized that further, by more sustain masteries early in the tree and more damage focused ones later. This doesn't differ from most roles in my opinion. If you play a champion a certain way, e.g Zyra, more aggressively than most, then you should take the appropriate masteries and runes. There is plenty of diversity from a play style stand point, let alone champion stand point. I'm happy with how it is at the moment.\r\n\r\n* **Laning Patterns**\r\n\r\nAgain, relative to other roles this is almost par for the course. If you picked a tank support into a ranged support, you're going to have a bad time if you're punished and without adequate help. You're forced to stay back and patiently wait for a gank, or transition into mid without giving up too much of a lead. This is still true for any mid-lane, top-lane, jungle or even ad match up. There is a meta and it will switch to allow counters for specific metas and support is no different. \r\n\r\nPersonally I'm looking forward to picking up tanks this season to shut down any assassin that comes for my carry, which is a far cry from the range damage supports I used last season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing how Riot change things in the upcoming season. I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the changes this pre-season and I can't wait for more going forward.

I hate sightstone, i avoid buying one most of the time, its an 800g purchase that reduces my other abilities e.g. shield/heal or cc, with the free warding totems your vision in lane is perfectly acceptable. I do sometimes get sightstone after laning phase but the very idea of having a role whos sole job is to buy a 800g item and use its charges defines boredom. \r\n\r\nmake it cheaper, add it to the support item sooner, e.g. coin/shield/blade come with 1 charge, upgrading gives 2 charges, final upgrade gives 3 charges and an additional upgrade does nothing BUT give the 4th charge, no stat change on final upgrade.\r\n\r\nArdent censer was my favorite support item, excellent item for any support with a shield/heal (which is most of them if not all)\r\nWith the most recent patch my favorite item is actually knights vow, allowing me to take some of the damage off adc and heal with their attacks is amazing, matched with the keystone to take 5% it makes a fairly large difference and i am tending to take that keystone instead of the healing/shielding keystone as it's really useful. \r\nI'm still expeimenting with what i should take, but at the moment im rushing knights vow into boots into ardent censor then looking at things that also boost heal/shield power. As stated i get very late sightstones, not a fan of the item personally, on first back i'll always buy control ward for the bush closest to our outer tower then use trinket wards for far bush.\r\n\r\nIts worth considering buffing the support items to give more gold passive or gold on minion kill NOT made by player. while this may make other lanes take support items consider locking the 3 support items behind exhaust, like jungle items are locked behind smite. \r\n\r\nLastly, it'd be nice to get something like global assist announcements every 5-10 assists or to have assist streaks announced, do consider this idea is poorly thought out and something i just thought of...

ESPECIALLY with these stupid duo ADC lanes or Mid lane champs like Yasuo being the so called \"support\" I can't gain enough gold on time to keep up , get items and keep my ADC alive AND save tower or hold them off until my ADC revives if they die (I find most time's junglers are no help at all as well, no offence to you actually good ones out there).\r\n\r\nMoving on to recognition, I literally gave up on that end. about 1-50 game's I get recognized for my efforts. Most time's my team gives all the credit to the ADC or other player's when most of the time it was me who drained all their life and worked my ass off to keep everyone alive. Most of the kill's my team get's are because I drained the enemy or kept them alive long enough to do so but I get no thank's at all. Not to mention if I get a well earned kill I get slammed for doing so because \"I'm the support\" and apparently were not supposed to get kill's because that's stealing. I'm sorry but if no one is around or going for the enemy on low health who is running away, i am GOING to take that kill. Mostly because i need the gold in which i'm lacking. I can't count how many time's I have had to deal with toxic player's giving me a bad time because I couldn't heal them when I had no mana and they ran in on low health or took a kill that 1. they did nothing for and 2. didn't try to get. I love playing support but a simple \"thank you\" every now and then for saving a team mate from dying when i'm running everywhere keeping track of their health, the map and everything else wouldn't be too hard to give now would it? I don't think most player's understand that playing support CAN be difficult especially when your team is being reckless or pinning the blame on you when your doing everything you can. Support isn't a \"no skill\" role, it can be the most frustrating and difficult ones around. I would like to see it more appreciated instead of dismissed as much as it has been. \r\n\r\nI call for a strike! we support's shall not support or heal our fellow team mates until we get the appreciation we deserve! (that was a joke..)\r\n\r\nAs for item's it depends on the player and what they build, I personally haven't had many issues with that tbh aside from the lack of gold.\r\n\r\nWith laning it really depends who i'm versing but as I mentioned before i'm constantly versing the duo ADC lanes or mixed lanes. I actually rarely see a proper support champion used anymore o.o and it can tilt my lane to all hell.\r\n\r\nOk I've spoken enough and I don't speak for everyone on this because we all have different experiences playing the game.

Being a jungle main, I've got used to being blamed for everyone elses failings, but at least in the jungle I have power, autonomy and ACTUAL REAL CHOICES.  Supports get raged at for taking a single creep during a trade, for getting a kill that would otherwise escape, for only having 3 wards on the map, and for the inability of their marksman to CS.\r\n\r\n**Things that would make the support experience better-**\r\n\r\n**Getting rid of locket was a VERY good thing**, the pressure to have someone buy the item the team needs, but which gimps the person who buys it felt like a lot of pressure, given the limited support budget.  Some of the new items are certainly improvements.\r\n**\r\n\r\n**Getting rid of sightstone **(with increases in trinket power over the course of the game, or we lose global vision potential).  Supports are unpopular because they feel powerless.  Having to spend gold on an item considered so essential it's mandatory on you, and anyone else would rage if asked to build, due to its lack of stats and slot blocking, does NOT feel good.  I also dislike being forced into a build path as a jungler, but at least that directly gives me gold and xp, and if i just start machete and rush hydra for clear, no one rages at me (usually).  Either make the vision game FUN for those playing it, or stop it being the supports job.  If you DO get rid of sightstone, you'll also have to remove the jungle green smite, or supports will have to get smite, and use that as well.  You can see the pattern here, if someone has to do something necessary, but diminishes their own personal power and agency, it defaults to the support to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving kill/assist distinctions**  Assassin and ADC mains will probably rage a **LOT** if this is even raised, but, it's one of the biggest reasons I NEVER EVER want to play support again. Removing the distinction would achieve several things:\r\n\r\nFirstly, a natural fight FOR THE TEAM OBJECTIVE...  I want to win a fight, so can't I just play to actually win the fight? NO... I have to risk letting enemies escape constantly, or have 4 people rage at me. No one else faces this pressure.\r\n\r\nSecondly, ego boosting, all those pentakills, the lavish praise you get for a kill, the people who abbreviate kda to kd...  The stupid carry dives that get them killed to steal the kill, causing their own death in consequence (hi Vayne mains).  Supports will feel undervalued as long as this stuff exists. No matter what rewards you throw out for other things, kills get stupidly overvalued.  Don't even let us know who got the kill, it should all be shared takedowns.  Simply showing takedowns/deaths on the scoreboard after the game would probably make a lot of supports look as valuable as they actually are.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a better gold distribution.  When that Blitz lands the hook and rips Veigar into your team for a quick kill, he did far more work than the carry doing the killing, and gets less gold for it.  With even gold for kill participation, supports would get a better share of it (quite reasonably) and feel more valued.\r\n\r\nFourthly, less rage and better teamwork.  When people stop playing for kda, teamwork goes up.  When teamwork goes up, supports will be better appreciated, because teamwork is what they're designed for, but accolades (and gold) always goes out to the people who get kills, rather than those who set them up, save teammates or otherwise contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Concerning gold income. ** If you play a support tank at a decent level, you're just not even in the league of a 'real' tank, in terms of tankyness by midgame, unless you're Alistar.  Especially if you're a solo tank, you just melt in the face of enemy damage due to your low budget and forced itemization.  Playing some of the same tanks top or jungle (like Naut or Sion) vs support and you feel the amazing power you have with them with some decent income.  Playing support with them it's easy to feel week, behind, and useless.  This gets exacerbated when you're the teams only tank, as you melt in an instant to enemy burst, because you're not only poorer, you're also many levels behind.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to have as much gold as a good last hitting adc, but you need more than is currently available if you want to feel like Robin to Batman, rather than Robin to Superman.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcerning teamfights and tanks, why do those who only TOOK damage, not get assists?\r\n\r\nIf my blocking those skillshots saved my adcs life, but I don't hit the enemy during the kill (because I cant reach them and I hang back to heal), I am denied even an assist, despite sometimes being the entire reason the fight was won.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Levels. ** Supports are very interesting to roam with, but, this means you're 4-5 levels behind your team, not 2, that's a truly massive amount of stats.  Reintroduce catchup XP masteries at a level strong enough to count, or some other means to gain XP at a higher rate when behind, and supports might actually feel like champions during mid-lategame teamfights.  This would roaming supports not fall quite so far behind, which I suspect would make the role considerably more popular.\r\n\r\nThe current problem is that the better the support is at supporting the team, the further they fall behind (look at pro support levels and CS vs solo queue supports for example).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I was free to roam without ending up massively behind, and there was no issue about who got the kill, I would probably be willing to do a fair bit of support again, and maybe even make it my second role after jungling.  As it is, I'll continue to dive games where I'm support, until such time as I can actually not care who gets the kills.","replies":[]},{"poster":"qoobator","date":"2016-11-16T03:35:09.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support primary and ADC secondary here.
