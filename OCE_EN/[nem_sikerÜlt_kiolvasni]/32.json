Lucian just has no power anymore and yes you can still make great plays with him but since the reduction of his Q,W range its become much harder as u really have to get close in to land the shot this effects his entire kit as it does a portion of it original damage and has even less range but the Cool down is untouched, meaning u have no power to poke or kill and no skills to use after the first skill combo. on top of the fact that his Autos do not do as much as some Auto focused ADCs. Zyra, very simple her root range is stupid and once she gets her root off she just hits a spell or two and ur dead or so close before u even get out of stun. U talk about how powerful Lucian was before his nerfs? Try face rolling on Zyra, like actually putting ur face on the keyboard and rolling it cuz i bet u that u could get a kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LoL Melf","date":"2016-06-11T14:14:05.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wut about... bring back solo queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AuS51E2o02xD","date":"2016-06-11T07:36:34.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  Me while reading 'The State of the Season'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Codernick","date":"2016-06-08T19:40:22.016+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":4,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shimrra3","date":"2016-06-08T23:55:57.060+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just how many times are you going to totally rework Ryze?
