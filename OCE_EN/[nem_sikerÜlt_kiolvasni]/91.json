The current jungle item has no active ability. I am suggesting to grant it one.\r\n\r\nAllow jungle item to gain charge of monster scrape by defeating jungle monsters. When activate can place a monster lure on either baron pit or dragon pit. and which ever pit got higher value monster lure will pop the dragon (assuming baron not spawn yet). In this way, jungler can affect the spawn spot for dragon. making dragon pop at top pit can take strategic advantage.\r\n\r\nit can follow a rule that which ever pit got higher value monster lure will lure the first epic monster to spawn there. If both expect to spawn at same time, dragon will be first and baron will pop in the other.

Remove stealth wards from the game....that is such a good choice. I mean it's not like junglers camp lanes amirite? And that one early advantage carries a game? And yet, you still haven't made a meta that is balanced, Early S5, Bruiser Meta, Mid S5, tank meta, present day still a tank meta...are they ever going to idk....pay some attention to the champions they gutted from high level play, namely Katarina, Akali, Malzahar, Kha'zix and Fiddlesticks.\r\nJust make a more intricate meta, where they had sated devourer before was fine, it balanced out the purchase of cinderhulk and the new tank items. However, as much as I love seeing utility picks most champions just aren't worth picking up, at all. Even now I'm slowly seeing my much loved champion Rengar, fading away as more tanks and anti engagement tools are introduced to the meta. \r\nIn short, give your balance changes some real thought, don't get stuck in between buffing or nerfing a champion, buff or nerf them hard, see how they sit after the changes and when appropriate treat them adeqautely. Example, Katarina, instead of nerfing her constantly only 5 patches, give her something new or compensation. I mean you planned on giving her a possible overhaul with a new shunpo and AD scalings.But that might be bias. So basically improve the champions who need help and adjust the meta to fit ALL CHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\ntl:dr, don't remove stealth wards, they help out Katarina and Lee sin in particular as well as EVERY SINGLE LANER in their efforts to defend themselves from the terrors of the meta junglers of Rek'sai, Elise, Gragas, Lee sin.
