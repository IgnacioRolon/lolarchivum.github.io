Negatives- 1. Annie- my 3rd best champ for ranked behind ahri and brand- nerfed. 2. Riven- we already have plenty of riven mains in OCE and now you want to buff her more. You must really want to increase our salt levels for bronze silver gold and platinum(diamond maybe not but you never know)*. 3. Malphite- buffed yet again. I guess you want tank meta back in again *sigh*. Positives- 1. Jayce- TY for lowering mana costs/fixing bugs/changing damage ratio for R. 2. Ashe/Jhin I am actually glad for these 2 nerfs it brings certain underplayed champions like tristana/varus/urgot/quinn/kalista back into contention but pls nerf lucian and buff urgot. urgot is the lowest played of the adcs atm and I would love to see urgot back in the bot lane again. 3. GP- The best nerf you guys have done all year. TY. You have kept him strong but you have made him way less OverPowered than he used to be.\r\n\r\n* I Don't personally get salty against riven but I know some people who do.","replies":[{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2016-08-24T09:13:36.024+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest; Urgot is going to need a rework to bring him back.
