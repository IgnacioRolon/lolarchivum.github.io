The flights to Riot Games Sydney is just there to help players who otherwise couldn't attend the finals (after they have qualified) attend. \r\n\r\nWe will look to cover travel expenses for a Sydney team as well should they qualify (Uber/Taxi). \r\n\r\nThanks for raising this though, I will update the article to focus more on the finals experience rather than the flights itself.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"FireRafe24","date":"2017-06-12T10:10:46.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Sydney team will qualify XD","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-26T00:40:15.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't be so sure last year it was Monash vs QUT (no Sydney teams in the finals =P)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Savarin","date":"2017-06-05T10:37:19.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi, I'm just wondering...\r\n\r\nI don't have enough people for a club at my uni but I have always considered a possible career in shoutcasting League games, whether it be in-game or a pre/post-game analysis.\r\n\r\nI am in uni but like I said before, my uni doesn't have enough League players to form a club. \r\n\r\nWould there be any opportunity for me, of course gone through like a job interview, to shoutcast at any of the uni games? I would be so grateful and happy to do so as it would be great if I am to pursue a career in shoutcasting in League.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-06T00:29:37.691+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SLIVER,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I bet if you started something at your uni you will find that more players than you think are around =D. We will support you through the process as well so let me know if that is something you want to pursue.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely opportunities to get involved with shoutcasting. The best advice is always to put yourself out there and start casting over VODs or starting with Community groups.\r\n\r\nYou can reach out to Bit Games - https://www.facebook.com/BitGamesGG/\r\nThey run tournaments and events regularly and are always on the look out for new talent (this is where having videos of you casting over replays would be great!)\r\n\r\nYou can also get involved in community groups like Summoners Society who run tournaments every weekend - https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE\r\n\r\nOr you can reach out to the many existing Uni clubs and ask if they have any shout casting opportunities. They all run events regularly too - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/uni-clubs/directory\r\n\r\nHope that helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Burrito","date":"2017-06-19T13:26:04.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I'm from La Trobe University Competitive Online Games Society and was just wondering once we finish with trials by July 21st where exactly do we sign up our team and how do we know who we are playing against?
