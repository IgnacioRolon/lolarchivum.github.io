You could have easily just nerfed the projectile speed like you did with {{champion:7}} on {{champion:268}} 's E to create small counter play to avoid his knockup but instead you add 2 nerfs to him and made it even him even harder to play. \"Listening is another way we evaluate balance\" I think almost everyone who played Azir on the PBE with those nerfs, did not see it as a good thing, majority of them complained yet you didn't care. ~ Salty Summoner ","replies":[{"poster":"uHAXbro","date":"2015-10-08T02:08:06.303+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Azir is fine as a champion, you have to play him more as the champion he was intended to be, not as a nuking assassin (which was removed) but the new play style encourages him to be played as a control mage.

He has some good lane harrass, until he runs out of mana after 2-3 harasses, then he has nothing. Needs less mana cost, but if doing that can foresee him to become overpowered, then he needs a rework, because he currently is the joke of league of legends, as well as quite possibly the most underplayed champion, both due to power, and how unappealing he is.\r\n\r\nWarwick: Polar opposite to an in meta Jungler. Has almost no gank potential until level 6, which automatically makes him a bad jungle. His E is more of a burden than a blessing, it alerts enemies of where he is. Also, he's a 1 trick pony, so easy to predict and counteract. I suggest maybe nerfing his ult, and giving his other skills some form of CC or chase. Maybe reworking his E to some form of dash? And just a suggestion, but maybe add a slow to his Q? I feel like he can become a great in meta Jungle with just a few small tweaks to make him more versatile, at the cost of some pure power, kind of like the Fiora rework.\r\n\r\nPoppy: Heard this champ is receiving a rework soon. If true, greatly awaiting it.\r\n\r\nQuinn: A lot about her is everything an AD carry Marksman shouldn't be. Most people consider her the worst AD carry Marksman in the game. Her skills force her into poor positioning in team fights, and her passive can sometimes create misplays. Aware that she has a heavy snowball effect, so maybe nerf her snowball potential and rework some skills so that she can position herself better as an AD carry.\r\n\r\nTaric: Heard this champ is receiving a rework soon. If true, greatly awaiting it.\r\n\r\nYorick: I feel like Yorick could have been 1 of the updated Juggernauts. He was very similar to the old Darius, where his lane phase was insanely strong, and a great counter pick, but his overall team synergy was lacking. He's also a very easy pick for lane phase, not requiring too much skill, and just slaughtering your lane enemy, just like old Darius. He's also incredibly underplayed, due to most people not knowing how he works, and \"Yorick, the gravedigger who let down his family because he was too ugly to get a girlfriend\" doesn't really appeal to many people. I suggest a similar rework to the Darius rework, where you removed his easy win lane phase, but replaced it with team synergy, that also requires skill to play at his fullest. Maybe give his lore a tweak to make him more appealing too.\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone let me know what you guys think of these ideas, or suggest other champions. I'm keen for balance discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2015-10-08T10:01:50.268+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:83}} I hear is getting a rework next year.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chvrche5","date":"2015-10-10T05:27:39.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:143}} needs a death passive rework.

Zyras passive is fairly inneffective as it lays now, is there any tweaks coming to her in the future? Lux has atleast a shield and has fairly long range, Zyra has a narrow snare which has her killed if missed or killed if its anyone who can just burst anyway. Just curious if something like Ahri's Q will be added, when she drops the stun, or when her plants hit someone she gets a small movement speed boost or something.

But you've now given him one of the strongest sustains in the game. Not only does his Q do insane damage and stack his passive, but it heals him for % health. His bleed is insane in fights because once you've killed one person, you apply 5 stacks immediately. These 5 stacks pretty much do 500 damage by themselves... But to add a cherry on top, it gives him an ultimate that does nearly 1k true damage. \r\nSo overall, Darius has a heal that goes to nearly 35-40% of his hp (end game this is probably 1500 hp +) a bleed that overpowers a fully fed Talon Q, and a clean up ultimate that does 1k damage and refreshes, Who thought this was a fair trade? It doesn't even matter if you shut down Darius early because he just tanks up and doesn't even need Damage items because he has his ridiculous ultimate damage.\r\n\r\nGaren: Two Speed ups so escaping is ridiculously easy and chasing is too. Not only that but the base damage of the two speed ups are so insane that a Garen doesn't even need damage items to do damage. Full tank or Black Cleaver usually means your Q and E do around 300-500 each or more. Of course, like his mirror champion, Darius, he has an insane true damage finisher that completely stomps on ADCs and any squishys. Juggernauts are ineffective if they're kited and killed but you can't avoid a Garen. A silence and speed up Q chained into an E then ult pretty much kills the ADC or any carry role, makes Garen, who's purpose is to tank, become a fighter 1v1'r even though he has no damage items. \r\n\r\nMorde is strong but I don't lane with him much to list exactly how broken he is, so i'll skip him.\r\n\r\nSkarner: I feel like Skarner was the only Juggernaut to not completely break the game. Although his movement speed, attack speed is insane, his spires are insanely easy to cap so I don't really mind him.\r\n\r\nFiora: I'm gonna include Fiora in this, because she was close to the rework of the Juggs and she's extremely strong. \r\nTrue damage, 50% HP heal, 3-5 second dash and a skill that blocks everything in the game, including ultimates, summoners and items. Balanced? No. \r\nI'm just gonna focus on her ult because this is already long enough.\r\n\"We wanted players to feel like a duelist when they used her (Fiora) ult.\" - Riot. \r\nThis is innovative and a great idea to get the players more involved in her gameplay but. Why bother hitting all 4 sides when you can just burst them down and kill him? You just hit one side, kill them and get the 50% HP heal for your ENTIRE team. They wanted her to be more of a duelist but I've never heard of a dam duelist that heals after she attacks 4 times. A speed boost or attack speed boost would've been fair or make it that she HAS to hit all 4 to get the heal or boost. Every fiora just picks the squishest champ, ults them, 3 shots them and then heal the entire teamfight.\r\n\r\nPlease Riot. The Game is in a wreck. You keep mentioning the amount of times a champ gets banned. I've played games in Silver and Gold Elo and the Juggernauts are a must ban. Even in the LCS, they are always a high ban priority. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Nerf everything.

Tanks (Juggernauts in particular) are already killing marksmen champs behind the enemy front line then succeed in escaping (unless the enemy team has a capable support with heavy CC that hasn't been forced to initiate because the top lane cares too much about his KDA). Also most adc's who become meta are nerfed and then the next meta marksmen takes its place until it is nerfed, rinse and repeat until adc's are just all nerfed. \r\n\r\nGoing well in bot lane does not have the same effect on the game that succeeding in the other positions with many other prominent champs being able to hard carry a game without much input from their team.
