They said they were going to let us buy champ shards with ip later in 6.10s notes. God dam idiot\n\nYou could buy more chests with RP in the hope to land a champ shard if you'd like a shortcut....  TBH i think the shard/permanent/essence thing to get rank 6 and 7 is just ridiculous, it should be based on skill, you've already been dedicated enough to earn master 5 and score the required amount of S scores, also earning an S on the champ only get you the chest once a season, rather low odds to land a champ shard for every champ.\nand i think calling someone an idiot is rather harsh especially since my comment made rather a good point, it would be very poor business sense to allow you to shortcut your shard collection with freely earned currency now wouldn't it?.  \nThe first part of the patch notes where it mentioned the purchase of champ shards using IP was merely them giving an example of how you would show dedication to your champion, at the bottom of the patch notes they said they will add an item to the store to purchase with IP _**OR**_ RP (meaning: \"we haven't decided yet\") which will take place of the champion shard component, based on the low chance of you landing a shard for your specific champion, not the purchase of the shard itself, and i'm guessing it won't be cheap either, 6000 IP doesn't show much dedication, i'd be thinking more around the 12000+ IP mark maybe","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nytlord","date":"2016-06-02T05:38:22.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because you need champion shards/essence for Mastery Ranks 6 and 7","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-06-03T02:22:59.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man! they are in store now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Adriel","date":"2016-06-01T23:24:14.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-06-03T02:41:08.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah there.
