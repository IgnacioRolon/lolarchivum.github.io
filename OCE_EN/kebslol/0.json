Too much spawns tentacles everywhere. Too much zones 25% of the map all the time. Too much requires 5 people to put her down. No champion should be tanky AND do massive damage. That&#039;s called UNFAIR. No, you can&#039;t outplay her. You can&#039;t outzone her, you can&#039;t outcs her, and you can&#039;t kill her in lane even with 2 helpers. And before you trolls troll, I held even CS with her to the 20 minute mark without deaths. She destroyed entire team WITHOUT her ult. All it took was a single black cleaver. \r\n\r\nRiot Fail. Delete the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-06-30T07:31:28.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\n\nIllaoi is a champion with plentiful strengths and weaknesses as a champion but her overpoweredness seems to drop off when people learn to play against her properly by not allowing themselves to be trapped within her ultimate. \n\nYes, her tentacles are strong but she completely relies on them for healing and damage. Keep that in mind. ","replies":[]}]}
