Even the Boards are arid like a desert. \n\n73 ping is fairly high for connecting to servers within the same continent, but waaaaaaaay better than the currently absurd 300-360ms ping on NA, but the play-ability isn&#039;t much of a consideration when you can&#039;t even bloody play the game!\n\n___\n\nAlso, on a side note, in just the past 2 or 3 weeks, my ping on NA servers has been absurd like I said, going so high as to be 360, consistently, before I&#039;d be fine sitting at 250ms, then it started to pick up to 280 at the very least (which didn&#039;t seem like much of a difference, but I guess it would have marginally), but now it&#039;s actually difficult to play the game at such high ping.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-29T23:44:06.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH I think it's mostly due to you being level 14, but I'm sure OCE's smaller population is playing a small role here too. There are very few players around level 14, so obviously the matchmaking system is struggling to find people around your elo, and as a result you're spending 15 min in queue.\n\nOnce you level up to level 25+, things should start to get A LOT better ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-31T00:33:04.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably something else that would be impacting queue times is the fact it's Ascension, which has been occurring quite often in the RGMQ since the legacy client was disabled.
