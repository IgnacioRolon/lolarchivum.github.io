Just apply your images to the ticket and state your case. I did for a guy almost that bad telling me to kill myself blah blah blah. Usually I ignore and mute it but no one should ever be told to kill themselves. I draw the line there. I got a response less than 24hrs after I submitted my complaint and was told they'd investigate that player. They'll also tell you to also report inside the client and always write a description in the comments. Riot stated not long ago reports with no comments are often not looked upon than those with comments. Hope that helps you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-26T17:01:07.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why do you even care what that guy thinks? hes obviously mad.
