Furthermore this type of language is used when when we play games together and i dont use it in games with other individuals. My friend reported me as a joke looking to get me chat restricted for a couple of games however i immediately got a 14 day suspension even though it was my first offence and i hadn't intentionally griefed the game or said anything to other players in the game just my friend. I had honour lvl 4 checkpoint 3 and as i didnt say anything extremely bad im wondering why i had instantly recieved a 14 day suspension instead of a warning or a chat restriction?","replies":[{"poster":"THE KOA","date":"2019-10-30T10:59:36.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My dude email riot, board might take a while...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-30T08:54:10.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to appeal the ban, you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and explain your situation to them. I'm not sure whether they'll undo a ban that resulted from a \"joke\" report, but even so they should reduce the punishment if it's been escalated without cause.\n\nIf you're willing to share the chat logs from the game (should be in the reform card and email regarding the ban), then someone here may be able to provide more context, but without more information about the case there's not much anyone could tell you. I'd recommend that you and your friends take the report system more seriously in the future, and refrain from using it as a way to joke around with each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fireball202","date":"2019-10-30T06:28:53.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a video of our chat at the time we were using similar language and no hurtful terms were used, so just wanted to know if i could get a chat restriction instead or something along those lines.","replies":[]}]}
