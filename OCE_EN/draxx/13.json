I&#039;m in challenger but have yet to find my banked games in the leagues tab. Has this change already been implemented and if so, where can I see it?\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; With the existing decay rules some high-skill players were reaching the prized top spots and then sitting on their rank. Without having to continue defending those spots, accounts stagnated - leading to lower participation at the top of the ladder, where competition and stakes should be at their highest. To improve on this, we&rsquo;re adding a new set of rules for decay in Challenger and Master tier.\r\n\r\n&gt; ~DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS: Players can play to store up to 10 banked games of decay immunity\r\n\r\n&gt; ~MAINTENANCE FEES: Each day, 1 banked game is removed from player reserves\r\n\r\n&gt; ~INACTIVITY PENALTIES: Starting when the number of banked games first reaches 0, players incur 100 points of LP decay per day until they bank additional   games of decay immunity\r\n\r\n&gt; ~ACCESS YOUR STATEMENTS ONLINE: Banked games are tracked on the Leagues tab\r\n\r\n&gt; ~MEMBERS ONLY: Decay rules in other tiers are unchanged","replies":[]}
