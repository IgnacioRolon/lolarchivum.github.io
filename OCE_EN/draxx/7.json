I am currently Diamond V, however I truly do feel like I can play to the level that you need. Since ADC is open I'd like to fill that position. \nMy best ADC champs include: Vayne, Lucian, Twitch (situational), Caitlyn, Ashe and Tristana, but I do pick and play well on the other ADCs such as Sivir, Corki.\nSo, by all means, if you still need someone and you want a player who will be committed and ready to challenge themselves then allow me to be your ADC. \nMy IGN is: EternalEmVy","replies":[]}]}
