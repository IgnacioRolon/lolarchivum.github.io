Mechanically speaking, it has a heal and is wider/longer, but it's also substantially slower, has a longer cooldown, and doesn't trigger a directly damaging passive.\n\nHer W's initial range is longer, but the trigger range is *much* shorter than a Varus ult. Coupled with it's slower movement and the fact that its 1v1 potential is much lower (because Senna isn't Varus) makes it quite a different ability in the context of her kit.\n\nThe MS on her E is a similar duration, but also substantially less than Sivir's ult, affects champions in a comparatively *tiny* range, and allies lose the effect if they attack anything. The shroud and the wraith effect are camouflage only, unlike Akali's true invisibility.\n\nHer R is not a heal, it is a really-not-that-substantial shield that doesn't scale with her primary build stat and that doesn't last very long. It also does less damage than a Lux ult even when building full AD, is wider yes but much slower to fire (easier to dodge), and can't trigger a damaging passive like Lux's can.\n\n___\n\nShe feels a little strong at the moment, yes, but almost all new champions do. To be honest I would say it's almost entirely because people haven't learnt to play against her yet rather than her numbers actually being all that over-tuned. I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't receive a nerf at all, or if it's only a small one.\n\n___\n\nAs for what she brings to League, for one an entirely new way to play support. Pyke did it once, Senna has done it again. For the longest time your options for support (unless you were going wildly off-meta) were Tank, Enchanter, or kill-lane (read: not all that support-y) mage. Now we have an Assassin and a Marksman *tailored for the support role* to go with that.\n\nIf they flex elsewhere then sure, there are usually more efficient picks so 'what's the point?'. The point is they aren't designed for other lanes, and if they can flex there it's because players are doing interesting things with them, it doesn't erase their value to the support role. Diversity is never a bad thing.\n\nMechanically speaking her shroud and the wraiths it creates is an entirely new form of obfuscation, and very interesting to play with/around. Like Neeko's passive, it's not something central (i..e couldn't do without) to their mechanical kit, but it's central to their identity, and both create very interesting ways to play the game.\n\nWe haven't had a new global ult since Jinx (*October of 2013*) so that opportunity is a very exciting thing.\n\nShe is also so far as I can pull from the top of my head the only ranged champion (other than maybe Thresh and Rakan who are only technically ranged) that can fire through Yasuo's wind wall since her autos are a tether and release and not a projectile. This makes for some very interesting interactions.\n\n___\n\nShe's a champion with a very strong and unique identity, she's interesting to play but has clear and executable counter-play, she advances the lore and story fo the world of League and she has a unique dual aesthetic that works together very well. Does that mean she's for everyone? Of course not, but personally I would argue she's one of the best and most cohesively designed champions we have.\n\n___\n\nAs a quick side experiment, League has a lot of champions, so you can take pretty much anyone and compare their abilities to other champs to label them as lacking uniqueness.\n\n* Gnar's passive is basically any free transforming champion's ult + Shyvana ult.\n* Mini Gnar's Q is basically just a worse Sivir Q with a reset. Mega Gnar's Q is basically a slower, longer Mundo Q.\n* Mini Gnar's W is basically any other 3-stack auto-empowering passive in the game. Mega Gnar's W is basically an AoE Leona Q, or a faster Taric E, or an AoE Udyr bear auto, or a shorter and AoE Xerath E etc.\n* Gnar's E is a short Tristana E with a conditional bounce, or an Ezreal E that has to travel, or a Shen E without the taunt, etc.\n* Gnar's Ult is basically a Malphite Ult, or an Ori Ult, or a Shyvana Ult (activation) with a stun, etc.\n\nAnd yet, it's easily argued that Gnar is a unique champion with his own identity because when it all comes together it doesn't make Elise, or Shyvana, or Orianna. It makes Gnar.\n\nYou get the idea. Point being, a single ability doesn't define a champion, you have to look at the whole.","replies":[{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-11-16T12:16:57.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"her q does clear teemo shrooms through.  I saw one q a minion took out 2 of my shrooms\n\nbut at same time her w is a lot stronger than varus's she can come in with and entire team with her under shroud and hide her w . she also has very close to the same power as varus so she would kill just as fast if she hits it right\n\nfound shrouds 100 times worse than akalis because of the ghouls affect and she can laugh her tanks at you with her shrouds while cloaking who they are and there ability's animations. making it 10 times worse than both but in a smaller area\n\ntrue her r is slightly weak in kill protentional than luxs ult. but 1000 times stronger in situational use and its amount of uses\n\nI don't care for her strength at all really. she isn't a champion as far as I am concerned, also I find it easy to fight her because how I play. this doesn't change the fact she should not have been released at all if she wasn't a champion with her own kit\nI wouldn't want her nerf. I want her actually to be made. be just copy pasted\n\nsenna has no new dynamics for support because she cant currently scale with support items. next year maybe she might with new support items. but currently calling  her a support is a lie. she isn't even used in the support roal at all. who would wasted her on that role when she is very obviously not a support. her only reason for wanting to be bot lane is to increase her scalling with souls collected. we jhave an assassin support now and a lie that we were getting a marksman support. but either way there are a lot more champions that can of meta support that are marksman and ten times better. ash is a support incase everyone forgot that. she is a marksman support. senna is not the first that is a straight our lie from riot.\n\noh well in that case the point is she wasn't designed for support either. \noh and she never had value as a support for that to be erased as far as I have seen\n\nok I see there that is true about the uniqueness about her shrouds capabilities. unfortunately it has an ultimate attached to it so I still find it toxic. but you have a slight point that is literally her only unique quality. \n\nyes a new global ult would have been great with the one they have released they have so many opitions to go with and ways to make it unique unfortunately this was the opposite of what they did with her. just copy pasting over champions ults and saying jobs well done\n\nwait ok that is interesting. ok scrap her entire kit except her autos and passive and rebuild the rest\n\ndon't say she has a unique identity that is lieing man. the story of the game has zero affect on how she is not a champion that is unique. yeah they made a good story for her. no they didn't do any work on her kit. I would argue she is the worst release riot has ever made. she makes yummi and other champions like gragus first realse sound like great champions. that is how bad she was done.\n\n\ngnars passive is unqiue in many ways and was a bad choice. if you wanted to go that you should have said elise and jayce. and is so far from shyvannas ult you couldn't even compare them. except that they transform\n\nI can see the sivir bit but it is nothing like mundos q and that was a horrid comparison. and with sivirs q yes that is an interesting thought there. but look at gnar and his many unique qualities he actualy has an identity. \n\nI would have gone with taric stun as is it nothing like Leona stun. but even with taris stun it is completely different due to his kit and how it is made. but I see the small things that are close. yeah you should have left the others out they were terrible examples are you trying to be broad and just include anything. if so then gnars w is sejs ult sejs q sejs e and so on. then needs similarities not just it stuns therefor its the same.\n\ntrue as is every leap mechanic I agree this is something that is the same unfortunately it is impossible to give movement abilities without using that extremely basic definition \n\nI do like how you choice gnar because he is my main to try take a shot at me. I have obviously annoyed you a bit by pointing out how worthless senna is. unfortunately gnar is actually a champion that has many unique properties and was a terrible choice. please try use a better example \n\nno well actually in using gnar as a point of context you have shown how massively unique other champions are compared to senna and have only shown how she has nothing unique except her auto (which you brought up I find very interesting)\nso please I do welcome anther go as you did put a lot of effort into this I like how you did","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-16T12:53:35.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her Q counts as a basic attack in all respects (will hit towers, wards, etc) so it could damage shrooms yes, but only in the way that autos can.\n\nThe shroud is very small, and given that it's the shroud's primary mechanic, would you not be wary of her team if you can't see them elsewhere? Like it is for many things, vision or just avoiding it is the clear counter-play here.\n\nVarus has burst while Senna doesn't really, and the W does tiny damage compared to Varus' ult too. Her W isn't going to have a bigger impact than a Varus ult in a 1v1, and her ult takes a long time to fire for basically an auto's worth of damage and a small shield where all of Varus' abilities are immediately useful.\n\nIf you see a wraith running at you, you either know who it is because you saw them go into the shroud, or you assume it's their strongest player and play around that. It only cloaks the windup animation, as soon as the ability fires they become visible, which barely reduces the time you have to react to most abilities. It also has a substantial delay to re-enter the shroud, where Akali's is instant, most of her abilities are instant, you can't touch or see her even if you're standing on her, and it lasts longer.\n\nShe *is* her own champion. Her abilities, animations and thematic all fit her perfectly. Like I  mentioned, you could say *anyone* is a copy-paste if you try for it. She is as much a copy-paste as Gnar is.\n\nSupport items are kind of irrelevant though? Support items exist to keep champions relevant in the support role, not as items that supports *have* to take (other than Sightstone). She doesn't need them, so she doesn't take them. Pyke doesn't take support items either, does that mean he's not allowed to support?\n\nShe works great as a support, I should know, I've been playing her as one. Can she be stronger in solo lanes? Yes, but so can Lux, so can Morgana, so can Nautilus or Tahm or even *Bard*. Being able to flex to other lanes does not discount her value or validity as a support. She is arguably more of a support than Pyke is, since Pyke is basically a kill lane like Brand where Senna has Enchanter elements as well.\n\nMega Gnar Q is straight-up Mundo Q lol. It's a projectile that slows. I suppose you could say Olaf instead since it has a reset. But it's literally the same mechanic reskinned.\n\nThe others have as much wriggle room as the comparisons you made to Senna's abilities.\n\nThis is going to have to be an agreement to hard disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-11-17T00:59:30.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes and that is extremely over powered. Hmm i can walk up without orarcle shoot q twice into my adc and be assured there are no shrooms in the path. And she can accidentally clear any shroom or ward just to firing it.  Also tower damage that is extremely op so she can stand outside of tower range and spam q to destroy towers that is plain toxic. \n\nI am always worried about where the rest of the team is thats why i have begun to climb game knowledge and amount of games  played. Either way her ability to launch ghouls is toxic. If it is given a speed buff it needs to be limited to only her.\n\nAnd counter play should never be limited to you must run if she uses this move that is extremely toxic.\n\nNo her stun wont have the same impact in a 1v1 but a stronger impact in teamfights as she can cloak it it releases faster than his r so the team stun is more likely to happen. Taking damage away doesn't change the move.\n\nAkalis shroud is easy to deal with and except that akali is strong as it is massively weaker than sennas. \n\nShe has one unique ability thats her auto she is not her own champion she is a thief that stole from other champions. Actually in using that would make her more unique than she currently is. \n\nPyke has reasons and uses to not use support items and we all saw the hell that came from that the massive mistake it was and it has finally settled down after all the nerfs and swaps on his kit. That actually shows how bad a release senna is. \n\nNo being able to flex her in other lanes does not discount her ability to play support. I said she isn't a support she is a top mid adc with the capability to support. \n\nOh sorry i must have misread when said gnars q to mundo ok yeah mundo q is close to mega gnars q but again is munda q his r no, no its not its his q.  And yes like olafs q very close to like a weaker versions with slight differences i will say that definitely. \n\nMy comparison with sennas abilities were well said and shown you gaviw bad examples and a few great ones. Unfortunately only proving how toxic senna is by doing so. Gnar has stole basic abilities senna has stole ultimate moves. Gnars is a high skill cap champion senna is not.\n\n1. And untrue i welcome this as you have shown tiny peices of senna and what she could have been. Unfortunately that did not happen and we received this thing. I am glad you pointed out Stuff like her basic attacks it shows the things she should keep. But again scrap the entire kit otherwise. Keep her auto attack her passive and if the rest of her kits is removed then keep her q. Scrap her w e r and change them entirely or even scrap her w e and make moves there that would be fair chance for her to become a champion","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-17T02:16:00.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can't Q twice in succession it's a 10~ second CD. She also has to have a target to fire the Q so the chances of accidentally finding something are slim.\n\nUnless she's fed the tower damage is barely more than an auto and it's on a long CD so it's not like she going to be taking turrets with it. She can also only hit the turret from out of its range if she has something else to target through like a minion. She can't just walk up to any tower and touch it.\n\nThere is no spamming the Q.\n\nWhy? There are plenty of abilities and items that give team-wide speed buffs. Righteous glory or Shurelya's are often bought early in the game, should they be nerfed too?\n\nThe counter-play is vision, which is a basic staple of the game. The *backup* counter-play is avoiding it if you aren't with your team. The counter-play for most assassins is to shut them down early, and if that fails, the counter-play is avoiding them *permanently*, not just while they're using one long CD ability. Should we just remove all assassins?\n\nThe projectile is so much slower than Varus' R. Like legitimately half the travel speed. The initial root is also slower than Varus' ult which is instant. The secondary (i.e hitting other people) root is a bit faster, but it's also a tiny range and you have much more reaction time + the reaction time fo the person that got hit to dodge it.\n\nAkali's shroud is not easy to deal with if you don't have AoE or wide skill-shots. Even Red Trinket won't reveal her in it so unless you can predict or chance a hit on her in it you have *no idea* where she is. Senna's position, on the other hand, is completely visible, the ability only camouflages so if you or someone on your team (like your frontline) gets close to her or a wraith they are completely visible. She is also revealed by red wards and red trinket (unlike Akali).\n\nShe is only as much a thief as any other champion. Did Ivern Steal Annie's Ult? Sion's shield? Did Neeko steal Zyra's E? Did Zed steal Leblanc's W? Lulu's Q?\n\nPyke hasn't had any swaps to his kit? He doesn't build support items because he isn't a traditional support. That doesn't mean he isn't a support, just that he isn't following the same strict mould of Enchanter/CC tank/Kill Mage. Senna is the same.\n\nHigh skill cap is kind of irrelevant. Annie is low skill cap while Qiyana is high skill cap, and they both exist and continue to exist for a reason. You have to have both ends of the spectrum. Senna is somewhere in the middle. She's easy to learn but decently difficult to master. There is room for skill to shine through without it being an almost unreachable goal for a lot of people like Azir or Aurelion, and being hard doesn't make a champion good. They are not mutually inclusive.\n\nAt the end of the day though. If you don't like her, *don't play her*.","replies":[{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-11-17T10:34:46.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6 paragraph down yes to all of them and modified them but still yes\n\nYou didnt actually reply to anything i said with the pyke bit\n\nI completely disagree there i think she is easy to learn and easy to master most of her skill cap is other team members learning to play around her abilities. I think her entire skill cap is low. \n\nYou still haven't Said why she has  a 3 ultimate kit.  And i dont just dont want to play her i never want to see that thing in my game.

The problem with Pyke (and what will potentially be a problem with Senna) is maintaining their balance in support without blowing up their power elsewhere and ideally without restricting them to a single role (the philosophy being that flex is good). It's a time will tell type thing because at this stage it's too early to know how much of her strength is because she's too strong and how much is unfamiliarity.\n\nAs for why she has a 3 'ultimate' kit, because they aren't ultimate tier abilities in her kit. If you take Varus' ult, reduce the travel speed/detonation range substantially and gut the damage is it really worthy to be his ultimate? No. Her ult? Because they're weaker. The shield is *maybe* half the strength of a Lulu E and the damage is way less than half a Lux ult. It heavily trades-off potency to get the exxtra effect.\n\nNot sure what the third ult she has was meant to be. If it was Soraka's, I addressed that in my initial comment, it's not a heal, it's a shield.
