I get 5 games in a row last night with adc supports, a yas one trick that plays yas no matter what even if it&#039;s not suited to the role he is given, afk&#039;s and leaver. Then I get banned a few hours later for being upset that this is ACCEPTABLE behavior in ranked games. It&#039;s clear that this is acceptable because you get those fancy little notifications when someone you reported gets disciplined, yet after reported ALL of these people and others like it never do you get a notification for it. \n\nYou can actually get the same quin support, or the guy who spends 30 minutes in top lane with the team muted seeing if he can get to the inhibs before he loses multiple games in a row, it&#039;s almost like riot is trolling you as well. \n\nThe only thing they ban people for is language, despite how pathetic their ranked game quality is. \n_Want to play 1 hero no matter what role ?_ **sure** \n_Want to afk in base and decline ff votes because nobody would swap roles with you?_** sure**\n_Want to pick adcs for support role then build adc and try to bully the actual adc off your lane?_ **sure**\n_Want to ban champions your teamates have declared they will pick?_ **sure**\n_Want to beg for 1v1&#039;s at dragon instead of playing the game ?_ **sure**\n_Want to afk farm a lane for 30 minutes while ignoring the team or what is going on ?_ **sure**\n_got a new champ? haven&#039;t even read the abilities? don&#039;t have a clue what items to buy ? _ **Go for it! join a ranked game and see how it goes!**\n\nAre you mad that you got a number of games in a row with the people mentioned above or others like them? **Catch a ban for it because you&#039;re the problem in the community**\n\nGetting a quality game in ranked is a gamble, Riot does nothing to encourage good play, teamwork, or cooperation and doesn&#039;t stop people from doing everything in their power to ruin games so long as they don&#039;t use their bad words. Ranked has become just the standard que to play in. \n\nYou are expected by Riot to sit there in your chair for 20 minutes while which ever flavour of troll ruins your game so you can get a 4 man FF vote. You are expected to remain happy and satisfied during these games and continue to put in maximum effort while any number of your teamates do the exact opposite. Then use the report feature in game to help better the community...except wait...they don't do anything about it.  \n\nYou would expect to get quality games with like minded people who are working in their best efforts to win the game as that is the goal in a competitive match. You would expect people to make good decisions and not go  Lucian support with all team muted, you would expect people to know how their selected champion works and what to build and how basic game mechanics work. \n\nYou want to improve the community in ranked Riot? Start be banning the people actually ruin the games, not those upset about wasting 20 minutes trapped in the rift while that Lucian sup declines the FF. \n\nTo be clear I&#039;m not mad I got banned, I&#039;m not stressing out cuz I&#039;ve spent a lot of money in the shop, I&#039;m disappointed that Riot is more concerned with bad words than their ranked games being ruined by the collection of misfits who have zero concern themselves for the quality and integrity of a competitive match.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-03-01T20:41:16.318+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BrnK","date":"2018-03-02T04:09:35.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Except for the part where you are making things up. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UHiFc","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-02T05:06:00.609+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, looking at the specific details of that match through Riot's official match history tool [link: https://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/201356987/201873125?tab=overview] it would appear that Evelynnie's statements are accurate.\n\nYou died twice before the 8 minute mark, both of which coincide with a boost to red teams gold advantage, died alongside the Lux *and* lost a turret at the 15-16 minute mark, also coinciding with a boost to reds gold advantage, then only 2 minutes later died *again* and lost *another* turret, and considering the locations of your deaths I can only assume both turrets were bot lane. I'd say that pretty significantly constitutes \"losing lane\". Not only that, but you also ended up doing less overall damage to champs than the Lux, who died 5 more times than you and did worse than you in pretty much everything else.\n\nHonestly, the stats definitely seem to support Evelynnie's statements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2018-03-02T04:33:08.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"????

As for your dislike of others' champion choice: players should have the freedom to play what they want. You are not the sole deciding factor in how a team should be picked and how they should play, nor do your decisions constitute the only way to win. I can understand if, say, you had a Katarina building mana regen items, but I didn't see anything wrong with the Lucian build you had mentioned. This where I'd draw the line in playing off-meta vs not trying to win. If you are insulting and harassing teammates, you also fall into the \"not trying to win\" category. Your teammates are who they're going to be. You will differ on the best path to winning, but being negative to your teammates shows you have concerns that are not focused on winning.","replies":[{"poster":"BrnK","date":"2018-03-01T20:17:13.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"As for your dislike of others' champion choice: players should have the freedom to play what they want.

There are things a support role needs to be able to provide to the team and some champions objectively do not provide those things. This is different from off meta.   I'm perfectly happy seeing people play Brand jungle or strange off meta things that have reason to work. I'm not so keen to see a support with nerf guns and no form of assistance to be given to their adc and team, big difference. \n\nRanked has one objective, to win. Nobody in their right mind would take a VW bus to a circuit race. \n\nAs far as insulting and harassing teamates go, you're right it doesn't help. But this is not the same as tilting over a \"teamate\" trolling. \n\nYou are in the same boat as Riot where you put more concern on how people should react to trolls rather than how to resolve the trolling problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-01T20:40:58.291+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I'm not so keen to see a support with nerf guns and no form of assistance to be given to their adc and team, big difference. \n\nI get that it's not what you want in a support - CC, sustain. But there is added damage there, lane control, and there is the potential to increase your adc's damage to a champion with the right build. Is this something I'll try? Unlikely, but I wouldn't say never. He is trying to win, but just not by your standards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
