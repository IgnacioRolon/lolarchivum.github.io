After the trials and a few more games, I am quite literally Bronze 5. I&#039;ve looked up everything about carrying but no matter how well I do (I&#039;m being perfect serious when I say I will usually go around 5/0/3 until I face off against the fed enemy laners) I have no impact because the teams are that bad. I know that I was dumb to play jg, but I guess I just used to trust people too much.\r\n\r\n Anyways, I need a role and champion that will more often than not give me enough of an impact to properly carry my teammates. I&#039;ve looked at a lot of low elo stuff but squishes feel bad because the enemy always 5v1 roams to me when I do well and then my allies don&#039;t come or even signal then push in the tower, whereas tanks seem to be thick bricks who are hard to kill, but end up dead without a carry to do damage. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-06T00:32:20.745+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say this to everyone thats looking to join the ranked climb =D But I believe this to be true for a good ranked experience.\n\nIMO most champions are viable for the ranked climb.\n\nFirst of all welcome to the Ranked Climb =D prepare to test not only your skill but also your grit and resilience.\n\nFirst up check out these 2 great posts by our Instructor;\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/E5KPW5Qx-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-1\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/xeKp58HJ-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-2\n\nAlso I always highly suggest checking out these videos. Its great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. \n\n1) Your game play and how to improve\n2) Your attitude towards the game and your ranking.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-06T03:00:25.400+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please stop posting that gbay elo hell video from 2012. In 2012 you could carry your team by yourself if you got fed. 2016 it is much much harder to carry.\nThe game is very very different to what is was back then.\nUnless you have experienced  2016 bronze for your self you really have no right to comment about it.\nThe last few matches have seen teemo top trolling, Kennen mid feed the enemy darius and warwick. A nidilee supp that likes to farm instead of warding. Me lagging out in champ select and smite not getting changed which was totally my fault so I let the team down.\nYou can be positive and play well doesn't mean you can carry your self out of bronze 22 lp loss for 14 lp gain after a 6 game win streak is stupid.\nThis elo system punishes good players making it harder to climb due to less lp.\nSo if someone trolls then that's a loss of 24 lp.\nSame as mmr. I lost 4 games due to trolls and lost just under 200 mmr but yet those 6 wins I only gained about 50 mmr.\nThe system was better in 2012, it was easier to climb the game was young, the community was good and trolls were very few.\nOce was killed by a non existent tribunal which to this day some think getting reported does nothing.\nThose posts you posted as well the guy who climbed did so with friends. The are very few players I think that are good enough to queue with.\n\nSeriously come and spend a day in bronze with me and I bet ya you will soon get frustrated and start tilting watching the most stupid plays ever.\n\nThe best thing for bronze would to actually make a test league. One where if they don't buy at least one pink, farm so much cs or even ward more than ten times then they get kicked out of ranked and only allowed back in after so many bot/normal games.\nBlizzard did this with Heroic dungeons and it was the best thing.\n\nIf you didn't get at least silver in the proving grounds then you couldn't queue for heroic dungeons. This separated the good players from the trolls/trash players.\n\nThis is what riot needs to implement, something like this. That would clean out bronze real fast making it a good environment to play in.\nthen you would know that the play is having bad game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-05T04:23:39.073+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amumu or Graves jungle.\nHave a feel of what your laners are doing, how pushed they are.\nChoose a lane that has strong engage or hard cc and wards.\nIf you gank and they don't engage or even react then don't go back to that lane.\nIf you are ahead go and counter jungle.\nIf your laner is winning their lane then always gank that lane and push hard for the tower, buy them pinks, clear out enemy wards and show your presence even if they ward because it will put them in two minds ebcause they know you show your self plus sometimes that enemy laner can tunnel and not even see you coming for a gank.\nDon't ever gank a losing/feeding lane unless their enemy laner is low. When that laner is feeding it makes it very ahrd to gank because the enemy laner is ahead and sometimes the enemy jungler will counter making it a very hard gank to win.\nIf a laner is not warding by a sightstone and ward his lane but this can be useless because they are too dumb to watch the minimap.\nAlways try and get scuttle crab and ward while you are in that side of the jungle.\nDeep warding also helps you laners giving enough time for you to watch minimap and ping the fuck out of your laner to get back. Doesn't always work due to dumbos.\nWatch foxdroplol and other youtubers for tips but this still can only take you so far.\nDon't play on tilt. if you lose three games ina row, go and have a rest or play another game.\nAlso don't listen to people saying carry yourself. This is a team game and you can only do so much.\n\nHope this helps from a fellow bronzie jungler having the same problems.","replies":[{"poster":"Unfriending","date":"2016-09-05T06:46:58.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, I appreciate the advice and tips, it certainly sounds like you're better than the average bronzie, so good luck getting out <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-05T03:20:29.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Unfriending,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q9zrZaVY,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-05T01:30:13.312+0000)\n>\n>I am quite literally Bronze 5.\n\nAs opposed to figuratively/metaphorically Bronze 5?","replies":[{"poster":"Unfriending","date":"2016-09-05T06:55:10.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people use bronze 5 as an insult or to describe how badly someone is doing :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-05T03:23:52.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q9zrZaVY,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-05T03:20:29.710+0000)\n>\n> As opposed to figuratively/metaphorically Bronze 5?\n\nSpiritually ;^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-05T11:20:50.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q9zrZaVY,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-09-05T03:20:29.710+0000)\n>\n> As opposed to figuratively/metaphorically Bronze 5?\n\nThis comment made my day.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-05T11:23:11.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miicka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=q9zrZaVY,comment-id=00030002,timestamp=2016-09-05T11:20:50.783+0000)\n>\n> This comment made my day.\n\nYou're welcome.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Stubzie","date":"2016-09-07T23:36:20.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try {{champion:31}} jg, im B3 climbing my way out , i usually play with a 5 man team and have comms through discord. but cho post 6 with some stacks and ap can turn a lane very quick. if im jg i always go some one with decent cc ala vi or cho.\nI dont even bother playing ranked if i dont have comms with at least one team mate","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T02:42:05.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"If you can't carry from the jungle role in BRONZE 5 then there's an issue with your own play, not just the play of your teammates.

No matter what, you'll always have something to complain about, regardless of what role everyone is in. Don't expect many mechanical plays from bronzies. The sooner you understand that, the easier it'll be for you to carry. \n\nAnd actually, it takes quite a lot of IP to gather enough for 16 champions and 2 rune pages. I recently leveled an account to 30 and I purchased about 2-3 champions with RP, and I am still missing about 10 more champions in order to start queuing up for ranked (I am also missing an AP rune page). Because it takes twice as less time to level an account to 30 now, you need a lot of IP before you're even close to getting enough champions for ranked. Players are allowed to start playing ranked whenever they think they're ready, and because you're in bronze, that is where most of them end up. How long did it take you between hitting 30 and playing ranked? I'm going to assume not much time at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Unfriending","date":"2016-09-05T06:59:47.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It may take time before people can play ranked, but some people don't have the motive to actually improve and continue to make the same mistakes. My biggest frustration is that carrying from the jungle doesn't involve my skill level most of the time. You are perfectly entitled to say that there is something wrong with my playing but whilst I'm no where near a challenger, the fact that in the majority of games I will triple my KDA ratio and at least double my KDR, which leads me to believe that I do have the skills and mechanical wisdom to climb. \n\nMy issue with carrying from the jungle is that playing assassins (those junglers who take kills) is hard when all lanes feed but playing tanks (like amumu) can be hard if the laner doesn't follow up on the gank or even worse gets a massive lead then continues to die, which makes it very hard because assassins are too snowbally to be reliable unless the enemy laner is weak but tanks are unlikely to carry because some teammates just don't listen to engage. \n\nThen, when you play a laner, the jungler usually is of no help, which makes things very sticky in the long run. \n\nAnyways, I'll follow your advice and play a tanky/CC jungler whilst ganking as much as possible, but hey, maybe the guy who just went 10/1 in a ranked game as ekko and the game before went 12/3/20 as zac \"belongs\" in bronze 5.","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T08:05:04.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just checked your OP.GG and already off the bat I can see a plethora of issues that have nothing to do with your team. \n\nFirst of all, your win ratio is 18%. 13 wins to 60 losses. You cannot expect me to believe that of all those 60 losses, your team and ONLY your team was to blame. Absolutely fucking not. That is a garbage win rate and you most definitely 'belong' in Bronze 5 if that's the kind of win rate you have in an elo where you supposedly go '10/1' on Ekko in ranked (which was actually a normal and you STILL lost being 10/1....)\n\nSecond of all, your KDAs are just as garbage. You barely hit a 1.3 KDA on each champ you've played this season (which for some reason is only about 3-4 times per champion before you move onto the next one). You need to stick to a couple of champions and roles that you're good at, instead of playing anything and everything. Master a few things rather than trying to play everything and I guarantee you'll start seeing some improvements in your play.\n\nAnd for the love of God, please upgrade your trinket. It's amazing what you could do with a sweeper and a pink ward. \n\nSo yes, you do 'belong' in Bronze. I don't need an entire history of what goes on in your games about who died and why.
