In Dota 2, you can do a bunch of different things by way of team comp; solo offlane with trilane in safe lane, solo offlane with jungler, 2-1-2 etc.  In League, you basically have to run solo-lane top, solo mid, jungle, zero-cs-support and Attack Damage carry.

Pretty easy to memorise if you're coming from Dota 2 since we have a wider variety in which all of the items are useful.\n-League only has AP, or AD, nothing really much, straight simple, and now Riot is trying to remove everybody's fun by not making troll builds viable because they just want you to play a champion in only one-direction.  You either do your fking role, or you don't.  (RIP AP Yi, AD Teemo, AD TF, AP Tristana, AD Soraka, AD Sona, and lastly, AD Fizz for current meta.)  You could argue that you can still play them like such, but they aren't as effective anymore.\n-No couriers, however you have a free teleport to base and you can pick free spells such as flash and heal because when you outplay your opponents they can just say f*ck you to your face and heal and flash away.\n-Don't be afraid to yolo in League\nIn League you don't lose gold when you die.  So just yolo the fk every time you can get a kill without giving a f*ck because you can still flash and heal away (heal gives movement speed).\n-No tower diving early levels in league\nBasically if you're having trouble in lane you can just tower hug and still get exp because enemy can't deny minions.\n-No uphill/downhill mechanics\nDon't be afraid to kill an enemy who is up the hill.  Sun Tzu art of war doesn't apply much in League.  You can get away with playing like a retard and still win because League doesn't punish you too hard.\n-Backdooring\nIt's easy to backdoor in League, in Dota you take millions of hits to bring a tower down, but League's turrets are like pudding.  Also, league doesn't have much backdoor mechanic unlike in dota.\n-Voice chat\nYou don't have one.  Play with friends over skype.\n-Farming\nLeague farming is like breathing, it's so natural and you will get last hits 90% of the time if you played Dota.  Seriously go try it, it's so easy.\n-Runes\nYou don't need AD runes to be honest if you come from dota, last hit is so easy in League that all you need are attack speed and armor pen runes.\n-Skillshots\nYou can spam so much skillshots in league.  If you're from dota you'll land 90% of them.  Stop doing mana management calculations.  Screw that and just spam skills, you've essentially got infinite mana in league as to dota.  And by the time you've used up all of it somehow, you probably have so much cs you can back and go on a shopping spree with your 6k gold by 10 min.\n-Items\nJust get boots of speed and 1 health pot.  Last hitting is already easy enough and mana and hp regen is so quick you won't realize what's coming.  Also, if you get the mastery which gives you hp and mana for every last hit, that makes it even better.  Minions in league hit like a pussy, so you shouldn't even have your hp bar going less than 9/10 in the first place.  Boots will make you run like a truck so no one can harass you.\n-Harassing\nDon't get into enemy champion's range to harass.  You need to get used to what their skills are, in which case, unfortunately, you have to grind IP to be able to counter them unlike in dota where you can try everyone for free.  So this needs in game knowledge really.\nBut generally:\nwhen enemy melee champ comes near, poke and run.  They can't land a single skillshot on to you because there is no turn rate in league and you run as fast as  a ninja with those boots.\nwhen an enemy ranged comes near to harass, run, or trade blows (not recommended since you're trying to be a farming god, and not have enemy jg to pop out and kill you), and when they try to go for cs, poke and run, which compensates for you denying the minion.\n- Pub games\nGenerally you can just go out of your lane when it's safe and when there is no cs to be taken (like when lane is pushed and under their tower, you don't want to get ganked), so ward the river or enemy jungle and take their buffs when you see that it is safe (i.e. Enemy jungler is ganking another lane, and all 5 are on the map).  They will be so pissed.\n- Get a sightstone\nMost people think this is a bad investment, but since you'll be getting your core so fast due to ez last hits thy won't see it coming that you can just buy a sighstone which gives you FREE wards.  Did someone say free?  Not only that, you can plant 3 at ONCE. and when you go back to base, you refresh their CHARGES SO YOU CAN WARD MORE.  Best item in my opinion for a player coming from Dota.  Vision wins games, play strategically, learn when and when not to engage, you can do so much with wards (which only costs 800 gold and gives you HP at the same time).\n- Play passively early game and as safe as you can\nSince it's so easy to dodge skillshots which you have no turn rate as well, might as well keep farming for your tools.  I guarantee that in pub matches that people will be so mad that they can't hit you that they are prone to charge in and make mistakes, which of course you can punish them by slapping their arse and give them a good beating, kill them if you have to, but be careful to not overextend unless you have vision of your surroundings (buy wards) in which you can kill.  If they play passively as well, it's all good because you're bound to complete your build earlier because you get to last hit better than them.  Although it might be tempting to last hit from high hp, please don't let that ruin your dota career in the future, as it can make a bad habit.\n-Meta\nthe current meta will be that people will try to push your tower as soon as possible.  Punish them so hard by getting a jungler to gank when they AA all the time.  You get a free kill that way.  If you're jungler is dumb enough not to gank, not to worry, you get so much advantage  this way as well as the enemy spends most of their time in frustration that they can't kill you under the tower, and that they can't farm when minions are under the tower, leading to them making mistakes by trying to get a hit on you if you are able to be hit under tower whenever possible, and wa-lah, you just basically traded hits with them, with you dodging all their skillshots and you landing all of your skillshots on them.  Please volvo, what is turn rate?\n- Don't let LoL spoonfeeding make you a bad player!\nDon't get caught out of position for gods sake.  You can troll by yoloing in if you wanted, but that doesn't mean feeding their carry a penta kill because of your stupidity.\n- Heroes to win with which are easy to play.\n* Blitzcrank - oh my god this dude is cancer.  Basically you can literally just either hook someone to your tower (because the map is so small), or you run up to enemy up punch them in the face and do aoe silence.  Build full ap on this dude because you will literally wreck havoc everywhere and squishy ADC or APC will be so mad at getting killed so easily with 1 30 second ult (or lower due to cd reduct, your choice).  Or you could play tank, but who needs that when you can dodge all ss, have a free barrier if you screw up, free heal if you screw up, free flash if you screw up, low hook cd if you screw up, low overdrive cd if you screw up, low punch cd if you screw up, low ult cd if you screw up.  You can turn a fight into a 5v5 to a 3v5 with proper positioning in a teamfight (support and adc or apc are generally squishy).\n* Vayne - jesus, this champ is so easy to play as, and she has the highest adc in the game.  The jungle is essentially yours and all you have to do when a %%%got 1v1s you is ult, Q, E, and do the right click of death and  spam Q.  Get Furor enchantment on boots and you'll essentially be kiting them so hard and tumbling away to tumblr heaven.  BoTRK for more kiting and attck speed madness, as well as escape. When running, Q away, hit, and ur furor enchantment will get you running in no time, Q, condemn them to wall, and run again like the bastard you are, Q, hit, and then use BoTRK, rinse and repeat.  By the time the enemy with higher mobility than you has come along, your team will be there by then to help you, or if it's him alone (watch map), generally high mobil champs are squshy as hell and just condemn them to wall and right click of death please.  If they are tanky, your name isn't vayne if you can't shred a tank with your high damage, high mobility kit, stealth, amp amp amp dmg, 2 second Q cd, a stun, a passive which deals true damage on every third hit.  (with your items, you essentially deal over 40 percent damage to tanks in just 3 hits!  and you still have your botrk 10% damage of their max hp, plus stealing their move speed to kite them, AND you can deal 6 hits (16 percent of their max hp from passive W only ;D) + botrk current hp dmg each hit, plus your Q resets AA if you Q on a wall and it deals 50% increase base damage, and your ult deals a fuck ton of added dmg, plus your items which amps even MORE DAMAGe and ends up killing your targets in 9 hits in 4 seconds essentially. \n\nGosh im tired.

It isn't unheard of for Vayne or Quinn to go to top or bottom, and the same goes for Zed. And of course, a lot of top laners can work the jungle and vise versa.
