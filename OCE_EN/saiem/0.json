I think a lot of this comes from getting my friends into League, playing with them while they leveled their accounts and learned the game.  I don&#039;t like ranked because my wifi can be sketchy and I don&#039;t want to let down the team because of that, can I still improve my MMR and get away from the HORRIFIC players I see in normal draft games?","replies":[{"poster":"Merry Br√°ndybuck","date":"2018-09-08T00:32:01.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals MMR is a seperate \"ranking\" from your Solo q and Flex Q MMR, the only way to really improve it would be hitting some nasty win streaks.","replies":[]}]}
