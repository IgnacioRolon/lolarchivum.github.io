Wanting to get more information before turning to the boards, I looked into Jinx's (the scripter) recent matches as well as his/her LOLKing.  So I am asking for some ruling against Jinx or for a rioter to keep tabs on this person to see if any 3rd party program is in play to keep these types of Rule Breakers out of this game that I love.  Images will be linked below.  I also would like to point out in the LOLKing Climb image the incredibly steep increase in ranking from right when Jinx reached Gold.\n\nLOLKing Climb from 16/11/2013 to 01/03/2016\nhttp://puu.sh/nqItu/4549382454.png\n\nMatch History of 01/03/2016\nhttp://puu.sh/nqMvV/ab13007e1e.jpg\n\nDamage In Game\nhttp://puu.sh/nqIib/cfd3ef4c10.jpg\n\nThis game was a Pre-Made 5 and after checking the other 4 teammates in Jinx's team they are all a Pre-Made 5.  If Riot chooses to keep an eye out for the others players in the team with Jinx, that would be amazing.  Also I am a Platinum 4 player nearly Platinum 3 and would really hate to get someone like Jinx in my game.  So I am also doing this for myself and future people who have to vs this Jinx.\n\nEDIT:  If nothing is wrong then I have no problem, just want to absolutely make sure.  Also they said that in team fights the Jinx was dodging EVERYTHING.  Against a CC heavy team such as this one, I get a little suspicious that they didn't hit anything against this Jinx.\n\nThank You for your time and hope that Justice will be served.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-01T10:38:45.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Against a CC heavy team such as this one, I get a little suspicious that they didn't hit anything against this Jinx.\n\nShe has 5 death's, a Scimitar, A janna (the peel queen), Lulu (the utility mid laner for protect the carry comps), Shen (ult shield and taunt's) And to top it off a Nautilus (the single target lock down for the team)\n\nThey clearly hit things to get her to 5 deaths, but against a team like this, it doesn't matter what you hit, it's not helping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-01T09:06:46.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, could you please remove the names as it is [against the rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) to name and shame. ♥\n\nWhile it is a little suspicious, it is completely possible that they legitimately got good. I have a friend who went from silver to diamond during preseason/before mid-feb this year, as well as a friend who went from bronze 5 to diamond in half a year.\n\nIt's also possible that within his 5man premade, his team works really really well together with all the communication and co-ordination needed to get those kinds of scores.\n\nIf you are suspicious of a player that may be scripting, be sure to report them in the post game lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"SmashBro","date":"2016-03-01T09:13:51.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh they did but it's just to make sure.
