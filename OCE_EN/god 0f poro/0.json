Even if I have the 2600rp to transfer it still no possibility to change region. Idk if it&#039;s not available during pre-season or something else and I&#039;m wondering if you can only change region once.\r\n\r\nFeel free to tell me any  information you have, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-11T10:38:40.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Server transfers are down right now.
