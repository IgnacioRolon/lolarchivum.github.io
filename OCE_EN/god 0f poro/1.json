Missions needs to be as long as they have to play about 3-4 Games. \r\n-5 Missions * 10 Champions = 50 Missions.\r\n-Then each lvl 30+ player will randomly have two of the 50 missions (It can be on the same champ or not)\r\n-If the player make the two missions in a week he has the choice to get a permanent chroma or two key fragments / a chest depending on what he needs (someone with 15 keys and 0 chest in the loot will get a chest for example) (if he has all the chromas he gets the chest / key loot)\r\n-During the other week, the missions are off and at the end the 10 new lowest pick rate will be select with their new missions.\r\nI think this can make a lot of people playing unpopular champions and help to not forget them because they are &quot;useless&quot;.\r\nI hope you enjoyed reading my post, and sorry if there are english mistakes it&#039;s not my mothertongue language.\r\nGod 0f Poro, Player that want to see more Iverns in games and less Yasuos.\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Those missions can be unlockable at lvl 35 or 45 to be kind of a reward for leveling up.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-15T06:05:03.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a whole game mode to make people play a larger variety of champions.\n\nIt's called ARAM.","replies":[]}]}
