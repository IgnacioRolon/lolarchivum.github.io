BUT I argue that it'd still be an excellent tool to utilize in PvP as an AFK buffer.\nAfter all server issues AND afk are unfair fields\n\nAdditionally as Bunny pointed out one could just leave to save the team in a defeat. However if the afk penalty is severe enough no-one will be willing to make that sacrifice.\n\n-Original post as below, I'm keeping the sarcasm, it fuels me-\n\nThe &#039;Loss prevented&#039; feature in ranked was once the only buffer between your LP and an unfair game situation (In this case, &#039;AFK&#039;). The system it ran on was &#039;earnest&#039; at best but in most cases fairly protected your rank and reputation whilst still rewarding the enemy for their (typically lucky) victory. Needed work though, I get that.\n\nBut hell to that, bit too much _slight_ tinkering to do to make it function, am I right? Yeah nah lads, scrap it, can&#039;t have Entropy and fairness floating around like a day old fart now can we?\n\nTime and time again I&#039;ve been on the losing end of an AFK, and usually the enemy is very gracious. 9 reports later and I find no action taken on rectifying the issue, with only my LP I had to lose for all the _nothing_ to happen. Neato burrito. So if we don&#039;t want to solve individual cases then &#039;Loss Prevented&#039; is quite literally our only shot.\n\nHard to program? Too bad. That&#039;s what coders are paid for, they love a challenge.\n\n**This is how I suggest it runs;**\nTEAM WITH 4 PLAYERS\n* Unfair playing field\n* Gain NO &#039;Pity LP&#039; BUT AT THE LEAST don&#039;t lose any either (Gosh that almost sounds logical)\n\nTEAM WITH NO AFK\n* Free LP yay! LP rates are the same, bad luck is bad luck FREELO bois~\n\nOooootherwiiise~ Riot Games (as a well established MOBA gaming company) are (as highlighted in this thread and as evident in literally every god damn ranked game ever)\n* Removing a logically sound and fairness balancing mechanic (Line 1-2)\n* Taking little to no evident action in the current &#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;method&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039; of punishing those whom leave the games (Lines 4-6)\n* Continuing the Youtube-ranted-ongoing-consistently-ignored-clear-as-day-blatant-issue of punishing the unlucky (Line 5)\n\nIf Riot is already working on reviving the system, kudos! I tip my fedora-the-explorer to you. But people of the community; Cmon, seriously we need to add some pressure to this issue, we&#039;ve aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall~ experienced it regardless of rank please vote below.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-07-07T14:05:07.962+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loss Prevented still exists.

I know this doesn't really help when you have an AFK in your game after the time period is up but out of 20 games as an example you would be pretty unlucky to get even 1 AFK. I've definitely had days where it feels like I get nothing but leavers but at least in the last 20 games I have had I haven't had one and if I had it was a D/C at 3 minutes to which we could remake.\n\nI think the loss prevention you are talking about could probably be exploited if you knew you were going to lose the game so someone just left for the benefit of the rest of the team. I know it's not highly possible in solo queue but it could definitely happen and the last thing Riot would want is to have their features exploited for personal gain. The only gain they want is how big their wallets are becoming.\n\nLoss prevention is typically only used in cases where this is a significant amount of people have connection issues. To which Riot will activate Loss Prevention because it is a problem with their servers.","replies":[{"poster":"Armageddon Tired","date":"2016-07-07T14:43:42.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if the AFKer got a heafty penalty then no-one would be willing to make the sacrifice","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-08T00:36:09.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately it is still too easily abuseable.

Wrong, you implement a personal scoring system so for those who actually try in each game mode and are there for the whole time will gain something out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Armageddon Tired","date":"2016-07-07T12:57:22.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty please?
