Got perma banned and I shit you not. On the game reviews that come up of my chat are so fucking mellow it&#039;s not funny. I&#039;ve seen people flame way, way worse, feed then AFK and what do they get? Fucking nothing. Yes i&#039;m swearing and cursing right now but i&#039;m so pissed it&#039;s not funny. The &#039;Game 1&quot; review was my last game I played. I didn&#039;t get a report after so unless Riot is just watching my games I don&#039;t see a reason that&#039;s there. In this game I wasn&#039;t the one flaming 90% of the time. I had 2 of my team mates call me shit and start talking shit about reporting me afterwards What do they get I wonder. Most likely FUCKING NOTHING.\r\n\r\n I&#039;ve spent money on this account and now that&#039;s all gone for what you may ask? For being a little bit talkative in games and having butt hurt people reporting. I have actually spent around about $500 on this account maybe even more (most likely alot more). and all of that is gone. My money has been stolen from a Butt Hurt person who got a bit hurt off of my either typing in caps &quot;wtf are you doing&#039; and even saying &quot;That was fucking stupid&quot;. Which yes I have said a couple of times. Most of the time I will only say &quot;That was stupid&quot; and they wouldn&#039;t mind. Maybe if I play with mates we can tell each other that they &quot;Fucking suck&quot; and they wont mind yet I cant tell someone that they are &quot;playing like and idiot&quot;. How does that work. \r\n\r\nSome people need to fucking man up on this game because they are acting like some fucking butt hurt little fucking 10 year olds.\r\n\r\nTLDR; IM FUCKING PISSED ABOUT A PERMA BAN\r\n\r\nYes I realise half of this is just me rambling on nonesense but come on. Money spent on an account now gone. Wasted. ITS FUCKING IDIOTIC","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-05T09:05:15.402+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI understand that getting banned (especially permanently) can be a hard thing to take in. But I need you to remember that this has been a long time coming, and you were given plenty of time to reform.\n\n> League uses a **4 tier punishment system**:\n> \n> 1. **First offense**: 10 game chat restriction\n> 2. **Second offense**: 25 game chat restriction\n> 3. **Third offense**: 2 week ban\n> 4. **Fourth offense**: Permanent ban\n> \n> You might have also received some warnings as well, for very mild offenses. You can read more about the punishment tiers [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/_ga=1.67894481.1391421436.1448910774).\n>  \n\n> It also doesn't matter whether you thought the behavior was acceptable or not. If you got perma-banned then it's clear that your in-game behavior was insulting other players frequently, and was unacceptable in League.\n\nIf you still believe you were banned unfairly, I recommend you post your chat logs here as a reply or new discussion. That way the community can tell you were you might have gone wrong, and help you improve for next time.\n\nUnder [Riot policy](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201898070-My-Account-is-Suspended#h1q2) we can't actually get back your account. But if we find that you were actually reported unreasonably or unfairly, we might be able to give you some compensation in return. \n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-03-08T17:01:06.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being able to create another account in 5 sec and start his toxic spree again is not harsh!\n\nThis is the reason why you have the MOST TOXIC GAMING COMMUNITY in the WORLD!\n\nCONGRATS RIOT!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-05T22:03:28.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does the escalation process ever \"reset\"?
