Not being able to reconnect back into a game is just complete bs. And I now have to wait 10 minutes before a queue just to play..... now tell me if im wrong but technical issues that wasn't my internet cause I checked it while I dced, and wasnt my pc either cause its brand new. And I get punished for it. I even described to my team mates what happened but cause they are dense shits they wont listen and blame me for everything when you look at their scores and they are doing terrible 4v5 or not. Now it probably cant be reversed but please can you guys do something about not being able to recconect so this isn't hard on a small group of players","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:03:34.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing's perfect man.","replies":[]}]}
