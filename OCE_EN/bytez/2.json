This started to occur this season. After I press &quot;Launch&quot; the button goes grey and nothing happens for a while. Eventually it will launch if I&#039;m lucky but it takes a long time, and after patches it doesn&#039;t launch at all. Reinstalling helps launch the game once but after that the same problem continues to happen. I have spent hours searching for a solution and I believe that uninstalling my AntiVirus (Bitdefender) is the only one that seems to work. However, I do not want to do this because it is actually a good AntiVirus. \r\n\r\nIs there a way around this problem? I have tried adding League to the Exclusions list multiple times but it never works. There has to be another solution. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-09T05:11:37.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYou said your antivirus seems to be causing this issue, have you added the entire LoL install directory (Default **C:\\Riot Games\\**) [to your antivirus exclusion list](http://www.bitdefender.com/support/how-do-i-exclude-a-folder-from-being-scanned-[bitdefender-windows-8-security]-1067.html), if not then try that and report back.\n\nIt's also possible that your antivirus comes bundled with a firewall which is causing you issues, see below for steps on how to add league as an exception in your firewall.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Riot KB,realm=OCE,timestamp=2016-03-08T16:58:59.450+0000)\n> **ADDING EXCEPTIONS TO YOUR FIREWALL MANUALLY:**\n> Here is a list of executable paths that you will need to add to your firewall's exception list:\n> \n* C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\lol.launcher.exe\n* C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system\\rads_user_kernel.exe\n\n> **Special Note:**\n> \n> These next three executables may be located in different directories depending on the current version of the game.

I got fed up and Uninstalled just to prove my hypothesis. The moment it was Uninstalled League booted up perfectly with no problems at all. I installed another AntiVirus just in case and I now have no problems. Since BitDefender is indeed a top tier AntiVirus it's a shame that I had to Uninstall it due to such an issue, but it's fine since I can just reinstall it when I want. \n\nThanks for your replies and concern.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-12T03:41:53.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear all is resolved.
