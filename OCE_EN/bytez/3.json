My question isn't about that. I'm sure there must have been questions about this before but I wanted to know that, when the Tribunal does finally come to OCE, will reporting a player for no reason get them banned? I would seriously love to get all the Trolls / AFK'ers / Toxic Players banned, as they ruin the gaming experience for everyone and make LoL a game where you become angry, instead of playing to have fun. As much as it will be good to ban these horrible players, what if THEY report us? Us, the players who don't intentionally feed, troll or get into unnecessary fights with our team. The players who don't blame the team, assist the enemies or leave on purpose. This has been bothering me for quite a while and I would really like an answer, or a link to a thread / post that does have an answer. I just think it would be really unfair if WE got banned for no reason, after being reported by some kid who's mad over nothing, after we have done nothing wrong. \n\nOnce again, an answer or a link to a post with an answer would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-15T20:54:12.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you aren't doing anything wrong it is easy to see from the chat logs that get published and scores and item builds.
