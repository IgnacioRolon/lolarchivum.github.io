I come across this problem on a regular basis. It's a fault in the coding.\n\nHere's what I do to fix it:\n\nStep 1) Open windows explorer.\n\nStep 2) Navigate to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\\"\n\nStep 3) Create a new, empty file in the latest version folder named \"S_OK\", with no extension.\n\nStep 4) Start League with admin privileges. You may get the same error. Try once more and it should work.\n\nIf it doesn't, tell me and I'll look for something else.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
