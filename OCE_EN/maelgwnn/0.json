We did actually find an issue with our match history over the weekend, which was causing the behaviour you saw (being redirected to EUW match history).\n\nThis should be fixed up now though, so let us know if you are still seeing the problem.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-20T23:52:52.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I for one know that your region is **not** dictated by the url you use to visit League. You can be on oce.leagueoflegends but still on the EUW boards. I'm not 100% sure how to fix this but I find that meddling around with the region selection enough eventually fixes it.\n\nBut what is the strangest is that your account is on OCE, not EUW, so there shouldn't be *anything* appearing for you there. Did you ever transfer your account from region to region?","replies":[]},{"poster":"phantasy","date":"2015-02-20T10:42:55.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im getting same stuff pretty annoying.
