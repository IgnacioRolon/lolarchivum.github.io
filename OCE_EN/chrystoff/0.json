Using 60Hz or 50Hz as your refresh rate and a resolution of 1280x720 (even just once) might fix it permanently.\n\nAlso, use Window's native tool to scan your hard-drive for errors. You can do this by right-clicking your Local Drive and then clicking on the \"Tools\" tab. Suggest you make a back-up of it first, and its repair *may* delete files.\n\nThis next one might be a no-brainer, but do you have any other applications open while running League? Even things such as automatic maintenance or background virus scanners can cause huge lag on a computer, because most of them don't really expect you to be playing video-games on them.\n\nTry cleaning your registry with a program like CCleaner.\n\nAs a desparate move, you can try [reinstalling the game](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) (be sure to [back-up your item sets](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752904-Item-Sets-#h4q1) and config files!).
