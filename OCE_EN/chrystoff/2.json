I&#039;ve made custom games of this too often and been met with the sound of crickets rolling by in a tumbleweed. I decided I&#039;d make an event in here and see if my luck changes!\n\nSo, join me on **Domination Day, Thursdays at 8pm** (AEST or GMT 10+), where we will make Summoners Rift look like a yordles tea party!\n\nThe name of the game will be 'Domination Day', so just search for that in the custom games lobby on the day and at that time and I'll have it up and running.\n\nEdit1: I will have a chat room open at that time too, and it will also be called 'Domination Day', so joining this would make it easier to get matches going for the event.\n\nWeek 2: Well, 1 person showed up on the time, and we managed to scrounge another 6 throughout 30-40 minutes to have a 4v4, but it turned a bit one sided since we had a new player (level 3) on one team who was not sure how a monitor works, which isn't his fault! all in all 2/5 stars. :(\n\nWeek 3: I've lost faith.","replies":[{"poster":"Kirex","date":"2015-08-31T08:12:32.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend using a chatroom so that everyone can be on the same page once you start getting more people.","replies":[{"poster":"Chrystoff","date":"2015-08-31T09:29:45.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea! thanks buddy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Razikaler","date":"2015-08-30T02:32:29.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh, Sounds fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-08-28T06:13:33.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll join in when I can...
