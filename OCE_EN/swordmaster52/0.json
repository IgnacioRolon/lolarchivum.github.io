Who were they to know that you were in a premade? Perhaps you hit a sore point for them, since this kind of toxicity is a trigger point for a lot of people and the type that the overwhelming majority of the community vote to punish at the highest level. \n\nYes, what the other person was saying was inflammatory and would have also flagged their account for review and potential punishment (if you reported them).
