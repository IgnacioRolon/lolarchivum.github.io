Given that so much time has passed now I doubt they could do it, and that may or may not have been before all outstanding codes got deactivated (to prevent resale of skins like Black Alistar for a crapton of money) which complicates things further.~~\n\n~~You could still submit a ticket to player support though, you never know. https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new~~\n\nSeem's a skin fairy may have seen your post, sus your client notifications :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bazzible","date":"2018-11-24T03:52:49.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nani the heck, I saw this and was so confused, checked my notifs...nothing happened...very confused???, then my friend told me to check my ward skins and omg wtf ty skin fairy","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-24T08:56:41.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-24T07:12:16.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Golden Alister and Riot Tristana skins for social media follows?
