So wanted to ask if there was anything I could improve on.

Bait, you know when to do it (your team is squishy and hangs back). Deliberately set yourself up like you got picked. \n2. Absorb multiple enemy ultimates and key cooldowns\n3. Get your ult out, your E up and q. Also activate exhaust if you are about to die and your activate your locket of solari.\n\nThat right there can win team fights and games\n\nThere is even the chance that you will be able to escape with your W.\n\n\nIf you are ahead, don't bother with this tactic.

Dying as a healing sup is worse than dying as a tank one (cos healing sups are never supposed to be taking the hits.)\n\nPersonally i don't think that there is any other kind of support to play in ranked other than tanks ones (because in this cancer assassin meta, no one else ever picks a tank, so the task always fall to you)","replies":[]}]}
