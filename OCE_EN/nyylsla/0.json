Previous months were ok but this few weeks they were a mass of them(like at least 2 in a game), mostly are in premade groups so solo players are forced to coup with there behaviour. I am sure reporting them would have no use as i have reported every single that are toxic. i hope riot would do something about it as it is naturally unfun now.\n\nSince the game is snowbally, they didnt even care playing safe,going 0/3-0/6 in the first 10mins. giving advice to them is useless and they will scold you back.\n'\nThe point is these players are all about themselves or \"selfish\" whether they feed and drag you along with you. I dont see how these team strategy games gonna develop with these players around","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-12-16T04:24:36.758+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":1,"body":"I firmly believe that if you can't read and speak the language of the ToS, then you should not play that game/on that region.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-12-16T06:17:38.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":6,"body":"The context of this thread seems to be that it's an issue exclusive to Chinese/Mandarin speaking players, yet I'd argue that you'd find significantly more English speaking players who do the same kind of things in-game.

They tend to duo and flame everyone in their own language, using insults like 'fk ur mom' and 'orphan child'. While not only being incredibly abusive, their over inflated egos make them impossible to flame back, and talking back to them will almost always cause them to afk or troll.

Especially at night here in Perth almost every team mate and enemy is someone who doesn't speak english. Why is this bad? This should be obvious and affects everyone - \n\nHow can you pick your lane in champ select if they don't speak english? Obviously a normals issue however I only play normals. So the only option here is to let them literally instalock their champ (which they almost always do) with nothing said in chat as to where they're going or what they're doing. You're forced to go whatever lane is left, usually support, and deal with them in game for the next 20 minutes minimum where the next issue arises.\n\nThey don't speak english in the game itself. Little to no pings but speak in chinese in chat and expect us to know what the hell they're saying. The only english that i've seen them say is when they're telling me i'm bad or that all Australians are bad. I believe there was a report option not too long ago that literally was failing to communicate. So Riot is not going to enforce the fact that you literally cannot communicate with them? \n\nIt's the lack of communication which is why this needs to stop. I haven't read the comments on this thread yet but after this post I will and you can bet that if I see anyone trying to refute OPs claims with anything along the lines of 'it's a small issue' or 'deal with it' then you will find me there refuting every word of that persons reply.
