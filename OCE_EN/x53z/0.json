I mystery gifted my friend and he also received the Magnificent Twisted Fate.  I do think that they should rework the skin, not remove it as it is unfair to those who actually bought the skin for 1820 RP at the time it was released. Besides, other than this skin, I don't think that there are other legendary skins that need a rework.\n\nBut (on a side note), I read that the skin was/is/is now worth 520 RP according to an app I have. Riot, can you fix this for us?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-17T04:43:07.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you take skins out? That's ridiculous and pretty messed up considering people need to buy them.\nBut yes, regardless of how rare they now are, they need to get nice texture updates like every newer skin does.","replies":[{"poster":"x53z","date":"2015-02-17T04:49:00.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt say i wanted them gone but i want to know what the community thinks.","replies":[]}]}]}
