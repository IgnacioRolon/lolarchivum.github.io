I couldn't get the skin alone with 975 rp because it says We have just changed the price of the skin, please come back later. So i bought the bundle which was 1463 (which i believe is the full price containing rek sai even i already have him) and i was hoping that there was a deduction in the price after bought. and there wasn't. SO i ended up spending 1463 rp for the bundle and 7800 ip for the champion. I believe there is a bug in the store or bundle cause i couldn't buy the skin and normally if you buy something thats in the bundle, the bundle's price will go down. Can i get a refund or something cause i paid more rp /ip then i should. \r\n\r\nI did get both the champion and the skin which was a good thing.\r\n\r\nP.s there is a purchase history thing that i attatched about my purchase","replies":[{"poster":"Krausy13","date":"2014-12-14T00:06:20.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got rek't :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Melbourne Zico ","date":"2014-12-11T21:29:46.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rek sai not rem sai","replies":[]}]}
