(resources can only be picked up by the team who generated them but if they die and drop it then it is free for all). \r\n\r\nThe resources would be used to upgrade your base in 3 different ways: (all upgrades last 6 minutes)\r\n1. Build a moat that slows enemy movement by 30%\r\n2. Upgrade towers to do increased damage also area damage\r\n3. Protect the base in a magical barrier that grants a temporary shield to allies when they pass through it and absorbs 50% of enemy ranged attacks.\r\n\r\nThe map would be a circular shape with a node between each team base. At the middle of the map would be a boss monster that gives a party buff or a huge payload of resources. Roaming monsters of increasing difficulty will be found throughout the map. (each time a group of monsters is destroyed they re-spawn stronger, so a tactic would be take out enemy monster patrols to make it harder for them to gather resources)\r\n\r\nThe aim of the game would be to take out your enemies bases and protect your own by gathering resources to upgrade defenses. If a team is aced by the enemy they lose a random upgrade to their base.  Surrender option will only be available once 1 team's base is destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe picture attached is a rough outline of the map:\r\nred, green and yellow dots are team bases\r\nblue dots are resource nodes\r\nand purple dot is boss monster\r\nthe lines between them all are roaming monster routes\r\n\r\nSo there it is!  Let me know what your thoughts are?\r\n\r\nCorvis Colvein","replies":[{"poster":"Corvis Colvein","date":"2014-12-03T02:33:52.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"say it was just a 3 team nexus fight, you could make it the first team that destroys an enemy nexus wins, so you wouldn't have a whole team waiting for the game to end because it would end at first nexus defeated.\n\nThe roaming monsters would still be fun to have.\n\nThe resource gathering isn't necessary, although the nodes could be made into extra gold per 5 seconds for the team who owns them\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T09:51:49.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't quite like the concept, but I have always liked the idea of a LoL gamemode with three teams. I would prefer the standard nexus setup on something which is like a Y for this, and think it could turn out quite interesting. For example, if one team was getting ahead the other two teams could work together to beat them down. However, my thoughts on something like that would be that it is cool... but... but... could you imagine if your team lost and then you were sitting there waiting for the game to end for half an hour?
