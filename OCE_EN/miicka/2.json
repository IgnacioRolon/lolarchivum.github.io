The concept of being Right or Wrong is a purely theoretical construct, created by humans to ease understanding. Right and wrong don't exist in the animal and plant kingdoms. \nThis means that because there is no fundamental rule laid down by nature as to what is right and wrong, right and wrong is what humanity as a whole decides it to be. Therefore it is a majority rules, whatever the majority think is wrong, becomes incorrect, and what the majority considers right becomes correct. for example Smoking was once correct, it was beneficial to health and longevity, now it is incorrect as we know that to be inversely true. (this also implies that we see living as being correct) \n\nWe as a whole view murder as incorrect, therefore we consider having thoughts about murduring someone, incorrect. When in reality, killing another member of your species is a natural thing. (lions often kill even their own children) but as effort o survive as a group we needed to feel safe, and the only way to feel safe among your own kind is to prevent you from killing eachother, so viewing murder as incorrect is a survival mechanism, its not some rule laid down by the universe. Incest is also considered incorrect because it makes the offspring genetically inferior, and thus cannot ensure the survival of the human race. So as a survival mechanism, we consider it incorrect and this prevent people from doing it. \n\nTherefore if having murderous or incestuous, thoughts is considered wrong in public opinion. That means that thoughts themselves can be wrong, and opinions are nothing but thoughts, so opinions can be wrong depending on society's current standing on it. \n\nLook at the Nazi's for example, it was their opinion that it was fine to torture and butcher anyone they thought was inferior. Now that is just their opinion, and they are entitled to it, but 99% of the population would consider their opinion to be wrong or incorrect. \n\nSo if the Nazi's can have opinions that are incorrect, then that logic can be applied to every opinion.\n\nHowever then we can have facts, for example I can be of the opinion that giving Zed mana will make the game more balanced, and you could be of the opposite opinion. Neither of us will ever know who's opinion would actually make the game more balanced.\nBUT just because we cant measure something, doesn't mean it isn't there, either giving Zed mana or taking his resource away entirely, will very slightly make the game more or less balanced. We can never truly measure that change of course, but one change will be more correct than the other in making the game more balanced. This means that the idea's expressed in one of our opinions was wrong, and one was right. \n\nThe Nazi's opinions are considered wrong, and that is 'subjectively' wrong because its a majority rules thing.\nOne of our opinions on Zed is considered wrong, and that is 'objectively' wrong, because regardless of what we think, there is a right answer and one of us will be right and the other will be wrong.\n","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-31T14:33:17.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes the boards comes down to moral thing.
