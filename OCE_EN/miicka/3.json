I agree, a lot of the 1350 champs are fun to play, but I already own all of them lol. I have Olaf, and I'm absolutely trash at Nidalee, but I will definitely try out Anivia as she looks really fun, and I've had my eye on Sona for a while now. As for ADC I'm thinking of getting twitch.

I'd offer some advice though and that is to find the style of champion you like. For example I do well with and enjoy the long range AP mages. Morgana, Orianna, Lux and Zyra as an example are a few of the AP mages I like. I enjoy playing all of them but my number one champion I have fun with is Lux. Even though all the others are AP mages and I find them all fun I think Lux is just my number one and can always play a game with her and win or lose I'll have a good time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-07-25T19:57:14.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miicka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=rk5IKJzd,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-25T07:04:08.567+0000)\n>\n> So I want a new champ and I just hit 3300 ip with first win of the day.

Can be played AP or AD, its fricken hilarious when your rocket jump resets from assist/kills in a team fight and you're contribution is literally just 3-5 jumps onto champs with your W, get good at it in team fights, though its not as strong as an auto, its just good fun jumping on peoples heads, seeing them die, and you jump on someone elses head instantly! \n\nEveryone wants to say AP blitz cause of the Q and R combo... but go top lane bruiser AD blitz... knowing people are scared of clear space between themselves and a blitz is hugely fun, anyone tries to stop you farming, just grab them and W and auto beat down, the moment they run, knock them up :P or just W/R them, keep beating, the moment they run, your slow ass 8-16second Q grab is available (generally trades only last a few seconds, so opening with Q as AD is not that good)... \n\nOnce you hit 6, melee range is god... Q not needed, Q is for people who realize you're just gunna beat down and try to run. knock up into silence :) wins most trades, just realie its not AP, you'll do a bit of damage but top generally has some tankiness, the scale on the abilities won't last, you gotta learn how to melee with him appropriately :) \n\nPanth, is personal, i find him great fun, i know most people dont see how fragile he is and just ends up dying time and time again on him cause on the otherside of the coin, being able to virtually block the first 2 hits in a trade is godly and amazingly tank. Takes time to get down well, i don't seem to use him hugely well in rift (usually positive scores), but aram i find him to be... sweet jesus i cant remember the last time ive done a game worse than something like 12-4 15-5 10-3 etc and not just from trying to use Q to KS. But actually engaging well and fighting smart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DannyMac","date":"2016-07-25T11:34:03.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune, mainly because of her ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-07-25T11:54:36.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune was actually the most recent champion I bought haha.
