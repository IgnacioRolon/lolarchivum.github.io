And she takes skill now. If anything, she&#039;s probably stronger than she was before the rework, its just now you actually have to learn how to play her well.\r\n\r\nSo please, shhh. No matter what you say Riot is not going to revert her back to her pre-rework. And for a good reason too, because this rework is fair for **everybody**. Marksmen, squishies, immobile champs and even katarina.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-11-09T22:20:28.692+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait? Kat taking skill!!???

I may have only played one game with her (and against another Kat in-lane, mind you) but it just seems a great improvement. She really seems a lot more intuitive and flowing now. Before the change I had quite a bit of difficulty managing to use her even decently, but now I can just jump in and be able to pull off amazing plays (well, amazing for a Silver who should probably be Bronze) without having to spend 50+ games practising. Then, at the same time, I know I'm just not using her to her full potential. If I *did* put the time in to practice, I'm confident I could do it. This just feels like how champions like Kat *should* work, and Riot have pulled it off quite well in my opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2016-11-10T00:18:30.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually i like her more now o.O am i the only one?","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-09T18:40:04.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree to be honest.\n\nFirst few games with new katarina went like shit but after i started to get the hang of her i realised there is so much more damage potential there.\n\nInfact only issue i actually have with new kat is the playstyle seems kind of self contradictory, she still needs to wait till the perfect scenario to be able to engage but she now also has a slight bit of setup required with dagger placement.\n\nWorks fine in teamfights, infact works better than ever in teamfights, just makes her early game trades a little worse (or harder i guess is the better word)","replies":[]}]}
