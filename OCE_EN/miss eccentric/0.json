Veigar&#039;s door swung open, Veigar stood there rubbing his sleepy eyes. It had occurred to Lulu that it wasnt 8:00, the streets of Bandle City had been empty the whole time that she had been standing in front of Veigar&#039;s old, redwood door. He let out a final yordle yawn, it was more of a mouse squeak than a yawn, Lulu liked this about yordles, they were naturally adorable._\n\n_Lulu could smell Veigar from where she was standing, he smelt more dusty than usual causing her to sneeze softly. &quot;You know,&quot; Veigar&#039;s morning breath smelt... utterly disgusting. But his soft, croaky voice made up for it, &quot;you came way too early today.&quot; Lulu felt bad for waking him up, she spoke with an apologetic tone in her voice, &quot;I know, I know... I&#039;m sorry but I was really excited today.&quot;_\n\n_Every now and then, Veigar and Lulu would explore the forest, their mission was to know of every speck and flower in the forest. Their days in the forest would usually consisted of jumping, running and hide &#039;n&#039; seek... although neither one of them were good at playing for they would always get caught up in inspecting a rock or chasing after a toad. Lulu loved exploring, and Veigar had a curious mind, they were simply made to be friends._\n\n_Veigar stared at Lulu and shrugged. Lulus green eyes were filled with too much determination for him refuse. He looked down and let out a loud sigh. Veigar proceeded to close the door but Lulu stuck her foot out to stop the aging door crashing into her face. &quot;You don&#039;t want to come?&quot; She felt a bit hurt by this, even though she was 3 hours early. &quot;I&#039;m going to get dressed...&quot; Lulus mouth pulled into a toothy grin as she nodded furiously, as if she was charging into battle._\n\n_The door reopened, creaks following its every move. Lulu had been squatting on the ground for a solid 5 minutes and she had started to get restless, her eyes widened when she heard the creaks and she immediately jumped up from her position._\n\n_&quot;Lets go?&quot;_\n\n_&quot;Lets.&quot; Veigar&#039;s voice was softened even more than it originally was when he said this, for he had formed a smile as soon as his eyes met Lulus excitement. Lulu dusted off her dress and started to walk towards the intimidating forest, Veigar trotting right behind her. He let out another yawn and looked over to Lulu&#039;s face. She was always happy and she was the one who always gave him hope. Veigar smiled again and nudged Lulu with his elbow, &quot;want to race?&quot; \nLulu grinned at this challenge and counted down from 5 with her fingers. Her last finger hit her palm and the two yordles set off at full speed on the tiled, down-hill road._\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nLulu stood by the large, superior, blue turret of her lane, watching the destruction and killing happening ahead of her. Staff in hand, she set her eyes on her enemy, the dark magician also with his staff, taking down everything in his path. His wicked cackles echoed throughout the lane, a yordle driven into complete madness. Lulu&#039;s eyes started to well up with tears as she stood under the protection of her turret, gripping her staff with Pix by her side. Memories come flashing back, the memories of their playful days, when only innocence set up camp in their hearts.\n\n&quot;Scared?&quot; Veigar cackled and proceeded to attack minions in attempt to get closer to Lulu.\n\n_&quot;Don&#039;t be scared Lulu. It&#039;s only a spider.&quot;_\n\nThe truth was, she was scared. She didn&#039;t want to hurt her friend, she still cared for him even after Veigar&#039;s isolation, even after madness poisoned his brain. It was her fault wasn&#039;t it? It was her fault that he ended up like this. She could&#039;ve helped him but she never took the time to notice that he had been taken away. She left him when he needed her most.\n\n_&quot;Lulu wait for me!&quot;_\n\nLulu wiped away the tears from her rosy cheeks and took a step forward. She glanced at Veigar, killing and overpowered as she let out a short sigh. Her mind had always been set on protecting Veigar, yet when he needed saving, she failed him. She never wanted to abandon him. She wanted to save him this time, but that wasn&#039;t the way it was supposed to be. It&#039;s impossible to save everyone.\n\n&quot;Pix.&quot;\n\n_&quot;Veigar, when we grow old like our mums and dads, will we still be friends?&quot; Lulu looked to her right, setting eyes on an old painting of a golden hourglass. Veigar could tell that the thought of not being friends concerned her, she was never one to like being alone. He smiled sweetly and place his hand on top of Lulus head. &quot;Lulu, i already told you,&quot; He lowered his head and kissed her forehead gently, &quot;we will be friends forever.&quot; Veigar could feel Lulus smile as she wrapped her arms around his waist. &quot;Promise?&quot;, Lulu whispered tearily into Veigar&#039;s stomach. Veigar nodded and sighed, &quot;I promise.&quot;_\n\nHer voice cracked and she had finally given in, &quot;Let&#039;s go.&quot;\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nThanks for reading.
