I am known for my assassin based champion pool and my very aggressive playstyle, however I need a team to compliment/synergise with me and a team that I can synergise with. My main champions include: Rengar, Yi, Volibear, Udyr in the jungle and specific champs for other lanes, hence I regard myself as a jungle main (though I can play most champions well to some extent). \r\n\r\nIf any teams of the community are happy to have me onboard, feel free to add me, \r\nIGN: Reyn time","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2015-12-20T14:58:46.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont want to be a party pooper >_> but if you want a \"VERY serious\" 5s team it will be very hard for you. I mean you might get in one but a diamond will come along and take your spot most likely. I'd suggest getting higher division before you go for super serious teams but I wish you luck!","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2015-12-21T00:37:57.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You want me to get a higher rank.....when I've been stuck with really trashy teams. Although this excuse seems repetitive, you should take a look at the teams. Also, since when was serious 5s, exclusive so to speak?","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2015-12-21T02:12:29.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Serious 5s isn't exclusive, by all means you could get into one. But most of the time a platinum won't be in a serious team for long because there will be a diamond with better mechanics, better champion pool and/or better game knowledge and they will kick you. It's happened to me multiple times and I am diamond lol. Good luck for finding a team that will keep you it will just be hard because you're only platinum","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-20T16:32:10.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats ur elo","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2015-12-21T00:38:32.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plat 3 (was Plat 1, almost diamond mid-way through Season 5)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chance The Wolf","date":"2015-12-20T14:31:39.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ill join even though im a level 8","replies":[]}]}
