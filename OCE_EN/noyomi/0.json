It's about doing the right things in the game.  My last S was on Sivir and I scored 7/7/12. The reason I got an S though was because I recognized our win condition and implemented it. We were getting smashed in the team fight, but I had Sivir so I knew I had some split push potential. I implemented that strategy and every time somebody came to lane to push back I used my Ult to disengage, which let the rest of the team keep control of the other lanes. We eventually had the momentum and the other team finally made a mistake and sent Oriana on her own 3 levels behind me by this stage to stop the push (instaed of the usual 2 or 3), so at that point Ii decided to 1v1 her and take her out and from there we were able to take out inbhbitors and win the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FreshHomework","date":"2016-07-10T22:19:45.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's about how much damage you have done in total and how you carry your team. When I receive the most kills I don't get and S but when I carried my team and was the only one not feeding I got an S but we still lost. It's also about the people you play with. Pretend someone on the enemy team is queueing with a beginner and he feeds you kills or even if the enemy team has a feeder, you may think by the amount of kills you have got from him/her will give you an S but I'm pretty sure that Riot has something that can detect that.","replies":[]}]}
