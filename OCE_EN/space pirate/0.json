You can use w to be able to cast it straight away, but then you are forfeiting the opportunity to stun until your w comes off of cooldown again.\r\n\r\nWhat i propose is that instead of reducing the cooldown of his q and e, Zilean's w should instead allow him to cast his next basic spell independent of cooldown. That way if you cast w when your q is on three seconds cooldown, you can cast your q and then it will still come off of cooldown again in three seconds time.\r\nThe best comparison to this is Rengar when he has five stacks, he can cast any of his basic abilities whether they are off cooldown or not, but casting them does not change the cooldown that they already had, allowing for the doubling up of one spell.\r\n\r\nThis does remove the ability to double up on both q and e cooldown refreshing at the same time, but most of the time people only need to reset one of these cooldowns anyway, either to stun, or to escape/chase.\r\n\r\nI would be very interested to hear other people's thoughts on this, particularly if any Riot staff see this.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-16T08:03:19.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My first question would be, what about his ult?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-16T08:27:45.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP did specify basic spells.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-16T21:12:18.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
