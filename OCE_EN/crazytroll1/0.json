During the game our support kept flaming me the entire game and kept ganging up on me with his friend the ADC and kept trying to trigger me, it was only the support and the ADC who reported me and I got a perma ban for it. I understand I didn&#039;t say the nicest things to them but I didn&#039;t swear at them or say they were bad, I just kept telling them how it wasn&#039;t my fault for them dying. I ended up muting them halfway through the game so I couldn&#039;t see what they were saying. I also never received a warning saying my next ban will resolve in a perma ban which I believe is not okay as a player because if I know my account is on the line I would watch myself a lot more carefully and not say anything in chat at all. Also if the people who are in my game are flaming me and I&#039;m just stating facts I don&#039;t get why I should be the one getting banned for it, they were toxic to me so I was just defending myself. I am willing to do anything to get my account back, I have spent over 500$ easily on this account and just to see it all go away without letting me know that my next ban will be a perma ban is not right. Please review my ban, I am more than willing to do anything to get this account back. If not I will be asking for a full refund on all the money I have spent on this game through this account because that means you guys took my money and now you took my account away from me so I wont be able to use the money I have spent on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-15T06:17:36.692+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sorry because you're banned, because your money is lost, or because you know you abused people on such a level, repeatedly, that you're given a perma ban eventually?\n\nTo get perma ban from verbal abuse alone, which is usually barred by multiple layers of punishment unless really severe case of abuse in 1 go, there isn't that much ground to work in your favour you know.\n\nNot to mention, full refund because you're banned makes no sense, your previous transactions/businesses have nothing to do with your current banned status. It's like saying if you go about insulting everyone in a whatever store, so much so you're thrown out of it and blacklisted from ever entering again, to which you ask for a full refund from all the money you've spent in that shop because you can never enter again; does that make sense to you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-15T06:21:12.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> they weren't saying the nicest things either.\n\nNot relevant.\n\n> I also never received a warning saying my next ban will resolve in a perma ban\n\nWas your last punishment a 14-day ban? If so, that's your warning.\n\n> Also if the people who are in my game are flaming me and I'm just stating facts I don't get why I should be the one getting banned for it, they were toxic to me so I was just defending myself.\n\nIf you've been banned for what you said in-game, then logically you were *retaliating* not \"*defending*\". It's an important distinction to make and most people think that retaliating is the same as defending, even though they might not realise it. You can feel free to post the chat logs and one (or more) of the board-goers will be able to point out the kinds of things that would've got you banned.\n\n> If not I will be asking for a full refund on all the money I have spent on this game through this account because that means you guys took my money and now you took my account away from me so I wont be able to use the money I have spent on this game.\n\nYou're not getting a refund full-stop, and here's why:\n\nFirstly, the money you spent on the game was to purchase Riot Points, which are an in-game currency used to purchase in-game goodies. No where in any of the transactions you made (or in the TOU or EULA) was there anything about \"being entitled to a refund if the account you're using gets banned\", therefore you have no basis to ask for a refund. Riot has fulfilled their end of the transaction by providing what you've paid for and *nothing* more.\n\nSecondly, the accounts and all their assets (champions, skins, runes etc) are *owned by Riot* and loaned to you, as a player. This includes Riot Points and anything you purchase with Riot Points. By spending money on the game you are paying for a *service* (access to RP, skins, champions, icons etc), a service that Riot is free to revoke if you break your agreements with them. This is stated in the TOU and EULA, which you *should* have agreed to before being given access to the game (if you haven't then you didn't even have any rights to be using the account).\n\nLastly, this situation has resulted from you breaking the rules of the game, which in direct violation of the TOU and EULA. It is the TOU and EULA that govern whether an individual is allowed access to the game and it's assets and, as such, if you've broken those agreements you have forfeited any rights or privileges the TOU and EULA may have granted you.\n\nAs a final note, I would like to point out that if you wish to dispute the ban you may contact [support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) by submitting a ticket explaining the situation. They will review the ban and determine whether it was a false positive or whether it was deserved. If they determine the latter, the account will remain banned and you will have no way of regaining access to it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-15T05:31:30.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like losing a friend suddenly to a car crash.\n\nI feel for you bro.\n\nR.I.P CrazyTroll1\n<2016 --- 2017\nBanned for being crazy\nBanned for being troll\nBanned for being 1 of possibly many\n\nNow we wait for Seras Dragon to say some parting words.","replies":[]}]}
