The problem is when i go to click on the &#039;League of Legends&#039; icon or the exe file or whatever to actually try start the LOL logo appears then disappears quickly. I have already tried deleting all of the files and tried all of the fixes on the internet i could find. For example i have deleted the patcher and launcher and basically everything. I have changed my screen resolution, still nothing, ive run it in compatibility mode still nothing. Just then i uninstalled and deleted everything league related off my computer then went to the OCE lol site to download the game again. Getting the exact same problem i could download the installer fine and that ran up to a point where the league logo would pop up with a thin white loading bar underneath it this got to 60% and then disappeared without anything happening. When i was attempting earlier fixes like deleting the lol launcher file and patcher file out of the RADS folder it would get to this abovementioned point and then just disappear at the thin loading bar at 60%. It would also pop up with a pvp.net patcher kernel is not working every now and again. Like i said i have tried all of the fixes i could find and tried running as admin etc etc and  just then tried reinstalling nothing is working. Any ideas, any help is appreciated.

It'll definitely help out in narrowing down the cause of the problem. Can you try the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article? \n\n>1. Switch to a wired (ethernet) connection. Wireless connections may be weak or have interference, causing a disruption and preventing a stable internet connection to the League of Legends servers. \n2. Disable any firewalls and/or antivirus applications that you may have running. These firewalls may block outbound and inbound League of Legends connections, causing some serious problems and preventing you from getting on the Rift! For help disabling your firewall(s), check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\n3. Disable IPv6, as the League of Legends client is designed to work with IPv4. For help disabling IPv6, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4).\n4. Configure your DNS to use a public Domain Name System. For help configuring your DNS settings, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5).\n5. If possible, try port forwarding the League of Legends ports. For a list of the ports that League of Legends uses and more information on how to set up port forwarding, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq8).\n6. Check for VPN and proxy usage. If necessary, [**reset your Internet Explorer settings**](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings). \n7. Disable IP Helper. To do this, open the start menu, search \"services\", and select \"Services.msc\" or \"Services\" (depending on operating system). Locate IP Helper, right-click on it, and select \"Properties\". On the properties page, select \"Startup type\" and select \"Disable\". Under \"Service status\", click on \"Stop\" and then apply the settings. \n8. Now, lastly, [**flush your DNS and release/renew IP**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq10).","replies":[{"poster":"AceDM","date":"2015-11-25T03:12:14.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried all of this and also resetting winsock i have restarted my router and i am on an ethernet connection.

I changed from ad-aware to avast and now it works perfectly. I think some antiviruses might block this patch from properly patching it. Good luck, hope this helps a bit!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
