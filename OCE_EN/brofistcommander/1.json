To my horror I was thrown into a group of new players who just hit level 30.\nMost games were a struggle and the four games I did win was due to the same situation happening on the enemy team which allowed to feed enough to carry the other 4 players on my team. I even won a game back dooring with Soraka. xD\n\nThis actually put me off from playing ranked games.","replies":[]}]}]}
