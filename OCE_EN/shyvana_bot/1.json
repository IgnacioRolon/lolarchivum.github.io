I used to play league to have fun, but ever since i moved from NA when the OCE servers opened up I came to the realisation that the report system doesn&#039;t work. No one would help us, our cries will forever be unheard. Riot doesn&#039;t care about us, nothing will ever ben done about the state of this community. I used to be a good person, I would always start the game with a good luck and have fun and end with a gg. But game after game of intentional feeding, hate speech, bullying and more from team mates and allies playing league is no longer worth it. And before people quote the old &quot;Just mute them&quot;, muting doesn&#039;t stop the ekko from walking down mid lane in your promos, muting doesn&#039;t stop the nami from sitting in base spamming laugh all game, muting doesn&#039;t stop the 4 man premade from sitting in your lane taking your farm while spamming laugh. \r\n\r\nBut it has reaches the point where the past 3 games I consistently displayed toxic behaviour. I told multiple people to kill themselves. At one point, an intentional feeder asked &quot; do you want to hear a joke?&quot; and I replied &quot; I want to hear about your murder case on TV, I also want to hear about its not being pursued because everyone is glad you are dead&quot;. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Good bye league. I enjoyed you but the people that play you are horrible people and the people that made you don&#039;t care.","replies":[]}
