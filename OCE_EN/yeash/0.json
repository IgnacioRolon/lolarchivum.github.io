Oh how this was a bad idea...\r\n\r\nMy first game was awesome, I was playing Thresh and ended up going like 3/5/25 or something similar and got S-, so I was feeling pretty good about myself.\r\n\r\nThe very next game, I got completely abused the entire game, was called all sorts of horrible things, told to kill myself etc.... \r\n\r\nI was just wondering if this was common in LoL as I have been a long-term WoW player and thought I&#039;d jump ship to see what it was like.\r\n\r\nDoes this game have a good community or am I best off playing something else if I wanted to chill out and make friends?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-05-08T06:32:24.420+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey summoner! \n\nWelcome to League of Legends :)\n\nUnfortunately behaviour like this is something that you will run into during your time playing.\nPeople will argue till the cows come home regarding how common it is (personally, I only ever see it in ranked games and maybe 1 in 20 normals). \n\n**Even though this behaviour does exist, it isn't something that you have to put up with! **\nThere are a few  features (both existing and coming) that lessen the impact of having jerks in your game, as well as systems in place to punish them for their behaviour. \n\n**in game**\n\n* Mute text feature - best used as soon as someone starts showcasing some toxic behavior, as that way you are less likely to tilt off it. \n* Mute pings feature (coming soon)\n* playing with friends (avoid toxicity all together)\n\n**Punishing toxic players**\n In league we have a [instant feedback system,](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) where you report players and they get punished. If their behaviour is incredibly toxic (eg, racism, sexism, encouragement of suicide) they often recieve a harsher punishment. You can report players (and see the report categories) in the end game screen, by hovering over their name and pushing the red exclamation mark. \n\nReporting players using this system is of the utmost importance, as every report through this system not only helps it learn what players consider unacceptable behaviour, it also stacks up against the player. If the player isn't automatically punished, the report is still counted against them if they continue in such a negative manner. \n\n**The ultimate best way to have fun in league of legends is to play with friends, and luckily there are plenty of ways to make some.**\n\n* You can post on the [team recruitment board](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment)\n* Join one of the facebook communities like [summoners society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/)\n* Add players that were nice to play with after game\n* Join up to your local university club (you are at university and that's a possibility)\n\nGL HF ♥ ","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-08T12:43:04.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Feedback system is broken, it never listen to us Lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-05-08T23:12:07.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the amount of \"help I was banned\" messages, I'd beg to differ. \n\nJust because you didn't get the pop-up notification or you see the player continuing to play, doesn't mean that the report went unnoticed. \n\nThe player could have received a punishment right away from IFS in the form of a chat restriction. \nIt could have been their first instance of slightly toxic behavior and the report is safely stored away to count against them if they are further negative. \nThey could have been punished by leaver buster and are sitting through low priority queues to get into game\nThey could even be in line for a manual review if they keep getting reported but IFS isn't picking up anything it can find to be banworthy.\n\n\nJust because you don't see it, doesn't mean it isn't working.

You are the only one. For me it's 19/20.\n\nI find your response wrong, aside from playing with friends to avoid this type of thing.\n\nSo you're saying the reports against a player \"stack\", do the \"stacks\" fall off, because it seems my account is blacklisted as a negative player or something like that, even though I would rather be the friendliest person in the team and have no intentions of arguing, you get people who are quite provocative in ways you obviously don't see because you only see toxic behaviour 1 time in 20 games. \n\nJust because people aren't being racist, sexist or anything of that sort, they cans till completely ruin your game and it happens quite often, so a lot of wasted time. You should read my recent thread because it has many counterpoints to what you've stated. The report system is entirely broken.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/4peEHvPM-unfair-punishment-poor-report-investigations","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flúffy","date":"2017-05-08T09:50:43.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man if you wanted any help or to make new friends ill be happy to lend a hand","replies":[]},{"poster":"AmProTho","date":"2017-05-11T19:34:20.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here, read this: [My Thread](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/4peEHvPM-unfair-punishment-poor-report-investigations)\n\nThis is the type of thing you will be dealing with.
