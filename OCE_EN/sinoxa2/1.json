They ended up buying all the same items and running into towers - a poorly scripted AI if I do say. I have created much better scripts in my lifetime.\r\n\r\nPlease remove these accounts from our community.\r\n\r\nP.S. I took advantage of the opportunity and spawn killed the enemy AI multiple times.\r\n#AniviaMain\r\n{{champion:34}}","replies":[]}
