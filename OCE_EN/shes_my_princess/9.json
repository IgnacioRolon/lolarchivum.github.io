It&#039;s no wonder nobody&#039;s wanting to queue up as support. I haven&#039;t personally had it SUPER bad, as I can imagine it could be much worse, but how is going from supporting in plat 3 games to supporting bronze and silver players a thing? There&#039;s so much variation in skill levels at the moment that playing support isn&#039;t feasible given it&#039;s a lucky dip to who you&#039;ll play with and have to rely on. I&#039;ve had bronze players on my team consistently. I&#039;m only imagining Challenger support mains having to support a silver ADC&#039;s whilst queuing up in flex right now, expecting to be in lane with people their skill. \r\n\r\nOther roles I wouldn&#039;t expect to mind so much as there&#039;s fun to be had with more mechanical plays and dumpstering kids, but when you&#039;re support and _have to rely on people for the majority of the game_ on average who are a lot worse than you, consistently, it&#039;s pretty disheartening.

I can have real impact on the game and win a lot easier in Plat that at the lower end because as you say - players have a clue and support is taken seriously by the team.\n\nThis flex thing is totally messed up.  I got placed into bronze (down from plat), then proceed to win 16 straight games to move back into Silver.\nNow I have this bullshit \"1 more game to get real rank\", and I win it and \"You are now Bronze 2\".\n\nSeriously? I got penalised......FOR PLAYING WELL... AS SUPPORT!\n\nThe data science team needs to work with program design - because the system is TOTALLY FLAWED.","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2016-11-17T12:08:40.329+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What we need is a support players union!\n\nPower to the people!\n\nSeriously though hahahaha sounds like you got worked over real bad by the system :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-17T13:30:11.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No that was everyone, they fixed the MMR (sort of) and made us redo a game to check.\n\nPretty sure it's still fucked mind you.","replies":[]}]}]}
