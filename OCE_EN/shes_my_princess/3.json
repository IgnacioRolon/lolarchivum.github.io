The first was less malicious when a friend of mine was told they&#039;d get a free skin after the game. Now this. What is this and why is it a thing? What&#039;s Riot&#039;s stance on using this to claim to be a riot employee (Which is totally believable, if not for the continuous torrent of abuse coming from this ********&#039;s mouth the entirety of the game)?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-23T04:05:58.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Falsely claiming to be a Riot employee, regardless of how it's done, is taken very seriously and, if I'm not mistaken, generally leads to an instant perma-ban. I would definitely recommend sending the original screenshot(s) to [Riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) with a (short) description of the situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2017-04-23T04:33:06.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's weird. Six years and I'd never come across anything like this, then twice in the span of three days. No idea what's changed to allow people to use that font, but I can definitely see it being used for some bad stuff. I'll do that, though. Cheers.\n\nEdit: Submitting a ticket is a huge hassle. Keeps telling me to post in the appropriate board before wasting their time with it, so I guess it'll die here. I'm sure they know about the font anyway - I'm just hoping the dude in this case is dealt with.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-23T04:40:43.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's got to do with the fact that this \"/me\" command has recently (and suddenly) become much more commonly known. It's not like there aren't people who will jump at the chance to take advantage of something like this (as I'm sure you're aware), but this \"feature\", while (seemingly) not being intended, is such an opportunity for the individuals who would do such things. It's certainly allowed people to more easily trick others who are less informed.\n\nEDIT: Going to \"Submit a Request\" then choosing \"I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games\" should allow you to submit a ticket for review. The support staff will then be able to direct it to the player behaviour team. It honestly seems a bit ridiculous how Riot has that set up, but not much we can do about that.\n\nI can tell you that Riot most certainly is aware of the command, there's been no indication of whether it will remain or not as far as I'm aware. It's possible that situations like this would be considered when making that decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-23T05:46:13.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like what happened a while back where in game you could make your text appear on the line after your name (so it'd just be white text instead of Player (Champion): text. People used that to claim all sorts of bs too. As you say, best thing to do is to submit it in a ticket. \n\nAs for why they don't have a \"I'd like to report someone\" it's because it's not the best way to report people so they don't want to encourage it. Like in OPs case, it would have been better if he'd simply reported the guy after game with a note that said in pre game lobby he was claiming to be a Riot employee. Ticket reporting should only be a last resort kinda thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
