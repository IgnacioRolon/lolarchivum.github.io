Are there other wireless networks nearby (neighbours?) that might be interfering?\n\nThat kind of thing can kick in for no apparent reason and can cause strange intermittent problems like this.

This setting is related to your ISP, not your connection, necessarily.\n\nOn Windows 8.1, go to your Control Panel, **not PC settings**, and then go to Network and Sharing. If you can't find it, then you can just right-click the networking icon in your taskbar and then select \"Open Network and Sharing Center\". Click \"Change adapter settings\", right click your adapter and click \"Properties\", scroll down to the bottom and select the one with IPv4 in it somewhere and then click \"Properties\" again, and BAM, you can change your DNS.\n\n8.8.8.8 as primary and 8.8.4.4 as secondary.\n\nYou should be able to use your wifi connection if you do this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2015-02-18T06:51:41.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@riotoce halp a$ap pls","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2015-02-18T06:52:53.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, and I'm posting here as I have about 3 emails for different accounts and..
