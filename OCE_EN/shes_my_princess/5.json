If you leave a brief report comment saying _\"he made death threats in the post-game chat\"_, then a Rioter who reviews your report can easily bring up those chats and punish them for it.  \n\n\n+ But sometimes it will be the Instant Feedback system that reviews your report. The [information](http://support.lol.garena.com/en_SG/articles/542-#h3q1) that's currently available seems to indicate that Instant Feedback does check post and pre game chat, but TBH it seems a little bit vague to me.\n\nGood news is though, that in this case it doesn't matter if the Instant Feedback system detects post-game chat or not. \n\nInstant Feedback punishes both feeding and toxic behaviour with one punishment. So this player will still get the same punishment for just feeding, as they would for feeding + toxic chat. _(note; this doesn't work the other way around)_\n\nI've left a few things out to keep this post relatively short, so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I can explain more :D","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-11-29T06:45:12.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Post and pre game chats are definitely collected and recorded.
