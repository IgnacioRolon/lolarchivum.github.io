I have been barraged with them too. Only a few games a go a guy locked into jungle AFTER the jungler had first picked. It was the original junglers series too. We did end up winning with 2 jungles but the ADC AFkd most the game and we got super lucky they had a DC late. This is what it's coming to these days, drives me insane because the game is technically perfect. The issues with it is based on the community 100% - nothing else. Unlucky about the -10lp :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-02-28T08:30:01.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't really matter. You should think of it this way. \nWould you rather lose 10lp, take a 30 minute time penalty and keep your current mmr? \nOr lose 19lp, play a game that makes you want to kys and also lose mmr?\n\nnote: mmr determines how much lp you gain from each win. For example if you have a high mmr you gain 21 lp if you win and lose 16 lp if you lose.\n If you have a low mmr you gain 16lp per win and lose 21lp if you lose.","replies":[]}]}
