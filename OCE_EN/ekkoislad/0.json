Is the system automated or done by someone?\n2. If not, Why is it not Done by someone.\n3. Why do people who cheat and feed get less of a penalty and less of a chance to be penalised if they do what they do, And toxic players who have those people on their teams have to get the punishment for being frustrated at them?\n4. Why is the whole chat not shown when you are banned?\n5. Why have I spent 50 bucks on your game and been treated like dirt?\n6. Why Have I got 3 Banned accounts because of Feeding and Cheating people?\n7. Why don't people with 14 Days have a chance to get them reverted? If so How.\n8. Why don't you have a ban appeal section for Bans? -_-\nRito pls fix.\n( Pretty sure I can have an opinion buddy. )","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-22T13:23:39.141+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Automated, but manual reviews are still a constant feature, both for cases the automation cannot properly assess and to monitor and maintain the accuracy of the automated system.\n\n2. In my time on boards, and more recently (but with deeper insight) as a volunteer I have only ever seen one single incorrect ban made by the automated system, and it was resolved in two days through support.\n\n3. People who cheat/script/hack etc get a straight permanent suspension, there is no warning for such behaviour. Intentional feeders jump straight to a 14 day ban, and very quickly to a perma if they continue. Both are punishments which are harsher than the lower tiers of chat toxicity punishments (which are 10 game and 25 game chat restrictions).\n\n4. Because it is your behaviour that is relevant to you. Defending yourself is fine, retaliation is not. If you have been banned then your behaviour was deemed unacceptable, and thus it is your behaviour that you need to be looking at. The system looks at anyone who is reported, so if someone else demonstrated negative behaviour they will receive punishment as well, the fact is simply that their punishment is not your concern, only your own is.\n\n5. How have you been treated like dirt? You offer no specifics there. If you have been banned it is for a reason, which you are more than welcome to discuss here if you feel the punishment was unwarranted.\n\n6. Assuming you didn't cheat yourself, have you ever shared those accounts? Intent feeding will get you perma banned very quickly if you don't change your behaviour.\n\n7. The only time a punishment will be reverted is if it was made in error, otherwise that would kind of defeat the purpose of a punishment.\n\n8. You can appeal bans by submitting a support ticket: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-23T02:13:33.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras covered it pretty well, though I do want to touch a bit on question 5:\n> Why have I spent 50 bucks on your game and been treated like dirt?\n\nAs Seras said, you've provided no details on how you've been \"treated like dirt\". That said, spending more money on the game wont net you priority treatment. Every player, whether they spend nothing or thousands, is treated equally by Riot, because no one is buying the right/privilege of preferential treatment.","replies":[{"poster":"EkkoIsLad","date":"2016-11-28T05:05:57.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I Have been treated like dirt because I spend money on the fucking game and still don't get non automated report shit.\nThe whole system should be fucking automated oml.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-28T05:43:06.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EkkoIsLad,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=zPKfrBzE,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-11-28T05:05:57.276+0000)\n>\n> I Have been treated like dirt because I spend money on the fucking game and still don&#x27;t get non automated report shit.\n\nYou say that like it's what you're paying for.
