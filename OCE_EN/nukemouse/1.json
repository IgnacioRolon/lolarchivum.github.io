Riot has justified many of their recent visual reworks not featuring a &quot;classic&quot; skin because the recent reworks have stayed closer to the original champion&#039;s visual theme, but in this case they have failed to deliver that for two of urgot&#039;s skins!\r\nPlease riot, give Butcher back his proper mask and consider using that weird sea monster thing as a separate skin to the beloved crabgot!\r\n{{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-08T06:20:34.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can appreciate the loss of certain features like the skin mask.\nI think the updates have been true to the skins.\n\nThe what most people found the main feature of Butcher Urgot to be was the fact that he fired chainsaws. _(not to mention it was often considered the most hideous skin in the game)_\n\nMeanwhile I don't think Giant Enemy Crabgot was ever originally supposed to be a 'costume'. I think it was just a terrible attempt at making a skin for an ugly champion.  It was humours because it was just so bad, it was still clearly Urgot, but just a version of Urgot that had failed to look like a crab.\nIt's main feature was that it referenced the movie \"Creature from the Black Lagoon.\"\n\nBut with new Urgot looking so ruthless and brutal, I don't think a half-assed crab costume would have gone down well. \nEspecially if the suspicion that they will release Star Guardian Urgot is right _(which will be a comedic skin)_.\n\nSo _personally (skins are always personal)_ I think the new Crabgot is his best skin and I think it was the right choice to make it serious.\nNot to mention the skin's name is '_Giant Enemy crabgot_', and the old skin was neither giant, nor an enemy. \n\n\nBut I can definitely appreciate the loss of something you loved :(\nupdates can be bitches!","replies":[{"poster":"Nukemouse","date":"2017-07-08T18:30:56.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they had intended for giant enemy crabgot to look like an actual crab, they wouldn't have left most of urgot visible, it's name is a reference to an old meme and is most certainly intended as a joke. His terrible costume was the humour of it, yes. The new butcher urgot skin doesn't fire chainsaws, so it lost that too. Though i suspect his ulti will fire the chainsaw? So 1/20th as often you will get to shoot chainsaws, but that is an unfortunate side effect of a gameplay related change not really a skin design issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-09T11:39:08.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they left most of Urgot visible for the same reason that nightmare cho'gath is just normal cho'gath tinted blue.\nThey were a new game with less money and resources back then and they just couldn't make as cool skins as they can now, not to mention the graphics of the game were very different to what they are now.\n_(we forget how far league has come)_\n\nhttp://gamerankers.com/game_images/game_listing_images/files/000/000/027/original/LOL3.jpg\n\nSo crabgot would have been a bigger change from the base skin than it is now. \n\nIt's always a shame when skins/champs lose things that you found special about them though :(\nIt's my personal opinion that Urgot is a step forward though, _(and I'm against a lot of reworks!)_","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-07-07T23:40:06.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about they leave that and make star guardian urgot","replies":[]}]}
