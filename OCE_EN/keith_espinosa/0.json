It is devastating, my pre-season ranking had me in silver where I won about 50% of my games;  2 days later my placements put me in bronze, which is fine and I enjoy the climb. What I don&#039;t enjoy is being placed in low bronze (B3, 0LP) and still being crushed almost every game.  This massive drop in &quot;Skill&quot; seems to have occurred in less than a week. I&#039;m not entirely sure why this is happening and I need help. How, in this world of dynamic ques, 2,3,&amp;4 man pre-mades, where people are getting their favorite rolls, how do you win games, as a former low elo jack of all trades who could prey upon people being forced to lock support &amp; stuck in lanes they don&#039;t play.  Right now, I don&#039;t even care about climbing out of bronze, I probably belong there, its just I would like to win more than 10% of my games.\r\n\r\nWriting this has helped me highlight my problem (atleast in part) as simply having an MMR higher (MMR is still roughly low silver) than my actual skill.  I no longer have my main tool for winning games available to me, throughout previous solo Q experiences I&#039;ve been able to exploit people who play rolls they are unfamiliar with, or who were unhappy with the champion select in some way, for a victory. Clearly I need to just pick 2 rolls and a few champions to spam with until i&#039;m proficient enough to win games, find some friends and climb again, but what should I be doing to get ahead and win those games.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-31T23:27:44.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Keith Espinosa,\n\nFirst of all it's great to see you're open to feedback and willing to learn, those are the first steps to getting better at this game.\n\nI used to be a jack of all trades that relied on counter picks and favourable match ups to win games as well. However I spent this preseason spamming certain roles (Mid and Top, although I'm thinking of switching out top for adc as I really enjoy playing Ezreal).\n\nMy biggest advice to you would be to consider what kind of champions you enjoy playing first\n\nFor example I enjoy skill shot champions, I like playing Ahri, Xerath, Zed, Ezreal, Lux, (Hopefully Jhin!) So mid lane was an easy choice for me.\n\nI also really enjoy 1 v 1 lane match ups so playing the top lane was a good secondary option.\n\nThink about what you enjoy playing, like playing tanks? \n\nTanks (e.g. Amumu, Alistair, Leona, Malphite, sejauni etc) - Top, Jungle, Support\nFighters (e.g. Fiora, Jax, Irelia etc) - Top and Jungle\nAssassins (e.g. Zed, Ahri, Talon, Rengar, Kha) - Mid, Jungle\nMarksmen ( e.g. ez, cait, corki etc) - Mid, bot\nMages (e.g. brand, velkoz, lux, swain etc) - mid/support\nUtility/Support (e.g. Janna, Thresh, soraka, etc) - support\n\nIf you can find some champions that you really enjoy playing and improving at. You can find joy in mastering the champion and game, you will naturally improve and win more as a result of this.\n\nHope that helps, also check out this awesome playlist from the University of New South Wales LoL club. It taught me a lot about how to think about/play this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz","replies":[{"poster":"Keith Espinosa","date":"2016-02-01T00:08:30.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the post.\n\nI went through that UNSW playlist last season (Murdoch wanted a team, though not many people play from the uni & I was listed as the 6th as place filler, till they could find someone better) and the videos really helped me focus on my lane mechanics; which let me be able to competently play the lanes & climb out of bronze, though it seems that this new system has really bumped up the skill level of the people I'm versing, while I may not necessarily be the biggest let down on my team, but the skill disparity is so large that I cannot make up for the difference. \n\nI enjoy playing champions that are able to balls to the wall all in, but from experience that does not work in bronze more often than not you end up 1v5ing the enemy team while your own team is sitting in an epic four man battle against the wraith camp after backing away on your engage, from the enemy. The tactic that has classically worked for me in high pick and burst across an AOE (Lux), while its really disappointing when your combo can't kill an enemy, it is fun to blast someone from off their screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-01T00:59:41.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah playing a champion that forces you to hang back and play safe is a good option. \n\nDo you prefer to be the person initiating the fight (tank)? Or do you prefer being the melee champion jumping in the battle dealing high sustained damage (Fighter)?","replies":[{"poster":"Keith Espinosa","date":"2016-02-01T01:47:10.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like initiating it from range (Sejuani, or Lux Q), that is my ideal because it lets me back out if i need to; otherwise i like being the one to initiate it, usually Amumu style engages - the Go button as its put.\n\nI'm on the extremes - either I want to one shot someone as rengar/zix/talon and run off (never been able to but really want to), or I want to be hitting that Go button, and having my team collapse behind me... Blasting from afar atleast is consistent, and I don't need to rely on people with it, its all me. The most important thing in all of this is damage combined with survivability and a little mobility because there is no point playing a super tank in the top lane and taking forever to die, but not being able to take someone off the enemy team with you.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-02-01T02:17:15.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha I see, you're probably not going to get a champion that can do it ALL. But Lux is definitely a good way to get picks and deal damage from range (lower mobility and survivability though).\n\nDiana might be a consideration, she does high damge, has decent survivability AND Aoe CC. \nOrianna is another person that can engage from range and deal damage.\n\nBut yeah Lux is a great option, I would say just focus on improving and you will find you start winning more as a result! highly recommend watching that play list and continuing to learn and master each aspect in the videos.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-03T06:29:16.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm I feel that support and jungle are much more viable for climbing with the new queue (whereas before there was a lot of pressure to carry regardless of your role, well imo anyway) and getting your ADC fed goes a long way to securing a victory.\n\nMy first suggestion, would be to pick either your two best roles or the two you enjoy the most, and practice with them in norms. Try to have at least two champs for each of those rolls (especially if one is say, Rammus who works much better against heavy AD teams, you'd want someone more versatile as your other). Versatile champs like Nami/Rek'Sai or flex picks like Lulu are all great choices, but your best bet is to go with what you enjoy and can play since you'll always do better that way. \n\nDon't make the mistake that some people do and pick the champs that are strong if you can't play them, and don't feel pressured to get good at those champions because the champs that are strong will change with time.\n\nMy other suggestion would be to wait for solo Q. If you work better in the solo environment. if that is how you like to play and what you enjoy, then just don't play dynamic queue (unless you want to). Practice in norms and wait for solo Q to roll out. I agree that solo is a very different experience from dyna, and I think that is a significant part of the reason so many people are salty about it :P\n\nYou've taken a solid approach to the whole thing and I think you have a lot of options available to you, but ultimately, climbing in this game comes down to practice, experience, and a genuine desire to get better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cupidism","date":"2016-02-03T05:18:23.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only just started playing again i reached gold last season and stopped because i just wanted the freebies. But the differences between this season and last season so far to me mostly seem to be in the pre game screen.\n\nPreviously you landed in a game and called a role or got left with one (i used to fill because i can play a champ in most lanes just fine) but this season you seem to pre pick what roles you want, you could be facing people who are playing roles they are familiar with more consistently which would make matches a little harder when vsing people in their comfort lanes.\n\nI decided on maining in the jungle with Shaco and running Support as my secondary. I think if you are struggling to win games maybe drop back into the support role for awhile until you get some confidence and wins back. From reading through the posts Leona sounds like she would be a great support pick for you. all the stuns and engage potential, or just all the peel for your ADC (depending on the flow of the game)\n\nand at least in the support role the pressure of 'carrying' the game isn't there, you just have to keep your ADC alive.\nThat would be my suggestion on what to try if you're in a slump. hope you recover from the slump soon o7","replies":[]}]}
