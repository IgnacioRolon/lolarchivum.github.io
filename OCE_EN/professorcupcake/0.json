I&#039;m not the most amazing player ever so my understanding of how balancing works in league is not very in depth but it just seems to me that Yasuo turning a knockback from Hecarim&#039;s devastating charge or a vault from Quinn into a 1 second disable at 1200 range is a little bit ridiculous in terms of interactivity.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-03-06T21:36:18.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this man, ProfessorCupcake is spot on in this instance.
