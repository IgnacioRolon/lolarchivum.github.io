I have a 1080ti, i9-9900k, 32gb of ram AND my pc runs league at 140fps on average! Really well optimized game this is!

Most games won't support framerates higher than 144, and our physical eyes can't really see past 150~ anyway.\n\nLeague also isn't a game where motion blur is really at all relevant (which is, as I understand it, why mainstream shooters tend to have the 240 option) so there isn't really going to be any benefit to you squeezing out those extra frames.\n\nThat aside, League is designed to be an accessible game, which means there is more focus on the super low-end than on the super high-end. The effort:impact ratio for optimising for such framerates just isn't favourable.","replies":[{"poster":"Purpul","date":"2019-08-31T11:07:19.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"     Well, I get around 300fps playing r6 which is a more demanding game than league is. I don't understand how this game doesn't perform better than that? I've had cheaper gpu's that perform better on league than this. So yeah, in the context I am setting, 140fps is low. And that hasn't been proven I play fps and league, and the benefit in either scenario is equal. Additionally, all games support 144+ fps... a ~10 year old game has no excuse for the lack of development AND be launching games like TFT which perform just as bad. \n\n     The way I see it, Riot is the perfect example of a company lead by people who have no idea of what they're doing and unless they open their eyes, will just be overthrown by another game eventually. People have been complaining about a lot of things for many years and they haven't been able to fix any of these issues... from the toxic community and the bad matchmaking to the way the game performs on hardware, the 1080ti isn't even a new gpu for it to not be supported well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Call me AAKAA","date":"2019-08-30T09:07:26.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes. dial down the settings bro. your probably on very high.","replies":[]}]}
