You can search on there to filter for your favourite champions. I myself have found quite a few pieces of art work that I use as wallpapers with one of my personal favourites being [\"Krug Life\" ](http://crossanima.deviantart.com/art/Krug-Life-496044376) by CrossAnima which is featured on there.\n\n---\n\nFor more fanart usually the best way that I find it apart from using the fanart showcase is usually either just searching around for it or using sites such as Deviantart or Artstation to search on being good places to find fanart at a good quality as well.\n\n---\n\nAs for offical splash arts I usually find these just by finding a splash art that I like in the client and then google searching for it. E.G. Google searching for \"Akali Splash Art\" or etc. Make sure that you find ones at a good enough resolution/image size though so it isn't pixelated! (I would recommend looking for at least 1920x1080, but depending on your screens resolution, you might be able to go lower than this.)\n\nAs a side note if you are looking for more than just wallpapers I would highly recommend looking at the [League of Legends Screensaver Program](http://screensaver.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en_AU) that Riot made. Letting you set even animated splash arts as your screen saver a long with all of the splash arts in the game, art from the League of Legends universe and even photos from the world championships.\n\n---\n\nHope this helps you on your search! If you find any cool ones that you like would you mind showing me them? I am always looking out for more wallpapers to add to my collection as well.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Damsultin","date":"2017-04-02T09:51:03.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much! ^~^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-02T02:32:50.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a PC App released last year (I think it was made by Riot, but I can't remember)","replies":[]}]}
