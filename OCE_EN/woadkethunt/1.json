You missed an important point, who you were playing against when you made this build?\n\nIceborn is quite useless on Yi for ANY situation, you don't have enough skills to make the proc, therefore wasting an item slot for something that could do a Yi more.\n\nI would say for whatever reason or whoever you were up against in this build, swap Iceborn for some Lifesteal and maybe the Wits for some Penetration. Or think about getting Smite regardless of lane or jungle, getting {{item:1419}} or running no smite stock standard {{item:3153}}, or even both since they are different passives and do stack, or should, I haven't really tested it yet.\n\nAs for your S scorecard, that is irrelevant also, you cannot know what score is minimum, it depends on how all other players in that lane with that champion are playing on the same server, so it is a forever changing score.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-02T08:27:23.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1419}}  this is something you want, because it does so much, and anything but jungle yi is asking not to get an S.\n\n{{item:3025}}  is a terrible item for Yi cause you barely get the passive, especially if your running {{item:3022}}  because slows don't stack (how have people not learned this yet?).","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-06-02T10:10:01.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just got S with the build i suggested but i swapped the mallet for a thorn, the build isn't meant to be super serious just a unique team fight esq build","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-02T09:57:33.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Include a dead man's instead of Sunfire Cape, and ditch the Iceborn because Frozen Mallet is better and get some more damage or perhaps a Steraks or another on hit item.","replies":[]}]}
