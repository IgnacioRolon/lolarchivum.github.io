Blitz hooks my ADC lane partner Ezreal. Then the game goes into drug mode, where i move towards the enemy tower. Then the game freezes. \n\nNow, my internet is perfectly fine, everything works, including the LOL CHAT client. However I cannot return to the game.\n\nSo, I try to restart my computer and modem. When I come back  I still cannot connect to the game. So then I try op.gg to see if i can spectate the game which has been going now for 47 mins. On the loading screen it gets to 100% for every champion then stops.\n\nWhats happening? The game is still going btw...\n\nAnyone know?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-05T01:44:23.859+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh no... Looks like Ghost games are back.
