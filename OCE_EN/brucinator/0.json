I&#039;ve had nothing but frustration from it though. Multiple times i&#039;ve done very well in and out of lane, warded, good % kill participation, decent CS... and i can&#039;t seem to snag even an S-. I don&#039;t understand what more i can do. \n\nIn the game below, i had 50% kill participation as a toplaner, bought 3 pink wards, warded with yellow too, decent CS, highest DMG to champs in the game and i didn't die. I got an A.\n\n[](http://[img]http://i.imgur.com/1gSMGor.png[/img])","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-06T12:04:30.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes a lot more than you think due to HOW they calculate it.\n\nIt has NOTHING to do with the game YOU just played, nothing to do with your KDA or stats or anything basically from anyone in that particular game unless there is another champion on the enemy team who used the same champ as you.\n\nThey calculate it based on how well you played versus EVERYONE ELSE in the same region on the same champ. So let's say you get a score of 30/10 on Yi, but around the same time that is only top 30% of players, you will get a B, maybe an A.\n\nBut you can go 5/0 with 400 CS on Nasus and take 11 towers, 3 inhibitors and 48 assists, you will get an S since you played better than all other Nasus in your region. It is a stupid way to work out your own personal scorecard in that particular game and one of the few things they need changing. No fair in comparing a Platinum or Masters premade 5 team to someone in Bronze. Even if you place THE BEST player into a low rank team, if their team feeds like fuck and lose them the game, and their stats suffer due to it, they will not get that S rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucinator","date":"2016-06-06T06:09:57.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[img]http://i.imgur.com/1gSMGor.png[/img]","replies":[]}]}
