Apparently many people that I have played with think that suicide is a totally okay thing: so okay that they wish it on people that may not play their best. Coming from a game where we lost, and I, agree that I did not play my absolute best with a couple wrong calls here and there, was repeatedly told to, quote, \"kill yourself.\" I think that scenarios like this should be dealt with more as it makes the LoL community more toxic than what it should be. The fact that people are wanting people to die over such a small issue perplexes me: so much so that I am starting to lose the pleasure of playing this game, and my faith in the community too.\r\n\r\nI hereby ask all players, if you feel the need to yell at someone on the other end of a screen to \"kill yourself\" stop and think: would you like to be told that? More often than not you would prefer not to kill yourself. Even being told to hurts. So please, for the sake of this community, stop the threats.
