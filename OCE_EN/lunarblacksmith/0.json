Xayah?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"&#039;Sup everyone.\r\nI&#039;ve played League before, but never touched Ranked and am as what I think they call &quot;casual&quot;, so I don&#039;t understand a few things that I&#039;d like to get clear if anyone out there wouldn&#039;t mind telling me:\r\n\r\n1) Why do people call champs &quot;trash&quot;\r\n2) Why so much hate when there is a popular champ, like {{champion:157}} Yasuo atm, even if he is OP, there are other overplayed champs..aren&#039;t there?\r\n3) I can&#039;t quite tell myself, to more experienced eyes, is {{champion:498}} Xayah a bit more powerful than she should be or do you think she&#039;s balanced? (I love Xayah just for her personality, regardless.)\r\n4) Do people &quot;Smurf&quot; to get better rankings or something? I don&#039;t understand.\r\n5) Lastly, could just be me, but are League players generally &quot;trolls&quot;?\r\n\r\nAnyway, cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-08-05T11:46:43.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xayah is  bad adc she doesnt deal with ganks well where as twitch lucian ez vayne ect do and alsou can dodge her feathers she not very stong u need to be good at adc to be good at her u cant base her on learning adc shes just not amazing atm and she got debuffed before her realise","replies":[]},{"poster":"pitbull1709","date":"2017-08-03T12:19:18.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1- Some champs are just \"trash\" (awful, garbage, just generally all round bad.) Depending on the meta, and buffs/nerfs, these will shift around, but there are some who just dont seem to fit into any meta..... Azir, Riot come on :P\n\n2- As stated below, Yas has a high skill cap, in that if you're not great with him, you will probably feed your ass off. That is one reason people hate Yasuo and similar champs, because no-one WANTS to lose a game of league, and a bad Yasuo will probably lose the game for you. (This could be said for all champs really, but the hate is ingrained for this one.) That leads me onto my 2nd point.\n\nThe hate isn't necessarily aimed at the champion in particular. It seems the consensus, that MOST (not all) Yasuo players are incredibly toxic, and if it doesn't go their way, will either flame you to kingdom come, or int and make the experience worse.\n\n3 - From what I've seen of Xayah, she is powerful, but can be easily countered with mobility, because if she can't root you, then you should be able to kill her.\n\n4- Smurfs are quite often used as tilt/stress relievers. People don't really care as much about a alt account, so if they're tilted or not doing great on the main acc, they will have a few games on a different acc (usually lower rated) to un-tilt.\n\n5 - Not all league players are trolls, but I will say, we do have a very weird community. A large part is toxic, and another large part are trolls. Never made sense to me, if they can't get enjoyment out of the game without ruining it for others, what's the point?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fl√∫ffy","date":"2017-07-29T16:22:46.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disappointed in these responses \n\n1-  Because in their opinion that champ is just bad or worse than other champs\n\n2- So for Yasuo as an example his abilities are quite strong with his passive being a 2x multiplier and his high skill cap making him a very popular champion from when he was released to even now still and yes their are other champions that are over played like Yasuo and they also have a high skill cap \n\n3- I think xayah is in a really good spot in the meta right now, i do think she is quite strong compared to some other ADC's though\n(I also love xayah)\n\n4- Their are a couple of reasons why people \"smurf\". A lot of high elo players would rather have a quicker queue time because their are a lot less players in the higher tiers, another reason is some players like to boost their friends or other players and someone i know has a smurf to practice their off roles in ranked because it has no effect on their mains account\n\n5- Yes league players are trolls but not all of them are some just want t do some fun stuff with their friends or some people just like to ruin your game by intentionally feeding so be careful and try not to rage \n\nIf you would like some more of your Questions answered feel free to add me @ AoiKitsune In game im happy to try my best and help anyone i can or is willing to ask","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-27T12:57:47.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.
