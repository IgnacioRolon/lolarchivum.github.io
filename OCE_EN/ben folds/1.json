It does happen most often when I enter the shop (and of course I have ceased to enter the shop) but also has happened a couple of times in champ select, which is excessively irritating and is more than likely going to lead to penalties that I don&#039;t think I deserve. Does anyone have any official Rito word on this error? Because myself and most of my regular league buds are experiencing the error too.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: rito pls fix client","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-22T07:12:07.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Bam.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/qGggBnHi-lol-client-crash-may-22nd)","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Folds","date":"2015-05-22T12:31:19.321+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=a5uhAYLF,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-22T07:12:07.024+0000)\n>\n> [Bam.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/qGggBnHi-lol-client-crash-may-22nd)\n\nYay!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-05-22T04:28:24.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its everyone..
