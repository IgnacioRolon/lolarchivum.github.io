The rest are gruelling, and frustrating, as you will either have;\na) a feeder\nb) an AFK\nc) an AFK after giving first blood and 5 kills\nd) a chat spammer with rude and racist, sexist, you name ist trash talk\ne) someone who shouldn't be on the OCE server and makes your ping >9000\nf) someone who doesn't ping or isn't map aware then blames you for dying when they're in the enemies jungle\ng) a person too young to be playing a game that requires a higher brain function than \"point and shoot\"\n.\n.\nx) stays in jungle all game and doesn't gank\ny) doesn't buy or place a single ward then wonders why they're getting ganked in their own jungle\nz) all of the above and more! \n\nI started playing this at the end of 2nd season. It was fun then...maybe cuz we were on the American server... and not as many &lt;16YO had access to their mums credit cards/computers back then.\n\nBut now, it's more of an assignment. and the due time was an hour ago, and you haven't started and you have no idea what it's about.\n\nBut what do I know? You might get lucky. If you're one of the better players, please do play. We need more people like that. \n\nGG and HF all","replies":[]}]}
