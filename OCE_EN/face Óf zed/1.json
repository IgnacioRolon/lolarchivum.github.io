Due to the scale of the effort, no one will be receiving their rewards just yet, and even when they start going out it will likely be \"staggered\" with some players receiving their rewards before others. If you haven't received anything by the 12/13th of December (and believe you were eligible), you should submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"2018 Season Ranked and Honor rewards\" option).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neeko Neeko Ne","date":"2018-11-16T08:09:17.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Within 2 weeks of the end of the season, they said.
