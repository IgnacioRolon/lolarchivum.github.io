Your mmr soft resets at the beginning of each season. What that means is that you will generally get placed at least 1 div below what you were at the end of S5. Depending on how many games you won, sometimes more. \n\nHere is the official info:\n> As usual, you'll have ten placement games to fight through before settling in to your tier and division, ready for the climb. Your placement is still heavily influenced by where you ended up last season and what you accomplished during preseason. If you’ve never played ranked, then your placements will be all that matters!\n> Preseason brought some substantial changes to the game (learn more about preseason here, so we’re again running a soft reset before placements kick off. As with previous years because of the soft reset, you’ll likely place lower than where you ended last year.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/2016-ranked-season-kicks-soon","replies":[{"poster":"FACE ÓF ZED","date":"2016-02-06T11:10:20.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so like at the end of this season if i get bronze 4, i will be bronze 5 next season so i can go feed in all my placement games and still get the same fuking rank?\nI WORKED MY ASS OFF TO GET 5 WINS AND I DID SOO WELL","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-06T11:29:12.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With 10 wins you might get low B4, but it's pretty unlikely. Usually winning 8-10 will get you one or two divs below, but it depends a bit on who you are playing with/vsing in your placements, as it comes down to your hidden mmr in the end, and you will gain more mmr from defeating those with higher mmr than you.\n\nBut to answer your question, essentially yes. If you end season at B4 you are almost guaranteed a B5 placement in the next season. If you had climbed to B1 or 2 in preseason you'd have a much better chance of not getting B5, but preseason rank has a much lower impact than your end of season rank. \n\nThat said, if you feed in/lose all your placements you will be placed in a much lower mmr in B5 and will have an even worse time of it. The rank may be the same, but the experience will be very different, because you will be matched with players of a similar mmr (the lowest if you intentionally lose all badly).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-02-06T08:21:49.669+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just climb back up if you deserve a higher rank","replies":[{"poster":"FACE ÓF ZED","date":"2016-02-06T11:09:04.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do know that bronze 5 is elo hell u can never get out","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-02-06T11:31:08.638+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get out if you are playing well consistently.

I say can be, as it varies. There's always something you can learn and improve on.\n\nLooking at your recent ranked games (on oce.op.gg), it's clear enough that you need to work on your last hitting. As a laner aim for a bare minimum of 6cs a minute (ideally even more than that). Maybe 5cs/min in some busy games but anything lower needs improvement. As you would know, more cs = more gold = earlier items etc.\n\nAlso focus on objectives. Like REALLY focus on them. If your team can grab a few early turrets, more often than not it snowballs into a win. The focus on objectives can also result in less chasing for kills and less deaths.\n\nWarding is also important but I won't go into detail here.\n\nI say this coming from being placed B2 in S4 and getting rekt playing a few games, getting stuck in B5 last season for 250 games (cuz I suck at the game) and learning and grinding my way up to B1 (and I still suck).\n\nTL;DR You will climb to a 'good rank' if you deserve it. Work on your last hitting for more gold. Focus on objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-02-06T11:55:52.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"worked so hard to get 5 wins LOL mate fucking qq","replies":[]}]}
