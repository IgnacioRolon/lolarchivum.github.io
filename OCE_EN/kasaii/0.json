I gained 12LP once and lost 27lp the next, thats a 2.5:1 ratio almost. \r\nEven in challenger people barely hit a 60% win rate. How does this even make sense, I came into diamond with over 70% Winrate, the first game i won was 13lp. Im still above 50% winrate but it's been on a heavy decline because of tilting my progress is no matter how hard I try, I cannot win 4 games and lose 1 just to gain 10-15lp.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-26T04:01:54.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone explained this to me a while back.\n\"Don't gain much because you're versing trash so you don't get rewarded as much for beating trash.

But how did my mmr get messed up so bad the moment I get into diamond. It was a fast climb from gold since my placements, fair cause I haven't played in a season but I climbed getting 20+ lp but the moment I get diamond, no games have I gotten over 13lp. My account is messed up.","replies":[]}]}]}
