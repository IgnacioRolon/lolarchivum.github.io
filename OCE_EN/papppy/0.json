In fact it's more serious in low elo because that's where the vast majority of the players are at and thus scripters in low elo makes for some very bad impression of the game for the players than they would be otherwise pose in the higher elo bracket.\n\nStill try report this to league support or something, I don't suppose it's gonna do more work here than posting through the report section of the support.","replies":[{"poster":"papppy","date":"2016-12-30T05:21:41.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> player cheating is a big issue regardless of which elo range they&#x27;re playing at. \n> \n\nGranted it is, but it's a bit less of an issue due to it not affecting professional and potentially professional play. Not to make it seem or sound less serious as cheating at all is serious, but I think that scripters affecting professionals negatively is slightly more concerning than it affecting people in bronze, again not to make taken as less seriously, just not as potentially detrimental. But I'm not Riot so that isn't my call. \n\n>that's where the vast majority of the players are at and thus scripters in low elo makes for some very bad impression of the game \n>\n\nYes that's true, but it doesn't affect the professional play of the game in any way. Again as I said before it isn't to be taken less seriously due to this, it just doesn't seem like an immediate problem. \n\nThank you for the support ticket idea, I'll try that instead as this seems to get more of a general topic feedback rather than what I was expecting.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-30T08:37:47.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Looks like **SEKAI** has already got you on the right track with a support ticket :)\n\nOne thing I'll just remind you about is that these guys are [banned in waves](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AEVP3NMA-anti-cheater-banwave-incoming), not as soon as they are detected.
