We are looking to add to our four-man team in hopes of bringing together a solid five-man team. We are looking to give the competitive scene a serious shot, so we would love to add to our ranks. Definitely looking for someone who&#039;s on-board with some banter within the group as melding with the team is a serious need.\n\nAs far as requirements go we would love someone with a general understanding of the game and a desire to learn and grow with the rest of the team.\nOur schedule however is restricted to about 10pm - 7am GMT +11.\n\nIf you wish to give this a shot with us, please feel free to add myself in-game. My IGN is: Mioh\nHope to hear from you soon!\n\n\n**:EDIT:**\nThank you everyone for your lively responses! I received a lot of response and will definitely be trying my best to trial everyone when I get the chance. But for now, I will need to put a hold on any further requests. Thank you all for your interest!","replies":[{"poster":"THEKING361","date":"2017-12-14T12:41:39.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MY IGN is THEKING361, I would like to join your team if possible :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Walken077","date":"2017-12-12T10:55:46.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just added you mate, hope you are still looking","replies":[]},{"poster":"AndreiS","date":"2017-12-12T06:53:06.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im down to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"whyys0serious","date":"2017-12-11T17:24:54.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man I just added you so yeahh didn't say if you needed chat but 5 mans I'm guessing you would \n\ncheers","replies":[]}]}
