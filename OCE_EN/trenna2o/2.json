If this is only your second, it's because zero tolerance chat such as hate speech or suicide encouragement was involved in your first punishment and it should be obvious why such language is not permitted. If this is your 3rd or 4th then you've had at least one chat restriction warning you that your behaviour would not be accepted and that you would have to improve (or at least not bring it to the game) or face further punishment.\n\nTo simplify, you were penalised for your behaviour, but you were permanently banned because you refused to improve it despite warnings, including the explicit warning of permanent suspension found in the 14 day reform card.\n\nRiot's stance on fighting back is that defending yourself is fine (\"Hey don't do that\", \"That's not true\") but retaliating is not (\"Go back to x rank\", \"you blankning blanker\", \"[spam insults]\").\n\n>[WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT!](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-#h1q7)\n\n>Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.\n\nIf you wish to appeal for a removal or reduction of your punishment, you can submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you want specific community feedback I'd recommend posting your chat logs, as there's only so much context we can offer without details of your punishment.","replies":[]}]}
