For good reason too, can you imagine games where people are completely ignoring their teams just so they can get x farm, x objective assists and eventually x/x/x KDA? \n\nIn the end, the grade you receive is based on the[ **same champ** in the **same role**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery) compared to everyone else on the server. You have to be in the top x% of players playing whichever champion in whichever role (they treat annie mid and annie support differently for example) \n\nThe grade boundaries are bound to change slightly every day, depending on how players are doing with the champs. From what I can remember, Ashe and Garen are pretty easy to get S ranks on, as a lot of beginners play them (and do bad), eventually lowering the grade.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-12-16T03:24:47.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the x% of people playing that champ, i feel like thats wrong, in some of my worst sion support games i could get constant S\nbut the instant i play top with higher kda and farm, and objectives, i cant get an S\nand can my alah ahkbar sion skills plz give me more mastery, i have had a game where i pushe about, lets see, 2 of my lane, 1 with top, pushed 2 with mid, suicide bombed 3rd one later, and tanked double nexus turret so super minoins could push, plz let that contribute, ic ant remember if i was top or support, and im pretty sure im lying about two of those, idk which two, i just, think i did that, idek","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-07T08:51:22.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For KDA It varies from champ but you need to be in at least 40% kill participation, for cs you need at least 75 per 10 min and for objectives you need to be involved in 50%.

For Junglers you need 50cs per 10 min 50% kill paritipation and 50% onjectuve participation.
