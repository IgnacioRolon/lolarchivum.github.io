She can&rsquo;t rationalize the appeal of a technology that weights convenience versus safety; although the pilot, Janna, would simply laugh through that concern. In that airy, breathless, sort of way she&rsquo;d become famous for in the League.\n\nCaitlyn wishes she were famous for a laugh.\n\n&ldquo;Our ETA, Miss Janna?&rdquo; She asks with a posh accent.\n\nThough this Piltover Police issued airship isn&rsquo;t the sleek design of the newer racing model Janna had won with two months previous, they still made excellent time &ndash; drifting through the skyscrapers at lofty speeds. Caitlyn grips to her leather seat, absently tightening the strap, and adjusting her rifle across her lap.\n\nJanna laughs. &ldquo;About a minute out, Sheriff. Don&rsquo;t worry that pretty lil&rsquo; head of yours, we&rsquo;re almost there.&rdquo;\n\nShe&rsquo;s a lanky blond woman with an alabaster complexion. She had a reputation that hinged on a flirtatious demeanor but seems ridiculous when dressed behind bronze aviation goggles. Janna checks over her shoulder at her nervous passenger, ignoring for a moment the hiss and tick of the cockpit controls.\n\nCaitlyn&rsquo;s knuckles are beginning to turn white.\n\n&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; chimes a voice through the static of the PA system in the aircraft. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s takin&rsquo; ya so long? We&rsquo;re closin&rsquo; in on this brat. ETA?&rdquo;\n\nThe zephyr gracefully pulls upwards, swelling in speed, and narrowly missing a smokestack. Janna taps into the radio with an audible switch on her board. &ldquo;Great minds think alike &ndash; I was just explaining to the Sheriff that we&rsquo;re about a minute out.&rdquo;\n\nAnother audible click. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;all got 45 seconds. Captain Hammer has the suspect cornered on 3rd and moving west towards the Iron District.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a moment of silence but no indicating tick to signal the end of transmission. &ldquo;Can she hear me?&rdquo;\n\nJanna once again makes an obvious motion to check over her shoulder at Caitlyn. The Sheriff gives a minute tilt of approval but says nothing.\n\n&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You have one shot at this, Cupcake. I&rsquo;ll handle it if ya miss, but I really don&rsquo;t want to deal with the paperwork. 30 seconds.&rdquo;\n\nThe transmission signals its admission as the airship begins swoon to a halt, the small round port windows overlooking the endless steel construction of the Ironworks building. In a hiss of steam and click of cogs, the starboard side door begins to unlatch and peel open. The air pressure of the ship immediately shifts and gives Caitlyn the sudden sense of vertigo.\n\nThe noise of the city below pours into the open airship in such force that it disarms Caitlyn&rsquo;s stove-pipe hat backwards. She lets the hat roll into a corner, sweeping her dark bangs aside and making one final check on her beloved Clockwork, pulling the bolt back into ready action.\n\nRising swiftly from her seat, Caitlyn is careful to grapple for the holding rings along the ceiling. Janna is less cautious, elegantly gliding through the cockpit towards her. The blonde pilot makes a point to tug at the front of the leather harness buckled around Caitlyn&rsquo;s torso. The leather chafes, and &ndash;truthfully &ndash; wasn&rsquo;t Caitlyn&rsquo;s favorite fashion accessory but was one of the few things in the air fleet the Sheriff agreed upon.\n\n&ldquo;Here we go,&rdquo; Janna chimes.\n\nShe leads Caitlyn to the open port promptly, tactile hands making quick work to reveal long thick strips of leather fastened around a crank in one of the many ceiling compartments. Janna uses the length of her arm to measure off the appropriate slack before securing a steel carabineer to Caitlyn&rsquo;s harness.\n\nIt&rsquo;s two quick safety tugs before Janna is satisfied and Caitlyn is stepping into the wind.\n\nShe&rsquo;s careful and tedious to find her footing outside the airship, tapping out onto a bronzed ledge welded to the outside of the craft. A sudden updraft causes the zephyr to swell upwards, but the tethers to the Ironworks tower hold fast. Caitlyn is shaken but secure; bracing Clockwork before considering her on balance.\n\nThere&rsquo;s the audible click of the PA: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the brat cornered in the East part of the square &ndash; she&rsquo;s using the merry-go-round for cover.&rdquo;\n\nNow or never. Caitlyn leans into the apex her harness allows, shouldering her Hextech rifle and lining down the Triple-Lens scope. She hangs above the whole world, the wind flaying her skin and cutting to the bone in its chill at the altitude. There&rsquo;s the familiar discomfort and whirl of her left eye, her vision stretching thin and brain reeling to keep up to the mechanical shift.\n\n&ldquo;Any time, Cupcake!&rdquo;\n\nThe suspect nausea is quelled instantly when Caitlyn closes her natural eye, letting the machine take over while her rifle begins to hum and pop excitedly at the attention. She&rsquo;s no longer swinging above Piltover, but examining the fine curve of the suspect&rsquo;s sprite-like nose, a thick stream of blood flowing around the turn of a Cheshire grin.\n\nObviously Vi&rsquo;s handiwork.\n\nThe boom is deafening, the kickback blinding her as for one - gory- second it is Caitlyn riding the tip of the bullet as it mutilates the side of Jinx&rsquo;s face.\n\n&ldquo;Headshot.&rdquo;\n****\n\nThanks for reading!
