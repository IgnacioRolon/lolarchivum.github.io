After narrowing the [shortlist](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/ORmqvHsO-fanfiction-contest-the-shortlist) to 10 entries, the community took control and voted for the Final Five -and now, without further ado:\r\n\r\n**1st: [Refracted Silence](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/3jVwdyj2-fanfiction-contest-entry-refracted-silence)** by [Malygos](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/Malygos)\r\n_An unknown bystander is witness to an assassination under the totalitarian rule of Noxus in this short vignette._\r\n\r\n**2nd: **[**Four Words**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/FKuVURMi-four-words) by [GreatClockwyrm](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/GreatClockwyrm)\r\n_This subtle portrait of Jhin is as gorgeous as it is grotesque. _\r\n\r\n**3rd:** [**Five Things to Make a Shadow**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/Qm3hjwiP-five-things-to-make-a-shadow) by [EarlGreyShakes](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/EarlGreyShakes)\r\n_Justice is just a nicer name for revenge. _\r\n\r\n**4th:** **[Diary of a Shuriman Merchant](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/6nqh7g6y-diary-of-a-shuriman-merchant)** by [Miss Auri](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/Miss%20Auri)\r\n_A recovered wares journal documents a peculiar meta shift in the sands of Shurima. _\r\n\r\n**5th:** **[Don&#039;t Blink](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/TpI5facs-dont-blink)** by [The Great NaCl](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/The%20Great%20NaCl)\r\n_Ekko knows that all Zuan really needs is a little spit shine in this heartfelt narrative._\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nA FanFiction contest had never been attempted before - and honestly - we were shocked with the caliber and sheer amount of talent in the community. Going forward, we&#039;ve learned a lot and want to provide more FanFiction contests in the future - but better. \r\n\r\nThank you to all the incredible participants and writers of the community (and readers). We were truly taken on a magical journey.","replies":[{"poster":"Malygos","date":"2016-08-08T07:28:17.325+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations everyone and a huge thank you to all who voted for me, as someone who wants to seriously write for a living it's an amazing confidence boost to win a competition like this. \n\nThis competition was great, I really hope Riot does more like this in the future (perhaps even a bi/trimonthly thing?
