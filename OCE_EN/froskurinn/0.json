The unprecedented turnout for the **[FanFiction Contest](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/TQsEsHat-fanfiction-contest-announcement)** was incredible; with over 174,000 words written and 200+ stories submitted, the sheer amount and caliber of the community&rsquo;s talent was displayed in full force. Between [plays](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/YZ8aiuE8-shakespeares-the-two-allies-of-piltover), poems, [Limericks](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/Gjylsavl-limerick-of-legends), and [epics ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/qYsTEMFj-zilean-origins)&ndash; we had the joy to examine every expression of the written form and narrowed our Shortlist down to 10 stories.\r\n\r\nNo easy task at all. \r\n\r\nFor a refresher, the Shortlist was determined by the Rubric below.\r\n****\r\n**Grading  Rubric:**\r\n\r\nThe Rubric is explained and ordered below in a weighted fashion. Creativity being the most important and Grammar being the least important to grading. \r\n \r\n* **Creativity. **The most important of the Rubric and that hardest to really quantify. In short, how did you best leave your fingerprint on the essence of League of Legends? \r\n* **Prompt.** _&quot;The Average Day in Runeterra&quot;_. \r\n* **League of Legends Elements.** This is a League FanFiction contest! The more elements from the game or lore (twisted or canon) the better!\r\n* **Grammar.** No one is perfect, we know that. And we also know that a single spelling mistake shouldn&rsquo;t detract from a great story, but we need to be able to understand and get through your story without confusion.\r\n****\r\n**Community Voting**\r\n\r\nBut the Rubric and Shortlist only take the contest so far. The remaining honor of crowning the FanFiction Contest winners is now in your hands as a community. Out of the 10 Shortlist Finalists, we&#039;re only looking for **5 Victors**. Below, the Shortlist Finalists are listed and linked - using the poll at the bottom of the page, vote for your **_favorite _**FanFiction entry.\r\n\r\nFavorite. It&#039;s such a high standard and impossible trait to quantify. If you need the Rubric to help guide your vote, that&#039;s fine - but ultimately, don&#039;t let the Rubric restrict your personal taste and vote for the story that speaks to you. The community will have one week to select the winners; which means that on **August 5th**, the Final FanFiction Five will be chosen! \r\n\r\nAnd remember, if this Shortlist doesn&#039;t sate your hunger for incredible stories, there are the hundreds of adventures waiting in the **[FanFiction Contest Boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction)**. \r\n****\r\n**FanFiction Shortlist Finalists**\r\n\r\n**[An Average Day in the Sewers](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/OtVNtvZH-an-average-day-in-the-sewers)** by [Funsocks](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/Funsocks)\r\n_In this horrific and haunting tale, recruits patrolling the sewers are playing a deadly game of cat and rat around every dark corner. _\r\n\r\n**[Freljordian Diplomacy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/contest-fan-fiction/oh34YxOL-freljordian-diplomacy)** by [Jimsomi](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/jimsomi)\r\n_On a brisk and beautiful Freljordian morning, a Little Queen is up early.

I can sympathise when people use the downvote to reduce something that clearly shouldn't 'deserve' attention, but...\n\nI'm an avid reader myself, so here me out when I say 'descriptive language' is really the tip of the iceberg when it comes to a _great_ piece of writing. Control, Pacing, Character development, Metaphors, Insights ... there was plenty more room for the writer to _dig deeper_.\nIn fact, the writer leans very heavily on 'stereotypes' with Jax, Boram and the Noxian Soldiers that were in my opinion poorly applied.\n\n_Boram Darkwill_ is both an established character (an century-old necromancer who heavily influenced Noxian History) and a long dead one - absolutely nothing like the writer's 'Boram'. \nIt is one thing to cross-reference existing lore elements from several areas and make connexions, as was part of the rubic; another thing entirely to merely 'force-copy-paste' a name or place without doing the research beforehand.\n\nIt's a decent entry that is quite enjoyable to read, but there were some glaring flaws and inconsistencies within it that the judge took into account when deciding on the shortlist.","replies":[{"poster":"moovlice","date":"2016-07-29T06:37:55.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wasn't _'boosted'_ at least not to my knowledge and I also used the name \"Boram Darkwill\" because I hit some writers block on a name and I'm a big fan of Sion and I liked the name, his character in my story has nothing to do with the actual necromancer in Sion's lore it is just a name.

This fulfils the _‘Creative’_ part of the Rubick in an original and genuine, and refreshingly uncringeworthy, way.\n> \n> This entry also meets the _‘Average day in Runeterra’_ prompt: Varus’s entire purpose is to kill as many Noxians as he can before he dies, and the writer sums that up pretty succinctly in the closing line - this _is_ an average day for Varus.\n> \n> He/she really paints a vivid, well-developed and believable image of Varus, conversely to some of these entries which are honestly really dissonant from the champions they’re supposed to be representing.\n> \n> Don’t get me wrong, these are all (mostly) pretty good, but in my opinion, this entry fulfils the overall Rubick better than any other story in this list, and its style really stood out from the rest - surely it must have been overlooked?\n\nWell, uh, thanks?\n\nI dunno, most of the ones that made it are pretty good – The Jhin, Veigar, Fiora and Twitch ones do really good jobs of capturing their champion’s characters as well, and I don't think the Rubic should be the only thing that we judge an entry by. \n\nThough I admit that I don't perceive some of these entries to be _quite _ as good as mine, I'm sure that the Judge(s) simply found enough flaws in it to prefer the others over it, or didn't find it their cup of tea (or simply didn't want an 'edgy' story getting in - that's fine as well).\n\nEh, it would be wrong to include it in the list _now_ (especially if that would mean another guy got kicked out), and to be honest I'm not fussed about losing (I'd probably give most of the prize away): I'm just content with people reading and enjoying a work that I applied myself to. \n\nThere can only be 5 winners, 10 shortlisters and 2 mentions - such is life.\n\nYou can pretend that you're just voting for second place ecksdee.","replies":[{"poster":"Malygos","date":"2016-07-28T03:26:00.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AdcStoleMyAs5ist,realm=OCE,application-id=wJE2nAgV,discussion-id=ORmqvHsO,comment-id=00100000,timestamp=2016-07-28T02:33:26.088+0000)\n>\n> Well, uh, thanks?\n> \n> I dunno, most of the ones that made it are pretty good – The Jhin, Veigar, Fiora and Twitch ones do really good jobs of capturing their champion’s characters as well, and I don&#x27;t think the Rubic should be the only thing that we judge an entry by. \n> \n> Though I admit that I don&#x27;t perceive some of these entries to be _quite _ as good as mine, I&#x27;m sure that the Judge(s) simply found enough flaws in it to prefer the others over it, or didn&#x27;t find it their cup of tea (or simply didn&#x27;t want an &#x27;edgy&#x27; story getting in - that&#x27;s fine as well).\n> \n> Eh, it would be wrong to include it in the list _now_ (especially if that would mean another guy got kicked out), and to be honest I&#x27;m not fussed about losing (I&#x27;d probably give most of the prize away): I&#x27;m just content with people reading and enjoying a work that I applied myself to. \n> \n> There can only be 5 winners, 10 shortlisters and 2 mentions - such is life.\n> \n> You can pretend that you&#x27;re just voting for second place ecksdee.\n\nI think this arises because of what the prompt was. It was about as open as anything could ever be. The land of Runeterra is filled with conflict, but there is also peace.\n\nSo what is an average day? Would an average day even mention a champion?\n\nCan we even consider a champion's day to day life as average? What is the 'average' we're looking at? \n\nWithout overdefining what 'average' Frosty was looking for, the rubric's all there is to go off. \n\nI did enjoy reading your story, and I was a little surprised it didn't make it either. Hopefully we see more contests in the future which have learned from this one well :)\nIt's good to see you're graceful about it.\n\nedit: forgot to mention I think it's a sin to try numerically grade creative works, but in circumstances like this, what else is there to really do? There's inherent bias in how people perceive these stories because of characters they mention. \n\"X is best because it's about my favourite champion Y.\"\n\"I hate Z and they got beaten up so this one is the best.\"\nSo being a fair judge is difficult, ergo a rubric.
