So we're going to need to collect crash dumps to keep digging into this until we know it's solved. Please follow these steps when the bugsplat appears but before the client is closed:\n\n- Start Task Manager\n- Find \"League of Legends (32 bit)\" under the Background processes section (not Apps section) on the Processes tab\n- Right click it and select create dump file. This will create the dump and tell you where it is stored (you can copy+paste that file path)\n- Find the file (will be a DMP File type) and reduce its size by Right click > Send To > Compressed (zipped) folder\n- Upload this compressed file to a google drive and share this with ocelivereports@riotgames.com. Alternatively, you can [open a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attach the file to the ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unkindled","date":"2019-07-18T08:51:01.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So there's no chance of the problem being fixed for tonight?
