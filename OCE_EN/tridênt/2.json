Internal testing just can't compare to live testing, no matter how thorough you are, especially so when you have short patch turnovers.\n\nFor two, it's generally not wise to delay content/bring down a whole gamemode for the sake of a purely cosmetic bug that can just be fixed next patch cycle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-11T11:31:46.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a known issue with accounts that got their highest rank bumped up to div 4 with the new changes.
