I don&#039;t play too often, just a blast when i get the odd day off work. Yesterday was one of those days.\r\n\r\nI played 5 games. All of them had afks. went 0/5.\r\n\r\nThen, just logged in to this guy (**attached**). Whenever doesnt get favourable champ select, drops this crap.\r\n\r\nPlease... is there something being done to stop this?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-11T09:23:54.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No naming and shaming on the forums dude, Riot will probably remove your photo if you don't edit it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-12T09:34:36.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really think Riot will do anything lol\n\nMaybe EUW but you are entitled to dream on OCE","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-11T23:27:58.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either a) Dodge (only lose 3LP, basically nothing) and save your time but let him get away with it; or b)Play the game out anyway, he will either start playing because he doesn't want to get banned/get banned for afking/dodge himself because he was lying about not being able to dodge.\n\nPeople do this because presumably there's a fairly high chance one of their teammates will dodge, which is the case because many people would rather lose 5 minutes and a few LP than risk losing 20+ mins and more LP. Kinda need some way to report people in champ select.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-11T23:10:18.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"enjoy your ban for afk?\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-11T19:20:16.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that guy took jungle cos he didnt want you afk farming with shyv lel. he da real mvp","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-11T23:09:50.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-11T10:30:20.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your question: No. It never ends.
