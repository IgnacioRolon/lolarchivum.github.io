Turn out 50% of them is smurf but the other 50% are new player. What I said is the new player is the one that have no idea what they are doing, so therefore is it fair to put a 4v5 game like that.","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-06-18T05:18:22.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"especially the ones who just hit 30 and dont even have any runes XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-15T18:13:56.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but your not necessarily better then the new player, and if you don't want new players in your game, get out of the starting MMR for new players.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-06-19T10:24:11.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's what I was wondering, should the starting MMR be a bit lower than now because new player can be good but not all of them, I didn't say I don't want new player, I said should we put them together with veteran.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-15T16:27:45.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said yes, but it really lies within the gray area. While newer players can learn from veteran players, gain tips, tricks, builds, objective control, skill use etc they do tend to get a little frustrated when the newer players make mistakes. This usually puts everyone on tilt.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-06-19T10:26:49.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, like in rank, 50% of my lost game due to stupid mistakes from other player. And 50% of those is usually new player. So I think we need to upgrade this on because the game is 5 years old so bad player from ss1 still can be put with new player in ss5.","replies":[]}]}]}
