It's was a rank game and my team losing because of this \"accident\". I don't ask for anything because I know this sever has a lot of problem. However, my friend was on the series so I ask if Riot can prevent this losing game for him.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-08T02:53:13.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Loss Prevented does not function in an individual basis. It's a switch which Riot flips if they believe there are server wide issues occurring. If a game has been recorded as complete, then that's how it will be.","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-03-08T12:26:32.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I can for once confirm this disconnect. Every one on OCE was disconnected at once (Included my self). It was not how ever significant enough to warrant a Loss Prevented.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-09T05:45:33.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. It's unfortunate, but if the game is completed before/after Riot hit the button, then they can't reverse it for individual cases.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
