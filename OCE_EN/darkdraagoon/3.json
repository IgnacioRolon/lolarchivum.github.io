How does this happen? If I rejoin right after that and being put in the same team, I can understand. But I already waited to avoid him and still get put with him again? Can anyone explain this to me and tell me how I can block someone in the right way pls.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-10T08:00:15.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The world is a small place, and if the servers had a system which would account for all the reports/blocks players have made (literally thousands a minute) and prevent two players who blocked each-other from being matched up again, then it would be severely detrimental to our match-making system.\n\nBut then again it wouldn't really affect it much if it was just for say, people you go out of the way to block. That's just lazy programming. It could at least auto-mute them when you find them in champ select, which would be a local tool, not server related.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations","replies":[{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-06-10T13:12:35.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the point is even they are being muted, they still can ruin my game. I block them because I don't want to play with them, not just not to ignore them.\nP/s: What I want was something call an early report system, where you can report them before the game and dodge that game, rather than suffer 20 mins. I know that people will abuse this system but it's better than make us suffer our time.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-11T03:53:00.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I know that people will abuse this system but it's better than make us suffer our time.\n\nBut what if people abusing that system makes you waste even more time? And are you suggesting that toxic players can't change for the better?\n\nIf you force said players to not play with people who reported them, then those player's chances of reforming go down, for they're seeing even more toxic behaviour from the players who aren't reporting them. Riot's gone really in-depth into what happens when you create a \"Prisoner's Island\" punishment system, where the reported players only play with other reported players. You could look up the ramifications of that, if you're interested.\n\nBut I digress; the matchmaking should not match you with a person you literally just reported. That's insulting, and generally discouraging people from using the report feature.","replies":[{"poster":"darkdraagoon","date":"2015-06-12T14:08:07.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I do is may be they should be \"Prison\" for some games so they can understand the feeling they did to other players before.
