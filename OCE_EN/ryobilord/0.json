For someone like me who picks Bot Primary and Support secondary the ratio of Bot to support games is horrendous. I don&#039;t mind playing supp, but I would much rather play Bot, and while I feel I could probably cheat the system by picking Mid as my secondary and get more Bot allocations due to there being a much larger number of mid players, that shouldn&#039;t be required. In my last 20 ranked games, I have had 1 game as Bot and 19 as Supp. I&#039;d be interested to see what others thoughts on this are, and if people have had similar experiences to me. Thanks for your time.","replies":[]}
