Shhhhh, I hear you already talking &quot;But Christmas was a month ago, how dare y...&quot;, OK listen Zilean can&#039;t be late, he manipulates time, and anyway he&#039;s armed with... Bombs? Yeah, bombs, and he&#039;s sensitive, so don&#039;t hurt him ! \r\n\r\nNow that everybody is calm, if you like poros, if you&#039;re sad with this foggy time, or maybe that you&#039;re needing some reconfort (you will find your soulmate, believe me, Zilean saw your futur ;) ), appreciate this recreative compilation of Zilean during the Snowdown event. I wouldn&#039;t be against some feedback obviously, that help me to improve, and that show at same time what you like/dislike (but only to me, Zilean is sensitive, don&#039;t forget) ! :D\r\n\r\nCaution, can contain a trace of skill !\r\nOr maybe not... :)\r\n\r\n{{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-13T13:31:55.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a Mastery 7 Zilean (though currently trying to learn a few other champs) I thoroughly enjoyed this. Subscribed.\n\nIt sucks how nobody will let you play him in bronze or silver though. Teammates threatening to report/ban you pick/afk/run it down mid, simply because you want to play zilean support or mid really sucks. Zilean is actually a good champion... or at least korea thinks so and I don't think I've ever done badly on him.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Grudumpf","date":"2017-02-14T21:24:57.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with you, I already got someone who told me that \"Zilean is bad at this elo (aka Silver)\", but damn this champ is strong, he just requires to not be too greedy. You have poke and strong utility\n\nWhat other champ you're training on? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-14T23:07:31.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"currently adding nautilus and janna to my mains, they're almost there I just need to get a little bit better with them before I can call them mains (I main sup/fill so I have a large champion pool but I don't consider a champion my main unless I can carry with them and guarantee my performance regardless of lag or the quality of enemy lane opponents, so I actually have very few champions I would call mains) also trying to learn graves, khazix and braum better, and maybe if after time I still find them fun, maybe work to adding those to my mains.\n\nAlso looking to buy sejuani, leona, brand, victor and talon after having alot of fun with them during various free weeks over the last few months. The Ip grind may take a while but I'll get there... so long as I don't get distracted by the prospect of another rune page.","replies":[{"poster":"Grudumpf","date":"2017-02-16T11:27:32.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mid/supp there ! Actually i don't play Nautilus that much, but after playing him, he's a good pick too, with a good peel AND a good engage :P\nActually none of them is a 6300's champ, then that will be easier than if you wanted Aurelion, Tahm and Bard :P (But Tahm and Bard are really funny, you could try them)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-16T13:12:43.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually enjoy bard and recently got the snowday bard skin from hextech crafting.
