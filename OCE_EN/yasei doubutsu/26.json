If you try to format the video to 16:9, you'll cut heaps off the top, and it'll look worse.\n\nThe actual solution to this is this:\n\n1. Go into a custom game, and hit escape to bring up options.\n\n2. Make sure you're on borderless, not windowed or fullscreen.\n\n3. Click on the resolution drop down menu, and look for the resolution with the * symbol.\n\n That's your screen's maximum resolution or **native resolution**. Mine is 1280x1024 because I have a square screen as well. It's not 3:4 but very similar.\n\n4. Find a resolution that keeps the the first number the same, but the second one changes. \n\n e.g for me, my native resolution was **1280**x1024 so I picked **1280**x720.\n\n5. There may be several resolutions with your first number at the front. So try them all out.\n\n You're looking for one that's 16:9, which is standard resolution for most YouTube videos.\n6. Now run Fraps or OBS, to test some recording. \n\n Make sure OBS is set to record the League of Legends window, NOT the whole screen. Otherwise you're going to get some of your desktop in the recording.\n\nI hope this helped.\n\nI know nothing about Gnar BTW, CSing looked OK though :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nitro Is Senpai","date":"2016-01-15T04:25:07.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi man, I'll be honest with you. I watched about 35 seconds of the movie then closed it - you need to format your youtube videos to the correct resolution, those black bars down the side watching it in 3:4 ratio is hideous.\n\nCheers though, please see this as constructive criticism.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-01-15T07:23:05.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Im still trying to learn how to get the right ratio.\nAfter effects can be weird, But hay im sorry that having something in 1080 P with about 30-60 fps wasn't good enough.\n\nAnd I dont see why the black bars on the side can be an issue? Almost every vid that was pre 2000 had it.\nBut meh, I need to figure out why after effects does that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-01-15T12:42:34.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo depressed to watch even for a Sliver scrub like me","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-01-15T13:43:37.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol XD","replies":[]}]}]}
