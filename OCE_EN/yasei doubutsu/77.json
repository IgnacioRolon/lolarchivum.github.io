I laughed then chuckled for like 8 seconds lol. No offense meant! I've never even tried to bake a cake. You could have used wafers as paneling and slide them into the cake at angles to copy the metal, homemade gummy or buy candy strips that are light blue for the running water (use scissors/knives to design it into water-like strips), mold...I'll shut up now. You make me want to try bake a cake out of interest and lurve for the game lol.
