Grand temples, buildings and walls surrounded this arid landscape, an oasis in an otherwise barren pit of sand and despair\n\"Ascending!?\" Azir said, eyes wide with shock at what Xerath was suggesting. In this throne room, Azir sat high and above all the others. For the moment, however, it was just him and his adviser. Xerath knelt before his throne and looked up at the emperor.\nXerath nodded. \"Think of it this way, my lord: You are young, powerful, wise. Should you ascend, we would NEVER have to worry about threat! Even more so, you will live for ages to come and bring Shurima into a brilliant age!\" The more Xerath spun these tales, the more Azir's expression changed from shock to curiosity .\n“Hmmm, You’re words make sense to me Xerath, however I must consult the Acolyte of Shurima before taking action, as although you are sharp, the Acolyte’s wisdom cannot be matched” Azir said, in deep thought, all the while, hoping deep inside of him, to achieve the power of Ascension.\n“I’ve already consulted with the Acolyte, my Lord. He was most supportive of my idea” lied Xerath without even blinking.\nBeneath his mask, Xerath smiled softly. It was so easy to manipulate this arrogant emperor that he might as well be talking to a 2 year old. \"Very well, my friend. Your words and the Acolyte’s support have convinced me that there is wisdom in ascendancy. I shall gather the spiritualists and ready the ritual.\n\nThere, in the temple, Azir stood and watched the sundial turn and twist. Whispers among the spiritualists grew louder, their chanting and ancient words causing the disc to spin at a pace more rapid by the second. The sun's rays began to twist, drawn to the spinning disc as Shurima grew darker. A concentrated ray began to spark and glow, showering a large circle with pure energy. As this happened, Azir walked closer to that shimmering light. Azir never even heard the footsteps as the hum of the ray drowned out Xerath's mad dash. In moments, Azir was shoved to the side and on the ground.\n\nThere is a special reason why ascendency only works perfectly in a time of need.\nAs Xerath leapt into the energy, he had no idea of the consequences his actions were about to befall him.\n\nXerath awoke and floated upwards. The temple where this ritual had been taking place was nothing but smouldering ruins. Every single human who had been there was gone, ghostly shadows plastered across the ground. \"T-This isn't...this isn't at all...no no no no NO NO NO! \" Xerath's ethereal form floated upwards to survey the damage.\n\nFor hours upon hours, Xerath floated through the wreckage. He would lift slabs of rubble off the ground, searing them back into place. The few survivors who could run sprinted as fast as they could when they saw his form arrive.\nAll that changed when Xerath heard the shifting of sand behind him. The being of energy turned, shocked as he discovered that he was no longer alone among the ruin: Nasus and Renekton, ascended heroes of Shurima legend. \"Y-You two are...\" Without even finishing, Xerath found Nasus's halbred where his throat had been. \"What are you-\" following this, Xerath went flying backwards as a concussive force sent the energy ascendant into the wall, causing the building to crumble upon him.\n\"You BETRAYED the emperor!\" Renekton howled in rage. His mighty claws grasped the stone, shoving hard upon Xerath's form under this mound of rubble.\n\"You have brought ruin to Shurima, magus,\" Nasus added. His hands also grasped stone. Brothers-in-arms, the two began to use the energy of Xerath against him. Stone sizzled and quaked, wrapping around the being of energy. Runes were etched by some unseen force, completely average stone becoming wrought with power and energy. \"And now, you shall be locked in darkness for eternity.\"\nXerath screamed. He called out to the two: \"It was an accident!\", \"I didn't mean to hurt anyone!\",\"I only wanted to help Shurima!\". But his cries fell silent as the stone bound tighter and tighter around him. Powerful as he was, Nasus and Renekton were beings with centuries of experience compared to his mere hours.\n\nSlowly, darkness encased the magus...\n\nEnd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-12T13:29:51.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jonius7:\n\nHere is my story.\n\n\"Nasus, seal the door! Please!\"\n\nMy dear brother, Renekton and I were facing the reality of things gone horribly wrong. Xerath had ascended. He had ascended, fuelled by his hatred of his master, Azir, the Shuriman emperor. Xerath had betrayed the Shuriman empire. In an instant, he had obliterated Azir and Shurima along with it. The legacy of Azir and his ancestors’ dynasty was gone as quickly as the Ascension had happened.\nRenekton and I had immediately rushed over to the Sun Disk only to have to restrain Xerath from wreaking more unspeakable havoc on the landscape. We had tried to contain him in a sarcophagus, only to have him shatter it as if it were flimsy glass. The tomb was the last resort.\n\nI sighed with a heavy heart as my brother dragged Xerath into the Tomb of the Emperors.\n\n“I’ll… I’ll never see you again!”, I exclaimed, “You must know that, Renekton!”\n\nRenekton, struggling with Xerath, was being pounded with arcane energy from the Magus Ascendant, it wouldn’t take long before Xerath grew familiar enough with his newfound powers to overwhelm him.\n\n“We… have to believe… that we’ll see each other again”, Renekton grunted. They were both inside the tomb now.\n\nI took one last look at the dark tomb, the walls inscripted with symbols and depictions of previous emperors. Just as I was about to slam the door shut I heard laughing. A menacing laugh, laced with the metallic reverb from the arcane being. Grimacing, I slammed the large ornate rock door shut. A wave of magical energy sealed the door with an intricate lock.\n\nWalking away, it pained me, that I may never see my brother again.\n\nThat was all so long ago.\n\nI had joined the League of Legends since then. There was its own brand of injustice that needed my help at the Institute of War. Wars between city states and factions had taken its toll on this land called Runeterra. As a result, the Institute of War was founded so that instead of full-scale wars, disputes would be resolved in “matches” on one of the Fields of Justice, between champions in the League of Legends.\n\nHowever, today was different. I felt a shift in the air, as if something big had happened outside the influence of the Institute of War. Say, there was that expedition that Sivir had left for a few days ago, perhaps she was bound to return, but she didn’t mention any details…\n\n“You looked troubled, Nasus”, said a rough voice. I turned to the right. Ryze had joined me at the entrance of the Institute of War.\n\n“If you’re worried about Sivir, I’m sure she’s fine!”’, said a light voice. There was Lux to the left of me, looking out into the distance. She turned to me and looked me in the eyes. “Stay positive!”\n\nThe Institute was fortunate to have one of the best views outside its front entrance. In the distance there was a beautiful lake, with green shrubs and trees dotting the edges. But the view was even better at sunset, the retracting sunlight would reflect on the lake’s surface in a way that made the lake almost transparent, before the sun would disappear behind the mountains on the horizon. Champions would mingle outside at this time to admire the view.\n\nAnd to the west, there was… wait… is that?\nI could see a dark figure making its way towards me. I couldn’t quite tell who it was from this distance as the sun was not shining to the west, but I felt that feeling again, the shift in the air as I watched and anticipated.\n\nAs the figure got closer, I could make out that the figure was quite tall, and seemed to be walking around… dazed? Or rather they were dashing in zig-zag directions as they travelled. I saw the faint glint of large teeth and a rather long head and mouth. Wait, no…\n\nRenekton.\n\nIt couldn’t be. I thought I’d never see my brother again. Yet the figure approaching was unmistakable, his thick green scales, and long bounding claws, I wouldn’t forget those. Not even in ten thousand years.\n\nI began to walk towards him. I was tempted to run up and embrace my dear brother, but why did I still feel so uneasy? And why were his eyes red?\n\nNevertheless, I closed the gap between us. He still seemed to be running and dashing towards me. “Renekton, my dear brother…”\n\nI barely saw it coming. He suddenly had his blade slicing at my torso, which I managed to block with my staff. The resulting clang was ominous, accentuating my feelings of unease.\n“Renekton, what are you…”\n\n“RRRARARRRRRRRGHGHGH!!!!”\nMy brother swiped at me again, this time aiming for a cross-cut on my left shoulder. I managed to sidestep out of the way. This was my brother? What had he become?\n\n“Brother-“\n\n“You are NOT my brother, traitor!”, he roared.\nThe rage was clearly there. Renekton’s eyes were glowing red, with bloodlust. He wanted to kill me. My brother, if I could even call him my brother, wanted me dead.\n\nRenekton suddenly resumed attacking with increased ferocity, I was forced to fight and wither him down, but he wasn’t slowing. The speed of his attacks threw me off balance for a split second, and that was enough for him to sense an opening, bringing his blade down-\n\n“Hyeya!”\nRenekton’s blade suddenly halted in mid-air. He was trapped in a light binding. I looked around and Lux was there, focusing her magic energy on Renekton, but he seemed to be able to shift the walls of the binding, and was starting to move…\n“Heeah!”\n“Feel my pain!”\nI saw the boundaries of Lux’s light binding turn blue and purple with Runic symbols on the edges of a cylinder shape. Ryze and Morgana had joined forces with Lux to create a triple binding.\n\n“We can’t hold him here for long, Nasus”, Morgana stated.\nNormally a single binding would be enough to keep someone at bay for a number of seconds. But it seemed that Renekton had extreme fury and was warping the powers of even three powerful mages, he was tossing around in his current position. I looked at Renekton’s face again. What had happened while he was trapped inside the Tomb of the Emperors with that Magus Ascendant? He must have gone mad. Oh, poor brother, and he must blame me for his madness.\n\nThe prison that the three mages had created for Renekton was fading. It wouldn’t be long now before he’d be ready to pounce once again.\n\n“Ohw!” Lux exclaimed. I felt a large impact and saw the shadowy vibrations on the ground as a ring of about eight summoners appeared around Renekton in his makeshift prison. The summoners were wearing purple cloaks, with the mark of yellow letters on their hoods. They were channelling magic through their fingers while chanting out spells to restrain Renekton.\n\nThere was one summoner however who wasn’t quite in the circle but was standing to the side of it. They were also wearing a dark blue cloak instead of a purple one. This summoner came up to the four of us and bowed, saying, “We thank you champions for defending as long as you did, he shall be taken care of now.”\n\nI blinked, and swallowed, glancing at my brother within the summoner circle before I spoke.\n“High Summoner Kalindus, he’s my brother, Renekton. What will happen to him now?”\n\n“Now that he is in the hands of the Institute, he will be given the choice of becoming a champion, such as yourselves. But questions like these are best saved for another day, when Renekton has calmed down enough. His mental state right now is too unstable to tell for sure.”\n\nI opened my mouth to ask another question, but then closed it, deep in thought. Renekton as a champion. I would undoubtedly face him on the Fields of Justice sooner or later if that happened.\nBut would I be seeing my old brother, or a shadow of his former self?\n\nAs I left and headed back towards the Institute, I heard one last sentence from Renekton:\n\n“You will not escape me, Nasus!”\n\nEND\n\nYeah, the triple binding from Lux, Ryze and Morgana was kinda cheesy, but I had the idea pop up in my head and I couldn’t seem to get rid of it. I hope the whole story is not too cliché and cheesy lol.\nIf I had more time I might have waffled out some sections even more, haha but I wanted to get to this stage where Nasus and Renekton meet each other again, after Renekton has succumbed to the madness. I also left it open enough to write future chapters.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-12T13:29:05.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HHSuperCC:\n\nSo, Azir and Anivia are having a conversation they talk about how similar they actually are.\nBoth their names start with their letter A.\nThey are both \"generally\" ap mid laners, unless some idiot gets the bright idea to go anivia adc, adc azir is perfectly fine though.\nSo then they start going on about their lives, Azir was reborn as a weird ass chicken thing, and anivia just gets reborn every gank.\nBecause nobody will gank within the cooldown, pwsh, junglers dont gank that often...\nBut then..\nAnivia talks about flying...\nAnivia flys everywhere and even in her splash arts, but azir is just walking along without wings.\nAnivia asks why he doesnt have wings, \"I mean, If you were like, reborn into this magical emperor half chicken thing, whats with your wings?

A Rioter's response was amazing (WARNING- SUPER LONG STORY)\n\nHere I was, standing before the mighty grand general of Noxus, Swain himself. “You, Anserem, are tasked with a mission that the fate of Noxian warfare could depend on.” I trembled. For a scrawny, disabled man, Swain imposed a massive presence in the room. Pointing his crutch towards me, Swain echoed, “Anserem, you are to travel to Demacia, to recruit the famous Yordle, Poppy.” I swallowed hard. “Surely your majesty, you don’t mean THE Poppy, keeper of the hammer?” I whimpered. “Indeed” the grand general replied. “Her potential as the commander and driving force of the Noxian army will benefit our conquests for total battlefield control and domination.” Swain’s crutch sparked with arcane energy, and spewed a bolt of magical lightning in front of me. “I have provided all necessary instructions and provisions for your mission. 1000 Riot points will suffice.” A bulging sack of RP emerged from the choking smoke formed by the lightning. “You are to consult the inception mage of Demacia.” “-And be warned,” said Swain, sternly, as I gingerly picked up the hefty sack. “Failure to accomplish your task will result in black, black consequences.” I shuddered, as beads of cold sweat formed on my head. “I understand, your majesty.”\n\nMoments later, I was sitting inside a badly weathered wagon, stained red from witnessing countless bloodshed and death. “Surely it can’t be too hard” I pondered. “Consult the mage, and bring Poppy. How hard can that be?”\n\nAs I neared the citadel of Demacia, my wagon was rocked with a deafening roar. When I poked my head out of the wagon canvas, men and women of all age flooded past. Out of the throbbing and chaotic pandemonium, I was able to pick up two words that sent goose-bumps firing down my back. Crag Beast. Before I could react, my wagon splinted apart, as a gargantuan crag beast crushed my vehicle. Fragments of wood and dust showered my face, as I was knocked aside by the explosion. Screams of terror were drowned by the deafening roar of the beast, as it ploughed its way through the traffic. In my dazed state, I was able to realize that small, coin-shaped objects were raining from the sky. One particular caught the sun’s bright glare, and the shape of a fist glinted off the object. To my horror, it was the Riot Points that were entrusted to me by Swain. In my frantic state, I ignored the crag beast and began to scrape whatever points were left from the chaos-sewn road. A nerve-breaking silence made me freeze, and my hairs stand on end. The crag beast towered over my puny frame, with one titanic hand groping at the remnants of my twisted wagon. The glimmer from the raining Riot Points had no doubt, attracted its attention. As the behemoth reached down, I braced myself for the inevitable. “I love you Heather darling. Take care of my children. Great Nagakaborous, please accept my pitiful soul.”\n\nThen I saw it. Like a shining light in the murky darkness, a small, golden haired yordle, wielding an oversized hammer, charged at the mighty crag beast. I watched in awe, as the plucky yordle swung her hammer with incredible dexterity and speed, dodging the lumbering crag beast and inflicting blow after blow. With a final, powerhouse swing, the mystery yordle struck the head of the beast, splitting its gigantic frame into two. The crag beast... was dead. Satisfied with her victory, the yordle trotted up to my bruised face, and helped me up. I couldn’t express my relief and my amazement- that such a small person could pack such a large punch. “Th…Thank you… Ms…?” I stuttered. “Poppy. Don’t mention it” said the yordle brightly. “You… you’re a hero, you know that?” I said. To this, Poppy simply replied, “Hero? Naw, I’m just a yordle with a hammer.” With that, she trotted away, to help other civilians, injured by the defeated crag beast.\n\nAs I neared the Inception mage’s shop, my mind was engrossed on the yordle who had saved my life. Poppy, hero, Demacia…\n“Come in!” Squawked a wizened old man, as he opened the door. He extended a dry, shrivelled hand. “I’m the Inception mage- I believe a messenger from the grand general of Noxus?” My eyes widened. “How did you know that?” “Oh, a mage always knows what’s up” cackled the strange man as he shuffled into the appointment room. Light heartedly, he produced a stained manuscript with covered with black, scrawled writing. “Sign here, and here please.” pointed the mage, as he prodded a bony finger at the paper. It was a contract, stating that the inception of Poppy would take place, so that she would believe that the hero she was looking for, was actually no-one else but the grand general Swain himself. I paled at the thought. I couldn’t possibly sign that! The citizens of Demacia needed the aegis from the shrewd yordle. But then, Swain’s words echoed in my head. “Failure… black, black consequences…” A blurred vision of my family and I, grimly awaiting execution through decapitation by the grand executioner, flashed before my eyes. My will steeled, and I grasped a feather and swiftly singed my name on the manuscript- ‘I, Anserem, hereby permit the inception taken place on Poppy of Demacia.’\n\n“Inception fee charge of 260 Riot Points please,” the mage giggled, as he gleefully wrapped up the damned contract. I kicked myself. How foolish of me, sacrificing a great Demacian hero to save his neck and his family! Cursing myself inwardly, I pulled out the sack of Riot Points, materialized by Swain. After the crag beast incident, the sack was nothing more than a ragged cloth, adorn with holes and gashes. However, as I counted the remainder of the Riot Points, my heart jammed in my throat. “253… 254… 255… 256.” I was 4 Riot Points short. My life flashed before my eyes. “Listen old-timer” I reasoned with the mage, “Is a discount possible?” The inceptionist’s facial expressions hardened. “No Riot Points…” the mage drawled, “…No Inception”. I squirmed in my shoes, as a gruesome foreshadowing began to sprout in my head. The grand general’s face would become twisted with rage, and would roar at my failures. Swain would then morph into a grotesque image of a hell-born raven, and a claw bearing mighty talons would grasp my throat, lacerating my neck. “Take this carcass to the grand executioner!” Swain would screech. The colour would drain from my face, as I would collapse on my knees to desperately plead for mercy. “Your majesty, have pity on my family! I have two children…” But by then, the palace guards would have forcibly grasped my shoulders, and haul me to the chopping board like a lamb to the slaughter. As I returned to reality, my mouth ran dry. “This is the end” I thought. “I’ll have to return to Noxus for execution…”\n\nIt is here, dear Riot reader, I am stuck in right now. Please, for the sake of my own skin, would it be possible for you to be the tentacle of Nagakaborous, and graciously add 4 more Riot Points into my account! Through this, I will be able to fulfil my mission by purchasing the Noxus Poppy skin on the snow-down sale, and not be executed by Draven.\n\nThis story can only have two outcomes. How the future events that will take place is determined by you, dear Riot staff. I am writing this in a desperate situation, with no other help to turn to. I pray that you will make the right decision.\nKind regards,\n-A deeply troubled Anserem.\n\nRioter's response\n\nAnserem,\n\nI hope that this message reaches you in time! The status of Noxus and our expansion across Runeterra rests in your hands.\n\nKatrina, noticing your lack of RP, sent me to you to make sure your trip is a successful one. She contacted me while I was on my own reconnaissance mission deep into the Kumungu Jungle. Upon hearing about your plight, I quickly crossed back across the jungle, narrowly escaping a Nidalee spear. I nearly died crossing the Shurima Desert, as I didn't pack enough water for the journey. However, after encountering Cassopiea and gaining her assistance, I finally crossed into Demacian territory, where I could finally reach you.\n\nAt the request of the Sinister Blade, by the blessing of The Serpent's Embrace, and on the behest of the Master Tactician, I deliver to you 4 RP. Go forth, Mighty Anserem, and complete your quest. Capture Poppy, and bring the might of The Hammer of Orlon to Noxus!\n\nFor Noxus!\nRiot swimbananas\n\nPS: For your return trip home, ask LeBlanc if she is willing to help you distort back.

Instantly, the mage’s cold face warmed, and returned to its eccentric state. “Tee hee, another customer,” he whispered merrily, as he opened the door. There, standing in the sombre night, stood a hooded figure. Judging by appearance, the mysterious customer appeared to have traversed great distances of Valoran to arrive in Demacia. Her cloak was soiled with dirt and sand, and ragged holes were scattered on the surface. “My name is Riot Swimbananas. I am here on the behest of the master tactician,” said a young woman’s voice. My ears pricked up- not from curiosity, but from fear. “Swain knows…” I panicked. “He’s aware of my blunder of a mission… he’s sent this woman to escort me back to Noxus for execution…” “I believe your patron, Anserem, is in lack of Riot Points.” the female stranger continued, “At the request of the sinister blade, by the blessing of The Serpent's Embrace, I deliver to you 4 RP.” What?! My heart skipped a beat, as I collapsed onto the wooden floor from pure relief. As I steadied myself, the hooded woman revealed her shrouded face. Again, my legs gave way, and I tumbled to the ground. Not by relief, but by awe. Although her allegedly long journey to Demacia had weathered her face, I was struck by her elegant complexion. The stranger had swirling, brown hair that was somewhat frazzled from the unforgivingsojourn to Demacia, and possessed deep blue eyes, that mesmerized my mind silly. “Are you… an angel?” I said goofily, as she handed my redeeming ticket- a small satchel containing exactly four Riot Points. Furiously, my mind began to formulate a witty compliment that could capture my saviour’s heart. “You look like Johan Scarlettson,” I uttered. …And there goes the moment. Way to go, Anserem. Just wait until the missus hears about this. I pictured my wife’s face twisted into a mask of rage, and the surface of a frying pan connecting with my well-deserved kisser. As the angelic figure strode towards the door, she added, “For your return home, ask LeBlanc if she is willing to help you distort back. Rumour has it, she is somewhere in Demacia.” And with the sweep of her coat, she disappeared into the murky darkness.\n\nWith trembling hands, the lifesaving points were carefully handed to the Inception mage. “Thank you!” cackled the decrepit wizard, as he snatched the points, and like the rest of the 256, he stored carefully in an esoteric pocket inside his robe.\n\nFrom the frigid alleys of Demacia, the midnight crow screeched loudly. The inception was about to begin. “Step aside, good sir,” the Inceptionist called, as he hobbled towards a large table, groaning under the weight of a mighty, leather bound spell-book, containing the fundamentals of a successful inception. The mage gleefully rubbed his ancient hands together, and grasped his staff. I assumed that he would blast the sky with some mystical powder that would somehow change Poppy’s viewpoint of a hero. Muttering an unrecognizable spell, the mage began the inception, by charging his staff with blue energy. Sparks fizzled and popped before his eyes, as spell chanting became exponentially stronger, sweeping like a crescendo. Terrified of what would happened next, I grasped a nearby table and braced myself for a giant fulmination of magical energy. Over the roaring din, the mage hollered, “Basic inception procedures! I’m about to dispatch you into psychological isolation, thus you will enter spurious realm of time and reality!” Before I could comprehend what a single word from the mage meant, he angled his staff towards my petrified head, and discharged a brilliant burst of lightning, which struck me right between the eyes. For a fraction of a second, I felt absolutely nothing- then the searing pain swept my mind, followed by an overwhelming desire to black out. So I did.\n\nFire. Blood. Anguish. I opened my eyes, to realize that I was placed in the middle of a raging battle in an unrecognizable town. Flames greedily licked the dry, wooden houses, and the sound of bloodshed, and cries of the dead battered my ears. Disorientated, I stumbled to my feet, only to narrowly dodge a swiping sword from a frenzied soldier. From further in the distance, the ominous drum beats of war rumbled towards the town. I recognized the drums- Noxian war command beats. My legs turned into jelly, as I realized I was in the heart of a bloody Noxian conquest. I cursed the mage. “Where am I? What did that blasted wizard do to me?” A fresh wave of Noxian soldiers engulfed the town, ransacking whatever items were worth of value. As chaos ensued, I dived behind a nearby wagon, overturned by the havoc of battle. Over the shrieks of clashing metal, I caught the sound of a young girl crying. A small, golden-haired yordle, no older than a child, was quietly sobbing next to me. A twisted figure, bearing a yawning wound lay mangled next to her- presumably her father. “Poor child,” I thought. “She’ll be slaughtered in this battle.” Being a father of two, I instinctively picked up the mourning yordle, and cradled her in my arms. “There, there.” I whispered. “I’ll get you out of this place.” The yordle ceased to cry, and opened her big, violet eyes. She reminded me of someone. Someone I remember seeing not so long ago, but older… “You… You’re Poppy!” I exclaimed. Poppy feebly nodded her head. No doubt the discord of war had left her in a traumatized state. A fiery explosion rocked the wagon, causing Poppy to bury her head into my arms. She wanted to leave. So did I. I had no trouble doing so.\n\nAlthough carrying a young yordle whilst running wasn’t easy, the town’s state of disarray made matters worse. Arrows whistled in the air, as it streaked past my face, and the metal from swords sliced the air as I ran. Beside me, men alike clashed with one another, resulting in blood being spilt, as the life-giving flow splattered on the charred, cobblestone pavement. As I neared what appeared to be the towns rear gates, I was knocked aside by a tremendous eruption. Great chunks of debris rained down, crushing my leg, pinning me towards the blackened earth. Pain screamed in my fibia, as it wriggled and howled through my veins. The bone was pulverized into two. “Go!” I shouted to Poppy, gritting my teeth in turmoil. “Save yourself while you still can!” Terrified, Poppy started to flee, before she turned and weakly asked, “Wh…what is your name sir?” It was here, that I remembered my whole purpose of this dystopic inception. To convince Poppy that Swain was her hero. Quick wittedly, I groaned, “Swain. Jericho Swain. Now run! Flee!” Obediently, Poppy nodded, terrified, and ran out of the ravaged town. As the figure of the yordle became smaller and smaller in the distance, I was engulfed in a smouldering inferno, from the wildly spreading fire. The omnipresent voice of the mage echoed in my head, “Had enough, good sir… Had enough, good sir?”\n\n“Had enough, good sir?” The mage inquired, as I opened my eyes. Groggily, I turned my head. No flames. No blood. No marching of soldiers or the intense heat of battle. I was once again, living in reality. I pointed a shaky finger at the twisted man. “You mad bastard,” I spluttered. “You placed me in the middle of a damned battlefield! My right leg was severed because of that!” “No need for mild profanity” replied the mage calmly. “It was all a dream.” I grasped my leg, and to my utter relief, it was still intact. “It is done,” the mage said. “You may return to Noxus. I believe the grand general is fully capable of concreting the debuff.” With a sigh of relief, I collected my belongings and limped to the door. Suddenly, the mage called, “’tis a shame that such a prodigious girl will spend the rest of her life cursed, by the inception debuff.” I bit my lip. “It is.” I silently grieved.\n\nThe illusionist LeBlanc’s distortion teleportation technique proved to be far more efficient than a weary ride on a worn-down wagon, as I was instantly teleported to the inside of the grand general’s castle. More exactly, a spectacular crash onto the cold, marble floor, ten feet from Swain’s presence. “I see you have, under the supervision of the deceiver, distorted your way back to Noxus,” the grand general commented. “I assume that your mission recruiting Poppy has been one of triumph.” I meekly nodded. Deep inside, I violently suppressed the urge to hurl a glob of spittle at the master tactician’s face. Poppy was a rightful citizen of Demacia, and never deserved a place in the squalid army of Noxus. Swain’s face signalled approval. “Your reward, Anserem, for successful completion of your task.” Again, his crutch imbued with dark sorcery, and blasted a bolt of brilliant energy, to form a sagging pouch of gold. “You may return to your home, Anserem,” dismissed Swain, with a swift flick of his wrist. “You have served well.” Without a word, I scooped the bag of golden coins, and exited the accursed castle.\n\nIt was only a matter of time, before Poppy too, entered the land of Noxus. But curse the gods of the Bilgewater seas, never did I expect to unexpectedly meet her during the bustling markets of the harbour province. “Hey, don’t I recognize you from somewhere?” said Poppy curiously. I allowed a sickly smile to be plastered on my face. “I’m the man you rescued from the crag beast, remember?” To this, her face brightened. In the most sincere voice I could muster, I spoke, “You saved my life that day. You’re a hero to me.” How cheesy and dim-witted I thought. Poppy merely giggled, then looked towards the ground and sighed. “I’m no hero… I feel like real hero awaits me in Noxus. I just hope, he’s not like the others.” Poor girl, the grand general would never appear to be a hero. Before I could stop myself, I felt my mouth inquire further about Poppy’s mentor. Surprised, since that nobody ever asked her about her perfect hero, Poppy timidly continued. “I had a dream,” she murmured. “It was a dream about my childhood. \n\nPart 2:","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-12T13:28:36.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was defenceless- lost. War raged around me.” My smile rapidly shrunk to a nervous grin. She was reflecting on her inception. Her eyes were clouded with a wispy shroud- the inception debuff was taking a toll on her. “…Out of the fire,” Poppy progressed, “a young man with a broken leg rescued me from the battle…” her voice trailed off, as she stared at me with utmost interest. Cold sweat once again broke out on my forehead, as I silently prayed that she wouldn’t recognize me. “Do you by any chance, know a man named Jericho Swain?” asked Poppy, with a touch of suspicion in her voice. “I do,” I bursted, slightly too loudly. And before I could jam my mouth shut, I continued, “Yonder the hill, Swain resides in the grand general palace”. “Thank you sir.” responded Poppy, possibly hinting an edge of lingering wariness. With that, she bravely trotted away to confront her hero.\n\nSweet Nagakaborous, what have I done? I just sent Poppy to her demise- now blood was on my hands. How could I ever live a free life again, knowing that I was responsible for the downfall of a future hero? Right and wrong clashed intensely inside my mind, as I began to search for a solution- a solution to redeem myself from my guilt and sin.\n\n“Maelwen, give me Item:3104 and Item:3026” I grunted. The old shopkeeper stared at me, startled. “Anserem, that’ll costs half a leviathan!” As a response, I simply placed the over-swollen bag of gold coins, that I was rewarded from Swain, onto the counter. Sceptically, the grizzly shopkeeper swiped the bag, and handed me the items. “I dare say you’ll find a use for this,” said the keeper, scratching his balding head as I headed for the door. “I don’t do refunds either!” he hastily added.\n\nSummoning all my courage and grit, I strode back into the grand general’s palace. Only moments ago, Poppy herself, had entered the palace to meet the grand general. My eyes darted from left to right, desperately trying to locate the young yordle, amongst the towering pillars and pastel-ivory walls. As I searched, Swain could might as well be concreting Poppy’s inception debuff, enslaving her to the Noxian military forever. Time was against my side.\n\nMy pace hastened, as I searched the myriad of rooms in the palace. No doubt, it was pointless wasting my energy, scanning the vast capacities of the grand general’s palace. By now, Poppy would have entered the heart of the kingdom- the residential space for Swain. My legs took off, as I ran straight to the hall of Noxian legends.\n\nUpon nearing the entrance to the hall, I was confronted by two, beefy guards. “Halt!” one guard vociferated, baring his yellowed teeth. “One does not simply enter the hall of legends under the admission of the grand general!” “Look, I’m kind of busy here,” I spat, irritated. No more than 20 feet from my footings, stood the plucky yordle Poppy, seemingly mesmerized by the mere presence of Swain. Both guards rammed their meat hook-like hands on my shoulders, and proceeded to drag me away. “Poppy!” I hollered, but in vain. The poor yordle appeared to be hypnotized under the crushing effects of the inception debuff. Spurred by my attempts to deny the future bastion of his military, Swain, wavered his crutch, and began to ready the concretion of the debuff. “No…” I whimpered. I couldn’t bear to watch the saviour of Demacia be apprehended by deceitful sorcery. My vision blurred as tears formed in my eyes. In one last wriggle attempt to free myself, I managed to secure freedom for one hand. With inch by pain-staking inch, I forced my hand to grasp item:3104, pocketed deep in my satchel. With my final ounce of energy, I tossed the item into the direction of the entranced Poppy. It was a small, silvery scarf that sailed in slow-motion. A quicksilver sash. My eyes tracked its trajectory, as the sash fluttered down, down, down, and enclosed Poppy’s waist. With a brilliant pulse of cleansing light, the mercurial magic expunged the blighted debuff from Poppy’s mind. Instantly, the shroud that covered her violet eyes cleared away. My limbs surrendered, as I breathed a sigh of victory.\n\n“Where… where am I?” trembled Poppy. Dazed, she nervously glanced around the soaring hall of the Noxian legends. “Noxian architecture! I’m in the grand general’s palace!” she gasped. In front of her, Swain screeched with anger. His one and only chance to reinforce the cohorts of Noxian combatants was gone. And I was to blame. “Sir, what are you doing here?” panicked Poppy, as she recognized my face. “Damn you, country worm!” Swain cawed, as his body rapidly morphed into a monstrous, demonic raven. “You dare oppose the orders of the grand general of Noxus?!” The fires of hades flared in his eyes, as he grasped his crutch. With a flick of his hand, mighty talons ruptured from the solid marble floor, and dug deeply into my feet. I screamed in agony, as the talons twisted inside my ankles, fleshing out muscle and bone with excruciating pain. “Your weak mind led to your downfall,” roared the now grand-raven, as his crutch began to kindle an ominous spell. “Only the strong survive in Noxus!” he spat. I braced myself and waited for the inevitable.\n\n“Get away, from my HERO!” thundered Poppy, as she swung her mighty hammer of Orlon, and connected it to the beak of the hell-bent raven. Even the sorcery of the all-powerful grand general, was no match for the legendary uru metal forged in Poppy’s hammer. WHAM! Swain squawked with torment, as he was launched into the air, and spiralled down to land with an almighty crash. The talons that firmly secured me retracted into the earth, making me tear out another ear-splitting shriek of pain. Gathering momentum, Poppy whirled her hammer and with two deft strokes, left a large, hammer-shaped dent in each guard’s head. Almost like paper, the once-strong guards crumpled to the ground. “Let’s get out of here!” said Poppy forcefully. The talons from Swain’s nevermove had left gaping tears in my feet, and had turned my pace into a limping walk. Behind me, the sound of the cascading of feet indicated a fresh wave of soldiers. I grimaced. I was leaving a streak of blood on the milky marble floor. “I’m only slowing you down,” I groaned. “Go Poppy. Save yourself.” She shook her head fiercely. “I’m getting…” she heaved, as she practically dragged me to the entrance of the palace. “…you out of here!” From the corner of my eye, I noticed a figure. A lone archer, with his bow drawn, possibly aiming directly at Poppy’s heart. “Get down…” I grunted, as I shoved Poppy aside.\n\nI heard the twang of the bowstring. The whistling of the arrow. It felt as if time had stopped moving. A force of a thousand blows drilled my chest, making me teeter backwards, and collapse onto the floor. The wind was knocked from my lungs, as the pain like a snake writhed inside me. As I looked at my chest, a wooden beam protruded from my ribs. Laces of blood bubbled from my mouth, as I attempted to steady myself. As if red-hot coals had been poured into my chest, intense agony seared my heart. Poppy gawked with terror. “No, no, no, please don’t die sir” she cried, as she desperately tried to extract the arrow lodged in my ribs. I gently pushed her away. “Get… out of… Noxus, Poppy.” I choked. Blood trickled down my mouth as I spoke, slowly pooling on the ground below me. “Be the hero… that Demacia needs…” Despite saying this, I knew that Poppy would never understand, that she was the true hero that deserved the hammer of Orlon. Poppy buried her head into my arms. “I thought you were my hero that awaited me in Noxus…” she sobbed, pearly tears rolling from her baby eyes. Another arrow narrowly missed my face, as it thudded into the ground adjacent to me. “At least, wh.. what is your name sir?” sniffled Poppy, as she grasped her hammer. I groaned. “Anserem- Anserem… of the harbour province. Now run… flee…” With one last tearful glance, Poppy scurried away, under the hail of Noxian arrows. “She’ll get away.” I thought. My eyesight wavered, as my panicked heart fought desperately to pulse for a final time. I smiled. “I win Swain.” I laughed. With that, my eyes rolled back, and my fire was defused. Under my clothes, item:3026 glowed white, as a divine light captured my flying soul, and placed it back into my earthly body. My eyes opened again, and the edges of my mouth weakly curled into a grin. That guardian’s angel armour was worth its weight in gold.\n\nIf you managed to read the whole thing, I salute thee. Cheesy? Yes. Worth? Absolutely. (Did you manage to see any small easter eggs?)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
