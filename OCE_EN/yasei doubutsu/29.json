I haven&#039;t thought of any.\r\n\r\nWell that was untill I got a thank you from 1 guy, I helped him understand why hes in bronze and hes now working to getting into silver.\r\nIts actually nice when you help someone and they listen.\r\n\r\nSo there are a few &quot;League&quot; resolutions I wanna make for this year.\r\nFirst of all, try and get my main account into Plat.\r\nIf not/Maybe if I have time. Get my other account into Gold.\r\n\r\nI also wanna play with my little brother more, as he is slowly enjoying league.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are some other things I wanna work on aswell.\r\nAfter I go to this weeding for my sister XD\r\nHelping 1 guy learn form his mistakes has prompted me to try some things.\r\n\r\nNow if any of you are bronze, Im willing to help much like I did for that guy.\r\nHere is the reference of what I did.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&amp;list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\r\n\r\nI want to help people get better at League -or as much as I can anyway-\r\nI had an idea of doing a &quot;How to support as X champion&quot; series, where I explain how to play any champion as a support role.\r\n-Legit support none of that bull crap and not peeling/warding etc-\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nSo this year, I wanna help as many people as I can learn and enjoy this game. And maybe climb while im at it.\r\nIf anyone has any ideas on what I should do, and how I should go about feel free to yell at me.\r\n\r\nAlrighty, so Good luck have fun.\r\nFrom your humble acolyte of shurima.\r\n\r\nhopefully this year will be just as good if not better then the last.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\nAdditional stuff.\r\nYoutube channel:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8x_OF9Fo1vb8NkaASrXaXQ\r\n\r\nIf you look, Ive made a promise with/for myslef that I will never ask anyone to &quot;Like N Subscribe&quot;\r\nIf I do good then people should like and do that on there own.\r\n\r\nTwitter:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/YaseiDoubutsu\r\n\r\nFacebook:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/YaseiDoubutsuXD/?ref=hl","replies":[{"poster":"Brookles","date":"2016-01-01T01:02:27.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi happy new year!
