I&#039;ve looked on google images but have had no luck, its usually gifs of other things and not the sun disk dripping water/sand.\r\n\r\nI wanna use the gif to cover the black borders in my videos.\r\nMy monitor is square like, meaning when I record I get black borders on the side, as YouTubes default setting is 16/4 etc.\r\nSo I thought why not have something pretty instead of the black borders.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-19T10:40:43.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I wouldn't recommend rendering a gif into a video, I would recommend taking the login screen and splitting the motif down the middle and using half on either side. You'll have to find the loop point but that wouldn't be too hard.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGq53f-4XDs\n\n\nYour other option is to take the Crystal Scar loading screen BG (from S@20). I use the loading screen BGs (HA for ARAM, SR for norms etc) to put behind the masked out client before loading so I don't have my desktop or empty space behind it. It also then matches up with the loading screen if I happen to have a clip from it. Just anchor the centre and resize.\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mLEZvmKZQ7o/VWZo6XqsxLI/AAAAAAAAqfo/KZAwrVdvdbs/s1600/CSBackground.png","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-19T10:55:32.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, cool thank you.\nI shall mess with these and use the one I like more.\n\nAlso I was thinking of using video footage, just wasn't sure how that was gonna turn out.","replies":[]}]}]}
