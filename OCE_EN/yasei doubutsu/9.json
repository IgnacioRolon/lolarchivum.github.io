(Small boost against possible mages on the enemy team, it is ad vs ad after all.)\r\n2.7 armor + 27 Armor at lvl 18 (29.7 in total) I like to go per lvl armor as I get more out of it rather then flats, I know that flats give me alot of protection early, but I gotta think of the team, and I usually like to scale into the mid/late game making me only harder to kill as time goes on.)\r\nand the 3% move speed, gotta walk into lane faster after recalling so I dont have to use TP, or walk into mid lane and gank without TP.\r\n(Or just kiting in general)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nName: AD top VS AP:\r\n3 marks of attack speed.\r\n6 marks of armor pen.\r\n6 seals of health.\r\n3 seals of percent health.\r\n9 glyphs of MR per lvl.\r\n1 quint of attack speed.\r\n2 quints of move speed.\r\n\r\nTotal:\r\n48 health.\r\n1.5% increased HP (usually if im going top im going tank and stacking HP. once again just some late game things giving me about an additional 300-500 HP)\r\n27 MR at lvl 18.

(At the start of the game I wont be using my AP as auto attacks until I get waaay more, so this helps get in AA dmg at the start of the game, while also making my spells and future AA dmg even stronger.)\r\n18 flat AP.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nName: AP mid VS AP.\r\n9 marks of AP per lvl.\r\n4 seals of armor per lvl.\r\n5 seals of flat AP.\r\n9 glyphs of MR per LVL.\r\n3 quints of spell vamp.\r\n\r\nTotal.\r\n17 AP at lvl 18 + 3 flat.

But If Im going to buy flat AP items anyway, then why not make it so I have morgana&#039;s passive as some form of sustain)\r\n27 MR at lvl 18 (AP&#039;s cannot kill as quickly as AD *Usually*, so I want to scale once again into mid/late game.)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nName: Marksman:\r\n6 marks of flat AD.\r\n3 marks of AD per lvl.\r\n9 seals of armor per lvl.\r\n3 glyphs of CDR per lvl.\r\n6 glyphs of flat mana regen (Testing, I like to use spells to clear waves or harass, I like to spam)\r\n2 quints of attack speed.\r\n1 quint of CDR per lvl.\r\n\r\nTotal:\r\n5.7 AD + 7.3 at lvl 18 (13 in total a pickaxe.)\r\n10.01% CDR at lvl 18.\r\n27 armor at lvl 18.

There is a method to their madness, and although some slight tweaks come down to personal playstyle, you can look among many of your favourite pro players to find the rune and mastery set to suit you best. I really recommend using the site below to source a lot of your information regarding runes/masteries and skill orders. \n\nhttp://probuilds.net/\n\nHave a browse and see what you like, it will really help you out! One other thing that I'd like to mention is that not all runes are equal in efficiency. Such as 3 Attack Speed Quints and 9 AD marks gives 14.5%AS and 9AD, versus 9 AS marks giving  and 3 AD Quints giving 6.75 AD and 15.3% AS. Note you're losing out on a significant amount of AD for a slight AS boost. Most pros will use runes in a certain layout, such as HP seals and Armor Quints instead of vice versa. Note down how they have their setup and apply it to your own theorycrafting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2016-06-15T04:14:35.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never use mana regen runes but I have a couple odd pages I use all the time:\n-----\n**[ADC] Tear**\n{{champion:126}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:6}}  has my ADCs <3\n9 red + 3 quints of Armor pen = 19 ArPen\n6 blue cdr\n3 blue scaling cdr = 5% + 5% @18\n9 yell scal = 27 Ar @18\nWith masteries to go along:\n**Tear of the AD Gods** 12/18/0\nThunderlords - precision - dangerous game - merciless - biscuits - savagery\nOppressor - vamp - doubleedge - sorcery\n\nThis combo gives 23 ArPen @ lvl1, up to 27 @18, usually get {{item:3142}} then {{item:3156}} and/or{{item:3147}} for total possible 67 ArPen, stacking all this armor pen after getting {{item:3004}} is great.
