New item + enchanted for jungle item. \"Shurima's Brace\" + \"Gaurdian\".","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has tried to make a good tank item for our junglers which backfired horribly *Cinderhulk*\r\nso while talking to some Rioters and reading about some threads I decided to try and create a new item.\r\n\r\nNow before I go into things we need list/Discuss the items at hand.\r\n\r\n&quot;Hunter&#039;s Machete&quot; = 400 Gold.\r\n+ 15 Bonus gold per Large Monster kill.\r\nPassive- Jungler: Deal 30 Magic DMG on hit to monsters over 2 seconds,\r\nand gain 7 HP and 3 MP while in combat with monsters.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo you gain gold per kill and deal bonus DMG whle gaining some HP/MP back.\r\nnow what Cinderhulk did *Which got abused* was AoE DMG while getting stronger per lvl and stacked up. *Opps -Riot*\r\n^ Because it was a replacement/Substitution for an early sun-fire cape.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo I thought about creating a tank based item that can only be used in the jungle *So some smart ass laner cant abuse it*.\r\n\r\nSo what does a tanky jungler need? Health and Armor of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Ruby Crystal&quot; = 400 Gold.\r\n+ 150 Health.\r\n\r\n&quot;Cloth Armor&quot; = 300 Gold.\r\n+ 15 armor.\r\n\r\nPretty simple stuff yeah?\r\n*I was thinking of adding in a magic mantle but a jungler doesnt need MR against monsters and so I removed it*\r\n\r\nSo now lets combine these items into a new one.\r\n\r\nRuby + Cloth + 300 Gold = &quot;Shurima&#039;s Brace&quot;\r\n+ 20 Armor\r\n+ 250 HP\r\nUnique Passive- Shurima&#039;s Cloak:\r\nGain + 4 Armor per Monster near you. *Max- 16*\r\nand 25% Base HP Regen in combat with Monsters.\r\n\r\n^ This should make it only useful while in the jungle and thus cannot be abused by laners.\r\nBecause the regen and armor are only useful while near monsters *Not Minions*.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow obviously the jungle item can upgrade.\r\n\r\nUpgraded Jungle item + 450 Gold.\r\n+ 30 Bonus gold per large Minion kill.\r\n+ X-Y-Z different passives.\r\n\t-Chilling Smite\r\n\t-Scavanging Smite\r\n\t-Blasting Smite\r\n\t-Challenging Smite\r\n\r\nso you get the second tier jungle item *850 Gold in total* + Shurima&#039;s Cloak *1000 in total* add another 400 gold.\r\n*To make it worth 2250 the same as every other jungle item*\r\n\r\nand now you get your new Jungle Item.\r\nEnchantment: &quot;Gaurdian&quot; *Like Warrior-Magus etc*\r\n+ 30 Armor.\r\n+ 400 Health Points.\r\n+ 30 Move Speed.\r\n\r\nUnique Passive- Shurima&#039;s Cloak: *Upgraded a little*\r\nGain + 6 Armor per Monster near you. *Max- 24*\r\nand 50% Base HP Regen in combat with Monsters.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow lets compare this to Cinderhulk.\r\n*For this I will be doing &quot;Stalkers Blade with Cinderhulk*\r\n\r\n+ 300 HP\r\n25% Base HP regen.\r\nChilling smite-\r\nJungler passive-\r\n~Immolate~ &lt;== we want to look at this one.\r\n\r\n^ Deals 15 ( + 0.6 champion lvl) as an AoE but deals 100% more DMG to monsters.\r\nAt lvl 18 Immolate now deals about 25 as an AoE (50 to monsters) I think the Base amount does not change so I left it.\r\nThis may seem small but this allows massive wave clear and bonus DMG to enemy champions.\r\n\r\nSo a big huge hulk like Mundo who runs TP + Smite top will get this enchantment for AoE clear + Free DMG.\r\nas well as having his own % of HP DMG.\r\n\r\nNow if we compare to what Ive done.\r\nWe get 100 More HP.\r\n25% more HP regen.\r\nSome small amount of move speed. (= to basic boots)\r\nand Armor + Armor based on what camp you are clearing.\r\n\r\nSo this removes AoE clear and grants more of a sustain option as well as being more tanky.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOriginally I did have Magic Mantle as apart of the build so that Junglers can build both Armor and MR.\r\nBut decided to remove it, I will Copy and paste my original notes it it however.\r\nI was also going to add that it also has a ward charge *Like sightstone as its also made up from a ruby crystal* But only had 1 charge. \r\n(So lee sin/Jax can get it feel tanky and can still do ward jumps.)\r\nI was also going to draw something like the Ascension symbol on like an armband, but I seem to have misplaced my Tablet at this time :(\r\n\r\n----------\r\nCloth Armor + Magic Mantle + 200 Gold. (1000 Gold Total) \r\n= Shurimas Brace.\r\nGrants Armor + Magic Resistance.\r\nUnique Passive: Shurima&#039;s Cloak.\r\nGrants 4 Armor per monster nearby. *Max = 16\r\nGrants 2 MR per monster nearby. *Max = 8\r\n---------- &lt;== removed Magic Mantle for HP\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think/Want in the jungle.\r\nSomething that cannot be abused by sneaky laners.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-23T22:12:14.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"turn the mobility into a % bonus, and it might be a valid idea.\nHowever, the first reason for cinderhulk was to give tanky junglers a way to clear.
