I get stomped and have never won a ranked yet so I gave up.\n\nBut if someone could guide me to my first win, I would be very keen to play more ranked and climb. I have a rl friend that would probably duo queue with me too.\n\nLove to join if you have room -  SlothAlmighty","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-08-13T02:12:11.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since its your first time ever playing ranked your elo/mmr is silver 5(ish)\nmeaning you should get pared up with low Gold, silver and bronze.\nNothing wrong there.\n\nThe main issue is probably experience, you haven't played nearly enough games to be acquainted with every role and some champions.\nMeaning you also don't have enough runes to help you.\n\nI know this may suck, but I recommend chilling in normals for now or even ARAM for some fun and get to know some champions at random.\n\nThis should give you some ideas on how to play the game better passively.\n\n-----\n\nIf people start being assholes, just mute them.\nThe more time you spend arguing / typing the less time you have to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-16T00:12:56.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i did some hard research over the weekend, watched a heap of Blitz games and gathered as many tips and techniques as i could and put them into training. Also researched a heap of ADC and Support champs to know what their mechanics are so i know what to be prepared for...\nI went 9-0 wins in norms playing Blitz, so decided to try my hand at ranked.\nAfter having 8 losses at ranked previously I decided i'm forgetting about those, forgetting who my opponents might be and muted everyone before the game started.\nWon first 2 games of ranked and got promoted straight into Bronze III.

Since you are new, I cant say \"practice on X\" and stuff, because you need practice on everything.\n\nOnce you've played a shit ton of normal's you'll find yourself getting passively better and better at the game.\nSo until then just enjoy the game and have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-16T08:39:15.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly my plan mate, cheers","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"shadowalien13","date":"2016-08-15T21:56:01.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing for just over a year now, and suck as bot lane :/ \nI main jungle (levelled up playing it only) but I can also play top pretty good and barely play mid.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-08-16T08:01:57.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man you go on massive loosing streaks, once you've lost a few games put it down and take a break.\nALOT of your games go for over 30-40 mins.
