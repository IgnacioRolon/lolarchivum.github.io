If you're starting a new account to the game, no matter how many games you play, you'll never make enough BE to get all the champions for free. At the rate which EXP goes up, the new system cuts 5275 exp or something per 30 days. If you play only a couple games a day, the first win bonus is worth about 2 levels up to 35 or 40 or something, and if you only play a couple games a day, that's going to be your goal for a long time. those two level ups are worth 1620-2640 BE, the trade off for that is 1500 BE. At a bare minimum it is reducing BE gain per month by 120, up to 1140 for the lucky ones.\n\nNow you might say that this works out better at higher levels to work out better for you. No, it doesn't. At higher levels (which I can well see needing MASSIVE amounts of EXP, like... upwards of 10 000, that 175 exp is SO VERY MUCH more beneficial than a measly 50 BE. it's 1-2 games in some cases additional that people need to play EVERY DAY to get the same benefit, and since the 50 BE only ticks. Now, that 5275 exp may only be half a level, but it's over the course of a month. Getting 50 BE a day feel like a kick in the teeth as you will never truly notice it, but you WILL notice half a level gain. if makes it actually feel as though you're progressing.\n\nTaking into account that with IP you used to get group bonuses to your IP, it was more the more people you played with, and it was noticeable. NOW, however, no matter how many people you play with, you DO NOT get an EXP bonus.\n\nI'm sorry, but as much as you want to talk it up as \"evolution\" and \"the future\" and \"easier\" this new BE system is little more than a blatant attempt to force people to spend even more money on your \"Free to Play\" game. Even after buying a starter pack AND a champion pack, from a beginning account you still do not have anny real ability to play ranked, as the champions you can actually afford to buy to make up that 20 minimum aren't viable in ranked. \n\nAnd that is what's turning more and more people off the game. It's bad enough that it costs thousands of dollars to get skins for the champs, but a fierce attempt like this to stooge money out of people is fucking disgraceful, from a company that thought up the \"summoner's code\" and intergrity. Fucking thieves is what you are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-16T08:50:46.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alternatively, give players like 100BE for playing 5 games a day (win or lose), similar to first win of the day, but encouraging players to put more time in, and try to grind more than just going for first win of the day and logging out.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-16T08:53:03.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean while i agree with the idea, Riot wouldn't, fact is you can tell from their systems that they are only trying to appeal to the casuals, they won't do anything that would then be worth it for the non-casuals.","replies":[]}]}]}
