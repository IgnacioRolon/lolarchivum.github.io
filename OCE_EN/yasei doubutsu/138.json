So when someone is higher it doesn't automatically mean he is superior in terms of skill, but yes, there is always the case where he is just better than you in this game when he is walking around with a higher league tag.\n\nHowever, belittling upon someone just because you have certain aspect better than another is just sad, it's easily one of the worst attributes one can acquire in his/her life. And no one should ever go there.\n\nBut really though, don't engage arguments online often, it's healthier that way.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-04-02T10:16:36.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was passive the entire time.\nI was playing a normal game with a lvl 23, something like that.\nAll I said was, \"I have been splitting.
