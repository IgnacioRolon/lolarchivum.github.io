I don't care about some \"emotes\" that are now free, if they cost something beforehand, I sure as hell weren't ever gonna buy them.\n2. So apparently we still get the same amount of BE per capsule but it's tuned so we don't get two of the same shards now? Sorry but I never saw anyone complaining about getting multiple shards, what we were complaining about is the AMOUNT we got per level up.\n3. FWOTD now resets 2 HOURS less?? Wow such a big difference, now instead of it resetting at 6am for me it now resets at 4am? Nice, TOO BAD I'M STILL ASLEEP.
