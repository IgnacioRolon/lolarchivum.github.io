Whoever's doing well on your team, compliment them, be supportive when they die, and just ride them all game. Theres a psychological effect in humans that literally will make your team play better, because subconsciously they want more compliments and they want to prove that they're as good as YOU'RE saying they are. This really does go a long way. \nAlso, finally, play like a bitch. Don't get into stupid trades, farm well, if you see someone low health running into their jungle, let them go. If someone on your team decides to dive in 1v5, let them die, back up. You could try to be the hero that flash ults into stupid situations, or you could just...not. High risk plays like that only reward highly skilled players (99% of the time) --- and frankly anyone in bronze just isn't amazing at the game (which is not a big deal at all i'm not trying to like talk down to anyone, just being honest).\n\nTL;DR   -   Ride dicks, play like a bitch.
