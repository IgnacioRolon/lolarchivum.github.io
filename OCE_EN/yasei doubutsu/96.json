It works well on ranged sups like lulu or zilean who have a weak laning phase and offers early game power and lane dominance, especially if your adc isn't trading autos when the enemy adc tries to cs whilst expose weakness definitely outscales lategame. Battle trance doesn't feel like a mastery for an adc and seems to be more for bruisers and tanks since unless you constantly are pushing and staying in%%%%bat with minions, it'd be hard to make use of battle trance and with some peel, double edged sword outscales since it starts at 5% instead of reaching 5% over an extended fight. I find alot of bruisers in toplane works well with 12-0-18. With the changes, fervour works better for ad casters who have resets, whilst warlords seems to give alot of adcs who don't make as much use of fervor decent sustain at least and deathfire works well on jihn and caitlynn.\n\nIn the Cunning tree:\nNot much has changed here but greenfathers gift is really strong in botlane (try this with caitlynn if you can for funtime headshot damages) and for junglers or ivern wherever he's played if used correctly because that 3% max hp damage is almost a spell in itself, though I feel the others have their merits, bandit is good for supports who are often cash strapped and dangerous game works really well on tanks and bruisers in teamfights giving them around 10% extra hp if a few enemies die in the chaos making them much more durable.\n\nFinally the Resolve tree:\nSiegemaster is great in defensive lanes where you'll be pushed up to tower a fair bit but toughskin is better in aggressive lane matchups since it can reduce minion damage when jumping on the enemy for a hard trade or all-in and overall I feel toughskin is still better, especially when jungling  (since you generally won't be near allied towers for most of the game). Fearless is great for bruisers or fighters, especially when you need to play aggressive though I feel perseverance might still be better for tanks since they'll probably just be playing defensively in most cases and will often have to deal with a fair bit of poke. The extra armour and magic resist buff is also more useful over short-medium length trades and on champions that stack hp and have decent defense stats but don't just stack defensive stats. Courage of the Colossus is broken for tanks and if you have a fair bit of hard cc in your kit it'd be a crime not to take this mastery.\n\n\nI'll say again, I'm very very bad at this game but this is just what seems logical to me and what I've found works. I know I'm limited in experience and if I got anything wrong I'm very sorry. But I hope if you don't play very much and don't keep up with the patchnotes this also helps.\n\nLove to watch your works Yasei Doubutsu.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-22T13:49:36.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still feel like taking Fresh Blood is pretty redundant on supports.\nyour not suppose to deal DMG even as DMG based supports.\nYou AA them once, or use a spell and let your ADC do the work with expose weakness.\n\nI feel like battle trance is a safer option to take so you don't get one shotted my assassins or high burst mages.\nNot to mention fights or trades usually last long enough to get the 5% anyway.\n\nYou should always take bandit on supports, as you Shouldn't be taking CS / Kills away from your Marksman. Accidental kills are fine along with relic shield to proc. But you should not be getting them.\n\nDangerous game is ok, extra HP / MP is always good. I just prefer a safer style.\n\nIn worst case scenarios you will ALWAYS be pushed into your towers.\nPerseverance is great, it can be active when ever compared to seigemaster.\nBut In most cases you cant trust your lane partner, and being pushed back into your tower can suck.\nBoth Persa / Seige can do well here.\n\nCourage is broken, on everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-23T00:52:43.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting, I really have to fix my masteries then.
