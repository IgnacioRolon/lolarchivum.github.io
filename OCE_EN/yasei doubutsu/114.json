{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-13T04:31:20.944+0000","title":"Additional reporting tabs.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had some of these ideas while I had a REALLY bad game.\r\nI sent a support ticket to riot exercising some of my concerns.\r\nI&#039;ve seen a lot of board posts about the whole &quot;Kill yourself&quot; thing, and even one guy who made a good point about him getting perma-banned all the time.\r\nAnd how he would just hop onto another account and continue being an asshole.\r\n\r\nanyway for CONTEXT read this bit, below will be a TLDR followed by my suggestion and text copied to here from what I submitted to riot.\r\n*Context*\r\nI had a loosing streak the other day, I&#039;ve broken out of it and almost gold again (YAY!)\r\nBut in some of these games, holy shit, its like peoples stupidity just sky rocketed.\r\n1 game, I asked my team to upgrade trinkets (I usually upgrade mine about lvl 9-11 when ever I remember.)\r\nAnd make sure I tell my team to do the same. (Because AoE oracles, for 25 secs is OP and farsight totem is awesome)\r\nThe response I got was, &quot;Why? red is shit and blue is so terrible right now&quot; \r\nThat&#039;s not a major thing that was just really surprising to hear. I&#039;ve seen bronze games with more brains then that (And holy shit do I watch a lot)\r\nThe main one that really got me, was the biggest gut punch I&#039;ve ever had in league.  \r\nI had a game with a Korean duo, I know they were Korean because I used translator on after lobby game, and that&#039;s what it said it was.\r\nThat and I know Japanese (A little bit) and know the difference between Japanese and chinese characters.\r\nbasically, I was support that game (As usual) but I was the only tank on the team. I had a top, jungle, mid and adc, all very squishy and going full AD/AP respectively. Only top being someone tanky, but still going full AD.\r\nMeaning my job is to peel and protect 4 summoners now, now that&#039;s usually not so bad I&#039;ve done that before.\r\nNo the issue was the duo, when ever I would leave my &quot;ADC&quot; when she backed or would start to farm jungle or bot lane when their entire team was mid/top. I would roam mid or top. I managed to get some ganks off too, got some flashes was pretty worth. My team ended up being like 16-3 at one point which was awesome. However, every time I &quot;Left&quot; my &quot;Carry&quot; I would cop abuse form the mid and adc, saying how I should protect them, which is kinda hard when they are in base or in our jungle. I did ward btw, I would ward river and all bushes. (Guess who still got caught out even after we pinged)\r\nThen blamed me for &quot;Not protecting the carry&quot; \r\nWhen I protected our mid and jungler got a kill and a tower.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is when it started. When I was saying I was protecting my carries, I had 3 other carries to protect. We got objectives and we were winning.\r\n*Untill now* The duo then &quot;Threatened&quot; me that they would afk or feed intentionally if I spoke or pinged. *Even once*\r\nI couldn&#039;t do anything I was powerless to stop these two assholes form anything. We ended up loosing that game even tho it was an easy win.\r\nAfter game lobby was them abusing us with me, top and the jungler reporting them both.\r\n(Is it just me or a asain based players more of an asshole/racist? I get Australians but the worst they say is C*nt)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnyway that&#039;s when I came up with the idea of having some additional reporting tabs.\r\nI even had the idea while I was sending a ticket to riot of having additional boards.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\nAdditional reporting tabs include.\r\n&quot;Threatened(Me)&quot; Tab\r\n&quot;Other&quot; Tab.\r\nExplanation down below.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHere is some text on what I wrote to riot.\r\n\r\nRioters read only board-\r\nThis will help filter out the @Riot / @X(Rioters name) of the main forums when summoners what to address specific problems to a rioter.\r\nOr when a summoners just wants to have a general discussion with a rioter without interruptions.\r\n(Mainly from spammers on the boards / assholes.)\r\n\r\nThis should also help get some feedback and ideas across, while not cluttering / getting lost in the main boards.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting tabs.\r\nYou have reduced the number of reporting tabs and even mixed some together.\r\nBut I think you guys should add more, not condense/remove some.\r\nthe two suggestions I have are the &quot;Other&quot; reporting tab where a summoners has to type and specify their reasons.\r\n(I.E. spamming &#039;you guys removed that one&#039; pinging excessively &#039;spamming I guess&#039; threatening, assisting suicide/depression\r\nI speak of that last one because as much as I try to be happy myself and make everyone else around me laugh. I have very minor depression.\r\nSo someone saying &quot;Kill yourself&quot; doesn&#039;t help that once in a blue moon thought. Now someone who is waaaay worse then me. Might actually take that to heart. Now that&#039;s actually a criminal offense, saying someone should kill themselves and they do. &#039;Its under helping a suicide&#039;.)\r\n\r\nAnd as I&#039;ve said before, a &quot;Threatened(Me)&quot; tab.\r\nI&#039;ve had plenty of games where I&#039;ve seen this in various forms.\r\nI&#039;ve seen, do that again and Ill feed/afk. all that shit.\r\nNow the one that absolutely pissed me off and made me initially write this support ticket to begin with was this one.\r\n&quot;If you type or ping again I&#039;ll afk or even feed&quot;\r\nI had a Korean duo (I copied there text after game and used translator) Threaten me that If I communicated in anyway they would intentionally throw the game.\r\nI was powerless against that, I had no weapons against that. Nothing.\r\nSo I hope you can someone Empathise with that powerless feeling. (We lost anyway)\r\n\r\nAnyway-\r\nGood Luck Have Fun.\r\nFrom Your Humble Acolyte Of Shurima.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nWhat suggestions do any of you have for additional reporting tabs?\r\nOr board tabs?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-13T07:17:15.399+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Current report categories (for reference):\n\n>* **Negative attitude**\n(griefing, giving up)\n* **Verval abuse**\n(harassment, offensive language)\n* **Leaving the game/AFK**\n* **Intent feeding**\n(feeding is griefing, not just having a bad game)\n* **Hate speech**\n(Racism, sexism, homophobia etc)\n* **Cheating**\n(Unapproved third party programs)\n* **Offensive/ inappropriate summoner name**\n\n**Situation one:** _the warding totems_\n\nWarding trinkets come down to personal preference. I personally prefer to keep my green one, especially if others in my team have upgrades theirs (even if they haven't, there is a good chance they aren't gonna use them). It provides stealth wards, which are really useful to ward objectives, and they aren't going to be destroyed in 0.5 seconds. It also provides a readily available ward, in cases where your teammate needs somewhere to teleport (can't do that with blue). it's also unlikely the other team will be warding to an extent where you need more than one sweeper (unless teemo or invis champs).\n\n**Verdict: **_[can't report tactical disagreements](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q3)._\n\n**Situation two:** _protect your carry_\nWhile some people enjoy being babysat, they should say it nicely. If they were doing it in a toxic manner (sounds like they were), then it is reportable. \n\n**Verdict:** _Negative attitude & verbal abuse reports_\n\nPing spams can be _negative attitude_, but it depends on context.\nThreating to throw the game is _negative attitude_\n\nDeath threats, info leaks and suicide encouragement (like you said), are a whole different type. I believe that there should be a way to report this kind of extreme toxicity without sending in a support ticket. The only issue is that if another category such as \"extreme toxicity\" was implemented, what is to stop everyone from reporting every little offence under this category?\n\n\n>Opinion on the Rioters read only board:\n\nI personally don't think it would work. Everyone coming to the boards would be \"@Rito give me RP\", \"@RIto I'm lagging fix your ♥♥♥♥\", \"@rito delete soraka\", etc. While there could definitely be more Riot engagement in the boards community, they are busy people and realistically don't have the time to respond to every single post (most of which are reposts btw). \n\nI think it's in a better place than it was six months ago, with the volunteers on hand to answer some questions and to poke Rioters when something major comes up.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-13T10:27:11.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sorry, the first one was I just don't understand peoples stupidity when not upgrading trinkets.
