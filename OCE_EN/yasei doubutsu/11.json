So I'm interested to see how they make it a good story while not destroying one of the best lore related champions.\n\nIt was cool having some story revolve around Yas. Its just a shame for me personally that my second favourite champ (Yasuo) now thinks very badly about my favourite champ (Azir) which kinda sucks but oh well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-30T13:29:26.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah. it kinda surprised me that Yasuo was in it.\nAnd Azir as a slave driver? plz no :( \n\nBut Im already so hyped, I love shurima!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-04-30T13:11:39.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please be an Earth mage support it sounds so good and sounds like it can become very different from other supports I'm feeling good about this champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2016-04-30T11:17:29.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If she isn't mid I lose 5 dollars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedPandaFox","date":"2016-04-30T10:43:18.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nYes I think I can say for a lot of Summoners we are thrilled too have a new Rock Type Champ.\n(Pokemon Pun)\n\nI cannot wait for more teasers and are looking forward too see what role she is. \n\n-RedPandaFox","replies":[]}]}
