In most cases the problem lies in a lack of role diversity (as I mentioned in my response to TMo6ASF), where someone gets put in a role they can't play and reject it, which is rarely out of a desire to be toxic, though can often manifest itself that way. That said, if someone (or a group of someones) is taking a select hostage then there is much more in play (or just plain different), and it usually IS out of some desire to mess with other people which is obviously no bueno. \n\nThe most reliable solution is to learn at least one champ in each role, so that when you find those brick walls you can work around them as painlessly as possible, though this relies on players taking it upon themselves to work around the undesirable situations. It isn't the most ideal, but is typically a necessity in online games with large communities (there will always be more trolls).\n\nThe key difference between blind and ranked here is that in ranked it is very clear that if you steal someones role without their permission it is a 100% punishable offence, where things are much less clear cut in blind pick because there will always be the \"I didn't see\" argument. Of course if they are truly toxic, reporting them with a note that mentions the offending behaviour was in champion select is perfectly adequate, but if they aren't otherwise a negative player you sometimes just have to deal with them stealing your role (which doesn't quite constitute taking a select hostage).\n\nIn situations like the one you describe, your best bet is to simply report them. If you don't play the game and therefore don't get to the post game lobby to report, you can always report them via a support ticket (though support tickets are less than ideal so long as post game reporting is available).\n\nThe most recent Ask Riot does have a little perspective on their stance with regards to taking selects hostage, however it is specific to ranked select so doesn't quite hit all the points you want I think.\nhttp://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/02/ask-riot-where-is-butchers-bridge/","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-02-04T02:22:09.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know EVERY role, my worst is ADC.\nBut I have been playing every role since season 1.\n\nDon't tell me, to learn or play a different role, I fill every single game.\n\nThere has to be an option or a way to prevent this kind of shit, when we got in game.\nBecause the other guy (Who they tried forcing out of jungle)\nStill went jungle, they ended up taking smite and stealing all of his buffs so he had to farm all game to catch up.\n\nThey ended up INTing for about 10 minutes, and even starting to curse and harass people on the enemy team.\n\nAfter the game....

I wasn't trying to imply that you didn't know how to play every role, I just don't know what you play. If it were as easy as just flicking a switch and nobody was toxic ever again of course Riot would do that, but it isn't that easy. You did the best you could in a shitty situation.\n\nThe fact that one got banned means the other two won't be far behind, especially if the accounts are bought and especially if they were inting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-02-03T15:36:46.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every other region had draft picks but us before seven and from what ive been told riot have now taken draft norms out for all regions because we were complaining we didn't have draft norms. idk why riot cant just make draft pick norms it would make it so much easier to actually play your role if you want to practice a champ or get to know a new role but no we have to contest with auto lockers. i just think it something easy the lol community actually wants and would make them a bit happier instead of pumping out skins skins skins.","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-02-04T00:51:09.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't need draft pick for that, just role select in blind pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-03T16:44:51.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draft pick was removed to benefit queue health. With the addition of an extra ranked queue, queue health was suffering (and still is on OCE) so the decision was made. I believe it was made with the intent of introducing a pre champ select role selection for normals, much like what we see in ranked but without the pick and ban phases, however there is no confirmation yay or nay on that one.\n\nIt is difficult to gauge just what percentage of the community actually does find frustration with this, since those that don't have any problems, tend not to speak up about it, personally at least (as much as I would love a role selection in blind) don't encounter much trouble on the instalock front or any other role calling related woes, and haven't for a good while, but I think part of that comes with a higher (albeit not much) level of play, where role diversity is more of a thing (i.e most people can play more than one role so are less concerned about getting that one role).\n\nAs for your last comment, the skin/art teams are completely separate from the teams that handle things like champion select so one does not affect the other.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Big Bad KhaZix","date":"2017-02-04T00:33:14.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hit that mf report button my dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-03T09:27:40.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"democracy\n\nyeah premades kinda suck and when my friends do the same thing, I generally don't participate.
