Anyone with utility built into their kit can support, and the more utility-centric a champ is, the more effective they are in doing that. Theoretically, they can be put anywhere as desired by the strategy.\n\nThe issue is that Riot and the community forces Supports into bot-lane to team up with the ADCs while trying to make it work regardless of any and all factors and for every single match.\n\nSupport can not do what they are supposed to do in this forced-teaming with ADCs, because they will outshine the ADCs in their performance (as they are generally the ones making saves and staging the kills), which Riot and some players don't want. And it becomes even more problematic in that ADCs are not even supposed to be strong early so of course Supports can and should surpass ADCs especially in early game, but again, Riot and some players don't want to see that.\n\nSo they thought about methods of making their vision work:\n\n1. They first tried making ADCs outright broken across all stages of the match, so that Supports get to do what they need to do like everybody else and they won't be outshining the ADCs as well. Which of course, didn't turn out so well.\n2. So they changed the approach, and this time, they make Supports outright useless. So they can't do what they're supposed to do properly, but hey, they aren't outshining the ADCs anymore. And Riot at the moment, seems to think this is fine.\n\nThis is why I focused my argument mostly around the ADC-support thingy and how it is the thing that we need to get rid off rather than blaming the tanks and assassins for doing their jobs properly, as well as trying to fix issues within the boundaries of the problem itself rather than trying to improve or remove the said problem.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Buttsubushi","date":"2017-01-15T10:26:05.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is boring?\n\n{{champion:63}} {{champion:143}} \n\nNot anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-15T14:35:59.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"even though they can be played support, if you play these champions, or annie, annivia, fizz or lux as a support.
