They refused to unban me because I had 'cheating programs open and was most likely cheating on their game.' Despite the fact that CE wasn't hooked into anything, I simply forgot to close it when it opened on startup. SMITE sucks, though, their anticheat constantly runs on your PC. It gets flagged by so many different things. Let's not forget that if you overclocked your PC you'd also be banned for it and no one was unbanned.\n\nI regret buying a Cupid skin. Fuck SMITE.

I get, on average, 417FPS on LoL. Am I cheating by having that over someone with 20?\n\nRegardless, I shouldn't have been banned for having CE open, not hooked into game.
