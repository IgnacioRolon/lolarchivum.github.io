Hence it is more acceptable to try new things that might negatively impact the outcome of the game, as the actual playing it is more important. In ranked the fun is caused by the achieving of something, e.g. its a lot of fun when you rise to the next rank or tier, and it makes you feel good, this is the difference. In normals you feel good by running around killing bad guys and saving good guys knowing what whatever you do doesn't matter in the long run. In ranked you feel good when you work for something and achieve it.\n\nSo a pick like AD jungle Anivia is without doubt less effective than AP mid Anivia, hence it being ok for normals to have fun playing it. but is less ok in ranked where winning is the prime objective and using a pick that is not in optimum power, is then less of an advantage and as such detrimental to the objective of winning. People then don't like this because they are less likely to win and as such not have their fun.\n\nyou are not completely right about the rankings. If you do manage to reach the top you have the chance to become pro (earning money) and that does greatly impact your life. Imagine if someone like Faker had an AD jungle anivia, or an AP support talon in every ranked game he played. he would have been significantly less likely to make it to where he is now, not because he is bad but because his team chose to disadvantage themselves by champion pick.\n\nthat is taking it to the extremes, but also while it is unlikely that the rankings will have a real world effect on most of us. the enjoyment of rising in the rankings is a good thing.\n\nWhat about if your favourite TV show was ruined? technically it doesn't matter because it doesn't do anything to your life right? but that doesnt stop you from being sad when it gets ruined.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-08T21:27:33.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"so what your saying is if I go ad {{champion:34}} jg as long as im having fun it dose not mater if 4/9 other players don't as I go 0 30 0 \nnice","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-09T08:51:16.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one can stop you playing AD anivia jg so wether i think its ok or not is not the point.\nIm saying if you really really feel the need to go 0 30 0 by playing a position like that. do it in normals not in ranked.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-10-08T09:23:54.379+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, like I know its a game.
