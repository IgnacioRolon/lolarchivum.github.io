While also trying to reach a better score, I do love how assist go into it as well.\r\n\r\nI believe it will make everyone &#039;Eventually&#039; play better as well, as they want to gain Kills + Assist, but do so without dying.\r\nMeaning everyone will be thinking on how to advance.\r\nIve already reached lvl 3 with Sivir, Bruam and Gnar, and almost Azir now.\r\n\r\nI also like on how it scores you as well.\r\nlike, &quot;hmmmm you done better this time&quot; or &quot;Well, you could improve.... alot.&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone Like/Dislike about it?\r\nI really love it.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-09T01:08:47.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It makes my front-bum larger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-08T14:16:11.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It rewards more points based on KDA, meaning people 'Should' stop trying to go for 1 v 1 trades.\nand actually focus on Not dying.
