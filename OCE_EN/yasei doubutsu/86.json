I also know that I'm a lot more accomplished at keeping my CS rising steadily, instead of forgetting about it mid-game.\n\nThat third gank down bot I was short mana for the ult. I noticed it just as I dropped below 'enough' so I turned off W and moved off a bit. When I got it back, I went for the kill on ez.\n\nTrying to CS too much with your W will drain your mana really quickly early on. Aurelion is not a strong early game champion, and Zed can push him out of lane so easily. It's not until I finish my rylai's that I'm able to actually try to be more aggressive.\n\nThe reason I went rylai's and liandries before zhonyas is because of the synergy between them and my W. It's extremely safe AOE poke. Zhonyas is also a massive bait for such an immobile champion as Aurelion. The second you zhonyas, you've just signed your own death warrant(unless you're only using it for zed's ult after you've already reached safety).\n\nBy rushing something like a tear, you sacrifice survivability. Aurelion has no innate escape so you need to build him tankier(like a non-suicide karthas, or a cho'gath)\n\nI started backing around 26m when the fight happened because I didn't want the team to go into that fight. The ping was from me, and I believed we would lose that.\n\nI've also noticed that you assume a lot of stuff(like that I know it's safe to stick around in certain parts, when you can see there's no enemies nearby, but I can't). You have to remember, in the real game, there's a fog of war.\n\nWe didn't baron because we were too low. We took mid tower because they were all dead and there was no real danger, despite us being low.\n\nThat death to Zac at 29-30m was embarrassing. Had to skip that. :(\n\nOne key mistake you make is assuming Aurelion is a burst champion. Aurelion is a sustained DPS mage bruiser. He relies heavily on his W to poke and deal damage in teamfights.\n\nStill watching, will update as I go.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-30T14:45:52.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Over all you did extremely well.\nThe whole point of this really is to be a constant reminder of \"Dont forget to ward and remember to upgrade trinket\"\nJonius and Fits use this to watch all there mistakes so they wont do them again.\n\nIts mainly here so you can also see, what you did right (The roams were awesome)\nand what you could have done better.
