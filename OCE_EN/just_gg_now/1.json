That hasn&#039;t worked and now I am worried about my account as I&#039;ve spent a fair amount of money on it. I was wondering if any riot member could reassure me that this issue is being taken care of.","replies":[{"poster":"Renzcer","date":"2016-09-27T13:06:43.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly it seems Riot will not do anything about stolen/hacked accounts. They'll just tell you it's in their \"Terms of use\" that you're responsible for your account details.\n\nI'm a victim myself, and there are others in the forum with the same problem, none of which Riot has \"given a shit\" about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"just gg now","date":"2016-09-27T11:03:14.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also it seems like the account has not been deactivated as there are games taking place just a couple hours ago. http://quickfind.kassad.in/profile/oce/thetomguy/","replies":[]}]}
