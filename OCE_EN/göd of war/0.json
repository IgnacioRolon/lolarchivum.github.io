It's not Riot's responsibility nor their fault that you're toxic and can't control yourself. My advice for you is to grow up, stop fucking typing and stop blaming others for your issues. With these 2 things i just gave you not only will you NOT GET BANNED but you'll become a better person in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Notoxic","date":"2018-10-15T05:31:36.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is funny because you think its anyone elses responsibility to control you. grow up.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-15T12:27:02.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Goosfraba","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-14T23:31:33.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot would never do it considering they want \"communication\". If the chat feature isn't used for anything relating to strategy it's considered abuse, excessive and not needed. in reality, it's a pointless feature. All friends in high elo tell me typing is the most detrimental thing you can possibly do.\n\nYou can move the chat window off your screen except you'll be at a disadvantage with time stamps. \n\nI'm the same type of player as you except not been permed I don't think we should have to take such measures for insurance we aren't going to get our accounts banned. What they have a zero tolerance for right now(racism homophobia self harm encouragement etc) is the only things that should matter.. calling someone a monkey warrants a perm ban depending on warning numbers. It's hard to have a perfect system and right now Riot is telling us to yield to the way their changing the game.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-10-14T23:35:20.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've also thought they should have a vote kick in champ select, just to protect your LP if someone was to lock in something troll and said they were going to troll, something like that. It happens pretty frequently especially when riot trolls someone by giving them mid in one game and then support the next. It's the most tilting thing ever. But, you can see how easily this would be abused by pre made teams and what not.\n\nI don't know why autofill is a thing because people dont like getting roles they don't pick. I, personally, would be happy to wait an extra 5 minutes to get the role I want.","replies":[]}]}]}
