They'll direct the ticket to the Player Behaviour team, at which point the case will be reviewed and a decision reached on the possibility of revoking the punishment. Keep in mind, there's no guarantee the ban will be revoked, as it is at Riot's discretion to do so.\n\nThat said, if you're willing to provide the chat logs (which you should have received via email and the in-client pop-up notifying you of your ban), there are a number of boards users who'll be happy to discuss it with you and address and specific comments that could have triggered the punishment.\n\nI would like to take a moment to address this comment:\n> i should be at least entitled to something seeing as i have put cash in since season 3 \n\nJust to say that, there's no difference of treatment between paying and non-paying players. By spending money on the game, all you are paying for is RP, not any \"superior treatment\", especially in regards to the rules and punishment systems, which makes sense. Riot takes each player as being equal in the eyes of justice, regardless of amount of money spent, time played or dedication to the game.\n\nI would also like to take a moment to state that quantity of reports against someone is never, in and of itself, enough to result in a punishment. My understanding is that reports against a single player from a pre-made group are treated as a single report, or at least weighted differently than multiple reports from randomly matched players, though I may be wrong on that.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will attempt to answer them as accurately as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"jaggapuss","date":"2017-09-07T21:26:46.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just meant like after playing since season 1 never getting banned doesnt that show enough i mean common look at what the game has come to now you can barley play a game between 9 and 730 without having 2 trolls in every game","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-09-13T02:25:04.952+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=jaggapuss,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=HUy7UwI5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-09-07T21:26:46.357+0000)\n>\n> i just meant like after playing since season 1 never getting banned doesnt that show enough\n\nHey Jaggapuss,\n\nI had a look into your account and I would like to clarify that this time-ban didn't just happen out of nowhere. You have been CHAT RESTRICTED 4 times prior (2 times this year) - these restrictions are warnings to you that your behaviour is getting worse and would eventually result in a BAN.\n\nI checked out your chatlogs. If you want to discuss your ban any further, feel free to share the logs that were sent to you - or with your permission I will post it up.\n\nI understand that in the heat of the moment, it can feel like you are simply retaliating - but having read through with the context of the chat, it's not hard to see why you were punished. While the enemy Master Yi seemed salty towards you (I assume without looking at the game timeline that you killed him?), there was no reason for you to escalate.\n\nThis may have been an instance where 2 players who both have negative tendancies met in chat and triggered each other to blow up. Let this tempban help you reflect on your own behaviour in these situations - do you NEED to talk smack at another player? Or can you just let them be salty and dominate them through your game performance?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jaggapuss","date":"2017-09-07T22:22:52.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also i went to the page i cannot submit a request because my tickets are #0 absolute bullshit after more than 450days gamplay i get rimmed because a couple casual players feel like mucking around","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-07T22:50:33.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How was it a 5 man if they were on your team?","replies":[{"poster":"jaggapuss","date":"2017-09-08T03:16:59.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 man cheers for picking up the mistake? llike wtf","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Virtual","date":"2017-09-07T12:15:48.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just got a 14 suspension also 6mins ago and have almost the exact same reason as you but instead of my own team harassing me, it was the enemy team, they kept coming for me calling me bad and telling me to get good and stuff so i got pissed and told em off and i got banned for calling em off whilst they got out free without a chat-restriction or suspension","replies":[]}]}
