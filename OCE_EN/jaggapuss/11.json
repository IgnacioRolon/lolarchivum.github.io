In your average 30 minute game, thats nearly once every 3 minutes. You are spending a good portion of the time dead, rather than up and helping your team. Just by learning to play safer and actively reducing that death count is going to help you go a long way in climbing.\n\n**2. focus on objectives!**\nYou are going in more for the risky kills (hence high deaths and but relatively high kill participation) more than focusing on objectives. You have about a 38% objective participation which should really be hovering a lil bit higher (especially if playing jg). Learn which objectives to prioritise, and help your team to make the calls to efficiently take them and rotate. Teamwork and objectives win games, not kills. \n\n**3. Choose 2 roles and stick to them.**\nI understand that autofill makes this harder (especially if you want to main top/mid) but it is really in your best interest to narrow this down. Learn everything you can about your roles. Learn the matchups, play all the champs to get a feel for their powerspikes and cooldowns. Narrow your own champ pool to be able to fill niches that may be missing. and so that you aren't at risk of being pick/banned/countered one-trick. \n\n**4. Warding.**\nThe site says it all, \"buy your tinket pls\". Aim to place at least 2+ vision wards per game. Aim for 15+ of the other types of wards (obviously going to be less if you are using sweeper). Learn about what each of the trinkets do, and which would be best in the situation you are in. \n\n* Red is good on junglers and supports as you can deny enemy vision and set up for objectives and ganks. \n* Blue is good for mid/ADC as they have a short cool down and there is no max limit on how many you can place\n* Yellow is good for when nobody else on your team has a yellow trinket/your team has many teleports. Support sightstones can only hold a certain number of wards, and quite often they have no charges left as vision needs to keep evolving. If you have a yellow trinket, you can stealthily ward objectives (because the other types of wards can be seen) as well as provide a TP point for your team. They are also quite handy for catching out enemies as they are trying to clear them.","replies":[{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-10-21T08:38:58.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GeB3WaeJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-20T02:14:10.338+0000)\n>\n> Just from booping your name into [this site](http://school.egg-one.com/lolprofiler/profile?summoner_id=jaggapuss+&amp;region=oce#tab_General), it is pretty clear to me what you need to work on. \n\nGood God that site's profiler is awesome !
