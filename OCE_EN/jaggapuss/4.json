If they are causing problems for you, don't feed it, mute and report them.

If you want to discuss your punishment I'd suggest posting your chat logs provided from your in-client reform card.

I can't look up your matches. If you deleted the email already you can request them again through a ticket if you want, but without you providing them I can't go over them with you.\n\n> THere is nothing to encourage positive play, the negative environment regardless of if it was \"Verbal\" or not, was provided by them, i just typed it.\n\nEach person is responsible for their own actions. They can't make you do anything and you can't make them do something, so you are judged according to what you alone did. If they got away with it today that doesn't mean they will never be punished. Even if your report against them didn't result in a punishment now it will still contribute to their case to be reviewed later if they are consistently toxic. The only reason you got punished now is because you had a history of negative behavior being reported and wasn't just from this match alone.\n\n> So their actions can't be stopped, but mine can cause its in a text log.\n\nGameplay offenses are more severely punished. When they cross the line and get caught they will receive bans is warranted, not chat restrictions.\n\n> do you think people like myself are going to just stay silent whilst some shit head kid ruins our fun\n\nYou should. They are just shit head kids, so ignore them and don't stoop to their shit head level please. Otherwise all you do is make sure the shit head environment gets shittier and stays that way.\n\n>  i really dont care what the code is\n\nThat is why you got punished.

From past experience, and great... so im a great team member and have the icon, but im toxic enough to be banned by an automatic system...\n\nSo am i negative or positive according to the community? \n\nIts pretty obvious the negative outweigh the positive in Riots system, excessively. And they don't care nor research, but hey... According to most team mates, im pretty OK. I think im fine, and no. I won't have some gamers ideology forced upon me, your morals aren't my morals, and as someone that has life experience im aware when logic isn't applied. It's not applied here, you see my wrong as more severe because of an automatic system that panders to whingers that keep crying and clicking report. I wonder how many reports i'd have done if i bothered with them all. Probably 100's by now. So there's 100's of players who have no negative report from me, who are getting away with it. Why? Because its so common and nothing happens, frustrated players like me don't see a point anymore. But when we spit the dummy. Riot collectively shits itself and supports the kids that pushed you into the behavior.\n\nRule of thumb to league just mute everyone in game and fuck the code, it doesn't have your back, dont try and have it's. Just do your own thing and mute everyone, no toxic language and you can't be angry.\n\nreally fu*king dumb i can be an honored member of the community but riot can punish me rather than take it away first, HONORED NEGATIVE PLAYER...
