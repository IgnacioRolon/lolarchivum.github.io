How on earth can you main adc on a shitty laptop. I never play adc as the lagginess is unbearable when csing early and making plays in the bot lane. I might have to though because if you look at my match history, the neemy bot lanes gets 2 double kills within the first 5 mins. Dropped from 70 LP to -1LP.

I'm playing on a literal tablet (not a laptop) which shouldn't really be running the windows 10 OS but whatever.\n\nI feel ya, but I play tanks like nautilus, leona, sion, alistair, ect... in teamfights, which is generally alot easier so long as you manage your general positioning (rather than the adaptive positioning of an adc to avoid getting splatted by a syndra or zed); or I play utility supports like zilean, janna and lulu, who are really safe and I try to position as aggressively as I can when playing these champs.\n\nI don't think my setup holds me back very much because in all honesty my mechanics would probably be terrible anyway on a good setup. I just need to be more calm and considerate of my macroplay because I know what I'm supposed to be doing but I often fail to act on that.","replies":[]}]}
