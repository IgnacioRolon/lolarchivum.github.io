Realization that there was a self to acknowledge the pain, and want it to stop. Continual creation & destruction in an unending cycle for with no end. Over the decades with every death & recreation a small thread of existence remained through each incarnation gathering memories & strength of will. Learning to fear the battles as they were announced, learning to hate what was to come. Finally gathering enough power to say 'NO, I will not charge blindly as your pawn'.\r\n\r\nPassive: Soul Convergence: 'x' attack/ability power (dependent on stance), 'x' armor/magic resist per nearby minion.\r\n\r\nq: Lead the charge (Melee): (targeted attack) Charge to enemy champion doing 'x' damage, nearby minions focus on charged target.\r\n    Spirit Dash (Caster): Skill shot (Visualize spirit projection of Minios from his body) passing through all targets in range (minions & champions). Friendly  targets healed & increase base stats, enemy targets damaged & reduced stats. (Duration & values increased per rank)\r\n\r\nw: Defiance (Melee): -Passive-Each friendly minion killed within 10 seconds increases mitigation & attack speed\r\n   \t                         -Active-Bolsters defense of self & nearby friendly minions. (Duration & mitigation value ratio increase per rank)\r\n   Surge (Caster): -Passive-Each caster minion projectile hits a target & splits to hit 2 additional targets at 50% damage.\r\n\t\t            -Active-Players auto attacks gain benefit of ability power and bounces to 2 additional targets with added slow. Slow ration based on AP.         (duration & AP ratio increase per rank)\r\n \r\nE: Choice: Switch between caster or melee stance. Abilities vary on stance, Caster-Bonus AP & magic resist, melee bonus AD & armor. (Values increase per rank)\r\n\r\nR: Spirit of the Nexus: Absorbs all nearby minions increasing attack/ability/armor/magic resist by 'x' and transforms into a super siege minion. (Values increase per rank)\r\n\r\nThis is just a concept, I have no skill with the balancing of values, hence the 'x' values & general 'increases with rank' statements, that would be left to people that know best!\r\nIt is an idea that has been floating around my mind for a long time & would like to see any feedback on what people thing of the general idea.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't already figure it out, the general concept is that over the duration of the Summoner wars & battles, a single entity amongst the continually spawning minions was able to keep hold of a sense of 'self' and evolved to a point of being able to make the decision to stop being a mindless entity, and choose to do something about his situation.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2015-03-26T13:18:50.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll go straight to the point with the problems and suggestions I have:\n\nHe is a more op split pusher than jax or trynd and I am srs. Why? His W. That is the most op skill I have ever seen in the history of split push. His passive *increases his attack speed and defense*, which I guess is armour and Magic resist. His active increases all defenses of ally minions. Ad Minios will be op despite his originally planned build of ap(his ratios are ap).\n\nSecondly, I'd like to add on why does his melee form give him ad if he's supposed to be an ap champion? \n\nHis laning phase will make his enemy cry. His melee q will automatically make all minions attack your target. The damage early game by the minions is no joke really. \n\nHis ultimate is also the same problem as his passive. It gives ad. \n\nOh and his ranged q heals ally minion, also another reason why he's so good split pushing. I really hope the numbers will be balanced. \n\nBut I think with a bit of edit and balanced number, this would be a cool champ. Great concept","replies":[]},{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-21T00:05:02.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that seems strange and i dont get that caster and melee crap also {{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[]}]}
