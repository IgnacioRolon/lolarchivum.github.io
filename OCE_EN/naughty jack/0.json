I played a ton in preseason season 4 and peaked at plat 3 however took a break and decayed to gold 3 that season. Have only just returned to league last week and suck so much. (During this time i let my brother play on my account as I had no need for it) \n\nI even played on my smurf (20ish games) and am at 9 wins 12 losses. I feel like I don&#039;t know what half these otems are now with all these reworks. Buffs and nerfs make champions I was comfortable on seem so foreign. \n\nI&#039;m going to try hard this season so I&#039;m sure I will improve.  Just feels bad going even in lane with bronze players when I remember  crushing them 2 years ago. \n\nHave been trting to one trick tahm kench top but he feels very clunky and slow. \n\nThinking I may one trick dianna. \n\nThoughts and advice guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-27T01:45:51.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana is an OK pick especially for low mmr.

Diana is still good in some plat games but not all, some plat players are really exceptionally good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-03-26T23:07:41.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game plays so differently now, and not in a good way.\n\nI suggest just playing a whole bunch of champs, and then focusing on what works for you, rather than trying to force a choice.","replies":[]}]}
