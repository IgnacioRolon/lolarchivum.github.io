I played in plat for most of last season in solo queue, but this time around I'd love to see if I could get a ranked 5s going. Solo queue felt too boring for me, and playing with a group is so much more exciting. Currently all lanes are filled, but not everyone can be online at the same time, all the time. At the moment our priority is to find another top laner. but we'll consider anything, the more the merrier eh? Also we pretty much need you to have a microphone. And are willing to use Teamspeak.\r\nThough the title states that we're looking for High Gold-Plat and above, if you feel like you can commit to the team and really help us we'll consider anyone, most likely run you through a couple of test games to see what you can do!\r\nIf you're interested, hit me up on League.
