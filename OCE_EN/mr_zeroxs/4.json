What do you mean by uploading clips? Is this simply a play that we make which we can record off of the replay system or does this have to be a full fledged YouTube video? \n\n2. What times will the team meet to play games? Or do we play games whenever all team members happen to be online?\n\n3. And finally, will our team just be competing in flex or will we actually be competing against other teams in an organised tournament?\n\nApart from that, this sounds cool. Expect to see me there tomorrow.\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-09-24T09:29:54.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Miicka,\nSorry for the delay - spent the weekend away, hopefully you're still interested!\n      \n1. This is just a play you made in Normal games or even Ranked that you were happy with, this can be given to me in a few ways - one of them using the match replay system that you mentioned. It only has to be one play, this is so I can put them together into a video for the clan channel.\n\n2. We haven't sorted that out yet as we are still recruiting, but for now it has been when we are online - obviously this should change in the near future.\n\n3. We will be competing in an organised tournament and we have recently acquired a sponsor to help fund the tournament costs to enter this. The tournament we'll be entering will be linked here: [](https://play.eslgaming.com/leagueoflegends/oceania/aunz-championship-lol-cup-3-2017-anz/rankings/)\n\nThank you for your interest!\n~ Zach or RKLe5 Zeroxs","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-09-16T21:42:15.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I tryout even if I'm not ranked?","replies":[]}]}
