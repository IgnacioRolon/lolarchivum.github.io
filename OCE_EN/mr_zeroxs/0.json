I&#039;m looking for a few people to help out in the organization, please read on if you&#039;re interested. We&#039;re thinking of branching out and making an Academy team, being Gold - Platinum team, we think having a full Gold (maybe high Silver team) would be reasonable for internal scrimmages, though we need more staff and players to make that happen. The following positions are open, requirements are listed below them:\n\n**Coach for Main Squad:**\n- Platinum 3+\n- Have decent game knowledge, not just of macro but also most positions in micro.\n- Be easy to work with (don&#039;t lose your temper at people who might not understand etc).\n\n**Manager for Academy Team:**\n- No Minimum Rank\n- Must be able to commit to the team and put in time sorting out rosters and things of the like.\n- Must also be easy to work with - toxicity is a big no in this organization.\n\n**Coach for Academy Team:**\n- Platinum 5+ (This may be relatively flexible depending on applications)\n- Have decent game knowledge, not just of macro but also most positions in micro.\n- Be easy to work with.\n\n**Players for Academy Team:**\n- Silver 2+ (Preferably Gold but will see how applicants go).\n- Be willing to turn up to practices and improve themselves, not only as a player but also relationship-wise with the team.\n- (In case you haven&#039;t noticed a pattern yet) Not Toxic. Again, Toxicity is a big no and isn&#039;t treated lightly in the org.\n\n**If you&#039;re interested in any of the positions please message my Discord below:**\n\n**Discord:** SRA Kekzii#1194\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to hear back from you,\n~ Mr Zeroxs, Founder of Storm Raisers Esports.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeo","date":"2018-08-02T10:10:25.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-07-30T11:01:53.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Have decent game knowledge, not just of macro but also most positions in micro.\"\n\nYou're ask a coach. ONE COACH. To micromanage 5 players across 5 seperate roles? Aswell as drafting  macro strategies for the team to follow? This is called \"asking too much\".\n\nDo you know how coaching work at all? If am being blunt here. \n\nThere is no coach; Even in the professional scene, that can meet your demands. If anyone said they can fulfill this duty; Then man, that guy have meager exprience and is taking things lightly. Or, an astounding geniuse! \"a Hidden dragon or crouching tiger\" As the chinese proverb goes in describing concealed talents. \n\nAnd when someone bite off more than they can chew, they will choke on it. In other words. Give up, due to the overwhelming responsibilities and difficulties, that they've underestimated. En route to failures.\n\nThis is simply too amateurish. Maybe be you should read books on management yes? Atleast then you will make mediocre mistakes, instead of a clear path to ruin.","replies":[{"poster":"Âltz","date":"2018-07-30T11:35:37.552+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're clearly a troll it's an amateur team not a pro team a coach can easily coach 5 players. You cannot even bring up professional coaches as they are expected to manage players 12 hours a day for scrims then after sometimes soloque a coach in this instance only needs to coach for about 2-3 hours maximum I'd say once or twice a week which is very easy.

Add on the fact that you are using hollow words such as Organization and Esport, to levitate the status of your thread. \n\nYou dont have an Organization. You are not Esport material; These terms are used to attract views. The actuality of this thread is for you to mislead people. Into helping some guy and his friends to climb ranks 5 so they can brag.\n\nStop smokescreening the truth.
