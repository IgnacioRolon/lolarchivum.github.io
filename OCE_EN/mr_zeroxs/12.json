Can Riot please work on a new way they analyse intentional feeding reports? I just had a game that had a Tahm Kench (for no reason whatsoever) just steal our junglers camps and then go AFK, (he took smite, he didn&#039;t say anything at all in champ select.) His username is: [removed - no reporting other players] and is on OCE. This is very annoying as it wasn&#039;t even justifiable to go AFK over, he said nothing before he went AFK and we said nothing to him, he threw a ranked game that all the players should&#039;ve had a chance in. Thanks all.\n\nLink: In the link it is the screenshot of CS. Teemo was our jungler and you can see where Tahm stops stealing his camps because it hits a big spike. Very annoying.","replies":[]}
