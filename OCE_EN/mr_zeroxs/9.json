My last 5 capsules have gone as follows; 500 BE, 500 BE, 500 BE, 2 x 6300 champs (that gave me 630 BE from disenchanting), 600 BE. This is very disappointing as I was initially excited for the new &#039;runes&#039; update due to the levelling system changes - but this is just unneeded, I thought that it was in addition to the IP that you used to get per match. (As it should be - even nerf the IP/BE per game a little and add this and it would have been balanced.)\n\n**2)** The amount of bots in ARAM (I play in OCE - not sure about other regions). When we search for a game of ARAM we manage to get matched with at least 3 bots per game (these bots are set to auto-feed and ruin games). It has ruined the ARAM queue for all of us. Reports don&#039;t even do anything either because I&#039;ve been matched with the same bot 6 or 7 times in one day.\n\nJudging by the state that the game is in, this is the downfall of League of Legends. It sucks to say as I enjoy playing this game, but it is true. Rito has managed to ruin the game by not focusing on the problems present. Thanks for listening to my rant. Hope the devs will do something about it. Please upvote if you agree with me, this is so the devs can see it.\n~ Mr. Zeroxs, fellow summoner on the rift.\n\nMy OCE Main: Mr Zeroxs\nOCE Second:  Noxilian Prince\n\n**[EDIT] So I have just heard that Riot has listened about the first point and will be buffing the system and also fix some other stuff. Read more about that [here.](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/BQed8FWz-leveling-and-rewards-improvements-to-milestone-emotes-capsules-fwotd)**","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-22T11:51:29.589+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry Mr Zeroxs you aren't part of the minority with this one, your opinion is on the same level as many, and all we can hope at this point is that something positive is done.","replies":[{"poster":"Noxilian Prince","date":"2017-11-22T12:11:12.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hoping someone at Riot will notice that what they're doing to the game isn't for the better.

I don't think many people like the lack of BE you get, we can agree on that. For your second point I've played a decent amount of aram (750 over 2 years) on a level 30 account and NEVER encountered a bot, maybe I'm just lucky...?\n\nI do definitely disagree this is the downfall of League. When you stare at the problems in the game, you don't look at all of the positives and why people actually come and play the game. So many people I know personally have came back for preseason and due to the chaos and champs around esp new ones like Zoe, they don't care about the BE problem that much. A problem that is going to get fixed due to the amount of people crying online about it. The other games on the market have their own problems and things that can push people to other games, such as League. I mean I hear people complaining about BE and botting the most on things like boards and I mean, I just leveled an account from 10-30 by playing co-ops/norms and I only found bots in co-ops like once a day, it really wasn't often. The BE problem is being fixed, source: https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/BQed8FWz-leveling-and-rewards-improvements-to-milestone-emotes-capsules-fwotd\n\nIt's a pretty good improvement IMO, if people keep complaining after that, I'd say they'd give you more.\n\n>\"It sucks to say as I enjoy playing this game\"\n\nYou enjoy the game even with the problems (that they're fixing)? Maybe that says something about the game. \n\n>\"Rito has managed to ruin the game by not focusing on the problems present.\"\n\nRiot have done an incredible job. They have focused and worked incredibly hard to fix the problems the game has. The only real problem in the game atm is BE, which they're fixing? If you look at everything they have done with adding so many things to the game that people have asked for, for yeaaaars e.g Practice tool, skin tab etc. I do think you're being kinda narrow-minded on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Noxilian Prince","date":"2017-11-23T01:31:47.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm happy to give you screenshots from my match history. I can guarantee that there are at least 10 matches with bots in. Here's one for example - notice their names and summoner spells. Also they all attempted to feed the other team (this is to get the games over faster - more games, more XP - the likelihood they'll win with auto-feeders is low, so they don't expect wins, the bots even start surrender votes sometimes).\n[http://i64.tinypic.com/oiu1cl.png](http://i64.tinypic.com/oiu1cl.png)\nThank you for your response and I can definitely see your reasoning and points. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsSoLiam","date":"2017-11-23T04:33:16.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your kindness, and idk I just never ever encounter them myself, even my lower ranked friends don't.
