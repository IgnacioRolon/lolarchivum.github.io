Its basically a lazy way for this guy to get free youtube videos upload for his chanel. \n\nHis whole process \"listed above\" revole arround videos and nothing else that is important for progression of a team. Highly adivice you guys to stay clear from these sorts of schemes.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-09-24T09:20:47.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...and that's why I got a sponsor to help fund tournament costs??

What advertisement would you possibly give them i wonder; Mayhap by your youtube chanel? That you are gonna bring those \"hightlight\" that you ripoff others and claim it for yourself?\n\nOh please, dont say sponsor like it a serious money making bussiness.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-09-30T00:49:52.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, your first point is invalid, suggesting my team is Bronze. We have Diamond and Platinum level players in our roster. Then you say that I claim their highlights as mine - this is untrue, first of all, this isn't my channel - it's the teams, I have a completely different channel - which you'd know if you happened to click the \"Show More\" button in the description box. Also yes - we have funding, for tournament costs.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-24T09:41:18.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Must upload at least X highlights a week\" What the hell? So everyone who signs up must automatically become a Youtuber and post videos for you? Yeah no, bad idea mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-09-30T00:54:21.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, as I mentioned in a reply above - this channel isn't owned by me, it is the channels clan. I have a different YouTube channel that is owned by me - which you'd find by clicking the \"Show More\" button in the description box. The requirement is that you play games during the week, sometime during the week you more than likely would have made a decent play, you get the game replay, trim it and send it to me, then I'll compile them all to produce a video. This requirement is so we don't have people not contributing - and to make all contributions even. I understand your point - though I do not agree with it. Thank you for your response.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-09-30T02:27:27.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realise \"Must upload AT LEAST 3 highlights a week.\" is a joke right?\n\nI dont know if you have exprience posting recruitments. But your is sorely lacking in any information regarding team practice and schedule. Or the structure of the organization you are trying to create. Most of what you put up is being nice and post videos.\n\nIf you are actually trying to create a professional team; First, put up what professionalism you want from the players and what you are offering the players - interm of contract, scrims such and such. What you have is vague and uninformative as far as team building goes. \n\nFrom reading what you have posted, i can tell you are inexprience, and a cassual attitude. I think your little pass time team wont last long, with the way things are running. But do try and prove me wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-10-05T02:30:44.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, the reason I'm lacking information for 'team practice and schedule' which is great and all, except for the fact that I'd prefer to see how regularly they are online and when they're free. You mention somewhere that my information is vague, which is pretty much what you mentioned before - though it is a valid point. Then you give your opinion, that the team won't last. There isn't much I can really reply to here. Thanks for the advice though! :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-15T23:48:11.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Zeroxs","date":"2017-09-16T04:32:25.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Highlights I mean single highlight clips.","replies":[]}]}]}
