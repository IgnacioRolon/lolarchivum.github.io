Had it in around 7 minutes.\nCome back, disconnected. I reconnected, we finish the game and win. I arrive at homescreen to find that I have a 20 minute LeaverBuster when I havent gotten a ban in 3-4 months. Wtf riot? (Our team didnt suffer because I left,  and we won soon after I rejoined) I dont fancy myself a good league player and our team could do fine without me. So why the hell am I banned?","replies":[{"poster":"U srs","date":"2017-10-14T04:03:43.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One time I got disconnected at lvl 3 came back when rest of team was lvl 6 and started farming hard then finally we won the game I hard carried a feeder and played the rest of the 20 mins of that game and got leaver buster rip{{champion:25}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xxDTAxBEASTxx","date":"2015-11-11T07:09:54.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea mate same thing here I get dced at level 1 rejoin then get leaver buster also had 2 AFKs on my team 5 games today 4 AFKs and btw they cant remove leaver buster even if they wanted to automatic shit","replies":[{"poster":"xXKoreanKingzXx","date":"2016-01-25T06:59:33.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah fuckin stupid riot should manage the cases themselves instead of having bots to do it for them","replies":[]}]}]}
