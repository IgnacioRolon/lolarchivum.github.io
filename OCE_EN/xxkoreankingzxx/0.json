If you are gone for too long you will be counted as a leaver. It doesn't matter if you come back and carry, you are still marked as such. Do you think your team enjoyed that you were absent?\n\n> things can and will happen in the real world which are far more important than a game\n\nThat isn't a get-out-of-jail-free card to afk whenever you like. You have to make the decision of whether leaving your match is worth the penalty. If it is then you have to deal with the penalty just like everyone else.\n\n> I was helping my mum who is very ill btw, make lunches for my younger siblings for school\n\nIf possible, you need to take care of important things *before* you queue up. Taking care of your mother is worth the low priority queue penalty, so pay it. If life interferes with your games so frequently that you keep getting Leaver Buster penalties then you don't need to be playing; your enjoyment of the game is not more important than everyone else's that have to deal with your absence.\n\nAnybody can submit a story about why they afk'd, but if Riot let people off for it there would be chaos and no accountability.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ","replies":[{"poster":"0DESTROYERZ0","date":"2016-01-29T02:38:55.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your totally right, no such thing as emergencies, and you never have to do what your parents tell you to do","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-29T07:31:03.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did I say this?

One time I was afk for 10 mins (disconnected), I came back and all was well, no ban.  Id just like some insight into how this system works... It also counted as a win on my ranked provisionals, which means that I didnt leave, And I quote from riot support page: \"Ranked is treated much more severely than normal when it comes to leavers. Games in which a player is considered a leaver always count as losses for them, even if their team is victorious\". My Team won, It counted as a win... This is why im confused...","replies":[]}]}]}
