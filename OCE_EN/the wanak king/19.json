Viktor knew even though being man he would never strip all traces of emotion. this made him persevere more to create all his life work in this Machine.\n\nHe entered the remaining parts of the Arcane Crystal Which Jayce Destroyed in the power units of the prototype Huvano - 012. Huvano&#039;s eyes glowed green, its arms twitched, its arms moved.. it was alive.\n\nViktor was pleased.. after many months of programming and training the droid in lethal combat he set a task for Huvano to assassinate Jayce, The machine obeyed and left the building with weapons constructed by Viktor himself,\n\nHuvano had traveled to Piltover. In the dead of night he entered Jayces Chambers, Jayce was asleep however was alarmed when he saw a dark shadow which came through the window, Jayce reacted quickly, He reached for his Hextech Pistol which threw Huvano off balance, Just in time for him to reach for his Mercury Hammer. Jayce Swung the enormous hammer towards Huvanos Abdomen which pummeled him to the wall. Huvano Shot a Burst of plasma which hit Jayces Shoulder.\n\nJayce Cried in agony as Huvano laughed in a deep tone. he stood up and slowly walked over to Jayce reloading his weapon. Huvano stood over Jayce aiming his Rifle at him. In one last desperate attempt to save his life Jayce Pushed Huvano to the ground, He had just enough time to reach for his Hammer, Huvano fired shots in desperation to hit Jayce, Jayce Charged his hammer and shot Huvano Which sent him through the windows out into Piltovers Street.\n\nHuvano was hurtling down fast into the Piltovers street from the Tower he took out his pistol and shot rope to the closest wall to repel off. Huvano Failed his mission, He knew he was no chance for Jayce. He Joined the League of Legends to train to become stronger so he could one day face Jayce in the Fields of Justice.\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Passive:  ** (Assassins Choice): Huvano begins the game with a Hex Pistol similar to (Viktors Hex Core)  {{item:3200}} however for every minion he kills he receives &quot;heads&quot; (Similar to GP&#039;s Silver Serpents) which then later in game can spend the &quot;heads&quot; on either Hex Plasma Rifle or Hex Cannon, (Rifle increases attack speed and Range), (Hex Cannon increases Damage with slow speed)\n\n**Q (Plasma Ray/Plasma Bombs):**\nPlasma Ray: works with Hex Pistol or Hex Plasma Rifle. Plasma Ray Shoots a beam of plasma at the enemy which burns 5 true damage over 3 Seconds, and slows for 0.5 seconds. Physical Damage: 40/55/70/100/120  scales off 100% AD)\nPlasma Bombs: Is a targeted bombardment which slows down 20% in AoE. Physical Damage: 30/40/55/70/85 (Scales off 130% AD)\n\nW: (Still haven&#039;t Thought of anything yet) Possibly a Grenade or trap of sorts? if you have any ideas please write them below!\n\n**E: Rappel:** Rappel is a targeted Pull (works Similar to nautilus) If Rappel Hits an enemy Champion, Minion or monster it pulls them towards Huvano. Dealing Magical Damage: 70/110/140/160/175 (Scales off 70% AP) If Rappel Hits a wall or Tower it will pull Huvano towards where rappel is attached if E is pressed a second time\n\n**R: Discharge:** Huvano Shoots a Giant Beam of Plasma which is a skill shot, All targets in the shot will be dealt: Physical Damage: 300/450/700 (Scales off 200% AD)\n\n**Appearance:** Huvano is a Droid/Robot who has a similar look of Zeds Mask ({{champion:238}} and Viktors Armor (If i could draw i would&#039;ve tried to show) , Huvano Has a slim, steel body which is Silver or Chrome look. his eyes glow green with a mask as mentioned above would like abit like zed. hes 5&#039;2&quot; who has a cape which is crimson red. During the battle between him and Jayce i would think it would be right to say he would have metallic scratches on his face. He would also Taunt taunt Jayce as well as all Humanoid Creatures similar to Viktors quotes. \n\nProbably Best Quote would also question his whether augmentation is superior to Jayce:_** &quot;We are superior.. how couldn&#039;t i defeat you&quot;**_ / &quot;**_ I have the strength to face you again Jayce, This time you will be exterminated&quot;_**. (Doctor Who Reference) \n\nIf he kills Jayce in game: _**&quot;My primary directive has been completed, New directive Stanwick&quot;.**_ \n\nReferring to Victors enemy (theories point Professor Stanwick to be Warwick before transformation)\n\nTHANK YOU FOR READING IF YOU BOTHERED!!
