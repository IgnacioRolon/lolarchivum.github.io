So, for a period of 30s-1min I don&#039;t see any skills, effects, information (such as mana use, exp, healing) but I can still control my character and see the movements of other players. Eventually, the \"lag\" ends and all the sound, effects, abilities, movement and in-game announcement show up at the same time and I&#039;m able to play again normally for a few minutes before the same thing happening. It also happens when the nexus get destroyed where I&#039;m forced to quit the client.\n\nI&#039;ve done a test on http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/ which said my net is fine, however, I will lag when I try to use too much of my bandwidth (but in-game my ping stays at 20-25). I also did a test on pingtest.net which said I had 0% packet lost and decent latency when I did the test on the Brisbane and Melbourne test servers, but when I tried to do one on the Sydney test server, it would prompt me with an error saying the test was being blocked by a firewall or java not being enabled.\n\nDoes anyone have a solution for this?\n\nEDIT: This only happens for LoL, never in another game like CSGO.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:14:36.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm... Firstly send in a support ticket. It might be an issue with your ISP. Do you know how to do a trace-route?\n\nTry calling up your ISP as well, and explain your problem to them, and the fact that the tests you've done have brought up nothing.\n\nFor the moment, try port forwarding League's ports. If you need help with that, just ask. It's a really long explanation that I won't post if you already know how to.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
