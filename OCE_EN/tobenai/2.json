I have support from individuals at Riot Games Oceania but we are looking for students in schools around NSW to show their interest. You can do this by getting a member of staff at your school to organise a team of students that wish to compete.\r\n\r\nThe events will be at pre determined locations (either at one of the schools or a gaming internet cafe) in which your team will have to travel to in the form of an excursion with the help of your staff organiser.\r\n\r\nWith your support we will also attempt to have League of Legends available to be played at High School&#039;s with access to the schools computers and Internet.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a team you can contact me through my department email with reference to the name of your school and a suitable method of contacting the member of staff organising the team.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity to show schools around Australia how League of Legends can be a big part of students&#039; education and create lasting friendships with others.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me about your interest.\r\n\r\nEmail:\r\nsimo.jurisic@education.nsw.gov.au\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-02-15T05:46:08.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such a cool initiative - get on board this!","replies":[]}]}
