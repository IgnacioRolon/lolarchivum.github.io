I have support from individuals at Riot Games Oceania but we are looking for students in schools around NSW to show their interest. You can do this by getting a member of staff at your school to organise a team of students that wish to compete.\r\n\r\nThe events will be at pre determined locations (either at one of the schools or a gaming internet cafe) in which your team will have to travel to in the form of an excursion with the help of your staff organiser.\r\n\r\nWith your support we will also attempt to have League of Legends available to be played at High School&#039;s with access to the schools computers and Internet.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a team you can contact me through my department email with reference to the name of your school and a suitable method of contacting the member of staff organising the team.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity to show schools around Australia how League of Legends can be a big part of students&#039; education and create lasting friendships with others.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me about your interest.\r\n\r\nEmail:\r\nsimo.jurisic@education.nsw.gov.au\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2017-02-10T20:39:16.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is awesome.

They would maybe allow the one day excursion once or twice a year if you really push it. They aren't going to allow just random up out of nowhere day all about skipping school to play games are they?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Prodigyyy","date":"2017-03-07T00:50:51.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Toebnai you noob who else is in our team so far we only have me you taha and milos","replies":[]}]}
