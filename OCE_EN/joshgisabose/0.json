I am looking for a highly talented support player that is willing to duo with me on a regular basis. You must have real game knowledge, the ability to play micro intense support champions and land your skillshots, and have a good temperament. If I have to tell you when to go and put down a ward, I will probably kill myself quietly.\r\n\r\nI like to play passive/aggressive in lane phase and then I will dive in to 5 people for team fights and try to outplay everybody like a BOSE.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add me at JoshGIsaBose on league or enquire in this thread :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hungry White Boy","date":"2015-05-19T03:33:15.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take me under your wing and raise me from a trash silver 2 support into a god and I will be yours forever xx.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JoshGIsaBose","date":"2015-05-17T11:35:28.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still looking!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JoshGIsaBose","date":"2015-05-17T08:56:27.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
