I have been here now 4-5 years, I for one hate this patch, there is too much of a change from what I got used to from all those years of playing.\n\nLast game I was hitting 600+ damage with Malz into the towers at end game, I even got Nashor's Tooth to make me hit faster to towers, hacking into the Nexus at 638 damage with a hit time of ~1.1 per second, at 5500 Nexus health that takes only 8.62 hits or ~8 seconds for one AP to kill the Nexus, alone.","replies":[]}]}
