Complaining about a mechanic intentionally put in the game that you play isn't doing anyone any good. The assassin update has made them less of a pain and added more counterplay to their burst. You complain about the new items but if you were smart, you would build items to counter those items. I recommend you stop being a twelve-year-old and complain about people better than you at a game.\n{{champion:91}} : was made less bursty for more roam potential\n{{champion:55}} : now requires more skill, so no more face rolling\n{{champion:7}} : Made to be more counter-play to her jukes\n{{champion:107}} : Easier to know who he is targeting.\n\nQuit whining about these changes, they're most welcome to League of Legends","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freddymc","date":"2016-11-09T03:54:11.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This update made the big 4 assassins far more healthy then before. Talon was literal cancer with no counterplay before this update, he had a blink and a brutal slow which prevented counterplay and made laning against him painful. Now he has a dash and only two offensive basic abilities to work with. Much, much better. Katarina was really button-mashy and once ahead she was super irritating to deal with. Now she takes skill and can be dealt with, and is also super fun to play. Rengar has delays on his q and leblanc's full burst is delayed. Can you people please explain how this update made these assassins more unhealty","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-09T04:02:18.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Freddymc,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=zh9cW4jY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-11-09T03:54:11.977+0000)\n>\n> This update made the big 4 assassins far more healthy then before.
