I swear its not my internet because when it FINALLY stops scanning files it actually seems like a small patch. My friends say that they barely even see the scanning files because its so short and it probably ends around 100 for them. Am I doing something wrong? I even patched this morning at like 4am just to come home at 3pm and have to wait for this stupid patch for almost 2 hours. I could understand the two hours thing though because my lol crashed midway but riot pls. I have no idea what the hell is going on with my client anymore","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-27T10:04:55.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the client scans for files, it scans all files present in your Riot Games folder. If you've ever downloaded the client from another region, even if it was just for a single second, a lot of files would have been placed in there (or you could have just moved them there manually :P)\n\nFor the clients, navigate to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects and look at the folders there. For OCE, you should only have folders named lol_air_client, lol_air_client_config_oc1, lol_game_client, lol_game_client_en_au, lol_launcher, lol_patcher. If there are any others, you can safely delete them.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
