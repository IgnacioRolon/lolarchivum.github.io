Was there another &#039;official&#039; announcement after this that I&#039;m missing regarding the uptimes of &#039;TT Ranked Flex&#039;? I saw this post &#039;https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/FKbiy2gY-twisted-treeline-ranked-schedule-preseason-update&#039; but have no idea if it&#039;s credible as I don&#039;t see a &#039;Riot&#039; tag or tag of any kind next to his [Zaps] name . Although even if it was official, why isn&#039;t the schedule being followed then?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-09-13T10:28:19.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mystici,\n\nYea there was another announcement back in April about the times changing and the reasoning [here](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/b4EUvoMX-tt-changes-coming-apr-3rd).\n\nYou can always find the [current intended queue schedule](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/wgM0WBsO-queue-schedule-updated-apr-3rd-2018) pinned to the [Boards home page](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/).","replies":[]}]}
