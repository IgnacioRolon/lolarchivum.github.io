Whilst we don&#039;t expect to win any tournies for quite a while, we want to get better and eventually be able to mix it with the big boys.\r\n\r\nCurrently looking for 3 members to fill the roles of Support, Top and either Mid or JG. I am undecided on whether I want to play Mid or JG so will look for players and then decide.\r\n\r\nWe will take it semi seriously as far as competing goes. We want to improve as quickly as possible, and play at a high level by the end of this Season, so that next Season we have a realistic shot at making Challenger. \r\n\r\nMyself and my current team mate both have a load of experience in grinding other competitive games and improving to get to the top. \r\n\r\nAll we require is for you to be a nice person who can handle constructive criticism. Also, no ego&#039;s please. We try hard not to have ego&#039;s.\r\nAnd be active. Not necessarily be on EVERY night, but most nights would be prefered. \r\n\r\nAlso, I know the title says Gold+, but we will definitely look at you if you are high Silver and have been Gold or higher previously. We know rank doesn&#039;t mean everything, but it is a good place to start :)\r\n\r\nHMU in client or on skype if interested\r\n\r\nIGN: Brindyyy\r\nskype: andrew.brind1","replies":[]}
