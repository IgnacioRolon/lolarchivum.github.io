Their Amumu goes top and we just all in them. Kill 4 and finish the game form being so far behind. Cop that trash-talker.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo satisfying!","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-03-26T02:03:08.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just love when you beat those kinds of people, had a game last week where the enemy lee sin and his team invaded us lvl one and cleared out our entire jungle, i was playing utility tree udyr at the time. We had a galio, annie, leona and twitch. Ofcourse they keep trash talking, calling us bV noobs and such. The score was 20-5, so we all decided to go full tank and protect the annie who was getting pretty strong. At 20 minutes we had a combined total of 12k hp meat shield protecting the annie. We completely stomped them in team fights and make the game super long on purpose, took 3 inhibitors and baron before we ended. The lesion's team completely raged at him lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-03-25T12:43:49.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always rather pleasing.\n\nHad a game a couple of days ago that started as 3v5, our jg and supp dc'd. I was mid and they decided to 3 man gank me 3-4 times, obv get the kill and then talk smack about it. Thankfully, Leona reconnected after about 10min and things were soon looking up.\n\nWe banded together and utterly destroyed every teamfight until the win @ about 50min.\n\nNo game is ever out of reach!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-25T12:15:49.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol yep it happens","replies":[]}]}
