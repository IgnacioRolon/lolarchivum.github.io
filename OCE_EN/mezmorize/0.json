I can't imagine revamping refunds would place higher than things like honour improvements, ranked systems etc. So long as those teams are working on new things for ranked, behaviour, all that big stuff, refunds probably aren't going to see any love.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-02-05T03:21:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=YEgEwpdn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-05T02:13:11.792+0000)\n>\n> Everyone wants this, but why would Riot do it?
