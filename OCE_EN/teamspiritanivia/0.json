Hardly. It embodies some of the comical humor League of Legends has been known for, such as masterpieces like Big Bad Warwick, Urf Rider Corki (Rest In Peace Urf #neverforget) and Brolaf.\nSo grab your spoon (or fork, however you eat fruit salad) and read on!\n\nFruit Salad Anivia Abilities\n\nPassive - Rebirth. When turning into Eggnivia, we are presented with a bowl of fruit salad. From the heavens above comes a spoon. Over the 6 seconds until rebirth, the spoon closes in for the scoop that ultimately gives Fruit Salad Anivia the nutritious goodness that is life.\n\nQ- Flash Frost. Flash Frost is now an explosive  watermelon of death! \n\nW- Crystallize. What are the tops of pineapples good for you ask? To trap your enemies and prevent your allies from recalling because Anivia is all about that Team Spirit of course. A wall of green prickles is your perfect icicle and Vitamin C supplement.\n\nE - Frostbite. When your enemies are having some issues moving thanks to your ice cold salad serving, what better way to dish out some damage on the double with the infamous banana. Not only is it shaped like a boomerang ( and we all know boomerangs come from trees and what goes on trees? Fruit does) but it is also high in Vitamin B6 AND Pwn. Best served cold.\n\nR- Glacial Storm. It is a common fact that you don't make friends with salad. But everyone will want to be your friend when you're Nutrionivia and unleashing a spiralling torrent of yummy goodness. Have an apple, a pear, even a cherry to share. Chuck in a cantaloupe and why not a mango cause they're dope. A torrent of pineapple for you, lets chuck in some berries, both 'black frosted' and blue. A Fruit Salad storm will put the Fruit Salad In Fruit Salad Anivia.\n\nVisually, Fruit Salad Anivia needs a fruit basket on her head. She shall radiate a healthy orange over the fields of Summoners Rift with green feathers to symbolize the all natural beauty that is refreshingly found in the best salad in the world. Spread your wings and fruit.\n\nRito Plz, think of the children, they need their nutrition - Abraham Lincoln.","replies":[{"poster":"Ikingy","date":"2014-12-19T05:35:18.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea Riot should make a whole set of fruit salad champions.
