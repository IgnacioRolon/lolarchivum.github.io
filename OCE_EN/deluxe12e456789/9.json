I was asking kndred for him to leave but she just stood.  Just as my friend was about to secure a kill with his ult, kindred ulted him. He was so surprised because he knew nothing about this ability and when i explained he felt cheated. this persisted throughout that game and into the next as we were on the same team again. my friend and I both agreed that this targeted instant ultimate should not be part of the game. Perhaps making it single target is an option.","replies":[{"poster":"TheGolleum","date":"2015-10-14T13:04:48.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope it is perfectly balanced. The ult can be used for trolling but so can other champions ults so it's nothing new. If it only affected the kindred's team than it would be broken but since it affects both it isn't. If it were single target it would be a worse Kayle ult.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-14T13:40:31.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look at {{champion:432}} at first the troll was good in this one and {{champion:34}} are that is fun and my fave {{champion:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2015-10-15T11:41:37.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally have never met any of these champs with troll players controlling them after playing way more games against or with them, on only my first two games playing with kindred, I instantly feel anger towards her ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-20T00:51:44.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And I have yet to come across a troll Kindred, but have encountered troll Bards and Anivias (not yet Ali though). Just because you haven't encountered something doesn't mean it's not around.
