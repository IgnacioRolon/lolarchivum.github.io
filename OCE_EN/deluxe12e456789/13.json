The alpha tester icon may take a few days to appear in your account. If you haven't received the icon by November 15, please let us know and we'll investigate further.\n\nToday(15th) is the last day of distribution not the start, and nope I haven't received it yet so will have to check tomorrow","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5318008","date":"2016-11-11T07:47:50.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"were you an alpha tester? \nif yes, i haven't received mine either","replies":[]}]}
