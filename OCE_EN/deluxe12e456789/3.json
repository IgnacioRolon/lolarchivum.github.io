Kappa.\n\nMake sure your connection is perfect, and that you're using cable not Wifi.\nYour connection will effect your CS, how often I've last hit a minion only for the lag to credit it to another minion instead of me.\n\nSeveral streamers/pros have said from time to time that if you need practice on last hitting, take some AD runes. If CS is your problem, taking AD runes instead of AP wont effect your gameplay very much.\n\nLast bit of advice I can give is to make sure you're not cancelling your auto attacks. I'll miss about 5 CS on average due to canceling my AA.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-11T07:28:59.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So pretty much take out the simplest thing you could do in league and make it easier ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-11T07:11:32.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed is the easiest champ in the game to last hit with that's for sure.\nAs for secret to your favourite champs the answer is practice more","replies":[]}]}
