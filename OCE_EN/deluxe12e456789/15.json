Just that passive in the jungle alone needs a buff, using it against an enemy, pointless.\n\nIf Rito changed WW passive, they need to give him some form of lifesteal passive back in his kit, possibly reduce his Q or change that also.\n\nWhile we are at it, since WW is quite old, how about just rework him to make him viable again? He is after all a part of the first set of champs to be released, simply buffing and nerfing him over the journey has not helped him with how the game is now.","replies":[]}]}
