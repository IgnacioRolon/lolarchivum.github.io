I have decided this champ concept to mend this void that is an attack damage support role. I like to have this champion to be a yordle with sword that looks too big  for him to carry that he found somewhere on the outskirts of bandle city as it would aslo fill the yordle support role. He will use mana. he will be melee. who knows you could make him {{champion:32}} long lost friend who searches for him until he finds him in the league. \r\n\r\nName: hugo the yordle with a big sword\r\n\r\nThe blade provides (passive): every 5 minute (2.5 min after 20 min) a sword shard will appear in his side of the jungle and picking it up will grant 5 ad permanently as well as some gold. his sword will get bigger per sword retrieved. He also gets 20 gold if he auto attacks an enemy champ on a 10 sec cooldown.\r\npromotion (q): raises his sword towards the allied champ and heals the ally for base amount plus % ad \r\ndemacia (W): Spin on the spot with sword tripping and slowing enemies for 1 s around him. If he has less % hp than the surrounding enemies he stuns them for 1 second\r\nexert energy (e) grants a small aoe movement speed buff scaling with %ad and a base of 10% for 2 seconds.\r\ndrain evil (r) passive: hugo deals 10/25/60 true dmg on hit, active: hugo can sap the life of one oponent doing 10% plus % ad of max hp and reducing his dmg by 20/30/50% for 4 seconds","replies":[{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-09-17T09:22:19.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea. As a support main the only thing i would change would be the E and thats just because its a lot of utility in 1 kit so i would change it into a self shield that also grants Either the lowest health ally 50% of the shield or the nearest ally 50% shield. numbers i can let you work out but as a melee support that defensive capability would be helpful. just my thoughts. A few changes could used else where but i like it","replies":[]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T09:36:20.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What don't you get. {{champion:32}} has no friends.

After 6 you have a bork active/exhaust with corki passive, he has no gap closers, you may want some survivablity cause he gonna get bursted before he can even get in range to even apply a stun.","replies":[]}]}]}
