I just watched some jhin gameplay and noticed that his ult zooms him out making his area of vision on camera bigger. is it  possible to give this trait of zooming out camera to {{champion:101}} {{champion:56}} ultmates to make it natural for players like me who struggle without a locked camera to play them.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-14T04:19:09.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah pressing Y or spacebar is probably something you should learn to do. playing with lock screen for most of the game....hopefully not the whole game.....is a really really bad habit. you can absolutely not progress to your full potential with lock screen on for that long. i would assume the only reason riot allows for it to stay is for new people to get the hang of focusing on a smaller amount of space right in front of you. have you got screen edge scrolling enabled? or did you at the time you decided not to use this? you can adjust how much the screen moves when you scroll to the edge, as well as your mouse speed and sensitivity JUST for the game. overtime it should become natural, hopefully its not too late","replies":[{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2016-01-14T05:07:00.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just saying its unfair that one champion is allowed a larger view from a locked screen","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-14T06:46:37.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually hes the only champ whos long range ult requires him to have vision of himself and his enemy. all other long range ults either give you a small AOE area for you to 1-time launch the projectile/s and for it to land in places that are far away from your champion, and seeing the champion doesnt make a difference, if that makes sense (xerath, lux, ziggs) otherwise you have special indicators or whatever they were called for jinx/ashe/draven ult that you can see where they can fire it and where it would come from, but the main thing is its only 1 singular proectile so its not important to see the actual champion themselves","replies":[{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2016-01-14T09:27:13.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"isnt it aoe?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-14T12:37:30.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i hope it isnt. his abilities vid wouldve showed if it was AOE. but he does fire long range shots with the indicator being a long line so its important to have the POV of the start and the possible ending of where his bullets start and end. even with miss fortunes she just hits the entire cone so its not important looking any further than what the cone can shoot at since its just gonna hit in her range or they move out of it, and they cant be hit by it at all, but it doesnt matter cos you cant do anything about it, with jhins ult you still need that vision cos you can still snipe them and it takes a lot longer to get out of his ults radius. <-- finally a fullstop amirite","replies":[{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2016-01-15T04:04:03.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"were not on the topic i was originally talking about (zooming out) its basically a xerath ultimate in a cone except more dmg why doesnt xerath get zoom out","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2016-01-14T01:31:26.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but my point is why don't you have to do that on jhin","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-14T02:05:01.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can just have unlocked and press Spacebar, whenever you need to lock the screen.
