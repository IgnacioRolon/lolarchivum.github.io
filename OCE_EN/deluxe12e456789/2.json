This only means that your normal score is the same as all the other normals scores.\n\nThat means that the last time you all played normals was when you were all the same skill level, or those higher ranks have been trying shit in normals as \"It is only normals\" and failing, therefore bringing their level down to that unranked dude.\n\nIf they played for real, they wouldn't be sitting in that game, or as I said, the last time they played they were actually at that level and have been grinding ranked for some time.","replies":[{"poster":"deluxe12E456789","date":"2015-09-16T22:03:56.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But forcing an extra 5-10 minutes just to play with players your skill level could easily be reduced to 60 seconds.
