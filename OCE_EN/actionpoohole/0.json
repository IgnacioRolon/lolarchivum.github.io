It is  much more enjoyable and interactive than before and opens up huge amounts of strategic play but the lack of counter play that has been created is just making the game far too \"Paper, Scissors, Rock\" for my liking.\n\nThe recent spike in a certain champion being selected due to an obvious exploit is just beyond a joke. I don't often have a problem with having to deal with countering champs but when they feed off people who are obviously unable to counter or even understand what is going on... Example: a complete and total suppression which is unable to be broken by non AD champs (Unless you want to buy a bad item for AP *QSS*) and are pretty much dead before even being able to move a square inch away,\n\nI'm sure I don't need to explain who this champ is, fact is that the fans even agree that it is beyond funny.\n\nThe game is becoming much too stressful due to the problems that have arisen.\n\nI love playing jungle and I love the way it is but the new items in combination with certain champs are FAR too powerful, and with other champs the items and jungle is just FAR too strong and the Items far too nonviable.\n\nA huge overhaul on balancing the new jungle items and champs to go along with it really needs to be done in order to bring back some balance into a very restricted and low counter play system that is currently in place.","replies":[{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-26T19:33:55.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I didn't really read this indepth enough/I'm not smart enough to work it out, who is the champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2014-11-26T22:02:52.280+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ActionPoohole","date":"2014-11-27T16:41:16.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had a huge issue with Warwick...\n\nBut when a champion is forced to be taken out by more than one champ at a time, that is when the problems begin. It's like always requiring a baby sitter because the enemy champion has the Trump Card and in most situations the only way to out deal this is to have 2 against it. Having to avoid a champion who is in your own jungle and being unable to flush them out or even scare them out on your own accord is quite dulling to the game play experience.\n\nI don't like someone being able to counter jungle me whilst I'm there to protect it and being able to do little about it unless I whelp for help... And in Blind picks it's more likely than not that they will be too busy with their fingers in their noses to come help...\n\nHowever I find that late game he's not a huge issue but he is still managing to stomp inexperienced players leading to them becoming more fed and far more of an issue to enjoying games than it should be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-27T06:38:35.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try buying 1-2 dorans blade in jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-11-26T22:34:38.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.
