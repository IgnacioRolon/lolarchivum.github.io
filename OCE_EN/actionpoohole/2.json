RIOT Please Reply 2 Formal Complaint.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remained at my teams nexus due to our team profusely feeding and being extremely abusive towards me and my friend and blabbering on about taking normals seriously. Constant harassment throughout the whole game. I couldn't exit the base without having half my HP knocked off in 1 hit. The game was impossible and the team duo were making it CRYSTAL clear how they intended to abuse us because they fed. There was nothing I could do and I refused to let some fed player embarrass me because of these completely disgusting individuals who think it's okay to treat people in Normals like trash.\r\n\r\nI get a stupid message telling me to say \"I Agree\" like I entered into some binding contract that now I don't even have the chance to have an internet problem and get booted otherwise perhaps I'll get banned. I make EVERY effort to make sure I complete games. I did not LEAVE the game at all. I stayed at my nexus to avoid being completely obliterated and laughed at and called a noob every time because of these scumbags. It was FUNNY for them to feed and laugh as everyone else cops the brunt of it.\r\n\r\nThe attitude and abuse was absolutely disgusting and I refused to partake in the rubbish.\r\n\r\nEnemy GangPlank was level 15 Whilst we were still in laning phase at level 10 due to the amount of kills they had fed to him. The game was thoroughly ruined and impossible considering our own team were making it clear that they would steal every buff from us as we tried to kill it and carry on to call us scrubs... Following us around to make a nuisance of a game that was already completely ruined.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn't enough that I had to put up with being thoroughly abused the game ends and I get a smack back message in my face:\r\n\r\n\"Type I Agree here\" ..... I DID NOTHING WRONG??? This message is completely insulting and disgusting. How dare I be treated like this?! I've played nearly 2000 games and I think I've only left maybe 1-3 games due to internet connection issues.\r\n\r\nThen for me to get a message that I can't bypass to agree to it like I did something wrong?\r\n\r\nI did nothing wrong and I would like this wiped from my record. As I complete every game I play but this time the abuse and feeding and poor attitude was just far too much to bare.\r\n\r\nThere is no justice when crap like this happens. This completely tainted my experience. Just like when I got reported by a premade for them abusing me and I get a message telling me about bad days. Sure, it really was a bad day thanks to a barrage of abuse from 4 trolls who thought it would be funny to add insult to injury.\r\n\r\nI never leave games intentionally and this automated system shows just how ridiculous an unmonitored and unmoderated system really is.\r\n\r\nI was FORCED to agree. And of course I Agree anyway but it's the principle. I did nothing wrong and was given a slap on the wrist due to others. This is entirely unfair!\r\n\r\nI'd like some sort of official response to this as the Tribunal System is COMPLETELY inadequate and does absolutely NOTHING to protect genuine players.\r\n\r\nI've paid a fair amount of money to RIOT and I would like some sort of gesture of customer service to begin wrapping up the problem that is the OCE Tribunal (Or Complete and Utter Lack thereof)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nScott","replies":[{"poster":"ActionPoohole","date":"2014-12-04T12:59:38.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please reply and don't leave a sour taste behind after this horrible mistreatment.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-05T06:09:55.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\n\nThe \"I Agree\" prompt given to players when they leave or AFK in a game is primarily to inform them that doing so is actually against the rules.\n\nBeing able to join and leave a current session in an online game is quite common, but obviously doesn't work in a game of LoL. So the first leave is used as a chance to let players know that Leaving/AFKing in LoL is detrimental to other players and punishable.\n\nIf you already understand this and you indeed make every effort to finish games and don't leave or AFK regularly, then you will not be punished by LeaverBuster.\n\nWith regards to the Tribunal and player behaviour, currently the Tribunal has been shut down in every region while it is re-developed with a range of improvements and new features in mind. There are other systems and manual bans in place (and still in development/testing) working while the Tribunal is offline. OCE will receive a Tribunal along with the other regions when it is re-opened. Details [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/tribunal-oce).","replies":[]}]}]}
