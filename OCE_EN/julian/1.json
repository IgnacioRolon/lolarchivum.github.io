Being to lazy to replace it , i have been playing for months with a different config\r\n\r\ni have shifted everything over one so Q=W , W=E , E= R , R=T\r\nI play with my four fingers on w,e,r,t and my thumb on v for an active item\r\n\r\nLately its been heaps frustrating when i try to auto level ... i still click on my level ups and it puts me in a massive disadvantage during lane in some scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have moved auto leveling to alt + Spells but it is like a mission to extend my thumb from v to alt\r\n\r\nSome one help me find a simpler alternative ( besides fixing my q k ) ill slap you , thank you {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-12T19:44:04.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think Alt+W, E, R ,T is actually smart and very easy to do. I struggle to see how your thumb cannot reach the Alt key, maybe use the side of your thumb? That seems more likely. If i find Alt to be good for auto levels (cause i too still press them) i might change to WERT.\n\nEDIT: nvm QWER and alt is ez.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-11T09:58:03.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2, 3, 4, 5?","replies":[{"poster":"Julian","date":"2015-01-11T10:02:00.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you make theauto leveling like 2 + W ?","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-11T10:08:41.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Julian,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zRFAnBF8,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-11T10:02:00.044+0000)\n>\n> Can you make theauto leveling like 2 + W ?\n\nYeah. If you aren't using 2, 3, 4 or 5 there isn't much reason to not just use one button to level the abilities though.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
