(Ranked)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"From personal experience, I have not seen any queue issues during the Thursday I have played the mode. It&#039;s not like Thursday is a special day or anything where more players login. Is it possible that we have the queue run daily with something like a 3:00pm - 12:00am setup?","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2017-01-29T22:49:49.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because I'm pretty sure Riot has explained over and over, annoying to the public (including me), the server population isn't enough to have the server run the Twisted Treeline for Ranked 24/7, the queue health for the server will turn bad (this is in a worse case scenario).\n\nApart from that nothing else is stopping them, just not enough people on the server to keep the Treeline open, as all. NA don't have this problem as they have all their shit and the server keeps EVERYTHING (Norm draft, Treeline Ranked, Treeline Norm) open cause they have a shit tonne on their server xD","replies":[]}]}
