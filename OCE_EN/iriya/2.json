Solo/duo and flex involve different skills and mindsets, so it's not all that farfetched for there to be a significant skill/rank disparity there.\n\nIt's worth remembering though that your opinion is only one of many. If I were to remove either queue it would be solo/duo, because at it's core League is a team game, and if people aren't willing to capitalise on that teamwork skill then that's their choice to take that disadvantage.","replies":[{"poster":"Iriya","date":"2017-01-04T05:29:03.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO REMOVE SOLO/DUO?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-04T08:31:47.924+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's right, League is a team game so removing the \"team queue\" would be stupid","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-01-05T12:48:33.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you considered the possibility that the \"rank disparity\" which appears may be linked to the way the rank reset was applied? \n\nAs someone who was placed in Plat 1 in Solo and Gold 3 in Flex, it makes sense that I am placed into games with and against other Gold Flex players regardless of my Solo rank. Admittedly, when I check op.gg I see a fruit salad of Solo/Duo ranks in my Flex games, as those are what are displayed, but upon further inspection the Flex ranks are quite close. Also, the queue times I've experienced as a solo player have been hardly notable and are often quick, which makes me hesitant to claim poor queue health. \n\nPerhaps a worthwhile point of discussion could be how similar Solo/Duo and Flex should have been upon initial placement (which I have no definitive answer for).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-01-04T03:35:32.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of flex Q is for people to play as teams.\nNot another SoloQ.","replies":[{"poster":"Iriya","date":"2017-01-04T03:39:27.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes but our region is too dead to actually support it. look at the rank disparities when playing","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-01-04T04:04:05.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems not, if it was dead then it would be like dominion, or the fact that TT isn't up all the time.\nThose we can't support.\n\nThe player base on this is split 40/60.\nBecause now Ranked teams are no more, and only exist through Flex.\nBut now solo people can Q up to join a random \"Team\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-01-05T11:18:57.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bronze and was in a plat one until they got a silver......

So golds get matched with bronze but golds cant queue with bronze. Does that seem crazy to anyone else? \n\nPerhaps having a queue health indicator would help people to know if they want to join a queue. Like lots of games have a population indicator so you can see this server is almost empty and this one is almost full. Once you have gone to the effort of finding a couple more mates to fill out a 5 man and then queued up and waited for 20 mins for a game which then turns out to be pretty unbalanced, kind of ruins it. \n\nA team game with no voice comms built in is always going to have problems imo.","replies":[]}]}
