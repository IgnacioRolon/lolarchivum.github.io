How could we treat them like things with uniform and fixed perks to be sorted and identified with a certain arbitrary label (negative ones at that) as opposed to being just another human being who may or may not be proficient in your language, and may or not may be a good person much like everyone else?\n\nIt's just a simple fairness problem in the end of the day really.

Or that the very close to definitive reasons may include Chinese names (again, not just any that seem Chinese) and maybe names consisted entirely of numbers, especially so if \"qq\" can be seen at the very start of that number string (nonsensical random character names DO NOT count).\n\nWithout at least some definitive and critical validation to point towards the likelihood of something, everything else is entirely born from mere speculation and conjectures. I mean seriously:\n\n* Since when being rude is anything to call someone's nationality?\n* Tilting and trolling their team when behind and possibly go afk is NOT something exclusive to players of any nationality.\n* Abusing teammates and go int feeding and whatnot is NOT anything to say about anyone's nationality, LEAGUE PLAYERS do that shit.\n* Language barrier is NOT an indication of toxicity, nor is it only possessed by players of any specific nationality. I mean hell, do you think every native OCE players type perfect English in the first place?\n* Random character strings in name is not anything to say about the player's nationality. Any players who originally named themselves after their email account, log-in name or purely random numbers/characters and refuse to change names will have that sort of name.\n* Playing Ionian champions does not indicate a player is of any specific nationality. Lee Sin is one of THE most popular and 1-trick'ed champ in the game, what, all of his players are Chinese you say?\n* Playing high burst champs is NOT exclusive to any player of any nationality, what are you even on about? Why do you think Mid, where it's populated by burst champs, is the most queued lane in all servers without fail?\n* Speaking in a language other than English in chat itself is NOT negative attitude.\n* Negative connotation does NOT mean the player is of any specific nationality.\n* \"ff20 gg noob team\" does NOT indicate one's nationality.\n* Typical 1-word-flash is not definitive of their nationality. So in the reverse of that logic, does a foreign player who learns to swear \"fk u\", \"uninstall\", \"kys\" etc are instantly OCE or wherever?\n* High aggression and going ham in lane does NOT indicate your nationality, wtf?\n* Building full damage does NOT indicate your nationality. It indicate bad game sense and that's all. Or perhaps you suggest that only players of a specific nationality or 2 can be bad? Really?\n* Not respecting team composition does NOT indicate your nationality.\n\nWhat sort of crack are you on bud? Give me some of that good stuff.

I mean really, seeing that or \"fu ck\" or whatever is bad? Have you seen how bad the insults, aggression and personal attacks can get from local OCE players?\n\nIt's really not the Chinese or whatever foreign players' problem if someone is just going to assume every little thing they say that isn't in formal and modest English to be the worst thing ever conceived in human languages, and tilting themselves \"having a bad time\" over it as well as condemning the entire demographic for no reason.\n\nAre there toxic Chinese or toxic whatever nationality (not from OCE) players? Hell yea, of course, no denying that. But is it really something so severe that it demands special attention, prioritisation or even requiring to go so far off the handle and into the territory of exclusion/alienation, given that we know precisely how toxic the local players can be in the first place? You tell me.\n\n**What I'm trying to say is basically: At least be fair, identify and judge/evaluate toxicity in people with the right metric and for the right reasons.**\n\n..............\n\nOn a side note: I am not quite sure if I get the \"your mum is grass\". It is probably supposed to be a variant of \"fk your mum\" as \"fk\" and \"grass\" are pronounced similarly in Mandarin, but \"harmonised\" or \"made pun\". For some context, \"fk your mum\" is just an everyday insult much like being the \"fk you\" of Chinese, and given its somewhat triviality and that in this case it's also having its hostility dulled/masked on top of it, that points to the notion that it was just a banter. One could argue that it may be passive-aggression too though I highly doubt it. I mean are you threatened from seeing \"fork you\" or \"grill yourself\"? Same deal.

Reports are thus generally reserved for cases of spamming, flame-baiting, flaming, real insults and abuses, hate speech, death threats and all sorts of other real nasties, not for \"idiot fuck you\" or the like. If they said \"you piece of useless fking shit feeder and go kys\" or something along that line/worse then you may get a case of someone being real salty and offensive and perhaps require a report card, but anyone would agree that \"idiot fuck you\" simply does not deserve that level of attention and response unless they spam it over and over nonstop or something otherwise that line itself does not really make it to the toxicity list. But well I'm sure you can try reporting someone over a \"idiot fuck you\", though, no one is stopping you from doing that yourself.\n\nAlso \"yellow fever\", a term that's much more problematic than something like \"idiot fuck you\", but I guess that's entirely okay while the latter is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad.

You can literally take that those examples with very little approaching 0 change and put in under a different light to get say a generic OCE/EU/NA/BR/etc toxic player, which is readily available across the server or internet in general so don't even try to kid yourself otherwise that players who do stupid things and proceed to blame and/or insult the team for it (and in incompetent whatever official language of the server too) or all other forms of toxicity is somehow almost entirely an 1-demographic-exclusive problem; that is just dumb. Also for the record, mummy insults is not exclusive to Asian origins; one of the first recorded mummy insult appeared in the Bible, not only that \"your mum\" or \"yo mamma\" and co. are also insults derived independently from any Eastern influences.\n\nSorry to inform you, but your \"Asian sort of feeling\" is busted. When you virtually label the great majority to all toxic players to be Asians by definition, does it ever come off as a surprise why most of the players are supposedly Asian to you?

I&#x27;ve &quot;assisted&quot; riot with at least 15 different people.  The satisfaction you get from assisting riot in banning toxic players is just amazing.\n\nRaces means nothing, every single human being is over 99.99% clone, I have 0 idea why you have to come back to that arbitrary idea when something vastly more tangible such as national and cultural impact/differences is just there up for grabs.\n\nAnd I wasn't bitching about native OCE players any exclusively, or merely basing off singular cases. I only take it out because people rarely seriously talked about the abundant OCE toxic players (the same for any dominant population on any server) openly because we just mute and report them, but somehow when they're from a different backgroundor using different language, even though they may be just as bad or perhaps less bad, we instead of doing the same thing we come to forum and have a whine about it almost every week or 2. \n\nIn OCE, one might perceive that there are more non-English Asian toxic players as opposed to other non-English OCE population or something, it's owing to the fact there's a higher Asian population (players) than other non-English OCE population in the first place, and NOT because they're for whatever reason, innately more toxic or whatever. However even that said, the reality is still that foreign players or non-English speaking players do not get the majority of reports and whatnot, not even close, as the majority to vast majority are addressed to native players of the region, this is the same for any server. But we only have more issues with players who may have language barriers, toxic or otherwise, probably because they're easier to pick out, not because there are actually any more toxic in the first place.\n\nThat fked up standard and the clearly unfair perception above and below are what irk me (though I won't deny there is another layer which is from be being identified with the group, which contribute to why I react so strongly, but that's mostly secondary), that is all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-22T12:07:39.165+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"#Racism\n* prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.\n* the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.\n\n#[Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias)\n\"The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, refers to the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than do neutral or positive things.\"\n\n___\nWhat SEKAI says is true, your list of \"identifying features\" are not in any way specific to Chinese players, nor even specific to toxic players in general. \n\n\"Most non-english speaking flamers are Chinese\" is also a terribly biased statement, because the international population in Aus/OCE means that the vast majority of non or poor English speakers in OCE are Chinese simply by percentage, which has absolutely nothing to do with them being toxic. It's a matter of correlation, not causation, a very important distinction.\n\nRank also has absolutely ZERO relevance to this argument. It is not an argument of what item builds work when or of some gameplay mechanic, it is a player behaviour discussion. While there are some behaviours seen more prevalent in high elos (witch-hunting, toxic queue sniping) and the like, they are not exclusive, and this whole racism argument is not one of them. It is a flawed argument that exists at every level of play.\n\nYou are being rather egotistical, and breaking the **Don't be a Jerk** rule, but given that SEKAI had valid discussion to offer and is perfectly capable of defending himself in a mostly civil and rational manner, I have left your post up.

But I guess some do use it, just maybe.\n\nNot to mention if they are toxic because they're just shitty, they will just be a sodding shit since the start or after being triggered by teammates or opponents _supposedly_ sucking or whatever, as expected as that's how most toxic players function, and they won't wait to only after being told to speak in English. It's not an impossibility, but that isn't that likely either. So I'd like to know how did you even bring it up to them in the first place? Considering what you're trying to push, I can't rule out problems being triggered by how you suggest it to them just yet.\n\n> I know OCE includes countries which speak languages other than English, but I believe a rule should be put in place (*cough* refusing to communicate with team), where you&#x27;re ONLY allowed to speak English in chat.

You can call it \"facts\" or whatever, but the rules that are created for no reason apart from excluding others over some arbitrary reasoning means the rule itself is a discrimination, and thus will never be implemented, by the sensible peeps anyway.\n\nRefusal to communication is when someone doesn't speak at all or continuously speak in a language nobody can understand despite being suggested numerous times to do otherwise, refuses to listen to or discuss with the team, refusing to honour team decisions, act on their own and refusal to cooperation with teammates, and refusing to acknowledge pings etc. One needs to tick a couple boxes from all that to be qualified a case of refusing to communicate, merely choosing not to type in English or simply unable to don't make it to the case in the grand scheme of things as the former isn't really a problem and the latter is simply not a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-02-26T13:21:15.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was a few years ago, so I don't remember the specifics, but I'm pretty sure I was told (by support or riot) that speaking in a language other than English counted as not communicating with your team.

I mean you even confirm so with that \"it&#x27;s more often that you say something bad than something good\", so I'm not sure what's going on there. If you're saying that there seems to be more Chinese speaking trolls than other non-English counterpart then as mentioned by the others already, it's due to the fact there's simply more Chinese speaking people than other non-English population hence you see more Chinese speaking trolls more than other non-English counterpart due to that; but even then, the vast majority of all trolls are still going to be English speaking in the end of the day as that's the dominant population here.\n\n\"Not all insults are in Mandarin.
