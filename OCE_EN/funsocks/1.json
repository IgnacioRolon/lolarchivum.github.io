Funsocks here. I placed in the top 10 in last year&#039;s fanfic contest with my Twitch story and have been wondering; &quot;What if...&quot; with my story selection ever since. I&#039;ve had a few stories floating around in my head, but considering the criteria in place, I&#039;m shelving a few ideas (Like Urgot meeting The Kindred when Garen takes his legs) in favour of a totally original setting that occurred in my mind as the result of a skin release, which I think would encompass the criteria more broadly without needing to bolt a skin name onto a story I already think is decent.\n\nThis story takes place in an invented city, but could be seen as an augmented crossover of Demacia and Bilgewater, beset by darkness, if one needed imagery to reference. I try to work Twitch into a lot of my stories, as he&#039;s been my main for about 2 seasons now. As with last time, let me know what you think with a comment below, and if I make the top 10 again, vote for me this time you bum :P Good luck to all the writers involved! Alright. On to the story.\n\nAlso, in case it isn't obvious, the skins I used were Iron Inquisitor Kayle, Black Scourge Singed, Cursed Revenant Nocturne and Kingpin Twitch\n-----------------------\n\nSquish. Squish. Squish.\n\nHer companion&#039;s presence had never bothered her so far, as varied as they were, but this new &quot;expert&quot; the church had sent was hard to bear. The sound of the moisture in his boots as they thudded along the streets brought her to the edge of madness. Why didn&#039;t he just dry them, or use another pair?\n\nIt stopped suddenly and sniffed the ground, circling some trash before diving into the refuse to retrieve some discarded food and gobbling it down.\n\n&quot;At least this one&#039;s got character, I guess...&quot;, she thought to herself, peering through her mask at the Plague Doctor assigned to her by the church.\n\nA staunch man, as silent as the coffin he carried on his back, with a wicked looking plague mask strapped to his face, concealing all motive. He wasn&#039;t blessed as the Iron Inquisitors, immune to the plague, but through his skills as a plague doctor he was practically immune to the disease. They called him &quot;Singed&quot;, a man who&#039;s family were sentenced to inquisition for being Plaguebearers and heretics. Their home was burned while they slept, and he returned from his work helping plague-stricken children to find his own home ablaze. Rumor has it that he braved the flames to try to save his daughter, the horrific scarring that occurred as a result a grim testament to which his Agent name reflected.\n\nKayle shuddered at the thought.\n\nPerhaps it was a bitter irony, or the joke of a higher up, that would cause them to pair the agents Kayle and Singed, the Firestarter with the One Afflicted by Flame. But such irony was lost when so few Agents remained, and even fewer Iron Inquisitors.\n\n&quot;Mmm... Hmm.. Over here, over here...&quot;, the giant rat muttered.\n\nKayle was snapped from her wandering thoughts of her companion who never spoke, instead to the companion who they now followed.\n\n&quot;Twitch&quot;, as they called him. There was no way around it. This... creature. It wasn&#039;t human. Perhaps it once was, or perhaps a rat that became greater, but in any view it was only half man, the second half being that of a rodent. It sniffed the air frequently and jerked it&#039;s head about, ears constantly re-positioning at every slight sound. He had gained some reputation as a master of poisons, plagues and manhunting before the outbreak of plague, and worked extensively with facets of the underworld, becoming somewhat of a &quot;Kingpin&quot; of sorts in his own circles and amassing quite a fortune. But when the Undercity was left all but a ghost town by the outbreak of the plague, he was the only living thing that emerged. The church saw it as the Gods showing him favour and granting him passage from the bowels of hell. Kayle, however, imagined he was simply immune to sickness as a result of how filthy he always was.\n\n&quot;Mmmm...&quot;, the rat croaked, stopping suddenly. &quot;It&#039;s in here...&quot;.\n\n&quot;Heretics&quot;. Revenants of the plague who refused to remain dead. They fed on the corpses of the damned, gaining unique powers with each feeding. Eventually, the Church would need to deploy a unit of Agents, an Iron Inquisitor accompanied by others with various skillsets to remove the Heretic, based on the growth of it&#039;s abilities. The ruined church they now stood before contained one very such horror.\n\nThis heretic lived in darkness. It&#039;s code name was &quot;Nocturne&quot;, of the darkness. It persisted in evading capture, unlike it&#039;s more audacious &quot;cousins&quot;, so a plague immune tracker was required to hunt it into the undercity, where it reside, which explained the need for agent Twitch, but... Why the doctor?\n\nKayle&#039;s mind flooded with strategies and methods to deal with the menace, based off the skills it was reported to possess, but the doctor&#039;s place failed to make itself apparent. His skillset was too much of a question, and the need for a doctor in the first place was negligible. Still, she couldn&#039;t deny the merit of strength in numbers, and the man seemed as strong as an bull, considering he spent large parts of his days transporting bodies in the coffin attached to his back.\n\n&quot;Spread out and find it. This one is cowardly and will flee at every opportunity. If you find it, make noise and give chase&quot;.\n\nThe other two silently nodded and flanked the building on each side as Kayle approached the massive church doors. She placed her gauntlets on the worn surface and gave a shove, heaving the massive wooden doors open with a creak.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nInside was... Darkness. Pure and absolute. The undisturbed pews seated a nonexistent procession and the room was largely undisturbed, compared to the exterior. Nonetheless, she definitely wasn&#039;t alone. The blackened presence of a Heretic oozed from the walls and tainted this place. The facade of The Fair Lady, to which her mask and her companion Singed&#039;s shield bore their resemblance, lay shattered behind the pulpit after apparently being torn from it&#039;s mounting.\n\nKayle took her first few steps into the room, moving carefully between the pews.\n\nThen she heard it. The scratching inside of her mind. The darkness crept closer, surrounding her, choking her.\n\nImpossible. It wasn&#039;t supposed to be aggressive. It was supposed to be-\n\n&quot;DARKNESSssss&quot;, the voice in the shadows whispered. &quot;All alone....&quot;\n\nShe felt it without seeing it. A lunge from the corner of the room, moving faster than she could see without being cloaked in shadows. The sound of breaking glass. With barely any time to react, she summoned her energy and deployed Her Lady&#039;s Grace. The golden shield erected just in time. A wicked blade hung in the air, just a breathe away from her mask, caught in the holy barrier. The creature had changed since the reports. Attached to it&#039;s arms were two wicked killing tools resembling swords. It was now totally devoid of it&#039;s humanity as it&#039;s melted, black skin clung to the blades.\n\nShe could feel it&#039;s eyes peeling her skin off beneath the darkness of it&#039;s cloak. Would the barrier hold? She needed help.\n\n&quot;He- ..&quot;, she began to shout, but all too late.\n\nAs the darkness the Heretic controlled faded, the scene unveiled itself. The breaking glass she had heard earlier was, in fact, her allies storming into the room. Singed had knocked open his casket and was running toward her, bottles of a thick, gluey substance shattering on the ground behind him. As he reached the heretic, he wrapped his arms around it&#039;s waist and threw it with all of his might, ripping the blade from it&#039;s arm with a foul tear and launching it into the glue behind him.\n\nPSHH. The sound of more glass shattering. This time, Twitch had hurled a flask of his own. It cracked open on the floor next to the Heretic. Perhaps the reaction of the last of it&#039;s humanity, it gasped in fear and surprise, the noxious green gas clearly being drawn into it&#039;s hood. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack. Three bolts, one in each arm and one in the gut, and it was pinned in place.\n\nKayle had drastically underestimated the skills of her allies.\n\nThe barrier faded and the blade that once hung in the air dropped onto the floor with a clank, foul blackened flesh still clinging to it and twitching.\n\nKayle drew her sword and walked toward the creature, crippled and writhing in pain on the ground. She could swear it was begging, but such a creature was beyond mercy. She lifted her blade into the air.\n\n&quot;Wait...&quot;, Singed uttered a single word.\n\nKayle was suprised. She had never heard him so much as breathe and assumed he was mute. She let her sword arm fall to her side and peered at his eyes through his mask. She could see the agony in those windows to his soul.\n\n&quot;He... It was my son. The Inquisitors failed to kill him in the flames. He fed on the flesh of his mother and sister and gained the power to slip away. I saw the bite marks in their flesh when I went into the flames. I... always knew. Somehow. That&#039;s why I joined the church as an Agent&quot;, the once silent doctor poured his soul out in that dusty, empty church.\n\n&quot;So please...&quot;, he continued. &quot;Let me do it. I brought him into the world. It&#039;s only appropriate that I see him out&quot;.\n\nKayle let her sword hang for a moment before returning it to it&#039;s sheathe. She could offer a prayer and release the soul regardless of if she actually killed it herself and she knew the such. The church simply often had the Inquisitors do it out of procedure.\n\nSinged approached the crippled creature and brought his face right down to it&#039;s own, seeming to stare into it&#039;s eyes. He then stood up and lifted his iron boot into the air.\n\n&quot;D-daddy?...&quot;, the creature croaked in a small child&#039;s voice.\n\n&quot;Keep his voice from your mouth, creature&quot;, he stated coldly, bringing his heavy boot down with a thud and a crunch.\n\n---------------------------\n\nAAAANNNDDD done. 1506 words. I might try to trim out some stuff before the final submission.
