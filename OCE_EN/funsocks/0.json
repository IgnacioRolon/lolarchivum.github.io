Uhuhuhuhu...&quot;\r\n\r\nThe laughter.\r\n\r\nEchoing around.\r\n\r\nHaunting us.\r\n\r\nDoes it even sleep?\r\n\r\nHow long have we been running?\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t even know anymore.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I know is the moisture in my boots and stench of sewerage.\r\n\r\nAnd if I end up like Johrum, that&#039;s all I&#039;ll be.\r\n\r\n&quot;Sir...&quot;\r\n\r\nOne of the recruits tore me from my wandering thoughts.\r\n\r\nWe&#039;d stopped for a rest. A moment&#039;s reprieve. But it hounded us endlessly, laughing the whole time. Like this was some kind of game of tag.\r\n\r\n&quot;Tch...&quot;\r\n\r\nI clicked my tongue and then sighed heavily. No matter which way I looked at it, we were lost. Going back the way we had come was pointless when we were running from that... Thing.\r\n\r\n&quot;Alright lads. In formation. We&#039;ve rested enough. Let&#039;s get out this hole&quot;\r\n\r\nThe recruits groaned and gathered their belongings. We had stopped for an hour at most before I felt the animousity fall on me again. Call it soldier&#039;s intuition. It was moving in for a kill.\r\n\r\n&quot;We can&#039;t. It&#039;s still out there. It&#039;ll get us all. We&#039;re doomed&quot;\r\n\r\nAs I thought, Johrim was going mad.\r\n\r\nWatching his brother die like that couldn&#039;t have been easy.\r\n\r\nHe even dragged him for the first few hours, vomiting and then eventually dead.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to convince him to leave the body, but it was taking too much energy to move Johrum, the brute of a man that he was. That was at least a day ago. How Johrim even managed to carry him as far as he did is a testament to his strength, but...\r\n\r\nOne of the other recruits stepped in to comfort him, but I blocked the lad with my sword and shook my head.\r\n\r\n&quot;Leave him. His mind&#039;s gone&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;But sir...&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Do you want to make it out here alive, recruit?&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I do, sir, but..&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Then let&#039;s move&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd so we left Yohrim. Sobbing alone in the darkness, in that room that would become his tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd no one even turned their heads when we heard the screams.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nWe carried on for several hours, feeling through the dark. We rounded a final corner and saw it.\r\n\r\nA shaft of light reaching down from above.\r\n\r\nThis &quot;routine&quot; patrol of the sewers was finally coming to a close, and I could return with a full company of knights to deal with this creature.\r\n\r\nBut as the recruits rushed toward the light in the desperation and relief, my gut sank.\r\n\r\nI knew something was off. It wouldn&#039;t hunt us for so long and just let us go.\r\n\r\nThe recruit scrambling in front froze in his tracks. Everyone looked at him, standing, frozen. Then they looked to his outstretched hand, which had fallen upon an object. A large, leathery lump.\r\n\r\n&quot;Oh! Hello!&quot;\r\n\r\nI finally got a good look at it. It was... A giant rat.\r\n\r\nA thick, serpentine tounge whipped off it&#039;s teeth as it struggled to fit human words into it&#039;s maw. Fluorescent green fluid dripped from it&#039;s mouth and hissed as it burned the ground it touched.\r\n\r\nThen, deftly, it planted a small, sharp object into the recruit. He stumbled backward in shock. The moment was still setting in for everyone, myself included.\r\n\r\n&quot;You&#039;re looking a little green...&quot;, the rat said.\r\n\r\nHis head Twitched about as he looked into the eyes of his victim for some time before drawing a small flask from his trench coat pocket. Snapping it with his thumb, a light green gas escaped. The wound on the recruit&#039;s leg began to bubble and the lad keeled over throwing up. Just like Johrum. The second flask must react to the venom somehow.\r\n\r\n&quot;Formatio-&quot;\r\n\r\nAs I began bellowing to the men to take formation, the rat reached down and picked up a handful of... Shadow? Then pulling it over it&#039;s head like a cloak, it dissipated into darkness.\r\n\r\n&quot;Damn! Where is it-?&quot;\r\n\r\nChaos. A frenzy. The recruits had all now recovered from their shock. They scrambled over one another to retreat from where the creature was, straight toward me.\r\n\r\nBut that didn&#039;t save them from a beast that is one with the shadows.\r\n\r\nI saw fountains of blood emerge from nothing.\r\n\r\nThat sound still plays in my mind.\r\n\r\nTsssssssthWACK. The sound of a crossbow bolt slicing through the air and landing in the backs of the men I was charged with protecting.\r\n\r\nAnd that shaft of light. One of the last things I saw. Will ever see. That glorious moment when we thought salvation was near. And yet, the final image that will haunt me.\r\n\r\nWhen it had massacred all my men, it fell on me. I didn&#039;t even have time to think of a way to fight it. Me. A &quot;seasoned&quot; knight.\r\n\r\nIt deftly hurled a flask of poisonous gas with it&#039;s thick, leathery tail. The flask shattered on the ground at my feet. I immediately felt sick. My vision went blurry and I couldn&#039;t breathe. I saw it&#039;s Twitching face emerge from the darkness, as though it was materializing from a nightmare into reality.\r\n\r\nBut it left me.\r\n\r\nIt went about scavenging from my men. With a bloodied pair of pliers, it went about removing... parts from the men that it liked.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ohhh... hoohoo... Lovely molars, lovely molars. Let Twitch have them. You won&#039;t be nee-&quot;, he began, pushing the plier&#039;s into the corpses&#039; mouth and deftly removing a tooth. &quot;-eeding them anymore. Ehee&quot;. He continued, filling various jars with various parts, taking the time to label everything as he went about his work.\r\n\r\nI watched for what seemed like an eternity. I couldn&#039;t move. The poison racked my nerves and my body was paralyzed. I struggled just to keep from inhaling the sewerage water. When he was finally done, his beady little eyes fell upon me.\r\n\r\nDread. My heart sank. Was this the end?\r\n\r\nI would later learn that this was simply one of his &quot;calling cards&quot;.\r\n\r\nHe would always leave a victim to tell the tale. Although he would leave them... Lesser.\r\n\r\nI awoke in darkness. Perhaps it were truly darkness. I would have known if I had eyes. Massive jolts of pain shot up my leg, which had been melted away below the knee. My left hand was mutilated beyond repair. I simply crawled, trying to escape on pure instinct. I crawled over the bodies of my men. I didn&#039;t need eyes to know.. To feel that they had been tampered with. I simply kept crawling based off my intuition. Sliding slowly in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThe moment I tasted fresh air, I screamed with all my energy and collapsed.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re reading this, I urge you. If you&#039;re in a hole on Runeterra, be wary. If you hear laughter in the darkness or see the shadows twitching, return from whence you came. If you&#039;re patrolling the sewers, never lose your way. Never forget your exit plan. \r\n\r\nThere is something out there in the dark that haunts the nightmares of the creatures of the void, themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Gotta hurry! Gotta hurry!&quot;, the eldritch abomination repeated to itself. &quot;Grab the things, time to move. They&#039;re onto you. They&#039;re onto you. They&#039;ll be sneaking around before too long&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe nasal mutterings collided on the thick stone walls, echoing until their own demise.\r\n\r\n&quot;One of these, some of that, a little of those.. I hate being a pack rat&quot;, the figure froze suddenly and sniffed the air. &quot;Ahh!&quot;, he suddenly exclaimed before continuing his scurrying.\r\n\r\nA ramshackle lean-to propped against a wall, hiding a small collection of valuables from plain sight, tucked away in a nook in the path. The creature was desperately digging through piles of &quot;Junk&quot; to find what it needed.\r\n\r\nRifling through a pile of books, it flicked many aside and took only the few it could carry. T̶h̶e̶ ̶P̶r̶i̶n̶c̶e̶  Twitɔh and the Princess, How to love a S̶o̶l̶d̶i̶e̶r Twitɔh and True Love (All edited in Crayon).\r\n\r\nWhen it finally had a pack together, it sniffed the air once more before darting off into the darkness, cloaked in a mantle of shadow. Where it went was anyone&#039;s guess, because for one who is complete with darkness, the world is truly their oyster. Another town would soon meet the horror. Another town would bury evidence and burn the dead to avoid panic, or blame it on a plague or epidemic, another town wou-\r\n\r\n&quot;WAIT!&quot;\r\n\r\nTwitch scurried back to the lean-to and shoved a rock aside, revealing a mouldy hunk of cheese.\r\n\r\n&quot;Sneaking around really works up your appetite&quot;, he snarfed the cheese down before dissapearing once more into darkness.\r\n\r\n....\r\n\r\nAnother town would meet the horror that is Twitch.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Author: {{champion:29}}\r\n\r\nTwitch. The giant, contemptible rat who probably just wants to be loved.\r\n\r\nThis story references Twitch&#039;s character, the bio written in his &quot;Lore&quot; tab and his in-game speech.\r\n\r\nFeel free to let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"EnemyTurns","date":"2016-09-23T01:39:58.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**That was the coolest thing I have ever read. **","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2016-09-23T02:44:58.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers man.\n\nI'm glad to have made it to the top ten.

Really well written, engaging, and I think the subtle aspects of your characterisation of Twitch (like books that were altered) made this a uniquely enjoyable contribution.

Fwahaha.\n\nThanks a lot! :D I really appreciate your input.\n\nThere isn't an awful amount of lore on Twitch, but I decided to make a few assumptions, such as the fact that he was somewhat \"One of a kind\" and there wasn't an entire race of giant rat people. I mean except Yordles :^) This made it a lot easier to connect the dots with Twitch's lore that riot has written, such as his editing of books with crayons. I tried to reference the actual in-game lore page as much as I could, as well as his spoken lines in-game and his actual character moveset, like one vial making his venom fester.\n\nI'm kind of dissapointed I didn't manage to work \"Oot doot doo. Oot dootdoot doot doot doo doo, doodoodoodoodoo doo!\" into the story, but it seems like the sort of thing he would say while stalking his prey to terrify them with silliness, and I wanted to keep the actual threat somewhat of a mystery in the writing until it was time for him to emerge, as I think it lent more impact to his appearance.\n\nI'm glad you enjoyed it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T06:10:32.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was pretty unnerving and you made Twitch into quite the monster (as he is in the game). I'm quite speechless at the horror unleashed, testament to your skill of creating an Alien-esque atmosphere and dread. When the action comes, it's explosive. \n\nThere's a formatting issue where your \"its\" are now \"it's\", but that's like super minor in this well-crafted piece. \n\nThanks for sharing!","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2016-09-20T19:08:31.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late response!\n\nThanks for the input.\n\nI'm not terribly competent at editing my own work. I try to tell a story when I write, and going back over the story somewhat feels like I'm saying what's already been said, if that makes sense? Either way, I'll certainly try to keep an eye on it in future works.\n\nThanks for reading it :)","replies":[]}]}]}
