If you haven't already checked out part one, have a look through the boards. Let me know what you think in the comments :) I also mentioned twelve star guardians at the end. I'm leaving the final star guardian (ten original, Taric, and ???) open for the reader's own creation to become a part of the story's lore. Maybe if _**YOU**_  wish upon The First Star, your wish will be granted, too.\n\nDocument has been edited to include the new Star Guardians. One of my choices for a Star Guardian was Soraka so that didn't end up too well. If there's any error in numbers, that's why. Perhaps Sol, himself, would have made a good second choice :) This story existed long before the contest, and I tried to chop it up to make it fit. I hope everything is in order. Every time I read it I spot something wrong so I'm just gonna leave it alone now.\n\nI wasn&#039;t sure if this was allowed within the rules but I see nothing regarding multiple submissions or sequels, so I hope this is okay.  Also, if the story places, I only want a single prize. This is simply for impact. Without any further adieu...\n\n----------------\n\nSo how did we get to where we are now?\n\nWell, it&#039;s a bittersweet tale.\n\nOur heroes arrived quickly at Mount Targon, driven into a fervor of battle by their previous victories and the bolstering of their ranks.\n\n(And of course Jinx gets a mvspd buff when she blows something up and Janna gives passive speed to allies)\n\nThey looked down on the massive mountain with awe. It stood stalwart, like the earth itself stood to greet them.\n\n&quot;How do we take down a mountain...&quot;, Janna almost silently lamented.\n\n&quot;LOTS. OF. ROCKETS. AHA HA HA HA! KURO!&quot;, Jinx tore through the skies toward the mountain, Shiro in tow, firing a barrage of destruction in each direction she faced.\n\n&quot;I don&#039;t think she understands the gravity of the situation...&quot;, Syndra muttered.\n\nAhri chuckled. &quot;You didn&#039;t just... Oh sweetie....&quot;.\n\nThe rest of the party looked on with a mix of amusement and disgust.\n\n(Puns aside)\n\nThe party turned to the First Star.\n\n&quot;The mountain, it had a weakness...&quot;, She began. &quot;And after all this time, I finally understand...&quot;.\n\nThere was silence.\n\n&quot;Master Taric, if you will...&quot;, she beckoned.\n\nTaric broke away from the circle and hovered in front of the First Star. &quot;Anything for you my dear. You are fabulous. Outrageous even.&quot;.\n\n&quot;The mountain... A vein of crystals runs inside of it. A crack in the earth. Master Taric, please use your crystal magic to shatter the mountain...&quot;, the First Star begged.\n\n&quot;Hmmm... It can be arranged, but first, I&#039;ll need vibrations at a certain frequency...&quot;, He began.\n\nEzreal pointed at Jinx&#039;s reign of destruction. &quot;Like that kind of vibration?&quot;\n\n&quot;You know, that just might...&quot;, the crystals orbiting Taric vibrated and resonated with Jinx&#039;s path of destruction. &quot;It&#039;s... Perfect...&quot;.\n\nThey all turned to the first star, who simply smiled.\n\n&quot;Then, I&#039;ll need all of your strength to assist me&quot;, Taric called upon his friends.\n\nEveryone&#039;s hand fell upon the handle of Taric&#039;s hammer. Poppy placed her own alongside and everyone held tight.\n\nAnd like that, nine shooting stars crashed into the mountain, guided on their path by the First Star.\n\n----------------\n\n&quot;Finally... Free....&quot;, a voice boomed through the dust and debris as Aurelion Sol rose from his prison.\n\nEven Jinx&#039;s wanton path of destruction had ceased and all eyes fell upon the great dragon.\n\nThe First Star flew up and embraced her friend&#039;s face within her hand. It felt like so long.\n\n&quot;Is that... Number one? But you... You have a form...&quot;, The dragon sputtered.\n\nThe First Star laughed warmly. &quot;Yes, my dear friend. A lot has changed since you&#039;ve been sleeping beneath the rocks. These are the warriors who helped to free me\", she said, motioning.\n\nThe star guardians flew up to meet the great dragon...\n\n... who gave them a cold glance and all but ignored them, turning back to his friend.\n\n&quot;Tell me. Are any of them Starcallers?&quot;, Sol enquired.\n\n&quot;S-star callers Sol? You want to... You want to bring down the stars?&quot;, The First Star asked carefully.\n\n&quot;My friend, I would bring down the cosmos to reduce this mountain to dust...&quot;, Aurelion looked on the half-destroyed mountain with a burning spite.\n\n&quot;Very well... Star guardian Soraka...&quot;, A figure appeared beside the First Star once more.\n\nThe Tenth hour had come.\n\n&quot;Obliterate it...&quot;, Sol said coldly.\n\n&quot;My lord...&quot;, Soraka replied, beginning the incantation.\n\nThe First Star gave a silent prayer for her sisters who were set to fall and soonafter, the mountain was turned to sand, the stars themselves the architect of it&#039;s demise.\n\nAurelion Sol... Had changed.\n\n&quot;What of the Star Guardians my friend?&quot;, The First Star asked.\n\n&quot;It matters not. Soon, they will all worship me...&quot;, Sol replied bitterly.\n\n----------------\n\nPerhaps the First Star created this all. When she drove away the chaos, she created the need for order, and within order exists both good and evil. Evil is not dormant only in the chaos and the void in which it was sealed. Aurelion Sol, the Celestial dragon. Although he creates, he can only resemble the universe he has created. He is both his own architect, and the architect of us all.\n\nAs for the Star Guardians...\n\nWhat started out as a measly mob has grown into an impressive fighting force, twelve members strong.\n\nMore people wish upon the First Star each day that they, too, might one day rise to the occasion and help protect the stars from being extinguished.\n\nAurelion goes about crafting, as he always has, but occassionally sends a tiny sliver of himself to Runeterra to participate in a strange combat sport, a League of Legends.\n\nAnd the Star Guardians...\n\nThe Star Guardians are in the sky. Gliding through the Cosmos with the First Star, who still believes in the good in the heart of her oldest friend.\n\nHe would just need time to heal...\n\nTHE END","replies":[]}
