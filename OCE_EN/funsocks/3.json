Click click.\n\n&quot;Hmmm... That&#039;s not it either. This would be so much easier if I had some light...&quot;\n\nA voice echoes through the absolute void.\n\nFlickers of a flint flash in nothingness.\n\nUntil eventually...\n\n&quot;Ahhh! Now we&#039;re playing with starfire!&quot;, the voice boomed. &quot;Wait, was that... It couldn&#039;t have been&quot;.\n\nAnd from the darkness, the First Star was born, forged in an empty canvas to paint a sky not yet born.\n\nIt started as a flicker. Then a flame. An unknown force in the darkness fuelled it, nurtured it. Until at last, the First Star was fully grown.\n\nBut in the darkness, another ingredient was added. Something not meant for stars.\n\nThe Cosmic Dragon, Aurelion Sol, had given the first star a soul.\n\nAnd so they spoke.\n\nAurelion of his journey across the cosmos, painting the darkness with stars.\n\nAnd the first start of her children, the small bodies of material that began to orbit her.\n\nThis continued for eons as Sol went about his work tirelessly. Forming. Shaping. Creating.\n\n--------------\n\n&quot;Something the matter, Sol?&quot;, the first star inquired. Her friend was unusually quiet.\n\n&quot;No, just a bothersome star. It flickers and stutters in the most irritating of ways. I&#039;ve tried to repair it so many times to no avail&quot;, Sol let out a sigh.\n\n&quot;Perhaps, my dear friend, it has to do with her children? The pups on one of her children... They begin to harness magic&quot;\n\n&quot;Hmmm... Perhaps they interfere with my work. I shall have to pay a visit to this place..&quot;\n\n&quot;The star&#039;s name is Rune. She&#039;s a calm and quiet star&quot;\n\n&quot;Rune... Then off to Rune&#039;s Terra I go&quot;\n\nAurelion snaked off into the abyss toward Rune.\n\nBeing unable to move, it was always a bother for The First Star to see her beloved friend leave.\n\nBut each time, he would return, a grin on his face and a new star born.\n\nThis time...\n\nSomething felt wrong.\n\n&quot;Sol...&quot;, The first star whispered into the nothingness. &quot;Take care....&quot;\n\n--------------\n\n&quot;AHAHAHAHAHAH!! TAKE THAT! ANNNND THAT!&quot;, a maniac&#039;s laugh amidst chaos.\n\nRockets flew in one direction. Glitter the other. Sparkles launched upward. Bullets tore apart the ground.\n\nJinx reveled in the chaos.\n\n&quot;She enjoys this far too much...&quot;, Janna noted to her Yordle companions Lulu and Poppy.\n\n&quot;Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, Janna&quot;, Poppy stated matter-of-factly.\n\n&quot;Should we help her Pix?&quot;, Lulu asked her companion. Pix remained unmoving.\n\n&quot;We would probably just get in her way...&quot;, Poppy responded.\n\nAnd so they left their fearless leader to her devices.\n\nBefore long, the darkness that had plagued this world and threatened it&#039;s star was abated.\n\nThe First Star&#039;s avatar descended from above, landing weightlessly on her toes and smiling.\n\n&quot;Well done, everyone&quot;, she stated warmly. &quot;The stars are safe once more&quot;.\n\n&quot;Why are we doing all of this anyway?&quot;, Jinx asked.\n\n&quot;Because we don&#039;t know when the father of the stars will return. Until then, we must strive to stop as many from burning out as we can...&quot;\n\n&quot;But we don&#039;t even KNOW where he IS. How is this helping?&quot;, Jinx continued to complain.\n\nThe first star had no response, but for a sad look of longing. She truly missed her friend.\n\n&quot;In the beginning, there was nothingness. Absolute and pure. And from it, the Celestial Dragon crafted the stars. He and I were very close. He was my father. My friend... Something more. He left for Runeterra hundreds of years ago and hasn&#039;t returned...&quot;, a tear ran down the first star&#039;s cheek.\n\n&quot;For so long, I was lost. I waited. In the darkness. Nothing changed. So I decided to call out to him. I shone as brightly and as far as I could... And that&#039;s when I saw it. The chaos. The disorder. I would never find him. Using my light... I banished the chaos. In doing so, I lost most of my power&quot;, the first star recalled her tale for the ten Star Guardians who had gathered to her cause.\n\nEveryone was silent, lost in the memories of their own loved ones.\n\n&quot;So you see, sweet Jinx&quot;, the first star said, reaching out and caressing her face. &quot;We must maintain the order for when he returns. It will be soon&quot;.\n\n&quot;What do you know that you&#039;re not telling us? You know he&#039;s on Runeterra. Let&#039;s go get him&quot;, Ezreal stated plainly, his heart of adventure calling.\n\n&quot;Then now is the perfect time...&quot;, the First Star responded.  &quot;...to meet our newest member&quot;.\n\nThe star guardians looked to each other. Each were curious. As though to answer them, a figure began to appear by the first star.\n\n&quot;Who.. Is that?&quot;, several voices asked at once.\n\nLong brown hair hung over a powerful jaw. A solid frame draped in finery. A hammer clenched in a powerful hand.\n\n&quot;Oh my...&quot;, the voice stated. &quot;This place is simply... fabulous&quot;.\n\n&quot;Allow me to introduce, Star Guardian Taric, the man who will one day crumble the stone piled on my dear friend&#039;s back. This man... Will defeat the mountain&quot;.\n\nAnd so the Star Guardian&#039;s greatest mission began.\n\nTo protect the stars, they would need to free Sol.\n\nWith the power granted to them by love and friendship, and the talents of their newest member...\n\nThey would break the mountain.","replies":[]}
