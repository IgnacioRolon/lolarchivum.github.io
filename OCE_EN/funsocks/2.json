Why isn&#039;t there the option to leave a lobby without dodging? For example, I&#039;m playing ranked. I&#039;ve played 10 games in a row. I choose Adc/Fill because I&#039;m a friendly player. On the 10th game, I FINALLY get my primary role, only to have the person who&#039;s playing with me pick something totally wrong. Ezreal support when they team is all gap closers. Or my favourite, simply an instalocker and role bully. I don&#039;t want to deal with that while I&#039;m climbing the ranks. It has never been as pertinent as my trying to make it to gold division at the end of this season. This isn&#039;t a complaint about people holding me back ala typical bronze life. It&#039;s about the fact that I don&#039;t want to sit down and play the game because of their behavior. I play fill anyway. I would be happy to swap positions in most situations, but if I get a role, I shouldn&#039;t be OBLIGED to.\r\n\r\nHow do I deal with that? I try to dodge, but I&#039;m frequently given 30 minute bans and can barely ever play the game I so thoroughly enjoy because of the behavior of other people. There is no way to leave the game in peace. Why not have some sort of counter for &quot;Trolls&quot;? 3 dodges in quick succession and you get a ban. People like me will wait an extra minute or two so we don&#039;t get in the same lobby anyway. The current system is literally designed so passive aggressive assholes can get away with whatever they want. There is no &quot;Lobby report&quot; button. I would be HAPPY to play the game around them if riot would review lobby behavior. Is there a way within the current report system to ask riot to review the player&#039;s behavior in the lobby? If so, I would be happy to play the game and simply report them.\r\n\r\nNo one in the community likes instalockers. No one enjoys playing ranked as ADC only to get someone play as Support Garen and flat out refuses to help you remotely and W&#039;s into your creep waves. If you were playing soccer and the goalkeeper took the ball, ran it down the other field to the other team&#039;s goal, tried to shoot then was too exhausted to get back to his own goal in time, the whole team would tear him up. He would be kicked off the team. What are my options regarding this behavior? As I write this, I&#039;m waiting for a ban to pass so I can actually play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-19T05:41:32.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"instalockers / role thieves : play another lane, troll, or dodge. One of these will result in zero penalty to you. Your choice.\nbad picks: not your place to say. That said, 3 marksmen (top, jg, adc) in a team is never good. Just make peace with it if someone cant see the importance of team comps and try play around it.","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2017-11-20T03:17:19.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't want to troll and other lanes aren't always willing. I don't think you fix a pile of shit by shitting on it. Other than that, I already DO dodge. I spend 90% of my time in the client waiting for my bans to pass. There is a penalty for dodging. It starts at 5 minutes and goes up to 30 minute bans.\n\nNo matter what, I will never in a million years be supported by an Ezreal, I don't care how many times Nerfplz says it's \"OP\". It's fucking trash. The argument for using him is \"Hurr durr he pokes\". Lots of supports poke. Most of them heal at the same time. Or shield. Or CC. Or do ANYTHING useful to me in lane. And most of them don't E out of the way of skillshots so I cop them in the face while farming. I can understand some picks. MF support with comet into Zyra will control the lane and cause serious harm in a teamfight. Some things I just won't put up with, and most of it is based around a support having their head stuck up their ass and thinking they're going to \"carry\" me.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-20T06:07:57.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean support is viable.","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2018-01-02T08:11:52.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't know Zilean is viable anywhere else. He had a short tenure in midlane when the AP and Assassin updates rolled out and he found a unique place in that meta, but that was addressed by riot in the following major patch and he quickly fell of after that and isn't even listed as a midlaner anymore, from my knowledge. Sure, he can do it. So can Lulu and Karma. It doesn't mean that's where they're most suited unless your team has a specific strategy in mind that revolves around that, such as how Faker often plays a support in the midlane when control effects are a more pertinent issue. This doesn't mean you should do it because Faker did it, just an example of someone who's very good doing it as an adaptive strategy, not a rule. It also doesn't mean that if you're playing Zilean, you should assume you're going to carry the lane. Don't throw your stun out when the enemy obviously has a chance to hard engage. Easy. If you can land a solid engage, go for it, but don't lean on gronk tactics that worked on that bronze guy once. It's not smart strategy.\n\nI don't mind Zilean support at all. I dislike Ezreal support because someone ranked platinum tried it once when they were smurfing or some retard youtuber did it on a video. I don't care what Nightblue or whatever did. You don't get to that level by copying what he does. You get to that level by understanding the game, the strength, weaknesses and limitations of your champions and by working with your teammates to make something happen. Some troll tactic that throws people who aren't ready for it off balance a little bit isn't an indication that it's good at all, especially if you pick Ezreal support into a hard engage like Leona then blame your ADC for dying to flash all-ins when you have no capacity to help them whatsoever, and that's my point. Helping the adc is your job there. Not poking. Not healing. Not any of the individual aspects of your character. Helping the adc make it through laning phase is your role.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-02T10:10:28.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zilean support offers zoning damage, slow/speedup, a stun, a revive and basically everything a velkoz, brand, xerath or zyra support can and more (although less damage and higher mana consumption). Zilean fell out of popularity in the old ardent censer metas, but otherwise is very strong and will be very useful in the current fighting tank support meta. The reason a vayne-zilean combo is so terrifying isn't actually the revive, it's the movespeed+slow combo, and the fact that he makes early towerdiving very pitched in his team's favour.\n\nAlso Zilean still remains a viable midlane pick, with strong early-midgame, amazing roam (the reason faker liked zilean is how quickly he gets around the map), and high synergy with hypercarries due to the movespeed and revive. In higher elo right now, Zilean has the 2nd highest winrate among midlaners, and is incredibly powerful when he can be used to close out a game in less than 30min, due to his incredibly strong midgame powerspike and the fact that he counters many of the most picked midlaners such as Zed, Azir, Malzahar, Orianna, Fizz, Kassadin, Zoe, Ahri, Ryze, Veigar, ect...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2017-11-19T05:20:01.238+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: An early /ff option in the lobby could work also. You could simply state; \"I can't play this game, can we just go back to lobby?\" and instead of everyone having to panic to think who has the lowest ban timer, the whole team can just agree to return to lobby. It won't affect pro league players. If they dodge after the bans, that's an automatic loss because it's obvious they're cheating.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2017-11-19T09:49:38.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Climb up  playing  your best Champs, and less likely to see those players.","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2018-01-02T08:26:34.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're playing an eSport.

So you got to diamond as a Riven one-trick, and that's awesome, but what happens if Riven gets banned? What happens if the opponent picks a hard counter, you're already at the top-tier of players so there no way you're going to be remarkably more skilled than them? What happens if the entire enemy team has CC and a strong front line? You're already platinum so you can't then practice champs and roles you don't know or you will get stomped. I think it's fine if you're a career smurf, but I want to improve, not just climb ranks and sell the account.\n\nTo me, it's less about climbing and more about learning and improving your skills and broadening strategic horizons and unfortunately, large sections of the community disagree. I think that's embarrassing for our demographic, considering it's a strategy game. It's not a one trick game. It's a careful manipulation of other player's psychology using the pawns and pieces available on the board.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-24T10:14:34.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bud a good trick is to have one friend play with you i am a support main and can tell you that i dont really dodge only in gold but most the time i can win even with a troll or two ....\nand i get it man but maybe he is really good with that champ \nalso remember the enemy have the same chance of getting this.\nplus you gotta think  wont people abuse something like that so they dont have to vs a hard team comp?","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2018-01-02T08:17:11.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be fair, I have a remarkable amount of success when I find a support main who's play style meshes with my own, and I don't disagree with you at all.
