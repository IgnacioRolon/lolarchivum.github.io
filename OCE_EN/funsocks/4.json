Funsocks here. I&#039;ve had this story on the backburner for some time, but I can&#039;t imagine there will be a fanfic contest where I&#039;ll be able to use it. Riot are also constantly changing the lore of characters (like the Urgot rework that made my Urgot meets Kindred story redundant, since he wasn&#039;t raised by Technomancers in his current iteration), so I thought I would at least publish it while the two character&#039;s lore is still relevant to the story. Without any further ado, I present &quot;Shadow Bear, Shadow Rat&quot;. Feel free to let me know what you think.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Oot doot doo, dooot doo doo&quot;, a maniacal tune echoed through the darkness of the forest, mouthed by a shadowy figure.\n\nThe voices of several men barked out as they made pursuit.\n\n&quot;Gotta move, gotta move, they&#039;ll take it back. But I licked it. It&#039;s MY headbucket&quot;, the rat muttered, grasping his claimed Noxian helmet, stuffed full of loot, to his chest.\n\nOne by one, the voices faded, as the pounding of the rat&#039;s boots tore across the forest floor, still not breaking a single twig out of habit if nothing else.\n\nHe lifted his nose to the air and sniffed furiously, ears flickering about to catch any sound.\n\nSilence.\n\nThe rat lowered his pace to a trot and eventually a stroll.\n\nHe knew these woods like the back of his hand, often using them to evade pursuit. The dark, perverse nature of the woods and the abundance of savage Shadow Bears kept most humans at bay.\n\nBut what is a Shadow Bear to a Shadow Rat?\n\nLarge, slow, stupid and loud.\n\nTwitch arrived at his destination, a small lake approaching the heart of the forest.\n\n&quot;Mmm... Stop for juice. Thirsty thirst&quot;, Twitch muttered, lowering his maw to the water.\n\n&quot;Ugh! Clear...&quot;, he sniffed about until he found a mossy patch of water and began drinking the fluid tainted green, lapping handfulls of the mosswater from the cupped shape in his thin, clawed hands.\n\nThen he heard it.\n\nJust a whisper. A slight sound.\n\nOn the far edge of the lake, a small figure sat.\n\nWeeping.\n\nThough all of his instincts begged against it, Twitch couldn&#039;t fight the allure.\n\nThere was a positive darkness emanating from the shape.\n\nIn this clearing, with the sun beating down from above, the rat who dances with the shadows had found some utter darkness.\n\nHe approached the shape carefully, until he could see the shape clearly.\n\n&quot;Hmm... Small human. Small humans cannot carry many things...&quot;, despite that, the allure of the darkness even overran any logic the creature may possess.\n\nHe was enchanted.\n\nHe gently padded all the way up to the sobbing figure until he was close enough to touch it, reaching out with a thin finger to poke it.\n\nTSSSSSSSS\n\nThe rat recoiled as his hand burned, the air around the figure hotter than a flame.\n\nImmediately, the figure&#039;s head snapped up.\n\nA being possessed. Flames poured from the little girl&#039;s eyes, nose and mouth, liquid fire oozing onto the ground and blackening all in it&#039;s wake.\n\nThose hellish eyes fell upon Twitch.\n\n&quot;Urk...&quot;, Twitch knew danger. He could sense it. Smell it. Feel it. Was this the end?\n\nHe quickly rifled through the Noxian helmet and retrieved his treasure. A large block of stinky Noxian cheese. There was nothing like it, but infiltrating a Noxian camp to retrieve such luxuries was not to be taken lightly, and even Twitch knew not to attempt to do so too often.\n\nStill. In a matter of life and death...\n\nHe held up the cheese, offering it to the figure. &quot;Cheese?&quot;, he said meekly.\n\nThe figure&#039;s eyes studied him. A bloodstained Noxian helmet. Obvious spoils.\n\nHe wasn&#039;t one of them.\n\nThe flames abated to reveal Annie&#039;s sniveling face. Tears flowed down her cheeks and mucus poured freely from her nose.\n\nIt was beautiful. Serene. The snot. The mess. Twitch was enchanted. At that moment, he was filled with something he had never felt before. A feeling so alien it warped his being.\n\nTwitch felt empathy. A twang in his chest as this creature&#039;s suffering resounded with him.\n\nThe two simply stood, studying each other, for some time.\n\nTwitch eventually broke the silence with a single word.\n\n&quot;Sad?&quot;.\n\nAnnie nodded.\n\n&quot;The bad men took Mummy, Daddy and Tibbers&quot;, she responded, wiping her face with the back of her hand.\n\nTwitch didn&#039;t know these words. This Mummy. Daddy. Tibbers. Perhaps the name of cheeses? The headbuckets had stolen her cheese, he concluded.\n\nHe tapped his thumb on his cheek in though for some time. Heading back to the Noxian camp was wrought with danger, of this Twitch knew too well. But this creature. It shared with him some of it&#039;s pain, and the weight was enormous.\n\nTwitch could hardly imagine such cheese.\n\n&quot;Yes! Twitch will &quot;hel-p!&quot;, he finally responded, mouthing a word he knew but rarely spoke.\n\nAnnie&#039;s face softened. Though she was also aware of the danger, she had to save her family.\n\nTwitch reached out with a jittery hand, to which Annie responded by placing her own in it. Then, hand in hand, the two walked back in the direction Twitch had run from.\n\n&quot;My name&#039;s Annie. What&#039;s your name?&quot;\n\nTwitch&#039;s head bobbed about a bit. &quot;Name? Hmmm...&quot;, he scratched his head, twitching about.\n\nAnnie giggled, a relief from the sadness. &quot;Then you can be called Twitchy&quot;.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nTwitch knew the habits of these men in chase. He had stalked and observed them many times. They followed strict, definite habits when searching. Of course, this was the result of rigorous Noxian military training, but to Twitch, it was simply repetitious and predictable behaviour. One by one, he hunted the members of the search party.\n\nScreams echoed off the trees as the men struggled to regroup to no avail. The few remaining survivors huddled together, back to back, weapons at the ready.\n\nBut the anger Twitch had gained through his empathy ensured it made no difference.\n\n&quot;Share THIS&quot;, he hollered, pulling the torsion bar on his crossbow back to allow maximum power and loading in his special skewery sticks, unloading a volley of powerful shots.\n\nPinned together, the men&#039;s faces turned green. Greenish yellow fluid erupted from their mouths and their eyes dissolved from the inside out.\n\nThere was not a moment when the search party stood a chance.\n\nHe nodded to Annie to follow in the shadows as the duo approached the Noxian camp, peering down from the edge of the forest.\n\nSeveral tents littered the camp as men went about various tasks. Cooking, cutting wood, sparring and equipment maintenance.\n\nIn the middle of the camp, several makeshift cages had been erected. Within them, two adult humans sat, lashed with magical bindings and rope.\n\nAnnie pointed.\n\n&quot;That&#039;s mummy and daddy...&quot;, Annie whispered.\n\nThings became more clear to &quot;Twitchy&quot;.\n\nHe was, of course, not totally ignorant of the machinations of human society, as he had observed it well, he simply lacked his own analogue.\n\nTwitch had always been alone. &quot;Born&quot; when a rat strayed too close to a Zaunish chemspill, Twitch had never known a family, but had a vague idea of the concept, and knew it&#039;s import to humans.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n&quot;Wait wait, I will do the sneakysneak&quot;, Twitch said reassuringly.\n\nHe reached down with his claw and grasped at a nearby shadow. It wrapped around his hand and it pulled upward, cloaking himself in darkness and disappearing from view.\n\nSome short time later, Annie saw him appear in the camp.\n\nHe sniffed about and avoided patrols, slowly working his way closer to the cages.\n\nThen Annie saw the figure.\n\nTwitch was ignorant to assume he was the only being who could employ stealth.\n\nNoxus, indeed, had it&#039;s own agents.\n\nTalon steadily approached Twitch from behind, who despite his keen sight and hearing, failed to detect the threat.\n\nA blade was raised and fell down upon Twitch.\n\n&quot;TWITCHY!&quot;, a voice hollered from the treeline.\n\nHis ears perked up, but it was too late.\n\nThe blade bit into his shoulder. Blood began to profusely flow, staining grey fur crimson.\n\n&quot;Urk...&quot;, Twitch sputtered, coughing up a mouthful of blood.\n\nHis vision began to fade.\n\n&quot;Hel-p&quot;. He had always been alone. That word. That small word would become his downfall.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\nThe air around Twitch&#039;s body began to writhe and stir. Flames sputtered to life around him. Talon leapt back to avoid the flames and took a ready position, scanning for the new assailant.\n\nA fireball tore through the air, the whipping sounds of flames screaming toward Talon. He was forced back yet again.\n\nAnnie emerged from the trees. Once again, flames poured from her eyes. Once again, she spewed liquid hellfire onto the ground. Her rage and darkness could be felt in the heart of Noxus itself.\n\nTalon was wary. He, of course, was aware of the threat of his prisoner&#039;s child.\n\nThe rat, however, he hadn&#039;t accounted for. Not that it was an issue now...\n\nHowever, when his eyes fell upon Twitch, he was already in the process of pouring some foul green substance onto the wound. Skin and flesh sizzled as the acidic substance burned the wound closed. Twitch winced at the fleeting pain, then turned his head slowly, a dead rage painted on his face.\n\nThe Darkness permeating from Annie resounded with Twitch. Like the Shadow Bear before him, the Shadow Rat had become enchanted by the young sorceress&#039; spell.\n\nDarkness courses through his veins, like some strength he had never felt before.\n\nHis muscles bulged. His figure changed. He began to grow larger.\n\n7 feet. 8 feet. 9 feet.\n\nTwitch grew larger and larger, veins protruding from tightly packed muscle. Flames began pouring from his eyes, mouth and nose, mirroring Annie&#039;s appearance. The thick, green fluid that dripped from his maw burned holes through grass and soil, leaving small pits in the ground. All the while, he remained cloaked in the flames.\n\n&quot;YAY! Twitchy!&quot;, Annie exclaimed.\n\n&quot;Tch...&quot;, Talon clicked his tongue. This trouble was beyond the gold they had paid him. As the rest of the camp arrived at the scene, Talon simply disappeared, returning to report to his masters.\n\nNone too soon.\n\nTwitch bellowed loudly, the roar more like that of a dragon.\n\nArmour rattled. Men scrambled over each other to try to flee.\n\nTwitch faded into the shadows as he fired his crossbow with one hand. When he approached a figure, he reached out with a bony paw, grasping at their heads, which immediately exploded into ash at his touch. Tents ignited as he passed. Equipment carts flew through the air as he swept them aside, all the while totally invisible and cloaked in air hot enough to melt the skin off a man.\n\nNot a single Noxian survived.\n\nThe duo panted as they realized their work was complete. Twitch slowly reverted to his former size and collapsed in an exhausted heap as Annie ran to where her parents were held.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nA heartfelt reunion was had as Annie released her parents. They embraced one another and cried.\n\nTwitch didn&#039;t understand the behavior. The touching and the crying. It was quite foreign to him. Feeling out of place and that his work was done, he turned and trotted off toward the forest.\n\n&quot;Twitchy?&quot;, Annie called. &quot;Don&#039;t you want to play?&quot;.\n\nIt didn&#039;t take more than a moment for Twitch to agree. He had become attached to this small human, in one way or another.\n\nHis ears flicked about and he turned his head to the edge of the forest. Two shadow bears looked on in silence.\n\nAnnie reached down and picked up the stuffed bear from the ground. She looked at it fondly and smiled, before tossing it into the air.\n\nIt&#039;s shape twisted and by the time it hit the ground, it was a fully formed shadow bear.\n\n&quot;That&#039;s your mummy and daddy too, isn&#039;t it Tibbers?&quot;, Annie asked.\n\nThe bear motioned it&#039;s head toward them and nodded.\n\n&quot;Don&#039;t worry. I have a new friend now. You should be with your family&quot;, Annie said. She was unable to mask the tears, but she nodded matter-of-factually.\n\nTibbers slowly trotted off to the other bears and nuzzled them, to which they responded in kind.\n\nHe turned his head back to Annie, who wore a smile to mask her tears.\n\n&quot;H-have fun Tibbers. We&#039;ll visit you soon, okay?&quot;, she said, waving enthusiastically.\n\nThe bear seemed to smile one last time to Annie, then the three creatures disappeared into the forest.\n\nAnnie stretched out her hands, taking her mother&#039;s hand and Twitch&#039;s paw. Her mother supported her father on the other side, who was beaten by the Noxian troops in captivity.\n\nThe four limped off North, toward their village outside of the Barrier. It would be a long, tired walk back to the Voodoo Lands.","replies":[{"poster":"Funsocks","date":"2018-02-02T05:54:38.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE ONE OF THEIR LORES","replies":[]}]}
