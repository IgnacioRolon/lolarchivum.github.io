I am writing this to ask if i can have my account back that was banned.  I understand the premise of which i was banned but being that i was banned a long time ago and have shown that i am able to perform at a more helpful and less toxic level I think this is enough to show that i have reformed and hope that i may get my account back.  This account has never received a ban which i am rather proud of due to my prior actions,  I believe i have reformed and hope that i may have my account return to me.  The summoner name of my other account was &quot;AdoIf HitIer&quot; (two capital i&#039;s instead of l&#039;s).
