Did you send in a support ticket?\n\nThe most likely cause for you to not receive your rewards was due to the reasons mentioned by Deep Terror Nami - if you missed out due to not meeting eligibility requirements.\n\nThat said - if you feel you did not receive them in error, you should get in touch with support!\n\nCheers,\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Brooth","date":"2016-01-20T06:02:49.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have emailed Riot's oce email and i have also added many rioters on lol, I have messaged the oce fb page.

There are a few ways to become ineligible or lose your rewards, so let's rule those out first. If we can confirm you didn't lose them for those reasons you should submit a [Support Ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Let me know as soon as you can.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Brooth","date":"2016-01-20T06:03:55.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't been ban for 6 months but i don't know about being reported","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-20T09:23:20.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply being reported doesn't matter.
