That means going negative is not an acceptable thing to you, CSing is high priority, Knowing when to go in and when to not, knowing when to roam and when to lane the list goes on but tl;dr the ranking system is fair and so is match making.\n\nIf you get a troll once in a while sure its annoying but its not the reason you're bronze 5.\n\n(Just like its not the reason im B2 on this account.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-02-17T01:30:54.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chill. A good and effective tribunal takes time to establish, which is why they are changing the old one (it didn't actually work well). \nAll you can do for now is report players, block them and move on. If you are finding ranked to toxic for you then go play normals until the new tribunal is rolled out.","replies":[]}]}
