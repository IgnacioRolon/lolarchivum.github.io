I have no problems playing well in normal games and usually have decent team mates but when it comes to promo games it seem i am stuck with at least one person that goes afk, feeds, trolls, rage quits or just has no idea how to play their role and or champion and the promo series is lost. So sick of this.\r\n\r\nYeah yeah, i know i am only b4, started b5 so most of you think i just suck anyway. just sick of being stuck with people that seemingly deliberately play bad when they know you are in promo games. Yes, I have had plenty of people say that someone in the team is in promo series and that they will deliberately play poorly so the guy loses series.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-05T12:11:59.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're good you will climb, end of story, take this account for instance, its a smurf and i went from Silver 2 to Gold 3, you wanna know how many promos i did to get there?
