It was good, it was my second for the day and i  was hoping to go up another rank. I played the first promo game which was unfortunately a loss and got the message that promo series was unsuccessful...WTF...I though promo series were over 3 games so how did I get a 1 game series? Is this one of the issues with ranked games being impacted that the notices are about this morning?\r\n\r\nNeedless to say I was a bit frustrated as I won the next 2 games to qualify for a promo series again. Really, I should have gone up to the next rank, not just qualified for another series.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2015-09-29T06:15:47.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i am done with league of legends. literally, after 17 promotion series lost, 34 of the matches lost to silver 4 because of some idiot who goes nunu jg with no smite, 2 afk in the base. Smurfs that go 21/0 and people in my team who just spam the surrender button while standing there or giving kills to enemy to make the game end.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2019-10-11T07:13:34.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Donâ€™t worry, your situation does not change much","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-23T11:18:01.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Such is life.\n\nIt sucks, but hey, now you get to play so more League.","replies":[]}]}
