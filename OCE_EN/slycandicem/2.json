We had a graves ( CrushDexter) mid and nidalee (DA GOD SLAYER) jungle. They played well  and we were in a very dominant position at 25 minutes. They then decided to stuff around so we lost the game. They didnt say why they wanted to lose but  they wouldnt help do anything useful. I presume they were playing duo. The other two and I tried to win. we held out for 50 minutes before they finally aced us (graves and nid died deliberately) and won the game.\r\n\r\nIf this was the first time it had happened it wouldnt be so bad but it was only the first time today. I like playing League. People like DA GOD SLAYER and CrushDexter are the sort of people that trash it for me. They obviously dont care about whether they win or lose. They probably think it is funny to throw a game.  I just wish we had a tribunal or similar tool to get rid of trash like these two. I expect it is just a matter of time before i have to play with these two again as I am certain i have played with and against them before. I may have even reported them before as I always report people like these two.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-03T22:34:19.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u cant play with trolls, ur just bad","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-04T01:09:23.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure both games have trolls and feeders but what your showing is a completely different type of scenario..","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-04T02:51:34.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"intentional feeding 33 kills? thats much more troll than just not committing after dominating early...\n\nhell, most games with an 0-10 or worse at 20 mins are instasurrender...\nwhereas OPs game they were far enough ahead that some people might have surrendered on the enemy team by then....","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-04T04:36:30.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"after 8 kills the said player yields no exp and and less than 50g, this in itself can be useful because you just turn them into a distraction or meat shield.\n\nwhat the OP got was 2 people who got the majority of the teams funds and abused that fact.\n\nessentially starving the team and failing critical moments which puts the team in a even worse position.\n\nalso along with above points its 2 people being toxic- not just 1, which again is harder to carry\n\nhttp://www.quickmeme.com/img/61/618614c49632fda85ff9ca7684929852314a02ea2338836726d9e1035b2a3de8.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-04T05:03:15.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but they werent being toxic. in no way did the OP say they were being toxic. they just didnt know how to close out the game....pretty friggin' normal for bronze/silver and hell, golds and plats sometimes dont know how to use their advantage.\n\nit just sounds like 2 people didnt know how to play out teamfights, or they did and no one followed them...especially if the 2 died together every time and the rest of the team was hanging back sucking each others %%%%s thinking that those 3 were the good ones....which doesnt fit at all, if the 2 who were trying to fight...were the fed ones...otherwise the other 3 would be fed, not the 2...\n\nwithout a link to the exact game and maybe a replay, its much easier to say the 2 fed people just didnt know how to press their advantage in the late game to end the game, and the 3 seem more to be trolling around WAITING for a throw...which is in itself, a throw.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-03-04T09:42:28.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh you make a very very very valid argument! and i agree with you, and i also agree that we need a replay.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-04T07:41:31.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MidnightFox,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3v6q2L1d,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-03-03T22:34:19.692+0000)\n>\n> if u cant play with trolls, ur just bad\n\nMost of your team was fed though.
