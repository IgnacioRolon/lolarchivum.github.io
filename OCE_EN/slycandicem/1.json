Given the number of people that have no idea how to play that are playing ranked and trashing games for others can some more requirements for ranked games be added?\r\n\r\nSomething simple like a minimum number of normal game wins would be simple and effective. It would stop the script players levelling to 30 in ai games then playing ranked with no runes etc. It might also make people think about how they treat others and whether they should troll games, rage quit etc as it would take some effort to get a new account up to be able to play ranked. \r\n\r\nI am open to suggestions and I hope that RIOT would give this some thought too. a reasonable minimum number of normal wins like 100 would be reasonable. It is enough wins for people to have plenty of ip for setting up a few rune pages without having to shell out for lots of ip boosts.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have any thoughts on requirements for ranked games?","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2015-09-04T04:05:28.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest a 10 game probation.

(By script play accounts i mean the ones that pick a champ never buy anything, never communicate and follow a particular team mate around all game. they dont back or use summoners, they just walk, even if they are going past an enemy turret and get killed.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-05T00:24:22.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The minimum standard for ranked games are as followed:\n1) Your Summoner level is 30.\n2) You must own 16 Champions.
