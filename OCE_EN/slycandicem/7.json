We were in a winning position and would have won comfortably except our top and mid, who were apparently a duo decided they didnt want to win the game. they sat at base doing nothing useful for the last 15 minutes of the game.  The enemy won although they took a long time to do it. Sick of losing games because of people like these two.\r\n\r\nWe seriously need a tribunal or equivalent so that trash like these two can be booted from the game. 'Azir only' and 'ChAnPulhEl' are their names. Naturally i reported them in the hope that if enough people report them Riot will actually do something useful and boot these players from the game.","replies":[]}
