Another game lost due to a booster on enemy team. A booster is someone playing in another person&#039;s account to artificially boost the rank of the owner of the account. A few people claim to be boosters and some obviously arent. Some clearly are. In a game I just played someone said they were boosting in game chat. I asked what rank their real account was in end game chat and they answered. Please ban the account being used in the game and find out from the owner of the account who they paid (or who their friend was) to do the boosting.\r\n\r\nYeah, I know, for some reason i am not supposed to do this but i cant find where i am supposed to make reports like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-16T07:01:56.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha that in no way proves 'boosting'. all that shows is someone in gold playing on a smurf.... it's possible it is someone playing on a friend's account to 'boost' them but you haven't proved that.\n\nbesides gold 3 isn't high elo. professional boosters (people that get paid) would generally be people who are high elo.","replies":[]}]}
