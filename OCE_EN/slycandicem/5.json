Just played a game where there were two boosters, one on each side. Both were having a conversation in game about their rank in their own accounts and how people pay them to boost to a higher rank. \r\n\r\nI would name them but &#039;horse of force&#039; will have a little tanty about it and say we shouldnt do that and suggest we write a support ticket. I have done support tickets before and as far as i know nothing happened. I certainly wasnt advised of any action on the ticket anyway.\r\n\r\nstuff it...novaelite 12 and mykool69 were the accounts. nova was riven in the game and mykool was zed. Both typed their actual account name in game chat and nova suggested that i get someone to boost my account. I am not a pathetic cheat so i have no intention of getting boosted.","replies":[{"poster":"Slycandicem","date":"2015-05-21T14:47:53.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If we had a functional tribunal there wouldnt be so many boosters, trolls, ragers etc playing. LOL would be much more fun because there would be more people playing to win and less that dont care if they win or lose or actively try to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-22T07:21:27.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I miss the Tribunal as well.

Really that's the only thing that comes out of name-and-shame. It's not like that person's gonna go, \"Oh my name was mentioned on a forum I don't even visit. I better stop doing this bad behaviour!\" Getting a red involved and taking said person through the system has the most efficient and effective resolution.\n\n>stuff it...\n\naw...\n\nIt's more to protect the accuser as well. It's against the [Universal Rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) and could be brought back up way later when you least expect it. What if this booster person wanted to get back at you for posting their name on the forums and accusing them of this?","replies":[]}]}
