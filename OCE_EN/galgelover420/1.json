I'm not one to dodge a queue very often at all, in fact I'm the guy who never calls a specific role, I always call \"fill\". But when a team, even in draft pick can't sort itself out and I can tell I'm going to be having a less that enjoyable experience for the next 20 or so minutes I at least want to have some kind of leeway in deciding my participation for such an activity.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that I think it would be a good idea to give out a single dodge a day that can go unpunished (without the six minute bar from playing a game). \r\n\r\nI'm probably just being a pissy nerd, but eh, it grinds my gears and I have nothing to do for the next 3 and a half minutes.
