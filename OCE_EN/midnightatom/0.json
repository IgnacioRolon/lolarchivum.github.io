I understand that you have to have kills as well as map presence, objectives etc. I am doing my best and i am constantly getting an A +. I am now at this stage where I am just angry and now starting to play like shit, turning my favourite champ is becoming my least favourite. This happening to any one else? Any tips to get the S-? \r\n\r\nMaybe I am just bad xd.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-19T03:12:44.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the champion, if they are OP in the meta or anything like that it makes it exponentially harder to get S's on them (this coming from someone who just got level 7 mastery Ekko.)\n\nIf the champion is a support, you also have to steal kills, (until riot actually update it, like they have said they would, i don't think it will actually change much though)\n\nBut yeah champion mastery tends to suck, and generally you have to just get into a lane where your opponent doesn't understand your champion, and abuse the fuck out of it to kill them over and over again.","replies":[]}]}
