I got home from work this afternoon and started up an ARAM. As I left the base, I noticed the normal 60fps was dipping to 58/59 pretty often (sounds pedantic but its noticable). I thought it might've been the snow or whatever, so I dropped the setting down a bit. Well even on Low with no Vsync/AA it was still sitting on that 58fps. \r\n\r\nAm I the only one having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-09T05:37:58.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also depends on your CPU, your FPS can be reduced even if you have a super OP GFX card, if your CPU is too slow to handle the GFX card.\n\nAlso if your fps are 100000 it doesn't really matter if your 50hz / 60hz / 75hz monitor cant display it. find out what hz your monitor is and cap the fps at that number, no point in going any higher really + it makes your GFX card fan so much quieter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gimble","date":"2014-12-06T00:34:42.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you have to turn the refresh rate sync option off.

My computer is ancient and I get 60 fps on max settings. I literally have a radeon HD 4800 series, which is terrible.\n\nDid you try  disabled the cap on FPS?","replies":[{"poster":"Ricky1370","date":"2014-12-05T13:51:10.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah disabling the cap didn't do anything oddly enough (neither did changing the cap to either 40/60/80). Ill give it another shot tomorrow when the servers are back. A while back League was only running at 58fps because of the animated HP/MP bars, but having a high end card should allow them to do whatever they want. Also disabling them didn't help, so who knows :/","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ADC or Cry","date":"2014-12-05T08:56:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop scripting HueHue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Obsidyth","date":"2014-12-05T08:15:15.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im rocking a 30fps average with a computer i bought only 3 months ago... so i would be frothing at 58fps lol.... your 2 fps dip makes me lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TempName004","date":"2014-12-05T06:22:25.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"change from fullscreen to borderless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-05T06:45:02.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The issue is you're using AMD.","replies":[]}]}
