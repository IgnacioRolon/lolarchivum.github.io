I would like it if they did something like, half your LP losses and give the leavers the LP loss you were meant to get in addition.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-04-27T02:36:22.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This theory is so flawed, every person in this game is an asshole as far as I'm concerned so no one would ever volunteer to AFK. But I agree with the remaining players should have LP loss halved and all their LP loss added to the AFKs LP loss. People should lose 75LP for leaving a game, that would stop people.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"S6 Meteous","date":"2015-04-26T23:54:12.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't you just love how we get punished for all the psychologically insecure muppets who we unfortunately play this game with?    \nThere really should be a name and shame post.
