For me, I&#039;ve always loved league over pretty much all over mobas because there was such a huge emphasis on smart play not just skillful play - yes you need to know how to use skills but you didn&#039;t have to be mechanically amazing at the game if you understood map rotations and just how to read the map and know what to build and where to be when (especially as a support/jungler).  While I appreciate the removal of starvation tactics, I feel like these changes are going to turn league into a pure mechanics brawling game where the better mechanical players will win most of the time as snowballing seems to be pretty massive with the changes, leaving little room for comebacks and strategic counterplay especially after enemy team acquires rift herald and steamrolls 2 towers from 1 death.  \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying that skillful play shouldn&#039;t be rewarded and for the most part I like the direction of a lot of these changes, I&#039;m just concerned if things continue in the direction they&#039;re going it might turn into another heroes of the storm or some such and lose the identity that is league.  Whether that&#039;s a good thing or a bad thing is not the point of this topic just that to me it&#039;s seeming to change the core of league (coming from someone who has played since beta). Still early and lots of changes I&#039;m sure to come but it will be interesting to see.","replies":[]}
