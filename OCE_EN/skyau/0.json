But make this clear: You don't need help LEVELING UP. My advice is play 3-4-5 games a day if you're busy just to get that win of a day. The win of the day gives you a lot of experience, and I climbed 19 lvls in a matter of about a month (due to the update). Would be happy to help you!","replies":[]}]}
