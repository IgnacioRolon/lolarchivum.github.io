The entired god damn match this guy fed my lane and did not stop saying this is what I get for not helping him do his own damn job that he doesnt need help with. Like are you serious. So i told him its his own fault for dying to a cs, i was focusing on malphite in my lane who was beating me. \n\nHe ruins this entire game and i tell him to stop and he continues to say its my fault this is happening and calls my shit, trash, goes fuck you zoe the entire match. The entire fucking match and because i tell him to stop and call him buttercup I get permabanned. This is the second time that I stand up for myself on someone who throws the entire game on purpose because they dont like me and I get banned. This is beyong fucking ridiculous. After a week and a half of reporting toxic players who have sworn at me and abused me and thrown matches, and not once did they get any form of punishment but because i fucking told this guy to leave me alone and stop throwing the match I some how get a permaban. This is beyond stupid, i muted reported, did nothing, i encouraged people, did nothing, I decided to never reply, did nothing. And all of that leads to me getting a permaban, who never flames who never types unless typed to and you can literally look at my history and see that, but because i have someone who maliciously and purposely threw the match i snapped because it was entirely uncalled for and Im over riot doing nothing about these toxic players ever. I have a list of players who have abused me and and thrown matches and all have been reported and I keep track of them and has anything happened ? NO like are you fucking serious. \n\nIm so over this shit, riot doesnt give a fuck about their players or the toxic people in it. Im done with trying to be ok with all this bullshit but I cant anymore.\nThis game is ruined, full of bots, trolls, toxic people, xenophobes, and generally horrible people. Will riot do anything about it no, are you wrong for standing up to this bullshit, yes and you should be permabanned for thinking like that.\n\nThanks for nothing riot on banning my account because i said buttercup, solid work on dealing with toxicity.\n\nexcuse the language, i am furious and this game has broken me","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-02-26T20:19:23.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"People only get themselves banned, anything else is a lie.\n\nSure you may get tilted by toxic teammates, but if you respond, it's on you.\n\nMute them and get on with the game.\nEnd.

But clearly youre one of those few people missing a few things.\nI have been following now 13 players who have been toxic in more than one game and i still follow them as of today, they have still managed to play games and what ? they dont get banned because ???","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-27T05:39:01.113+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Because the stupid reporting system needs more than 1 instance of them doing it. The bard that trolled me 7 days ago, is still trolling, but hey if he only trolls every so often, the reports are \"insignificant\".\nThe only course of action is to uninstall, which is what i will do when i get to level 30. Too many idiots and players with no balls or brain out there.\n\nTake this tristana I played with yesterday. Tristana/Soraka vs Draven/Brand. Tries to all in when they are full health at level 1. Dies. Then tower dives them at level 2 when Draven has a BF sword vs a cull. Dies. Blames support and then trolls by feeding around the map. No balls.\n\nOr this Malphite the other day. Picks Malphite into an all ad team. And when I say all ad, even the support is ad (jarvan). I rejoice. Until. He builds AP Malphite like a monkey. Enemy team stomps game. He even solo dies to renekton 6 times in lane. No brain. Not to mention the mid laner kassadin didnt even consider buying a zhonyas vs a Zed, he fed also. No brain. During the game I told them, \"this game is an easy win if we don't feed and buy at least one armour item\". The replies came back \"stfu noob you know nothing\". No brain and no idea and no manners.\n\nAnd the OCE classic. Doesn't watch the map, dies, and blames the nearest teammate while ping spamming question marks. Or spamming question marks when there is no way in hell you can save them (e.g. no mana, no cooldowns, no summoners).\n\nCompletely trash oce community we have right now.\n\nAfter level 30 I might actually get a new account and test how much trolling i can do without punishment and report back to you lot. It would be fun to type nothing, troll my arse off, get into ranked, troll to bronze 5, and see what Riot do. Probably nothing. I'll let you guys know in 6 months or so. Because playing seriously right now is a joke and a waste of time.\n\nI'll bookmark this page as a reference for the posts that I make on my troll account later.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-04-11T02:48:51.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quick update on this.

The report system IS a joke and it's usually the people who want to win that get the ban and not the person who caused an entire game to be shit. You're forced into a game for 40 minutes pretty much to play something you don't want to and left with no option but to get fucked. either way, you're getting dicked.

Without knowing the specifics of what got you punished we can't give you anything beyond the most generic. That said:\n\nIf you wish to appeal a punishment, you can submit a support ticket, however unless a punishment was made in error they won't revoke or reduce it.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nJust because you were punished doesn't mean the other guy wasn't. While there is a notification informing you if you have contributed to a punishment, it is very limited in when it shows, and not something to be counted on to determine if a punishment has been issued or not.\n\nIt doesn't matter who started it. While it really freaking sucks to be stuck in a game with some ass who has taken a disliking to you for some dumb reason, you are judged on your own behaviour, just as they are judged for theirs. Defending yourself is not the same as firing back.\n\nGameplay offences take longer to punish than chat offences. It comes down to chat being easier and therefore faster to judge. With chat the repeated behaviours that are indicative of toxicity are often pretty clear and pretty separate from any other behaviour, there's no ambiguity with calling someone a *insert racial slur here*. Whereas with gameplay, the repeated patterns of behaviour are often more ambiguous, e.g where do you draw the line between a player having a bad game and someone intentionally feeding? \n\nGameplay does get punished, but it can take a lot longer because manual reviews are time consuming (and therefore slower) and the automated system lacks the confidence to issue a punishment after just a few reports because of the possible ambiguity.","replies":[{"poster":"Joaquin Taco","date":"2018-02-26T00:57:21.277+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"I can post up everything but at the end of the day it does nothing to anyone for anything. Riots system doesnt work, doesnt fix anything. I got banned for arguing with a guy for feeding, thats not igniting thats not doing anything other than telling a moron to stop killing the game but yeah no riots logic is spot on, they throw the match and literally make it unplayable but god forbid you say something to them.\n\nNo thats not right, its stupid and always has been. \nIm not a toxic person because i dont talk unless I need to for the game but riot just loves to swing that ban hammer blindly. \n\nIts stupid and doesnt work, Mute report doesnt work when you get stuck with the player 3 times in a row, oh and you cant leave the game so now youre just going to have to deal with a thrown game. \n\nThey dont get bannned, they dont get shit but you argue back adn thats it. That makes literally no fucking sense in fixing toxicity in their games. I dont think ive seen anyone banned for throwing a game ever. But fuck man dont say anything bad because thats enough to get you kicked off.\n\nWhat do you get from seeing my chat log ? you see my replies only not theirs, what are my replies, telling the guy is acting like a child for throwing the game because i didnt help him clear a camp. like seriously, riot really doesnt give a shit and the community is absolute trash now.\n\ndoesnt matter who started it.. yes it fucking does, jesus christ so over this pathetic victim blaming shitty mentality, you have team flaming and throwing and what youre supposed to sit there nicely and take it??? mute report ? which we know doesnt work? then what ? wait in the base so avoid gettnig ripped by a fed team? oh wait youll get reported for afking, ok i fight and get ripped, get reported for feeding? I mean what is it exactly do you want people to do ? like seriously.\n\nyou literally and i can not stress that word enough but you can not LITERALLY PLAY THE FUCKING GAME, when youre team is throwing the whole thing.\n\nand thats not even getting into the amount of bots I have encounted and I mean for sure theyd be banned but pffft nope, they are still playing games. I watch their accounts and see what they do. Its not that hard. \n\nIm not the only discussion talking about this problem either. Thats an account now being permabanned for talking to a toxic team.
