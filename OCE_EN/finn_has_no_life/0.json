The general idea companies have nowadays is to automatically install updates with no user interaction. The benefit is that you don't have to lift a finger to remain updated and secure. Downside is that when you accidentally lose power, you could cause irreversible damage to your operating system (all automatic updates comes with the disclaimer saying that you should not turn off your computer while it is updating).\n\nNot all hope is lost, though. Go and update your drivers and your OS, see if just installing the newest update will fix the problems caused.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
