The colours are really pretty as well tbh.\r\n\r\nChallenger Ahri: I love the colours of this skin for Ahri, it&#039;s not too promiscuous but it fits with her theme well. I love what it stood for as well  the start of a season and she was the sort of mascot for the challenge ahead.\r\n\r\nYour turn!","replies":[]}
