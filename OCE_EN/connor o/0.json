I have been adjusting a lot of settings and trying to underclock it, but it still occasionally freezes resulting in leaverbuster being triggered sometimes before I can get back into the game (the freezing is unpredictable).\n\nThe result is that each time I get a penalty in place for &quot;going AFK&quot;. The penalty was first a 5 minute wait in the queue, then 10 minutes, and now it has been dealt at a 20 minute wait.\n\nBecause this makes league unplayable for me now, I was wondering if you could offer any info on whether leaverbuster calms down after some time and resets to the original 5 minute penalty, or if I should start a new account? I&#039;m yet to find a solution to my stability issues and have tried many things noted in the forums.\n\nThe worst part about all this is that if someone dodges I have to wait 20 minutes again, which I don't see as being fair since I can't control that.\n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-22T13:26:55.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very long time unfortunately. My advice for the LeaverBuster itself would be to queue up for ARAMs or bot games if you enjoy them since shorter games mean the 5 games will be gone faster.\n\nAs to your client issues, can you give more details about the problem? We might be able to get it fixed for you. My general advice for now would be to try repairing your client.","replies":[{"poster":"Connor O","date":"2017-07-23T04:09:43.393+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not convinced it is my client that is the problem. Sometimes if I leave my computer idle for a few hours without LoL open and I come back to use it, the keyboard and mouse, everything, is frozen on the screen. Even the clock. I can't find any patterns to this though. The best research I can do on the net points to it potentially being a corrupted hard drive, but it seems quite involved to image the whole thing to a new drive. I just want to play LoL ;(\n\nWill the leaverbuster just indefinitely double, so next time this happens I will be given a 40 minute penalty? I can't imagine waiting around for that length of time planning my day to click the button when the timer runs out. I think this kind of punishment is rediculous, considering I am not even playing ranked (I'm below level 30). I'd rather be banned for a week instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-23T05:21:38.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mmm sounds like it may well be a computer problem then, do you have a full PC or a laptop? Laptops obviously are considerably harder to fix depending on the problem, but maybe I can help.\n\nThe LeaverBuster maxes out at 20 minutes, so you don't have to worry about it getting any longer, but the longer you are leaving for, the harder it will be to get your account back to a point where one leave won't get you a LB timer. \n\nI know it sucks, especially when it is something beyond your control, but you have to remember that you are affecting the experience of 9 other players when this happens, especially if you make it all the way into game and past the remake period. There comes a point where you have to accept that this is an online game which involves other people, and you have to take responsibility for how your issues are affecting others.\n\nIt is obviously at the point where you have to either work on fixing the issue you have so that you no longer negatively affect those players, or accept that you will be severely limited in playing League while they persist.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
