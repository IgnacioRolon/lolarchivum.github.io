If you do not play the role you were assigned you will be punished. \n\nYour frustration is very understandable, and the only advice I can really offer is to play around them as best you can and report them in post game, or if they are really negative in champ select, to consider dodging (a few dodges here and there won't net you an LPQ, but be aware that LPQ is much harsher in ranked).\n\nIf for whatever reason you can't report them in post game, you could also consider collecting a few summoner names of people doing this (client screenshots are your best bet) and[ submitting them in a support ticket.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) Please know though that support is busy, so if possible always use the post game report feature instead.","replies":[]}]}
