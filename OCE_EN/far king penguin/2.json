I have an idea that can either be used or built upon by someone else but I was thinking that they could use the old queue system (doesn&#039;t worry about positions, just matches 5 together) and the first to load in with a position gets it. (i.e. if 2 people want mid are matched the first one to load in gets mid and so on, similar to the old system.) It could also be shown what positions you do want so people can work around and might come to a switching arrangement. Could also implement a reward system, say if you dont get any of your roles for 3-5 games straight you are put on priority to get your role next or something of the sort. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Use a mix of the old queue system and new queue system for ranked to shorten high elo queue times.\r\n\r\nSorry if this is not the correct board but I had no idea what it would come under. Just an idea Riot can feel free to use.","replies":[]}
