The items that you buy are either wrong or just weird because it has little to no synergy with the champion you are playing. Other than your CS don't look very good too when you are playing a role that isn't support. My advice to you is to go google search the builds for your champion and figure out why people recommend buying an item for a particular champion. Try and figure out what synergy the item has with your champion. If there is anything you don't know just ask me and if i know the answer to it i will help you with it.","replies":[]}]}
