I wasn't too happy with how short it was, but a handful of my favorite clips were with a different Nidalee skin. I'm extremely picky when it comes to these things...","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTOBmDgCHXw","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CTOBmDgCHXw/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone!\r\n\r\nSo I recently polished up a montage I&#039;ve been working on for the past month. I have never edited before, so everything done was from learning experiences  and my constant urge to perfect things within those hours. :/ \r\nIf you have any questions as to how I did certain things, I&#039;d be happy to explain and maybe give a few guidelines (if I manage to have the time).\r\nIt&#039;s quite short, but the a handful of the other clips were with different skins and/or were too old to have their replays rolled again.. :(\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a bit proud on how most of it turned out, but there is so much more I could&#039;ve done. I&#039;d appreciate if you could drop me a like and give a bit of criticism.\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n_Prowlore_","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-04T06:47:30.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is that summoner icon and how did I miss recieving it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Teemo","date":"2016-09-02T11:05:25.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unique style of editing but the clips were pretty average tbh and some parts were over edited and not really needed ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-09-02T07:25:12.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a HELL of a start....\n\nIf you want to learn a little more, feel free to shoot me an add.
