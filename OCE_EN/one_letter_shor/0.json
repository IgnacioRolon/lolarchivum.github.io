It gives unlimited resource in lane with its huge regeneration but in order to combo effectively you need to allow your energy bar to refill before you strike. Using the built-in champion mechanics you've listed to restore energy throughout the combo. As we see in all professional play. Zed takes blue buff in order to increase the regen to have pressure in lane more often, similar to that of a mage. It doesn't allow him unlimited aggression but it definitely helps. \n\nAn item to supplement energy users would be very hard to balance into the game, as you're effectively turning a champion with high kill pressure and low resource user into a more Riven like champion. It would turn these champs into Riven 2.0, which is a very hard balancing situation in itself as we can see from her very touchy patch change history. \n\nThe reference to the energy return mechanics is great to show how it causes the champions to thread auto attacks or spells together in their combo in order to reap the reward of bonus energy return. Stopping the Akali from just mauling your face or just full CDR Lee Sin's bouncing around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lysaaer","date":"2016-04-08T07:36:36.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why blue buff is in the game :) lol","replies":[]}]}
