I have also spent a lot of  money on this account ( $200+) and a lot of effort and time to get to where it is. {{champion:92}} Please don&#039;t let all the money i saved up go to waste because i am still in high school and  i don&#039;t even have a job so i put a lot of hard work to earn that money and now that i have found out it is permanently banned i am really upset.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-23T09:02:47.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAccount sharing is strictly against Riot's ToS/EuLA and is bannable by itself.\n\nAny activity taken on your account is **YOUR** responsibility.","replies":[{"poster":"One Letter Shor","date":"2016-04-24T02:41:56.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well isn't there something that can be done so i can get my account unbanned srsly?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-24T04:53:42.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0 chance in you getting your account back sorry.\n\nAs Seph stated, account sharing is a bannable offence in itself.","replies":[{"poster":"One Letter Shor","date":"2016-04-30T13:56:11.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not even next season or anything ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
