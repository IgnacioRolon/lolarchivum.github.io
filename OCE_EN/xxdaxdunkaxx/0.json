Do you have any plans buffing diana/changing her?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel at the moment {{champion:131}} is not that strong in the current meta and is having a hard time coping. This coming from a diana main with 120 games on her last season and going from silver to plat last season by just playing her. Now this season  i only got around 16 because i feel she is way to weak? So are you looking to change her at this given time. I also feel with the abbysal change it won&#039;t be a viable rush which is core on her.","replies":[{"poster":"Pararnore","date":"2016-05-04T21:13:44.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana is fine.
