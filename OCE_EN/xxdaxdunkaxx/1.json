Before we start looking at factors that may be causing these issues on the ISP end, I'd first like to confirm that the issue does not lay on your end of things. Can you try as many solutions as you can that are provided in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article?\n\nIf those solutions don't work, let's start looking into the diagnostics and see where the issue may be originating. To do this, we'll need you to provide some information for us: \n\n1. Confirmation that you've tried the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article\n2. ISP that you're using\n3. Region and/or State\n4. Trace Route (Tracert) - If you're unsure how to do this, check out [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)\n5.
