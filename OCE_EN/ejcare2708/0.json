I decided to play ashe instead of sivir, since i havent played her iin a while. As league loaded, my friend in discord tells me im against mf adc and ekko support. The sound of the name &quot;Mf&quot; reminded me of the dmg she can deal. I had a malphite support which was alright, but it wasnt until lvl 7+ where i was experiencing trouble with the lane. She q&#039;ed a minion, and landed onto me. 202 dmg... what the hell! that put me down a quarter of my health, not to mention she was 0/1/0. I continued, i died through greed, then, at around lvl 8-9, she was alone. i was csing, then i was q bounsed again. HALF. MY. HEALTH WAS LOST!!!! then ekko w&#039;ed then killed. This, made me mad... why is it, that a champion is allowed to have that much damage at 10 minutes in the game? Please nerf mf q... this does WAY too much damage early game, not to mention the horror that awaits late game.  {{champion:21}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-28T22:54:24.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if it kills the target the 2nd unit it hits takes massive damage just dont stand behind nearly dead minions \nits a big threat thats easy to avoid like a blitz hook\nalso you must realise that ashe even for an adc is particularly squishy","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-28T22:55:25.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also was she 10 mins with 80 cs having a bf sword and dirk because you can expect  a lot of damage from that even that early","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KieranisHarambe","date":"2017-07-28T12:09:14.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont stand so close to the minions you knobhead.
