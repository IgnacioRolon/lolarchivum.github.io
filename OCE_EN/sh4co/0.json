I quickly reached gold 1 this season with little to no problems. I got there with about a 70% win rate and would always do well in every game I played shaco, (since he was and is my main). I have recently started losing a lot more games on shaco and my win rate has dropped to about 55% even though I am consistently doing very well in games with shaco. I left a link to my op.gg account so that you can see for sure. If anyone can explain to me what I&#039;m doing wrong and how to improve more as a player that would be greatly appreciated. All I really want to know is, am I at fault or am I just getting unlucky with bad teams?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-11T08:11:19.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings SH4CO,\n\nShaco can be a difficult champion sometimes to carry into the late game when you are fed because it can be difficult to team fight with him and I think this might be the problem that you are running into. However there are some things that you can do to help this.\n---\n# Try to not just get yourself fed but your laners as well\n\nWhen you are ganking for laners always try to not only get yourself snowballing but your laners as well. Since shaco isn't the best at taking out tanks for example, getting your mid and adc fed can be extremely important to make sure that they can team fight effectively. When you are ganking always consider if it would be better for you or the laner you are ganking to get the kill.\n---\n# How to roam around the map in the mid game\n\nOnce laning phase has ended it can be quite hard to roam around the map and pick off kills. There are the effective things such as warding to help you pick off kills and going into their jungle when buffs are going to spawn so that you might get a chance to pick off their ADC or Mid laner. The amount of ADC and Mid laners that will be greedy and go alone to get buffs in the mid/late game is kind of insane which is a good chance to for you to pick off kills.\n\nAnother effective strategy is try to use your high value targets as bait. For example if you have a top laner or an ADC that is pushed up far in a lane, try to stick around close to where they are incase they get ganked. If they do you can most likely turn the tides by showing up, continuing the split push and getting kills in the process.\n---\n# Split pushing\n\nSplit pushing can be extremely effective on Shaco because of your high mobility and damage to squishy targets. Try to place boxes in locations that people will enter the lane to come and kill you, and push waves to make the enemies react. However when you are split pushing it is quite normal that the top laner will come to stop you which often will be hard for you to kill 1v1. In the case of this, push the wave as far as you can without forcing a trade, and then use your Q to disappear and roam to another lane to possibly start a 5v4 fight in your favour or start pushing another wave.\n---\n# Item Builds\n\nShaco is a champion that is heavily known for his high amounts of damage and going heavily AD in his item builds. However when you are team fighting sometimes it might be a good idea to pick up some defensive items to help you a long the way. These can be full defensive items such as Randiuns, Guardian Angel or Deadmans plate, or they can be what I can half tank items, a good example being Titanic Hydra.\n\nBuilding items like these will help you survive longer in team fights, letting your team do more damage while the enemy team is peeling you off of their carries.\n---\n# Final notes\n\nI hope that this information answers your question and helps you out in your games. If you have any other questions or any other ways I can help let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T05:25:43.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I vote option - \n\n~~3. Facing opponents that aren't as susceptible to cheesy shaco strategies~~\n3. Facing more team-orientated opponents.\n\nIt's not so much inner reflection that you need. It's a changed perspective of the elo you're in. \n\nWelcome to the teamwork elo, where you have to throw away the mentality that the game is all up to individual players, and that you have to 'carry'. I can sum up LGC's post with this: leadership. Bring the best out of your teammates, regardless of the situation, and you'll succeed.\n\nAs for me, I'm too much of an asshle to be a good leader, but YOU MAY HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you've cruised up to gold 1. Getting higher might take a lot more practice and experience, no matter how many strategy guides you read or advice you receive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SH4CO","date":"2017-01-11T06:59:07.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that I'm not sure if or what mistakes I'm doing so I'm not sure how to correct them and improve.","replies":[]}]}
