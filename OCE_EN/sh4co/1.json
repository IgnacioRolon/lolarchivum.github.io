Shaco is my favourite champion and would love some changes but would hate for his play style or early ganking  power to be gutted. With over 150 ranked games this season with him and over a 60% win rate I think it&#039;s fair to say that I have the enough experience with shaco to give some fair and cool suggestions for the upcoming Assassin rework. I understand that shaco is very hard to rework because it&#039;s so hard to change him without ruining/changing his assassin play style sneaky sorta feel. My first suggestion is to change his e (Two Shiv Poision) slightly by giving him some actual Poision, make it so the Poision affect is only active when you&#039;re e is up, like how the slow works currently, and to make it not op, nerd the damage of e slightly in the early game, but ends up the same damage at max rank. I think that his q (deceive), w (jack in the box) and him passive () need to stay how they are because they are the abilities that make shaco, Shaco. The only one change that would be cool, but impossible to keep balanced is his q having a reset feature but huge cd. Like I said unlikely because impossible to keep it from being to weak/strong. His ultimate (hallucinate) is what makes a good shaco good, depending on how he can use this skill, DEFIENTLY keep the ability to dodge skills with it for the outplay potential but I think adding something to the ultimate would make it way more useful like a switch between each other but it blows up straight after using it. I know what you&#039;re thinking first of all how do you move the clone and how is that fair at all, it would be easy to just change the button to control the clone but making it more balanced would also be easy by nerfing the based age but increasing the ration to keep it strong for ap shaco. Also it could have a copy feature where the clone copies the first spell you do after using you&#039;re ultimate. These are just my ideas but I&#039;m sure there are many more so if you have any please suggest them in the comments so that they have a chance of happening and if you think that this would be cool or fun to add to shaco like the post and if you want good old shaco to stay how he is leave a dislike. Please share this with you&#039;re friends to help spread the ideas and riot please don&#039;t ruin my shaco in the assassin rework. \r\nThanks for you&#039;re time.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-09T00:22:37.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your changes are completely overpowered, and actually if you run the numbers with these new numbers (not the old PBE ones) he is only being nerfed a bit.\nShaco is going to be a little harder to play but I'm sure you'll work out his current kit.\n\nI just don't like the rumours of another major rework coming up later for him since I do love shaco's identity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thechickenninja","date":"2016-11-08T07:01:20.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they have screwed him up\n\n{{champion:35}}","replies":[]}]}
