It would be a much more fun and rewarding as a player if it was 5 or even 10 times harder to get to the full rank of mastery points, some suggestions are that there would be milestones that reward you with some riot points or a skin (the rewards get better the higher mastery rank you get) and once you reach your get to the next rank there would be a massive reward, also getting better the higher mastery rank you get up to. This would make the game a lot more enjoyable.","replies":[{"poster":"sircoolinton","date":"2015-09-20T03:18:14.407+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree, this would work a lot better and make players put more time and effort into the game, so it's worth it for riot as well","replies":[{"poster":"SH4CO","date":"2015-09-20T03:24:49.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, but I doubt riot would actually change it, especially so close to worlds","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MummiesBoy","date":"2015-09-20T03:21:16.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a good idea, but the rewards would probably be too big, maybe if it was chroma skins instead of real ones or you get to choose a champion from the free week then it would be pretty cool","replies":[{"poster":"SH4CO","date":"2015-09-20T03:23:35.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah fair enough, I was just putting my idea out there but I guess your right","replies":[]}]}]}
