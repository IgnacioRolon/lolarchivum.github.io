YOu really think Tencent&#x27;s going to allow that again?\n\nTencent has been technically the legal owner of Riot since early 2011, when they'd already owned the majority of Riot's shares, though Riot only sold all of its remaining equity to Tencent in late 2015 but that really doesn't mean much at that point (at least I wouldn't say so).\n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't say it's that fair to blame everything onto Tencent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-12-25T11:25:56.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EzeBlood,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=k3IzRTPA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-25T05:49:15.557+0000)\n>\n> They did that last year and majority of the community got free stuff.
