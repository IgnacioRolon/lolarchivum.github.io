They have no obligation to help you mind, as the information on end times was published well before the start of the event, but they may be able to work something out with you.\n\n*Strong* warnings. Be polite. Go in with low expectations and understand that support has no obligation to help you. *Don't* mention legal action. So much as mention legal action in a ticket and they will not touch it. You will be referred to their legal team and support won't engage with you in the slightest.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]}
