But I feel as if I haven&#039;t grasped his skills yet. Could someone give me some tips and tricks? I&#039;ve done some research on Varus so I know what type of stuff to buy from the in-game store, but I notice that I tend to die more than I get successful kills.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-29T14:31:28.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its a lot more effective to just poke down your opponents and always play safe so that you dont run the risk of always having to gauge possible outcomes of 1v1s with different combinations of.....everything, even level difference. yeah sure you can auto a tanky volibear for 60% of his health, but then if he flash Q's you once and someones waiting on the sides you're absolutely dead, 100 to 0 for you, and all those autos meant nothing. if you just keep poking and farming from a distance, and learn to play like this, you should obtain a better understanding of when to be able to go in and stay back. unless the complete opposite gives you a better understanding.....but then again by now maybe you should have gathered the info you need, and then apply it to every other possible champ and their abilities and their combos with other champs to understand what you can do as a varus","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-02-29T14:01:08.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play safe early game, preferably with a peel support. He's very useful lategame with his massive poke and aoe cc ult. He's very weak against assassins or jump initiates like Malphite, then you're pretty much dead every teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-02-29T13:34:41.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Varus adc a bit these days, and you will almost never win lane. However, if you can afk farm your way up to about 250 cs, its easy picking from there on able to destroy most. never pick him into early game champs though","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-02-29T11:55:42.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to play him mid where i always play him i tend to go something along the lines of \n{{item:3004}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3036}}  And either {{item:3053}} or {{item:3812}} or {{item:3072}}  depending on what the situation is.
