Personally I think it's a better, more comprehensive program than the other two so I'd highly recommend using it.\n\nCouldn't agree more on the ingame replay system, it's astonishing it hasn't been implemented yet - so many other games have it, it can't be that difficult to put in!","replies":[]}]}
