It sounds as if you don't, and therefore nothing can be done in your case.","replies":[{"poster":"no mechanics ","date":"2015-10-02T16:50:42.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"aint nobody got time to read that lmao","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-03T01:45:33.876+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did I say you had to read it? No. I simply stated a section of the agreement stating that Riot cannot do anything for you as you agreed to the TOU and EULA. This thread is pointless, stop complaining and \"fix your shit\" (internet).","replies":[{"poster":"no mechanics ","date":"2015-10-06T06:10:36.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say what I meant by 'fix your shit'. What I meant was that the current tribunal system for AFK/Leavers is absolutely horrible. In all honesty, I think that the new system where you're placed in lower priority queue has done more bad than good. Given the fact that the current software that League is running on is full of bugs, sometimes being afk is inevitable as you can't move in some cases (e.g. the red cursor problem). Furthermore, I do have stable internet, however living in a planet thats capable of RAINing theres not much I can do, can I?\n\nHonestly the new changes on the tribunal riot makes just seems half assed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Xelvi","date":"2015-10-02T02:40:03.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been getting some 900-1200 ms server lag spikes too lately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"no mechanics ","date":"2015-10-01T15:41:04.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"and fucking first low priority queue ever so like ?
