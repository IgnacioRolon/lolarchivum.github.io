After going 1/9 in games I was placed in silver 4, now at this point I was already so fucking annoyed on how retarded every other player in my games were but this put me over the edge. \n\nHowever it is a brilliant market strategy, by placing you so low from your previous rank it gives you a false goal to work towards which MAKES you play even more games. This in turn strengthens their player numbers, the general spread of the game and of course the purchasing of Riot Points.\n\nFor me playing ranked has become nothing more than a chore and lucky for you Riot I only still play because my friends play. Why the fuck do I have to spend all of this time climbing two whole tiers to simply get back where I started. You may ask why I don&#039;t play normal queue and this is because I hate mirror match ups but hilariously people are more welcome and cooperative. \n\nI now fucking hate this game with a passion but Rito doesn&#039;t care because they already have my money and that is what any business is about, don&#039;t even try to argue that. Here is my match hx if you want to see an utter joke: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=soulstorm10 . Before you go &quot;oh but KDA doesn&#039;t matter&quot;  or &quot; lel xD just another whiney kid who isnt good enough to climb&quot; yes it absolutely does contribute to winning the game. You can&#039;t get towers or objectives if the enemy team is up so you logically kill them or force them out of lane. I always try go for objectives where feasible but it is incredibly hard when everyone just wants to TDM all the fucking time. I generally stomp lane, get the bot tower +/- drag, group for tower pushes but everyone else just decides to overextend without vision and die. Oh and if I am consistently versing high silver or low gold at least just fucking automatically put me there or let me verse people in my own division so I can shit on them and climb faster.\n\nThe general game direction is also something which is backwards and ludicrous. I understand they need to balance patches around competitive play because millions of dollars are in play however at least think of the 99% when you make decisions. The recent AD changes are disgusting and a plethora of toxic champions combined with clear favorites run rampant in this game. \n\nCurrently installing Dota 2, I have talked with my friends and they feel the same, you have lost more customers. Also I will be telling future people to not download this cesspool of a game, at least for its ranked queue anyway.\n\nI have dealt with a variety of people in my so far short career but I guarantee you this game and community is absolutely the worst thing I have ever seen logically and personality wise so far.\n\nI will be impressed if anyone has read this. I needed to vent and you are lucky I am taking it out here rather than random people in queue.\n\nTomorrow will be my last games for hopefully forever.\n\nUpdate: As I finish writing this I finished with 14/3/5 as Jhin with an enemy toxic/feeder Yasuo on their team, I flamed their yasuo for being a tool and realistically neither of us give a shit because neither of us are going to get banned. The worst part is I lost LP for that yet he climbs.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-21T16:24:48.839+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You finished the season p5 with 0 points, that puts you at gold elo. Everyone places lower, challengers place at best plat 1? If you are better than you're rank indicates, then you will climb back.\nIf you are solo, then working with your team > kda. Everyone commiting to a bad decision is better than half not commiting to a good one, so if you have a ham team, then prepare to ham. If they are passive, then you try to pick the right times to engage.\nIf ranked is making you rage ( pretty much everyone rages at sometime ) then take a break, it's not the end of the world. Every season is a new chance to prove your worth, its a long season and there will be many patches to come, maybe the current meta just isn't favoring your playstyle/champion pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-22T01:15:45.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Want to climb stop playing Jhin no matter how fed you are he is one of those champ cant carry if your team full of retard.
