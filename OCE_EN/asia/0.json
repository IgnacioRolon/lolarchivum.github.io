This poor little guy warranted a nerf he was strong. Snowballing into oblivion. HOWEVER, he didnt bring much to the table aside from very strong burst and mobility. With a heavy nerf to his burst aside from some mobility, he really dosnt offer much now. Say with zed for example, he offers wave clear, and the ability to split push if he cannot burst down a single target, also noting how he dosnt all rely on his ablities as much as fizz as he can aa his way through squishes if he cannot simply 'one shot them' \n\nWhat does fizz bring, well as of now not much. Little to know wave clear, No cc besides a slowing ult and a light slow on e, very little ablility to split push and most notably very limited burst which can only be abused if he hits a clunky large hitbox (often  a bad thing as it latches on to tanks in team fights quite easily)  unlike other point and click/large aoe dmg increase abilites/marks \"cough {{champion:238}}  cough\" and limited to decent snowballing capabilities via his best feature his mobility. \n\nIm not saying that he didnt warrant a nerf. But he was hit by far the hardest in a large patch where even zed and akali only suffered minor to average nerfs to only one of there multiple features, fizz has sunken to a 43% win rate (IM AWARE THIS DOSN'T REFLECT HIS OVERALL STATE JUST POINTING OUT A FACT) He also suffers a similar problem to that of zed (though zed has features which allow him to still be relevent) Which is the zhonyas issue, due to this change of the ult being such a dependent skill for fizz to hit now, if you can zhonyas/QSS (Qss only removes the mark itself not the shark) the ult and thus avoid  2.5 seconds/qss effects of a mere 20% dmg increase over 6 seconds. You avoid so much of his dmg now And unlike say zed or akali he really cannot do his job as a mobile assassin effectively with the zhonyas/qss issue due to his huge dependence on his ult, making him much more of a single target assassin which can be mitigated easily after the changes.\n\nAs well as this his e is a very significant part of his dmg now, due to the fact the w, and q simply dont do much now. Limiting so much of his mobility in team-fights. I'm sure riot did there testing to make sure this guy was still viable but i think they may have gone a tad overboard with some of the changes or compensation strategies to make up for what were very harsh Nerf's. \n\nNote: i am comparing fizz to zed who riot say is a \"healthy assassin\" due to there similar play styles of being a single target high mobility 'assassin'. \n\nTLDR : Fizz lacks the ability to be relevant besides some burst and limited mobility now due to a severe change, and fails to offer any kind of incentive aside from burst (rivaled/ bested by alot of other champs now) which so many champions with similar features offer (waveclear, split push etc) However he did warrant a nerf.\n\nNote i was a fizz main all throughout season 4, so my opinion may be a little bias, please leave your thoughts below and please again note this is my opinion \n{{champion:105}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-07T11:11:28.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"they could fix fizz easily by adding a reset to his E when he gets a kill or assist most likely kill","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2015-02-07T11:16:07.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mar3thyu,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdeRrELH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-07T11:11:28.783+0000)\n>\n> they could fix fizz easily by adding a reset to his when he gets a kill or assist most likely kill\n\nhis (what) exactly? you missed something, but i like your thinking\n","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-07T11:21:34.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NinjaNumber12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdeRrELH,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-07T11:16:07.468+0000)\n>\n> his (what) exactly? you missed something, but i like your thinking\n\nfixed soz mustn't have clicked hard enough","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-08T02:41:19.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you insane.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-08T03:31:23.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Dawaraven,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UdeRrELH,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-02-08T02:41:19.952+0000)\n>\n> Are you insane.\n\nMaybe :D but sanity is overrated","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Revelations 13","date":"2015-02-08T02:53:19.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol wtf  hardest nerf? pls diana gut , rengar first gut , xin zhaos' gut (he was considered insta report for playing him after ) the first heimer gut , lol you dont know what a gut is fizz is not %%%%%%ed overpowered he was he is just not as good anymore which is good !","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-07T11:26:01.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Against some of the Fizz's I have fought, it feels like his ult is just now DFG for him and he can focus on other items first instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NinjaNumber12","date":"2015-02-07T11:15:17.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played fizz since his most recent change but I believe Fizz is now about \"windows of power\".
