We destroyed the nexus, I clicked the continue sign after the win and after being stuck in the loading screen for the game stats etc. I just skipped waiting for stats as I couldnt be bothered to wait for them.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes my game hasn&#039;t registered on my match history so i log off and log back in thinking it might work after a log off. Now im here trying to reconnect to a game that doesnt exist claiming im not connected. \r\n\r\nIdk what to do about it... Thanks..","replies":[{"poster":"TitusBlackwell","date":"2016-04-29T14:50:15.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the same problem after a hexakill match, the game hasn't shown up on my match history on this site either :/ haven't been able to get off that screen for forty minutes or so now, doesn't matter if I log out or disconnect the net or try to actually connect, nothing seems to work.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-30T00:06:37.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"~~Ghost games will often also cause match history delays.

This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will fix on it's own, and usually lasts a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.","replies":[]}]}
