I did well on Nidalee before her nerf, and are doing well on Olaf. Zac is a little tricky but not to bad. I have narrowed down the new champion I want to buy to four: Elise,Hecarim, Kha&#039;Zix or Rek&#039;Sai.  i got $20 for my birthday so i am also going to buy lee sin. Which out of these four is the best for a good kda? And don&#039;t comment any others please. Thanks in advance! :)\n\nEdit: I am also now considering Ivern, courtesy of BarryButcher.","replies":[{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-12-06T20:19:40.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zac and Hecarim are probably the strongest atm\nLee would be strongest if you know how to play him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-06T18:08:06.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a fan of Olaf. \n\nHe lacks CC and his slow is all he has going for him. He is more of a high ELO filler jungle if you already have the CC or teamwork with your team. His brutal scaling and just overall tough kit makes him a good presence in team fights but his gank lacks heavily due to relying on the laner to CC or slow the target for you.\n\nStrong junglers, i would say Rengar, Kha, Shy(certainly number 1 on the soloQ atm). Wu is up there too, but only for those who know how to play him properly. Eve is strong atm but again you need to know how to play her. \n\nElise and Lee always are amazing junglers, and you can't go wrong with them but both are high skill and take a lot to master. \n\nMy personal picks this season for soloQ would be Malph, Shy and Rengar. Strong ganks and team presence.","replies":[{"poster":"Debankle","date":"2016-12-06T18:32:17.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the detailed reply. It has helped a lot but I am still deciding. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-12-06T20:14:50.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd also like to personally add Nocturne to the list. He has amazing level 6 gank, and his pre 6 gank is still strong as long as you enter the lane properly and your team member knows you are coming.\n\nTwitch once we see all the changes to him will also be a very potent jungle, much easier to be counter jungled but still a strong gank from 2+ level wise. His jungle is also pretty clean or healthy if you know how to do it. \n\nHeca is good but i feel there is a slight downwards motion to him atm mainly due to Shyvana being really heavily used, same with lee as both can duel him easy or just counter jungle him.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Debankle","date":"2016-12-06T18:39:41.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have narrowed it down to Ivern, Kha'Zix or Elise.
