Their AOE is good, but their kits aren't as specialised for it so it can sometimes be harder to pull off the big AOE plays IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-02T20:29:03.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude! you forgot renekton? I main renekton and its astonishing at how everyone underestimates the damage you do with this mighty croc. When he uses a furied attack jeez the damage is high.

Also his ult does constant aoe.... I mean if a renekton e's into a teamfight, ults and then q's it is pretty good aoe and a very good fight started and engage for the rest of the team :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-02T08:40:47.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunu can put out ridiculous aoe damage if you build him full ap glass cannon with his ult and Galio can put out stupid amounts of damage too.

Otherwise max e. By getting that 2nd point in q you can keep on one shotting minions for free sustain with passive. Alternatively max r > e > q > w and take some silly solo baron at like 20 mins (and later elder drag). \nWith AP nunu your main goal is to be a lane bully, you'll always win trades because of ur q. later use your ult from brush to stop the enemy laners escaping when you roam. take biscuits for more e spam. And finally remember the old nunu adage: as nunu all you do is make the enemy jungler worse than you :P (this also applies to mid lane)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"iDEC","date":"2016-10-04T20:31:04.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is Annie... wtf","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-10-04T21:10:49.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iDEC,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jLh80bJX,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-10-04T20:31:04.392+0000)\n>\n> Where is Annie... wtf\n\nYeah, lastnight our entire team was getting picked off by an Annie.
