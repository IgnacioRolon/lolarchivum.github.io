From my perspective an AD carry and a support. But then I wondered if they could pair with other champions as their abilities seem to make them reliant on each other. They need the other champion with them or they wont do as well. For example, Xayah needs time to set up her feathers, and Rakan can supply that through his shields, and if necessary his charm ult. I was wondering if they could pair with other campions just as successfully. In my opinion they really need to work together. What are your opinions on them!? Thanks in advance! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-05T01:30:13.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"imo xayah is decently powerful, but rakan is overloaded, his q is ranged poke that also has a 2 person heal on it, his w being a wq alistair combo but with more damage, longer knockup duration and no way to mess it up if you lag, his e is a better braum dash that can be cast rapidly so he's very very mobile for a tank, and his e->ult with flash/protobelt->5man w knockup, gives him really really really high levels of disruption, with exceptionally long multiple target cc, much higher than most other tanks at least and he's overall easier to play. Rakan is overloaded, and his kit doesn't exactly scream his identity and I don't like him. \n\nSure Xayah's kit fits thematically, but Rakan just seems like an overloaded bundle of every tank/support ability riot could think of and he doesn't really look or sound like the tank support type. If Rakan can build tank and still do high damage I will be very very unhappy, I hope he ends up being slightly squishy (more like an offtank than a true tank).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-05T09:20:12.722+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Rakan is designed to be a tank but rather a bruiser-y mage, and I think that is where a lot of his vulnerability is going to lie. He's an up close and personal support that is relying on his shields/heals and CC to keep him alive rather than tankiness, which is how most mage supports function but at range.\n\nOf course, he may well still be too strong in teamfights, that remains to be seen, but I suspect he won't thrive out of lane without another high cc or high tank (or both) champ on the team.\n\nI believe he'll fit somewhere into the niche of champs like Kassadin that aren't super squishy but would never be classed as tanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-05T02:00:25.618+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like Riot was going for something where they would work better together, but could still do well separated. Fact is, only one of their abilities (other than the recall \"syncing\") affects only the other directly, everything else will be just as effective regardless of who they're laning with (if anyone). Honestly, Rakan seems like he could be a decent jungler as well as a support, and Xayah seems like she could work as an assassin (mid, probably, or top) other than an ADC.\n\nDo they *need* each other to be successful? No. Would being together greatly increase their power? Possibly, I'd say it's too early to know.","replies":[]}]}
