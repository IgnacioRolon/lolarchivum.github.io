I haven&#039;t yet played a game with it, but I have looked at all the changes, and am wondering what level of priority should be put on it. I&#039;ve seen it take down towers so fast, so it seems pretty valuable. I just wanted to here other peoples opinions. Also, just out of interest, does Mordekaiser... nah never mind. I just wanted to know what others thought about it and if it is worth fighting over, or what is a good trade (e.g. turrets, drake). Thanks in advance! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-04T12:58:37.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it should be given high priority, if there is a chance to go for it safely, you should instantly be there! I would definitely treat it with higher priority than a tier 1 tower. But if I had to choose between it and a dragon that synergised well with my team _(or one that would help the enemy team a lot if they got it)_, id go for the dragon.\n\nBut giving up rift herald basically sacrifices first blood tower, and thats a large gold reward plus map pressure for the enemy. So definitely don't give it over lightly. Ive seen it take 3 turrets and an inhibitor in a single push when we protected it. So it's f**king powerful! and shouldn't be underestimated.\n\nAtm people just forget about it, becasue they arent used to getting it _(cos absolutely no one went for the old one)_. So I'm sure we will get a better picture once it gets on more peoples radars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Debankle","date":"2017-05-04T09:07:58.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the replies guys. it seems to me as though you should just not let the other team get it and instead fight over it. Thanks for the advice. It seems stronger than I thought, so this is an interesting addition to the game. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-04T10:16:06.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It hits really hard when clearing, so people avoid it more often than not anyway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-04T07:45:05.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Getting the new Rift Herald pretty much guarantees at least one tower, if not two.
