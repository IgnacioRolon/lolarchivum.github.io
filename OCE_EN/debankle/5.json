Worse, I am constantly being told to uninstall, to go back to bots. I was wondering what others thought, if I should keep trying or just go back to blind pick. It is really wearing on my conscience so any advice would really help. Thanks in advance! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-03-06T07:54:37.377+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I were you, I would stop playing ranked and focus on normal for a bit. You currently have a 7% win rate and a KDA of less than 2 on all of the champs you play.\n\nWhile it is tempting to try hard and go for a cool border and prove yourself, you will be in a much better position if you put if off and play a few hundred normals. With the amount you have (or haven't) played at the moment, it is highly unlikely you have the skills to play consistently enough to play in ranked. \n\nHere are some general tips to help you on your way :\n\n* [Actively work on CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH) (now easier with practice tool)\n* Play the champs you like at every chance you can - learn their match-ups, their builds, etc\n* [work on things like wave management, trading stance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz)\n* [stop dying as much](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/tBNPdREA-10-tips-to-reduce-your-death-count)\n\nIf you work hard on actively improving yourself, there is no reason why you can't be silver by the end of the season (provided you actually take a few months to play norms and expand your game knowledge and mechanics)\n\nGl with your climb ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2017-03-06T08:14:15.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest if you don't want to end up in bronze v to stop playing ranked for now. Play some norms and get the ip to get 2 completed rune pages, at the moment you only have 1 page that's full and it's not the greatest page.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HappyCheesecake","date":"2017-03-07T05:27:14.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice is to find a few champions that you like and play normals enough that you feel comfortable on them. Also farming up some ip for rune pages will help a lot. Once you actually feel slightly comfortable start playing ranked again, it doesn't matter if you feed as long as you're trying because we all have to start somewhere. Although laning mechanics, wave management and farming are important skills to have the most important thing is learning not to tilt. The others come with time and are fasttracked by spamming in ranked. \n\nPS I was in the same circumstance as you a few years back. Got 30 hit ranked placed 1200 mmr (silver 2 equivalent) 4 years ago and just fed and lost everygame. My gains were low but the skill level eventually got to where i would consistently win. I got better over time and so can you. I'm now diamond 4 seasons on. Good luck buddy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Debankle","date":"2017-03-07T02:11:11.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this guys.

Yes, you are bad,  but that is because you are unexperienced from the game. I would say to play normals until you have at least 300 wins with more wins than losses on your normals record. Or you could keep playing rank and get  bronze and be laughed at by the community.....\n\nAdvice from a trash platimum player :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fukushu","date":"2017-03-06T07:07:50.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh in my opinion its up to you, if you want to improve then keep ranking if not practice in normals then rank. My friend told me the best way to improve was to constantly rank which helped me. When i first started league everyone told me (including my rl friends) oh you're so shit you're never going to make it to gold etc. Look what i've done, i've reached plat and surpassed them all, they're literally stuck in bronze-silver. Dont let people weigh you down, learn to ignore and make fun of them when u pass their lvl cuz trust me its hilarious ;'). Just relax and enjoy yourself as well otherwise you'll just be stressed out or start doubting yourself even more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-06T07:07:22.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly, I would suggest playing 1000 games or so of normals, get a feel for playing against and with most champs,  of just start off in flex where the rank means sweet jack all, i use flex for testing out champs and playing for fun, because i cant stand normals. but i would say get some more experience than just the pre level 30 games before jumping into solo queue.\n\nAlso, find a champ that you love, and spam the crap out fo them, it doesnt matter how bad you are at first, if you like the kti, practice practice practice.","replies":[]}]}
