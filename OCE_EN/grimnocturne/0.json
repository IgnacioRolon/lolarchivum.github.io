PROOVING that RIOT does not give a fuck... that is all... will i get banned on this account? probably only due to the fact that i am flaming the fuck out of the forums which is actually dealt with by moderators... what is the point of having a report button? like so that automated messages can pop up on players screen to discourage them from re offending... if anything it makes them want to continue because they are sick of this happeneing to them every other game. start banning people ffs. it&#039;s not cruel. if you spend hours and hours getting a level 30 account then you get banned. suck shit cunt you might actually get discouraged from re offending.. but these pussy little 24 hour bans and 5 chats per game is ridiculous, nothing but a slap on the wrist, actually a slap on the wrist would probably benefit more than this. any hoooooo... on another note. how does it take you this long to get the 3v3 map up and going???????? like... they are way more fun. they &quot;usually&quot; dont take as long and ur not stuck in the game for 40 odd minutes every game because ur trollmates dont wanna surrender. trolls welcome to post whatever you like back idgaf this post will be deleted soon cause of its vulgar and brutally honest nature","replies":[]}
