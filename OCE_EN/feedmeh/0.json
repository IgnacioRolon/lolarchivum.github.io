(Larger) (even gragas big!!) I think it&rsquo;s an area of champion creation that league of legends could really expand on and have a lot of fun with!! Just a thought but would love to see it :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-06-13T02:17:03.001+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Illaoi is \"full figure\".\n\nYou're talking obese. You want an obese female in league. Which is fine, but lets not mince words.\n\nBut the inspiration for making a champion should come from a cool idea about the kit or gameplay not just \"lets put a fat woman in\".","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-06-13T05:11:10.728+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"between the anorexic lux, the mid size leona, strong lady illaoi and the monstrous rek'sai and annivia, we don't have many body figures left. \n\nI'm not sure we could include an obese female character without making it offensive. I mean gragas already satires negative stereotypes of obesity. What new satires could we make that wouldn't be extremely sexist? (also I think everyone has an agreement that gragas isn't a healthy body image).\n\nPersonally I'd like an old lady character in league, something creepy, something dark, possibly with a mechanical arm and a theme of childish traps and creepy little distortions of children's toys. An Assassin who works on fear and careful planning. Something that looks evil but is actually kind. Maybe against type make her an old noxian lady and toymaker who mourns all the children lost to war, and now driven to despair by loss and anger, she works tirelessly, distorting her craft for a means to end the endless warring. Someone who threatens the leaders and warmakers, strikes fear in their hearts. Not just an old lady, but an incarnation of the suffering, the loss and outrage of the people, something tenacious, tireless and terrifying.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-13T09:33:14.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=PqikJEGv,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-06-13T05:11:10.728+0000)\n>\n> between the anorexic lux, the mid size leona, strong lady illaoi and the monstrous rek&#x27;sai and annivia, we don&#x27;t have many body figures left. \n> \n> I&#x27;m not sure we could include an obese female character without making it offensive.

Shaco boxes are fun, but I'd really like a champion who really breaks the concept of premeditated vs reactive. Almost every champion in league is reactive now, and I think a calm and creepy old lady would be a great thematic for that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2018-06-13T02:53:35.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Being fat is not a good thing to promote. Gragas is just the typical male heavy drinker. A jolly drunker with a beer gut. You shouldnt apply an obese concept for women; Men dont want to see it, and girls dont look up to it.","replies":[]}]}
