It's all a learning experience, even with your team sometimes feeling like its holding you underwater while you're trying to swim.\n\nAnd most importantly, after every game, ask yourself: \"What could I have done to prevent that?\" Because 9 times out of 10, you could have been doing something more.\nIt's not fair, it shouldn't be your responsibility to do everything, but life isn't fair and you need to prepare for that. Your top lost lane? There were probably times you could have ganked. Bot lane enemy adc dominated? You probably should have done something  when you noticed it.\nThere is always something you did wrong.
