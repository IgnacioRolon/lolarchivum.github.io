If anyone really feels they need to help, they need to donate actual resources to relief causes.\n\nWe shouldn't ignore attacks like these, but support to this point is never good. Politicians now feel the need to act upon these attacks, in fact the French president has already said;\n\n_\"We will lead the fight. We will be merciless.\"_\n\nand Obama:\n\n_\"We stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism.\"_\n\nThis happened in 9/11 and G.W Bush went to war in Iraq for 8 years to overthrow Saddam Hussein and suppress Islamic extremist groups. **What came from this?** Well Hussein's generals went on to join ISIS and are now the reason for their military successes. Several terrorist bombings including Madrid, London, Times Square and recently Paris.\n\nThat's roughly what's happening now, it goes back further than that though, back to the Cold War with Russia","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-15T00:21:18.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Only 160 people died, that's not even 0.1% of the human population, who cares?","replies":[{"poster":"Skullandbonesss","date":"2015-11-15T05:55:40.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's such an insensitive thing to say. 160 people is still a dramatic number, and many were seriously injured. Those who died also affect everyone who they had known. Although the death toll may seem small, it still had a large affect. Paris is a first world city which means all of us are susceptible to these kind of terrorist attacks. If Riot gets behind these things it could give so much money to those who need it and because Riot never does these things maybe it could be great for their company.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-16T04:38:42.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest problem is, if Riot did something fro France, they'd also have to do something for everyone else lest they make a whole lot of people angry. Staying neutral and not saying anything is their best strategy as a company. Any Rioters that wish to show their support for Paris specifically can do so on the boards. Doing something in game would frustrate people who don't care, frustrate the people aware of the attacks that aren't and won't be covered and will really only appease a small population. Look at all the shit Facebook has gotten because they put up a French flag but not a xxx flag. If you're gonna do it for one, you eityher have to do it for all, or be prepared to weather the storm it'll bring when you don't. Riot is a games company, they are not structured for such things.\n\ntl;dr It's better Riot doesn't get involved at all. It would divide the community not bring it together as a whole.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-15T06:59:52.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about all the other countries affected by terrorist attacks?\nget off your high horse you bandwagoning, pretentious, self righteous %%%%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-11-15T06:35:55.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If u didnt notice on some social media posts, prior to this attack there were attacks in other countries e.g baghdad,iraq and beirut,lebanon the day before yet those were not widely covered by media. It seems only terrorist attacks in non middle-eastern countries get widely noticed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2015\n\nim not dismissing the idea entirely but i think it would be insensitive towards the numerous others who have been affected in previous incidents around the world.\nif anything it would be better if riot just encouraged players to donate to a charity that helped these people. a summoner icon seems the wrong way to do it. \n\nMost people on the eu server probably wont be directly affected by it and i doubt there will be in-game conversations about it. these boards would be a better form of communication","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-14T23:32:21.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why? Riot have never done anything like this before, why should they start now? Would they be expected to do this for every future trend that pops up, releasing an icon once a month, if not more often?\n\nFact is, people are sheep that will go where ever the media sends them. They post stuff related to things like this on social media then, as soon as the next \"big thing\" pops up, they completely forget about it and move on. Remember \"Je Suis\"? I'll bet you anything that no one is still going on about that.
