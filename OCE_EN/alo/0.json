So awesome to hear someone actually say it was educational.\n\nIf there's enough interest you can expect more videos like this starring other (support/jungle) champions.\n\nThanks for the feedback dude; much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-19T15:03:01.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any time my friend :D I'm glad my input was taken to heart :D i hope things work out with your youtube, btw what rank are you?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
