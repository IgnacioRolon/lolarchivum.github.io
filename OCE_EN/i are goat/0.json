Anyways, I&#039;m looking for a team to play with a couple times a week, or at least once a week.\r\n\r\nI play jungle and top primarily as well as support and mid when I have to. My weakest lane  is bot, as ADC and a mid follows pretty close after. I&#039;m not great by any means, but I play for the team and it would be cool getting tips and tricks from team mates to improve my overall skill level. I&#039;m not shooting for the stars, just want an active team, so add me if you want another member for your team or someone to duo with.\r\n\r\nIGN: I are Goat\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2016-02-01T03:37:09.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to duo i main mid and bot lane \nIGN:TheGingninj69","replies":[]}]}
