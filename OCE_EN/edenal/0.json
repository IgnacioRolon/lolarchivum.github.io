How long must this go on?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been trying to move my account to Oceania from EUW for over a week. Nothing is working. Then I accidentally transferred to NA and I was able to get riot to transfer me back. Anyway, what's the ETA on getting account region transfers working? It sucks not being able to play because the functions busted. Also, as far back as I can remember, there has almost always been an account transfer issue notification. Does riot manually have the power to move my account for me? Also, it's weird that i'm able to move my account to NA but not OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-09T12:06:59.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE transfers have been a bit of a minefield the last few years. End of season is very much *the worst* time for them too, so you've gotten rather unlucky.\n\nHopefully, they know more about the issue this year than they did last year, but I would say it's unlikely to be back up before preseason (as account transfers are normally scheduled to be disabled for actual season end into preseason).\n\nYour best bet is going to be to keep an eye on the service status, and if you want to play on OCE in the meantime, start a new account. If you have an open ticket with support you can ask them if they have any sort of timeline, but I wouldn't get your hopes up. As I understand it it's a very tricky and exceedingly persistent issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PermaBTwice","date":"2019-10-23T16:54:48.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is unreal. New skins, new game modes, new games, yet same account transfer problem. At the very least give some information on when it will be fixed! I have already paid for RP to transfer to EUW from OCE and it is not working. My RP has not been deducted, but every time I do try to transfer, it just does not work. Please fix this issue asap, I have 4 months vacation and really need my account transferred if I want to enjoy it.","replies":[]}]}
