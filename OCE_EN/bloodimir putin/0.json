He then says he doesn&#039;t care and wants to have fun. This fucking ranked, we are here to try our best to win. If you want to play jungle rengar with flash ignite, go play normals. (He doesn&#039;t even take smite, he takes flash ignite instead). He then proceeds to troll by not doing anything and going top to leech xp (Trolling). I call him out and I get chat restricted. Yes I know past games effect the restriction, but this is a fucking disgrace. \n\nI was chat restricted for this:\n\nGame 1\nBloodimir Putin: yes you degenerate\nBloodimir Putin: see\nBloodimir Putin: he jus trolls\nBloodimir Putin: ofc\nBloodimir Putin: like\nBloodimir Putin: you go into a game\nBloodimir Putin: expecting to lose\nBloodimir Putin: when you pick rengar\nBloodimir Putin: and say you&#039;re having fun (I&#039;m referring to that in champ select he said he doesn&#039;t care about winning and he just wants to have fun). \nBloodimir Putin: lmkao\nBloodimir Putin: you are trlling\nBloodimir Putin: ff pls\nBloodimir Putin: lmao\nBloodimir Putin: tell me\nBloodimir Putin: how\nBloodimir Putin: can i roam\nBloodimir Putin: LOL\nBloodimir Putin: i follow\nBloodimir Putin: LOL\nBloodimir Putin: and then\nBloodimir Putin: he smiotes (He was pinging me to help him with Blue because he was getting invaded by other jungler. If I came, the enemy jungler would still get because he has smite and this rengar does not). \nBloodimir Putin: LOL./\nBloodimir Putin: report jg pls\nBloodimir Putin: lmao\nBloodimir Putin: im toxic therefore he trolls (Calling me toxic despite obviously trolling)\nBloodimir Putin: good attitude\nBloodimir Putin: watch out\nBloodimir Putin: he got a kill\nBloodimir Putin: = not trolling\nBloodimir Putin: ok.\nBloodimir Putin: lmao\nBloodimir Putin: yeah report me for being toxic\nBloodimir Putin: calling out a yi 1-trick that instalocks rengar\nBloodimir Putin: excuse is that he used to main rengar (he said that he used to main rengar despite playing like dog shit on him, his stats clearly show that after 50 games at a 40% win rate) \nBloodimir Putin: but then he regularly ints and has a 40% winrate\nBloodimir Putin: and says\nBloodimir Putin: just playing for fun\nBloodimir Putin: and im the toxic one\nBloodimir Putin: you average 8 deaths\nBloodimir Putin: lmao\nBloodimir Putin: how do you average 8 deaths in plat.\nBloodimir Putin: thbgat is vbronze\nBloodimir Putin: literally bronze deaths\nBloodimir Putin: you go full crit rengar\nBloodimir Putin: probably imitating nightblue\nBloodimir Putin: Don&#039;t kill him! He&#039;s having fun@!\nBloodimir Putin: told someone to dodge.\nBloodimir Putin: because i laready dodge 3 times\nBloodimir Putin: cos of champ selectr trolls\nBloodimir Putin: i would be -10 lp\nBloodimir Putin: and maybe\nBloodimir Putin: i thought\nBloodimir Putin: \\he wouj;ldn&#039;;t troll\nBloodimir Putin: stiop killing him\nBloodimir Putin: he&#039;s trynna havce fun (I&#039;m referring to that in champ select he said he doesn&#039;t care about winning and he just wants to have fun). \n\nThe only toxic thing I said was called him a degenerate, which he is. If you troll, you&#039;re a degenerate. He can play freely and I am chat restricted. How is this fair.\n\nI need some clarity on this abomination.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-12T23:08:02.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Let me type bulshirt all game rather than playing the game.
