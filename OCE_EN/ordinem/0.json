During the game I played just now, a player just constantly expressed racism speech towards Chinese and used terms like &quot; Chinese dog&quot; to humiliate billions of people. As a Chinese myself, I think I have the responsibility to disclose this matter and call for your serious attention.\n\nI have more photos as proof if you guys request .","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-24T08:02:35.668+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"name and shame is a no no","replies":[]},{"poster":"V U","date":"2016-03-24T09:20:33.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dang, I've had a similar problem with these types of players. I was in a game a few weeks ago and a player said to me that I had \"%%%%%%%%%%% eyes and I looked like all the other Asians\". I didn't even know he knew I was Asian but he just said it anyway. The best tip from me is to just ignore it and move on. Report that player after the game and bam. You won't see that player ever again (depending on the situation)\n\n(Also, next time don't put the user's name and shame them)\n(It's against the rules)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-24T12:34:19.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As others have mentioned, please remove the name and shame. It is against board rules.\n\nHowever if you have screenshot evidence, you can submit it to support so an actual person will look into it for you.
