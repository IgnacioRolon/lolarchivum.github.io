Some people reached their Ranked goals, many, like myself, did not. While I know I&#039;m not the best player it just always felt like we lost simply because of a complete lack of communication.\r\n\r\nSo for season 6 I&#039;m going to give Ranked Teams a try. I&#039;m looking for players Bronze III to mid Silver (higher leveled people are welcome too, should anybody want to carry).\r\n\r\nMy goal for this team is to have 8-10 people who can play 2 roles well and at least 2 champions in that role well whilst being adaptable (for example if you can only play Darius and Garen its not always easy for you to adapt to the requirements of a specific game).\r\n\r\nI myself am a jungle main, playing Ammumu and Vi, with Top as my secondary role, where I play Hecarim and Jax. \r\nI&#039;m looking for another person (or people) that can fulfill my roles should I be unable to play and players for all other roles (once again, an 8-10 man team).\r\n\r\nThis is also going to be more than just a team. Teams work best once you actually get to know the other members well. There will be a group chat (on Skype most likely) which we can use to communicate. This can be used for personal stuff (without being creepy about it), theory crafting or sharing a funny vid on YouTube with your league friends. \r\n\r\nBig point though: if you make other team members angry or flame them or put them down you will be kicked. There is a one strike policy for dick heads.\r\n\r\nSo, who&#039;s in? :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kaneki Kazuto","date":"2015-12-02T23:23:23.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I am silver 4 \nIGN: LordBelgarion\nI am an adc main but can play all roles decently and would like to join your team :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sweaty Bum Crack","date":"2016-01-12T09:18:54.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LordBelgarion,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=ddIlMtpr,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2015-12-02T23:23:23.650+0000)\n>\n> Hey, I am silver 4 \n> IGN: LordBelgarion\n> I am an adc main but can play all roles decently and would like to join your team :)\n\nI can't seem to find you, have you changed your summoner name?","replies":[{"poster":"Kaneki Kazuto","date":"2016-01-19T13:11:01.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GravSpider,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=ddIlMtpr,comment-id=00070000,timestamp=2016-01-12T09:18:54.432+0000)\n>\n> I can't seem to find you, have you changed your summoner name?\nIt is now KanekiLelouch","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sweaty Bum Crack","date":"2016-01-12T09:15:38.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, I've been inactive for  a while.
