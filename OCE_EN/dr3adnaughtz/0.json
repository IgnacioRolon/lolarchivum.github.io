Also it will give players a better ability at redeeming themselves and possibly being put back into a moderate or favorable group in matchmaking instead of waiting for the 10 minute leaver penalty and then getting penalized again for not being back in time after the 10 minutes because a player decides to do something to burn the time. You could even have a \"Leaver-buster time is up, press OK to start matchmaking\" window to stop leavers getting penalized even more or wasting their own time. \r\n\r\nI think its important to penalize leavers but wasting peoples time through leaver-buster of up to 10 minutes is overkill me thinks.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T08:00:36.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">You could even have a \"Leaver-buster time is up, press OK to start matchmaking\" window to stop leavers getting penalized even more or wasting their own time.\n\nThat defies the point of low priority queue.\n\nPrisoner's Island never has good results, and it doesn't even make sense here. You'll have games where everyone disconnects, therefore most of the players don't even play the game with an afk because they're afk themself.\n\nWhat the system is designed to do is lower the concentration of regular leavers in game, and by making them wait before queuing up, that's what it does.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr3aDnAuGhTz","date":"2015-01-21T21:35:17.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It defies the point ? \n\nif a player doesn't sit and watch the counter he will automatically be placed in a matchmaking cue....\n\nSo if you make a coffee and come back to the game as it has a 10 minute timer to even search for a match, you will be banned as it throws you in a cue as soon as the timer is finished which will only land people another 10 minute wait.. which will lose summoners interest etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Chimmander","date":"2015-02-10T09:27:34.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with Dr3aDnAuGhTz , i just left a co op game as i had to go for dinner and this is my 2nd time ever doing so and i have to wait 10 minutes to play my next match like this really is harsh especially since it was really just a bot game and that i barely ever go out from a match. Please i really would like to see a maybe an increasing time penalty for ongoing abusers not just a straight 10 minute wait for those who only dodged twice and bot co-op shouldn't really have too harsh a result like that as really its pretty hard to lose against them etc... even though it is true that i dont see as many leavers and that but it is still wayy too harsh a punishment for 2nd time leavers","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T23:49:52.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is to lower the amount of regular leavers playing in normal games, without just outright banning them. If you were to just let the person start the queue whenever they like after the wait period, it just becomes like as if though the game were patching. In order words, it changes from being a punishment to just being an inconvenience, meaning the message is lost.\n\nI find it strange that it seems to be affecting people who have only left two games, it seems. That's unnecessarily harsh.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr3aDnAuGhTz","date":"2015-01-22T08:32:18.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your response and agree to a point but I find in a realistic occurrence the message is being lost anyway, the idea is to not treat the players as sheep by discriminating them by the way they play and act in game by giving them a 10 minute wait. Instead If players want to be total assholes they should be grouped up with them more instead through matchmaking.. There has got to be a way instead of a 10 minute wait, players that are respectful still get banned over networking issues etc.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T09:23:11.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the way I see it, if I have uncontrollable network issues that I can't fix and are unpredictable, I would prefer a ten minute wait than to be forced to play with people who are known to constantly afk. It wouldn't be a very positive atmosphere, and would probably just drive people to make smurfs and cause more chaos, as a form of vengeance.\n\nBut that's making a lot of presumptions.\n\nOf all the solutions proposed, the low priority queue seems to be the most effective and fair.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Dr3aDnAuGhTz","date":"2015-01-21T21:27:40.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am complaining about wasting peoples time which is unfortunately what the leaver-buster is doing. Sure you may be getting results but there is other ways to which you can penalize players without a stupid long timer, I also believe that alot of players are getting banned for no real valid reason (e.g bugsplat errors on mac, issues with Oceania server connections and one sided reporting by friends that play together) is just a start to the chaos.\n\nI just find it sad that riot is having to treat its community like a pre-school.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-21T02:17:13.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Works great for everyone who doesn't leave games though, I can honestly say I have had very few leavers since the new system.","replies":[]}]}
