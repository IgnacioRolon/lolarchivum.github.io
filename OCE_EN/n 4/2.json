Yes\n\nAge: 21\n\n**What previous experience do you have as analyst or coach:** For coaching experience, i ran one of the largest mentoring groups in OCE with 50+ people turning up every night, from bronze- diamond players. To be honest, my coaching experience could improve. \n\nI prefer the analyst position where I can assess plays, and instruct on mistakes/ positioning /plays /meta picks/ picks + bans. \n\nI was the analyst and coach for a couple of lower elo teams (1 diamond 5+, 2 plat + and 1 gold +), and as my experience in league has improved, so have the teams i've been the analyst for. Currently, i feel i'm ready to make the push to the super competitive team level.\n\n**What can you bring to the team:** Lots of experience, in lots of different situations. I've been playing League since season 1, and therefore I have a a good level of game knowledge to bring to the team. I've been watching all the tournaments and LCS  all through to season 4, and this year i took a small hiatus from league. I'm able to not only explain what plays went wrong, but also give insight into what could be improved into the future. \n\n**Are you willing to watch majority of the major regions games to keep up with the meta and the current power picks:** Yes, of course. Including OPL, EU/NA LCS etc.\n\n**Are you also willing yo watch all our games live or through a reply if you can't make training:** To be honest, for every game you lose, absolutely- perhaps 3 times over. For games were you crushed, i'm unsure if its worth taking the time out of watching other pro level games. \n\n**Any extra information about yourself that you think is Important:** I've kept all this information short and concise, to give you an overview. Obviously i've not included everything, and you should be able to get a gauge on if i appear interesting enough to go further with. I have played in the mid diamond league back in season 3 (when i was really aiming for diamond), but in the end, I wasn't mechanically gifted enough for high elo play- but i know I have the knowledge for the analyst position on a high elo team.","replies":[{"poster":"AS DLocker","date":"2015-09-19T04:20:57.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Star, \nAlpha Sydney is an organisation dedicated for competitive play and with the expansion into League, have started to recruit Diamond plus players for a new Ranked team.
