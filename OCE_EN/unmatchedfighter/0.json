It will provide a more supportive environment to learn and try new things, as well as having the added bonus of slightly higher IP and mastery gains as you go. For this you can always try the [team recruitment board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment),[ clubs](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) (or university/high school groups if that's where you're at), or even facebook groups like [Summoners Society](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/). \n\nIt is pretty frustrating constantly being up against people that will destroy you in lane, but eventually you will rise to the challenge (even though that seems like it will never happen). In fact, one of the best learning strategies for a lot of things is to throw yourself into the deep end, getting completely wrecked until you start adapting to the situation. You will come out the other end better for it. \n\nGL HF ♥","replies":[]}]}
