So many players with honour ribbons are getting banned / suspended because of rage towards a feeder / inter / griefer but the griefers just carry on and get nothing because the chatbots dont catch them swearing.so feeder wins this game just about luck{{sticker:slayer-jinx- catface}} and LOL just want to make money{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[{"poster":"Shania Swain","date":"2019-10-06T09:26:57.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Man i just copped a 14 day suspension for this exact problem. I copped a comms ban from an anivia support walling the team into enemys on purpose to kill them. Then i just copped a 14 day suspesion from an iron 2 ashe mid who ran it down mid.
