I&#039;d say I play decent enough as a support, I play Nautilus, Leona, and Braum. Jungle I play Rammus, Sejuani and Nautilus. \r\nI don&#039;t really have a preference in what roles I am looking for, just people to play with. I prefer people outside of bronze and probably not plat unless you want to play with someone lower rank than you.\r\nAdd me if you interested, we can talk out the details then.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Saucy","date":"2016-06-18T02:34:34.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are u in OCE","replies":[]}]}
