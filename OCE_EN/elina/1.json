This would also help those who weren&#039;t fluent in english to know what certain things are in the options or shop or what the announcer was saying in game. Another thing would be chinese and korean characters in summoner names; I think this&#039;d be pretty nice since many of us may have cooler ideas for names in other languages. Would really love it if oce was given the ability to change our language/summoner names/voice overs etc to something other than english. Share your thoughts on more languages in oce, doesn&#039;t have to be just chinese and korean but this is the best way to let the devs know we want more languages implemented.","replies":[]}
