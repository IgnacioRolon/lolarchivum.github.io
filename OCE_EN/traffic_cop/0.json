It sucks not to be able to, but it makes sense the way it is so the system does the job it's intended to do.\n\nThe FAQs do include information on how to level up, it just doesn't give any specific numbers because, quite simply, there are no specific numbers for levelling Honour. The system is based around consistency, not necessarily quantity. While regularly earning honours will speed up your progress to the next level, it's still possible to progress without honours altogether (it just takes longer).\n\nHere's the FAQ entrys regarding levelling:\n> **Do I need to do anything special to progress?**\n> Honor levels are all about consistency. Just show up, don't be an asshole, and you'll rise over the coming weeks and months. We have different rewards and celebrations prepared for players who are highly honored in specific games or over the course of a season.\n>\n> **If I get no Honors, do I still level up?**\n> You will, just a little more slowly than those who rack them up like crazy.","replies":[{"poster":"TheStevenWu","date":"2017-07-20T19:36:45.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. Having a tracker would only help Riot.\n\n1) How would you abuse the systems by knowing your level progress?\n1A) Irrelevant. Any form of abuse in the system can be implemented with or without level tracking (it's just a matter of knowing how effective the abuse is). Other than 3rd party programs, the only way to \"abuse\" the system is by playing with friends and having everyone honor a single teammate regardless of performance. Unfortunately, this is already happening - very seldom do you see players honor teammates outside of their pre-mades.\n\n2) Positive effects of having a tracker\n2A) Players who know they are close to being \"demoted\" a honor level will be more likely to adjust their behavior to avoid demotion - which is what RIOT wants.\n2B) Players can better see the effects of good sportsmanship, making trying that much more meaningful\n\n3) Negative effects of having a tracker\n3A) Players with high honor levels may find it \"acceptable\" to be toxic every once in awhile. IMO, this is a very insignificant side effect as having \"high honor levels\" usually wouldn't be the main justification of a honorable player losing it, while conditions like \"2A)\" usually has more impact\n3B) Players begging for honors (easily ignore. Riot should also implement a \"dishonor\" option as begging for honor has historically been considered dishonorable).\n\nOverall, the negative effects of having a tracker is pretty insignificant. However, having a tracker may lead to impactful positive effects. The only reason I can see RIOT not implementing a tracker is to hide the fact that they're providing less rewards than what they've sold to their players (in which would cause a negative effect if the tracker was implemented) - which is exactly how their previous honor systems worked. Players who were dishonorable were being flagged left and right while honorable players were seeing little to no benefits from the supposedly reward system, resulting in negative PR and complaints.\n\nTL:DR. Trackers aren't being implemented because RIOT doesn't want you to know how little rewards are given out for \"honorable\" behaviors.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-20T23:07:15.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1) How would you abuse the systems by knowing your level progress?\n\nQuite simply, players could just change their behaviour when they come too close to losing an Honour level, which is counter-intuitive to the system since it's about *consistent* behaviour, not just changing back and forth depending on the situation. It is most certainly *not* what Riot wants to come from Honour. Riot wants *consistent positive behaviour* from the Honour system.\n\n> the only way to \"abuse\" the system is by playing with friends and having everyone honor a single teammate regardless of performance.\n\nIt's been stated that this kind of abuse has been specifically targeted, and that it provides \"literally no benefit\". You can find this in the Honour [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148).\n\n> Players can better see the effects of good sportsmanship, making trying that much more meaningful\n\nRealistically, this should come as a much more \"passive\" effect of Honour, rather than being \"accessible\" through a tracker. With the introduction of Honour, it stands to reason that players will strive to be more positive (even if it's not how they normally behave), which should, in turn, result in much more pleasant games (win or lose), which should entice players to persist with a positive attitude and good sportsmanship. Adding a tracker *shouldn't* be the determining factor for this.\n\n> Players begging for honors\n\nGiven some of the changes to Honour, this is now only possible in-game, and would count as chat spam, which is a reportable offence. There's your \"dishonour\" option.\n\nThat said, it's been stated by Riot that there's \"some pretty crazy algorithms to determine when a player levels up\" and that \"It doesn't work super well as a progress indicator that we show to a player, and if we did, it would probably be more confusing than helpful.\" so it's doubtful that actually adding a progress tracker would help players, rather than just make them more confused about the nuances of levelling Honour.\nSource: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/JxiotXoA-is-there-a-counter-for-honor-like-can-i-track-my-process?comment=0001","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phant0mShad0w777","date":"2017-12-22T03:01:19.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree but I think that to solve the problem of people with a high honor lvl being toxic thinking \"they can afford it\" they should make the penalties to being toxic be more severe the higher the honor lvl you have.\n\nPeople who have a high honor lvl generally will be nicer more \"honor worthy\" players and EVERYONE has a bad game or losing streak once in a while but if somone is going to earn honor and then be toxic they need to be punished more severely.\n\nI think they need to work on \"HONOR POINTS\" and honor can be GAINED or LOST according to reports and honors earned.
