In my own thought I am thinking of like balancing the teams out so maybe Ziggs {{champion:115}} (as poking ap) then tanks like Zac {{champion:154}} or Mundo {{champion:36}} (that can health regen quick) and maybe adc? like Jinx {{champion:222}} or Kog Maw{{champion:96}}  that can get range.\n* Or Maybe just the wombo combo like Malphite{{champion:54}} , Zac{{champion:154}} , Wukong{{champion:62}} , Orianna {{champion:61}} and obvioulsy Yasuo{{champion:157}} ???.\nAny thoughts guys?\n\nPs. I also reckon that Zac is kinda a meta now in ranked since he is tanky and can do cc such as knockup.\n-Yohorien-","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-10-04T09:04:54.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From my experiences, the best team is one where players can fulfil their roles effectively. People often think that wombo, poke, sustain and all-rounder comps are OP, but it really depends on how well a player performs on their champ and as a team member IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"Yohorien","date":"2016-10-04T09:09:19.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the ideal thought.
