I&#039;ve tried troubleshooting my problem and trying any fixes I can find and nothing has worked. I had an older account I played on for about a week until I got banned (this was when I was first introduced to mobas and didnt know I got banned for leaving matches), same thing with that account too. But with my old account I was able to reset the password and log back in. BUT with my other account I made up some random email I didn&#039;t think I&#039;d be using for very long to make another LoL account but I end up playing with this email and account for three years. Now that I&#039;ve encountered this error I tried to do a password change on this account but I don&#039;t remember my email password and Microsoft can&#039;t help me recover it. I spent A LOT of money on this account and right now it looks like there is no way I&#039;m going to be able to access this account unless Riot Support pulls their heads out of their asses and actually helps me for once and answers my ticket. I&#039;m hoping they will ask me questions about the account that I can prove the account is mine and reset the password but if they can&#039;t I will legitimately sue Riot Games for all the lost money (and my first time in gold).","replies":[{"poster":"Mikky D","date":"2016-07-28T07:35:02.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably cant sue since they could make the case that it was your own negligence that caused you to lose it and not theirs","replies":[{"poster":"thundernanners","date":"2016-07-28T16:36:21.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did think about that true, but is it my fault I cannot access the LoL account anymore?

Every year i get silver 1 with 90 lp. I get gold after the season ends and still stuck back in silver. Then when i get to my promos im stuck against diamonds in the game mode im playing in trying to get to gold like is that really fair ? its not just a freak incident either because it happens on a constant basis. Then when i get taken down to 0 lp i get demoted the second i lose a single game. Like how the heck is that fair at all ?  I worked my butt off to get that far and yet still seem to only get ruined by servers. How can a silver 1 player stuck with bronze 5 players beat a team full of diamonds. In what way is that possible to win? But thanks riot for basically making it impossible for me to even get a victorious skin. Maybe you all should spend more time fixing your ranked servers than ruining champions like gangplank and tristana.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperJIVE","date":"2016-08-08T09:19:14.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol are you cooked? You can't sue Riot because you can't log into your account, that's most likely just a glitch or something in their system. You went and told Riot Support you want to sue them and now they are required to not talk/assist you because anything they do that isn't sanctioned by a lawyer could (potentially) ruin the company. You could of provided credit card statements and shit as proof that it's your account and it would of been all g after maybe a week or so. Now you've fucked this way more needed and i guess your best bet is to say \"it was just a joke fam I'm angry\" or some shit like that. R.I.P your account and any chance of getting it back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"thundernanners","date":"2016-07-28T17:22:20.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/jkfaWyl\n\nCan someone tell me where this is?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-28T17:31:48.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thundernanners,realm=NA,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=8zrkHbzy,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-07-28T17:22:20.722+0000)\n>\n> http://imgur.com/jkfaWyl\n> \n> Can someone tell me where this is?\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse","replies":[{"poster":"thundernanners","date":"2016-07-28T18:54:37.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where exactly does it say they can refuse me help?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-29T09:58:10.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=thundernanners,realm=NA,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=8zrkHbzy,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2016-07-28T18:54:37.439+0000)\n>\n> Where exactly does it say they can refuse me help?\n\nFirst off, let me be very clear that I am not a legal expert and my opinions do not represent legal opinions, nor do they represent the opinions of Riot Games or their legal counsel. \n\nBelow is the section within the Terms of Use that it appears Riot is invoking, now that it is aware that you are looking into taking legal action. I will not make any interpretations beyond this. \n># XV. LEGAL DISPUTES\n**A. Negotiations.** Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except those Claims expressly excluded in Section XV.B below). Riot Games will send its notice to the address it has on file to the extent that you have provided additional contact information to Riot Games (e.g. by participating in a promotional or survey, or contacting a customer services representative). Otherwise, Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your Account. You will send your notice to Riot Games, Ltd., P.O. Box 11989, Dublin 2, IRELAND, Attn: Legal Department. Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.\n\n>**B. Exceptions to Negotiations.** To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, you and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights; (ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (iii) any Claim for equitable relief. To the extent applicable, you further agree not to bring Claims on a representative or class member basis, or as a private attorney general. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court (or equivalent) for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of litigation.\n\n>**C. Governing Law.** Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflict of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Game from outside of Ireland. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act of 1993 (the “Act”) may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, New Zealand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Act applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the Act which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement. If you access the Game from, and are a resident of, the European Community and you are a consumer, you may have other or additional mandatory rights or remedies by law as set out in this Agreement. The ACL may apply to the Game if you access the Game from, and are a resident of, Australia. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the ACL applies then you may have other rights or remedies as set out in the ACL which may apply in addition to or instead of those set out in this Agreement.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
