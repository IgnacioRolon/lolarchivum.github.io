(I also like AD and Blue Ezreal in bot) When Ezreal had his ult CD brought up by 40 seconds, I obviously knew this was going to hit AP Ezreal as well as AD Ezreal. In a way, I&#039;m glad about it, as there have been fewer Ezreals stomping bot lane without what ought to be, in my opinion, the required skill for the power.\r\n\r\nHowever, while it has done this, it has impacted AP Ezreal much more than it has AD Ezeal. AP Ezreal was always borderline for viable in most team comps, but now that his greatest weapon has 40 seconds more on its cooldown, I would say he is hardly ever viable.\r\n\r\nI think that the cooldown should be reduced to 100 seconds (I agree, 80 seconds was way to low). But even though essence reaver gives Ezreal insane CDR easily, this doesn&#039;t help AP Ezreal. Perhaps change the ult&#039;s AD ratio to 0.9 instead of 1 if concerned about him being too powerful, but I don&#039;t think this in necessary.\r\n\r\nIn my view this higher ult CD has done 2 main things to Ezreal:\r\n* Officialised Essence Reaver as his item\r\n* Forced AP Ezreal to get max (45% including masteries) CDR to compensate, limiting his build. (beforehand I would have either 25% or 35% CDR, but that is too weak now)\r\n\r\nI understand that Riot tries to not restrict the possibilities of what people can play, but this has taken a step down the wrong path.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR; By nerfing Ezreals ult as a way of compensating for Ezreals power surge from the new Essence Reaver, it has achieved it&#039;s goal, BUT has left AP Ezreal floundering with no hope.\r\n\r\nWhat do you all reckon?","replies":[]}
