Which makes most people want to film too so what if there was an option already built into lol twice enables the player to film there game so that they can share with friends or post on YouTube\n\nI got this idea mainly from Minecraft which has an option where any player can live stream there gameplay. It seems like it would be great if it worked on lol.\n\nPlease leave a comment or vote if you think this is a good idea\n:D","replies":[{"poster":"Falconite","date":"2015-01-20T20:57:42.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am creating another altered post of this so that more people can see it just so you know","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-19T07:52:06.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just get OBM and your done also it's free","replies":[{"poster":"Falconite","date":"2015-01-19T08:22:27.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you provide a link please :D","replies":[{"poster":"Indy Savvy","date":"2015-01-19T23:20:10.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here: https://obsproject.com/","replies":[{"poster":"Falconite","date":"2015-01-20T20:52:01.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does  this program work on macs?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-20T00:25:25.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OBM isn't bad, an quite a few streamers use it.
