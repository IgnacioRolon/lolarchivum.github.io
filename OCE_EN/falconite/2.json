Fiddlesticks, {{champion:9}} Reksai {{champion:421}}  & Elise {{champion:60}}  the main ones that come to mind.\nMaybe even Jungle Irelia? {{champion:39}} or kayle? {{champion:10}} They are uncommon junglers but can be really strong\n\nKha'zix is ok right now.

Its because they are Assassins so they are supposed to use stealth and a tonne of damage to surprise people and insta-kill them.\n\nI'd say Rek'Sai probably your best bet. He has good sustain, CC etc and you can build him a little tanky\n\nOOOHHH, XIN {{champion:5}} He's ok. He is great for learning how to jungle. You can build him tanky too.\nXin you usually build 2 damage items and 3 tank items so he's not so squishy but he can still kill people pretty fast.","replies":[{"poster":"Falconite","date":"2015-01-18T00:38:10.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-17T21:27:52.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:64}} {{champion:254}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:121}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZedHotChiliPeprs","date":"2015-01-17T11:24:31.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:9}} {{champion:111}}  both come to mind, naut doesn't have sustain ,but shield kinda negates damage, especially with buff. fid has CC, sustain and dps burst","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-17T11:22:38.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elise and Vi are my personal favorites both really fun & OP (at least at my elo)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-17T11:04:48.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the godyre","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-01-17T09:31:55.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shyv has good clear and if killing the entire enemy team is a cc then shyvanna can do it very well","replies":[]}]}
