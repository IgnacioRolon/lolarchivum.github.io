(mainly cos i dont think he can carry in solo queue anymore)\n\ni start W with a strong leash on krugs, or if im forced to start blue side i start Q cos gromp. so W Q or Q W depending on start.\nstarting red side i can clear whole jungle and get a gank off before needing to B usually.","replies":[{"poster":"Falconite","date":"2015-01-17T22:08:02.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot for the information king digger :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-17T09:25:36.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3723}} \n{{item:1001}} \n{{item:3134}} Or {{item:3155}} \n{{item:3111}} Or {{item:3117}} Or {{item:3047}} \n{{item:3035}} \n{{item:3078}} \n{{item:3071}} Or {{item:3142}} Or {{item:3156}} \n{{item:3026}} Or{{item:3143}} Or {{item:3102}} \n\nFirst 3 Levels: Q > W > E\nSkill Max Order: W > Q > E\nEvolve Order: W > E > Q\nMake sure to have Q and E on smart cast.\nAlways kill the little creeps first for isolation damage on the big creep.\nDO NOT ENGAGE TEAMFIGHTS OTHERWISE YOU WILL JUST GET INSTA CC'D AND DIE WITHOUT BEING HELPFUL.
