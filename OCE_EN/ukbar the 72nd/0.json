I&#039;ve played a few games as him (it?) and it&#039;s just a matter of time until he starts to rack up the kills and feast stacks. He ends up also with 3k+ health by the end if he builds {{item:3027}}. In the early game even if the enemy tries to trade with him he silences aa 1-3 times then follows up with an easy Q due to the fact they are running away. He then can simply get a few last hits (which is easy to do with his E) and let his passive give him health regen. Once he gets level six, he can either start getting feast stacks if the enemy is playing passively or 80%-0 his opponent with an all in. From there it&#039;s all downhill for the enemy team as by about 30 minutes (if fed) 1-shotting the enemy carries with his ult is possible.\r\n\r\nIf you havn&#039;t already try out full AP {{champion:31}} in mid and see how stupid he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-05-31T13:58:09.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am just surprised that after years of no attention Cho'Gath is apparently the Oppest thing ever now","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-01T00:12:10.258+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because he got played in competitive, his to op all of a sudden.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-05-31T10:52:35.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Cho'gath as a champion is retarded, hope he gets gutted, too much tankiness and burst, he's like a Pantheon who scales into lategame.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-31T11:20:17.967+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except cho can 1 shot you by landing 1 spell and you actually can't do anything if you get hit by his Q.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-01T03:03:46.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait...\nPantheon falls off late game. \nCan someone please clarify this.
