Meaning if I won 10/10 provisionals I would probably get Gold 5 or Silver 1? \n\nWhat I&#039;m trying to say is: Do the ranks in the preseason mean anything at all for season 6s chances at a higher rank?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-12T13:59:57.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes. if you change your rank in preseason it will effect your placements next season","replies":[{"poster":"Parkway Drive","date":"2015-11-12T14:07:20.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes!!

Gold 4 preseason to Silver 4 after provisional's.","replies":[]}]}
