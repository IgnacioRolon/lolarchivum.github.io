Today - all of a sudden - 15/11/2016, after playing another flex match, I&#039;m placed again... in bronze 2. WTF was the new placing for? At this rate, I&#039;ll just stop playing League coz this is incredibly frustrating! I played alot of matches this new season to get to Silver 4. Now I&#039;m in Bronze!??","replies":[{"poster":"Deviera","date":"2016-11-15T07:17:21.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noticed the same thing, I got placed in s4  from promos then climbed to s3 now I'm back in s5..\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}\n\nupdate: flex rank was never going to be a permanent rank, pretty sure it was just to see where your mmr level was in the new season, and if you won a fair amount of flex, it will take that into consideration and will help decide your placement for next season since usually you're placed in a lower division. \n\nupdate (again): http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/XMZm8OPI-ranked-corrections-to-placement-results-and-ranks this should explain everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Lou ","date":"2016-11-15T07:44:04.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But doing that after placing them once is kinda unfair to a few. Especially since League games take up alot of time and effort. Its not like players have the luxury of gaming ALL the time. Its just when their free. Putting effort into improving and then getting demoted all of a sudden, why should I bother trying? Flex should have been a separate option from actual ranked games. Its frustrating, annoying and it pisses me off! Especially if it was a testing phase for gamers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T08:27:23.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is unfair, but the placements were so broken that the ranks were unfair, the matches were unfair, and the LP gains were unfair. To everyone involve whether they moved up or down in ranks. What would be more unfair, would be leaving Plats in Bronze, and Bronzes in Plat. Leaving it as it was would have defeated the whole purpose of having ranks int he first place, and would have destroyed any competitive integrity int he queue.\n\nFlex queue can't be separate from ranked because it is a ranked queue, hence the need for a speedy fix.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
