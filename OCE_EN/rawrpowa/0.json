So much so that when I get placed in an off-role like jungle I forget smite. I&#039;m just too busy messing around with my rune pages to notice that anything&#039;s wrong. I know this is really my fault, but some kind of ping or warning to say &quot;you&#039;ve forgotten smite&quot; in ranked would save me a lot of hardship.\r\n\r\nThanks, Rory.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-11-10T10:26:17.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or at least if they are forcing junglers who accidentally forget smite to not buy the jungle items, force the jungle role to take smite. would solve the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"RawrPowa","date":"2017-11-10T11:11:46.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Because without smite there's no way to get through the jungle.
