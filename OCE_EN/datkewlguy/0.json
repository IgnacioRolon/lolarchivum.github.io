Whilst doing this I had an idea that if I could somehow upload that icon onto LoL and have it on my profile, the loading screen and in game, (scattered flags around teams base). Now if you were to do the coding and make this idea come to life you could put a price of maybe some RP or some IP so it will cut down on there being too many icons. If the icon is offending or rude then players should be able to report team icon at the end of game screen. Thankyou, tell me what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2015-11-26T11:00:08.866+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a pretty good idea. When I still cared about my ranked team, I used to beg for this all the time, seeing all the SKT and Fnatic pro team icons, I could always invision my own team icon. But the problem with this, even if you have to pay for it, is there would be too many Kappa team icons. If they could upload any image, it would be a pretty bad system. And since they don't check every single thing sent in by every single player, I doubt they would make a personal approval system.\n\nMaybe if they told you as part of their EULA / Terms and conditions that you promise the image is your own, and you can get punished if you brake this rule, this might be able to be a pretty good feature!\n","replies":[]}]}
