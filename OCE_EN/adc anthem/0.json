Bronzes to Golds shouldn't be complaining, but at least Golds know what they are doing. Illaoi is no where close to broken, I haven't seen one in months. That is like saying Tryndamere is broken, if you fought him 1v1 in his ult. I'm willing to bet you run up to her during a gank, get pulled and ulted and she double kills and then you complain.\n\nIllaoi is so useless. Just run out of her ult if you HAVE to group around her, and dodge her Q and E in lane. What the heck to you mean she can never die? Even if you are dumb enough to let her spam heal you still probably don't buy or take grievous wounds. And yes, if she is behind she is garbage like most champions. Obviously skill is not a factor into your games nor mine. It's bronze.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-20T07:43:54.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bad players complain about champs because they are bad.\nJust look at all the countless threads on Yasuo.\n\nRito balance champs based on high level play, not scrubs that can't get out of bronze and only build items based on what they found as a guide online.\nLearn how to counter your lane, learn how to build to a situation (not just what a guide tells you), and fucking LEARN HOW TO PLAY.\n\nIllaoi is nowhere near the list of \"Rito plz\" champ nerfs, this is seriously just a L2P issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-20T08:57:00.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to say it but I agree with you.","replies":[]}]}]}
