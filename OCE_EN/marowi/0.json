Saturdays and Sundays fortnightly the tournaments will take place, providing off weeks for the casual player on weekends. Five tournaments total throughout the league will take us to the Promotion tournament where you can take on the Challenger Series (OCS) teams, to take their place in the first structured league heading to the OPL!_\n\n**The schedule is as follows:**\nWeek 1 Tournament (Feb 20 ~ Feb 21)\nWeek 2 Tournament (Mar 5 ~ Mar 6)\nWeek 3 Tournament (Mar 19 ~ Mar 20)\nWeek 4 Tournament (Apr 2 ~ Apr 3)\nWeek 5 Tournament (Apr 16 ~ Apr 17)\nPromotion/Relegation Matches (Apr 25 ~ May 1)\n\n**Where can I sign up?**\nYour path to pro starts right here on Battlefy: [OOL Week 1!](https://battlefy.com/riot-games-oceanic-open-ladder)\n\n**Day 1 (Preliminaries)** will see a round robin tournament with varying sizes, dependant on signups. The reason behind this is to provide an opportunity for all teams entering to garner experience in a competitive environment, familiarising themselves with day long competition. If they were to succeed and make it towards the OCS, this practice will prove vital moving into a league structure. The round robin will see approximately 4 games played between groups, with the top 2 teams from each group succeeding into Playoffs.\n**Day 2 (Playoffs)** of competition will be a single elimination bracket with best of 1 play up until the finals run which will break off into a best of 3 format. With the first day providing maximum player experience and opportunity to show off your skill, playoffs narrows the pack down to the find the absolute highest performing teams to challenge the top of the ladder. \n\nThe ladder will be concurrent with the league and a constantly updated system where your placement in both days will prove vital. The points will reward both consistent entry into the fortnightly tournaments and results in the same tournaments, slightly favoured towards results (as you&rsquo;d expect).\n\nAn example of how the ladder looks will be added to the [Website for OOL](http://oce.lolesports.com/leagues/oceanic-open-ladder) as the weeks commence!\n\n**How do the points work?**\nBasically the system will be rewarding placement and consistently in near equal amounts, inclined towards results to promote those aspirational competitive teams. We provide points for the preliminary results, varying in equal amounts from 1st to 4th in each respective group. This leads into playoff points which are weighted more heavily for results.\n\n**Preliminaries (Day 1) Points**\n1st - 20 points\n2nd - 15 points \n3rd - 10 points\n4th - 5 points\n5th - 0 points\n\n**Playoffs (Day 2) Points**\n1st Place  - 90 points\n2nd place - 60 points\n3rd Place - 40 points \n4th Place - 30 points\n5th - 8th Place - 20 points \n9th - 16th Place - 10 points \n17th - 32th Place - 5 points\n\n**Who can join?**\nThe question isn&rsquo;t who, but why! The Oceanic Open Ladder is your path to pro league, whilst we have no restrictions on joining, it&rsquo;s in yours and your team&#039;s best interest to be willing to learn &amp; improve from every respective OOL event. We welcome all entries who wish to take their craft as far as possible, but unfortunately due to the best possible player experience, we have to cap the total signups at 160 teams, so get in fast!\n\n**Prizes?**\nQuite simply, yes there will be RP prizes for every individual event, without a larger one for final placement. We are focusing on rewarding consistency as mentioned earlier, we want teams to commit and show that they can continue to commit through to a league format that is the OCS.\nPrizes are as follows:\n\n**RP &amp; PRIZES FOR STANDINGS (Per Player)**\n1st Place - Triumphant Ryze &amp; 3200 RP\n2nd Place - 2800 RP\n3rd Place - 2100 RP\n4th Place - 1100 RP\n5th - 8th Place - 800 RP\n9th - 16th Place - 500 RP\n17th - Last - 0 RP\n\nFor those who wish to get into the nitty gritty of the OOL and suss out the ruleset, we have them ready to go and in place here! \nStandout feature: Maximum 160 teams due to optimal player experience and aforementioned tournament structure.\n\nYou can find the [**OOL Rules here!**](http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com.s3.amazonaws.com/public/riot-oce/2016OOLRulesv1.0.pdf)\n\n**Will there be a broadcast and how can I get involved?**\nOne last thing that should be of interest to a select few is the ability to shoutcast or produce the OOL! At present we have a form for you to fill out, this form will be your expression of interest towards casting the OOL officially. Though we don&rsquo;t have any restrictions on the league being casted from third party sources, we do however offer a lot of benefits to those who opt into the form and getting designated casts through us here. Fill out the below form, we will try and create collaborations and set up as many casting avenues as possible. It&rsquo;s always preferred and better for broadcasts to have at least 2 casters involved for. The broadcast will be a &lsquo;bedroom cast&rsquo; format, casual and only the passionate and willing need apply!\n\n[**Caster Application Form!**](http://goo.gl/forms/2nVaFXZBPQ)\n\nThe reason we&rsquo;ve decided to have casting applications is to find, develop and nurture local talent to be the best they can be! With every event we wish to put the best foot forward, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. You&rsquo;re welcome to host your own stream but it&rsquo;s very easy to find direction as the nominated go-to source for OOL action. It&rsquo;s also a place we can direct viewers on each week as you get to work with tournament admins and actively find new games to broadcast throughout!\n\nIf you&rsquo;ve got any questions about the schedule, how to enter, rulings or something you believe I may have missed in this post, just leave a comment below.\n\nOtherwise thanks a bunch and I look forward to seeing your team take their shot at OPL fame!\n\nCheers,\nRusty.\n---\nRusty is standing by to answer any questions you might have, so fire away!\n\n-- Marowi","replies":[{"poster":"FlyingFinn","date":"2016-02-11T11:11:06.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really interested in the casting side of this, hopefully can get involved and put some advice given to me to good use!","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-02-11T13:25:54.911+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to hear it, make sure that forms filled out and good to go!","replies":[{"poster":"FlyingFinn","date":"2016-02-11T13:35:46.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will we get some sort of confirmation that it's gone through at all?","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-02-12T00:44:30.651+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confirmation that it's gone through unfortunately not via an email of any sorts just yet.

Are you looking for casters who will stream on an official Riot Games channel?

As in, will you be issuing overlays, scene structures etc? Or will we still be putting together our own overlays  etc?\n2a. To what extent will we be able to feature our own graphics? For example, will a community organisation be able to feature their logo on stream? Will we be able to feature our own sponsor's logos on stream?\n3.  How will access to matches work? Will Riot allocate matches, or will it be a matter of knowing when they happen and just spectating to stream, or some other method?\n3a. Will there be a match quota to meet, for e.g. \"you need to do x matches per week\". And will there be any mandatory scheduling, for e.g. \"We need you to stream every Monday from 7pm onwards for the next x weeks\"\n4.  To what extent can we be a \"packaged deal\"? We have a producer and 2 casters that are keen to work together - will we be able to or will Riot be assigning casting teams that might split us up?\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-02-15T02:52:52.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Casters will be broadcasting on their personal channels/producer channels. We won't necessarily be involved with mentoring unless time permits, I'll be trying my best to provide active and retrospective feedback but it isn't something I can appropriately promise!\n\n2. a) I'm trying to get overlays and other assorted things put into effect, but until you see them assume they aren't available and non-essential to the broadcast. You can utilize all of your own stuff, as per your desire.\n    b) Absolutely you can advertise your own brand. Just make sure you're advertising your brand ON the OOL, not your brand featuring the OOL, use common sense and you'll find a very happy medium, I trust you.\n\n3. I will be designating a broadcaster for the weekened/day of the weekend, they will work with admins and find games where available, or you are more then able to find, you can ideally find fresh matches but you're more than welcome to join games in progress, again as per your preference.\na) No quota to meet, it's all on your capaibilities, if you're broadcast it would make the most sense to fit as much of the day in as possible. If I had to choose, you'd be getting all of day 2 but day 1 is flexible.\n\n4. The caster form above has plenty of information regarding your roles and preferences as a casting team, if you're a team you are more than welcome to stay as a team. We won't split people up that have these preference and as long as you ensure the preferences are included in the forms, you should be fine!\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lonjanis","date":"2016-02-15T02:47:35.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chrisis,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=vAdzwJp2,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2016-02-15T02:08:39.678+0000)\n>\n> Rusty, I have a few questions regarding casting the OOL:\n> \n> 1.
