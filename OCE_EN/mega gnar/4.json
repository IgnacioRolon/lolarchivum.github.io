Ok where to start?\n\n1) It's INCREDIBLY disrespectful. I've seen this idea of an ANZAC skin for OCE suggested a few times. League of Legends is not an appropriate place to remember and commemorate fallen soldiers, much less doing it because of a bad pun you can make with a characters name.\n\n2) It's a bad concept in general. You have a bad pun for a name and...? The concept falls apart there because there would be no way to make this a skin short of putting Zac in a military uniform.\n\n3) OCE isn't just Australia and New Zealand. Riot have said numerous times the reason why the OCE skin hasn't come out is because it's hard to fully encompass all of the regions that OCE is in one skin. And to save you the trouble of looking up what countries are in Oceania (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania)","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-04-18T06:20:38.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What makes you believe its incredibly disrespectful?? Also what makes you believe hes implying its to be an oceanic skin? I agree its bad taste with the ZAC champ though. \n\nWhat is an appropriate place? Id say everywhere, because its about remembering the ANZACS from day to day living and gaming is what a lot of people do. They have the ANZAC league test. Rugby League is a game isn't it? Whats the difference? \n\nThe only factor is the money gained from the sale of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-18T07:35:43.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's incredibly disrespectful because the whole reason why it's being created is a bad pun you can make with his name and because the champion has a lack of skins. The intent wasn't 'Let's make a skin that we can use to honour fallen soldiers. Real people, brothers, sons, fathers, who died. Who is an appropriate champ that we could use to represent the message?' It was 'Hey, Zac's name fits in the word ANZAC, let's make an ANZAC skin.' Can you not see the disrespect there?\n\nAlso, nevermind the fact that thematically it makes no damn sense for someone with Zac's kit to even have a soldier themed skin, do you not see an issue with a skin based on real fallen soldiers on a champion who passive literally has him **exploding apart**? Can you honestly say you could look a veteran in the eye and say 'See this character him? We made him to honour you. Look at how chunks of him fall off when he hits people.'\n\nAnd he suggested this as an idea for the launch skin of the OCE severs. Whenever a new server launched for League, they always released a new skin that thematically fit that country so far there has been:\n\nSultan Tryandamere for Turkey Server\nSpecial Forces Gangplank for Brazil Server\nGlaive Warrior Pantheon for Romania Server\nMythic Cassiopeia for Greece Server\nWinged Hussar Xin Zhao for Poland Server\nGladiator Draven for Italy Server\nGhost bride Morghana for Latin America Server\nBear Calvary Sejuani for Russia Server\n\nHowever when OCE launched, there was no unique skin with the launch because Riot said it was too hard to create a skin that captured all of the OCE countries in one skin. This guy is suggesting this idea be that skin, and I'm saying that Riot won't do that because if they were just going to acknowledge Aus as being the only OCE country they would have done it already.\n\nAnd the reason why there is a difference between rugby league and League of Legends is because rugby league is a sport with that has a tied history between Australia and New Zealand (and I'd like to point out the ANZAC league started in 1997) that was made to honour ANZAC's around or on ANZAC day. There is a moment of silence and the whole event is incredibly respectful.\n\nLeague of Legends on the other hand is a video game where a rat with a cross bow shoots at a guy who can teleport and throw light at people. A game where people on a regular basis insult others and use the word gay as an insult. A game where characters** die**.\n\nThere has never, and will never, be an appropriate time for ANZAC's to be acknowledged in a game like League of Legends, and the fact that I have to explain it this much depressed me a little.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-04T08:50:57.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SoSinister,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=r7W1HYqh,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-02-04T00:31:04.053+0000)\n>\n> Well being Australian and also love League of legends...

And reference to the guys losing on the Turkish front, we kind of didn't.   As you maybe all aware it was a battlefield and we won WWI.   On that one battlefield alot of soldiers lost their lives from both sides.  Please try not to sully those lost lives and really understand the gravity behind ANZAC day and all service personnel out there. \nRemember this is just a pixelated computer game that we enjoy to play.   Not a life changing event.","replies":[]}]}
