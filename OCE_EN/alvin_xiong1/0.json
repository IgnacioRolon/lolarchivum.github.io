I really disagree with with cause to some people they can just shrug it off like it&#039;s nothing. But one thing I want to say to whoever that&#039;s going to see this post, please be open-minded and mature about this topic. I&#039;m honestly getting sick and tired of people going with the flow saying all this meme stuff. Don&#039;t get me wrong memes or certain memes are cool and funny but to have a meme like kys isn&#039;t cool. If you think about it what if your best friend, wife, husband, daughter, son and so on got told in a game that they liked by some person who knows the kys meme to kys and they did it because they go through a lot and video games is a way or might be the only way for them to relax or escape the stress or pressure in reality. I mean we never know who is going through what cause the world of social media or video games is massive, I MEAN MASSIVE! So we really don&#039;t know who goes through what at all. So to say all that bitter stuff to someone else could or possibly end their lives and we will never know it. But let me tell you guys a little story as well as my rant that I have that happened to me. I just recently finished a game and this Lux support &quot;NAME REMOVED&quot; won her/his game and told me to kys after the game and left. I&#039;m going to be real upset if they don&#039;t ban her/his profile permanently. People need to understand that just cause it&#039;s online it doesn&#039;t affect people. In reality yes it does affect other gamers. What if you told someone to kys and they actually did, or what if you don&#039;t know that their only escape of pain is video games and you tell them to kys and they do it. So with this meme of kys I honestly think people should take consideration and stop the kys stuff cause it&#039;s really not cool and it&#039;s really immature especially if you say you have common sense but you still use it. I&#039;ve thrown out my ten-cents. Reason why I&#039;m telling this is because we as a video game community should really take this seriously and really do something about it. Like I said at the beginning of this post please be open-minded and mature about this topic and I really don&#039;t want anyone to end hurting themselves cause of this kys meme. So with everything said and done, I really would like RIOT to consider this and take it seriously as well as other gaming communities out there as well. Stay safe and think about what you are going to say even in the midst of your emotions during games to not say or do something that will hurt others as well as yourself, it&#039;s not worth it. Stay safe and have fun on out there on the Rift people.{{champion:11}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-12T11:41:01.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that no one _should_ be saying things like that. And I personally wouldn't use it in league.  It certainly doesn't do any good, and if its not doing any good, I don't think it has any place anywhere.\n\nHowever I take issue with the whole _\"What if someone actually does it?_\" argument though.\nIf someone is that close to suicide that some 12 year old saying 3 letters in a virtual anonymous competitive world pushes them over the edge, as horrible as it sounds, I think it is pretty much inevitable at that point :S _(i feel like a dick saying that, but its probably the truth.)_\n\nIts not fair to dump _\"You killed someone because you said X to them!\"_ on someone. If they are that close to ending it, there is wayyyy more than 1 trigger involved, and the final straw could indeed be 3 letters on league, or it could be just that there wasn't enough weetbix left in the box this morning. It's not a rational state of mind, so the final trigger could be just about anything. So blaming it on a meme is irresponsible.\n\nIm not a stranger to the subject, I have a friend who I was very close with at the time, try to commit suicide several times, and thats a hard time for everyone around them, as well as themselves. and like lots of people I have also grappled with elements of depression before myself _(although admittedly not to the extent of self harm or anything like that)_. \nSo im not just some ignorant random here.\n\n______\n\nSo I fully support not having it _(along with other scathing remarks)_ said in games like league, but purely for the reason of making the league environment a better and more enjoyable place, not for putting the burden of preventing suicide onto the player base.\n\nThe sad burden of preventing a suicide falls to the people around that person, any signs however small should not be ignored and should be reported to someone like their parents or caregivers _(however embarrassing or awkward it may be)_. And its up to friends and family to help that person through that tough time. _(and to be honest, I don't think escaping into fantasy worlds is the best thing for people in that situation anyway, they need to be brought closer to the world, not drawn away from reality, imo. so league and other immersive games maybe shouldn't even be on the table?)_\n\nYou can't put that same burden onto every player in league, gamers come here to this virtual world to escape and have fun and to be someone they cant be in real life, and while ideally they shouldn't be mean to eachother, they also shouldn't have to tippy toe around everyone else's unknowable baggage.\n\nTeen suicide is a big problem, and one that can be avoided!\nbut attributing it to gaming is no different than attributing violent crimes to gaming.\n\nSuicidal people will find a reason with or without gaming, just like violent people will be violent with or without GTA or COD.\n\nThis is of course my own opinion on the matter.\nbut I think I'm being fairly open minded here.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-12T17:05:02.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR: Games don't make people into violent sociopaths, just like telling someone to kys isn't the reason that they actually end up doing it, People just need to fix their perceptions and focus on why these people are having issues, and trying to help them before this shit occurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-12T23:11:47.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9mMjwEVc,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2017-12-12T17:05:02.773+0000)\n>\n> TL;DR: Games don&#x27;t make people into violent sociopaths, just like telling someone to kys isn&#x27;t the reason that they actually end up doing it, People just need to fix their perceptions and focus on why these people are having issues, and trying to help them before this shit occurs.\n\nKiss your self","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-12T15:42:46.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9mMjwEVc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-12-12T11:41:01.514+0000)\n-snip-\n\nHey you made a good post for once. From a toxicity standpoint if Riot wants the game to be non-toxic they should probably make kys a 14 day straight up. I feel like telling someone to go and kill themselves is on the same tier (or worse) than being racist or homophobic and those are 14 day bans if reported.\n\nOn a personal level however I agree with you. If someone kills themselves because I said kys on the internet I won't have any guilt because there is a 99% chance they would of anyway. I don't really care about online toxicity at all regardless. Browsing the internet or playing online games is optional if you can't handle the heat, stay out of the nuclear reactor.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RAV3N","date":"2018-01-02T22:21:14.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This as well as using \"gay\", \"autistic\", or \"female bashing\" anything else like that as an insult should have zero tolerance IMHO\n\nThis is 2018, we should know better than that!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakescape","date":"2017-12-26T07:34:28.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're words on a computer screen. If you take anything said on the internet seriously from people WHO DO NOT KNOW YOU then the problem is not with them, it's with you being too sensitive. Getting offended by what anyone says on League to you is probably the dumbest thing you can do and even worse is when it frustrates you to a point where you gotta make a thread about it. You my friend should maybe stop using the internet if you're getting this frustrated with it.\n\nIf someone says that to me, my response would be to laugh or ignore it. It's been overused that many times that you should honestly become numb to it. That being said, anyone else who actually gets offended by it or god forbid actually does it then they should stop using the internet all together. They will see it EVERYWHERE not just on League. The internet is a place where people say whatever they want because they're anonymous and anyone who cannot handle being called names or getting told to kys then stop using it. Stop trying to censor and make it a less fun place because your feelings get hurt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-12T15:38:05.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name and shame lol prepare for --Name Removed-- , kiddo","replies":[]}]}
