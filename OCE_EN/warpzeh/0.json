I have climbed out of bronze 5, as well has have coached 3 different players out of b5 in the past couple of months.\n\n**1. Join a premade team.**\nBronze V is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots. Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff.\n**2. Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze v vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank). On top of this, play easy champs. Champs that aren't too mechanically intensive, so that new players will be able to identify what they do (a lot of B5 is made up of new players), no point playing Eve/Yasuo when it is highly likley your team wont know how to synergise with them.\n\n**3. Get super good at two roles.**\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand. Fill is your worst enemy. Leave filling roles to normals. \n\n**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n\n_Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be._\n\n**5. Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game. \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-02T13:11:15.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're bronze 5 literally anyone, anything, any advice, can help you improve. obviously real advice not stuff like \"always flash ignite under their tower cos faker does it\". then it becomes a matter of your mechanics and your ability to work with your teammates, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-02T06:45:55.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Silver 5 player could legitimately help you so much, I'm in promos for Gold right now, but since I'm not Gold yet, I definitely can't help you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-01T06:01:59.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're bronze 5 cos you think the only advice you're worthy of is that of people gold or higher","replies":[{"poster":"Warpzeh","date":"2016-04-02T06:41:52.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no. i want advice from the people that are 3 times better than me that i know can help me improve.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2016-04-02T05:20:23.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My own thoughts to this is that every Elo is elo hell and that you should not think about it at all. Focusing on the game and on yourself in improving in every game will assist you. There are a lot of things that should be questioned on such as what is your main roles, who do you play and what do you do in game. Use lol spectate or replays and you can reflect on play style and decision making.","replies":[]}]}
