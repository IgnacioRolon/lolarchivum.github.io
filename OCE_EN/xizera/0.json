I have been using a temporary account ever since but I want to get my old acc back as it was from season 2 and i had invested a LOT of money &amp; time into it. I ended up sending a ticket with no luck and no hope, i know it would be hard for Riot to trust me but if you can check the ip before the account got suspended you could see, i feel like I&#039;ve been robbed and riot can&#039;t do anything about it? I know i left it too late but i just gave up instantly. All that time/money just gone into thin air {{item:3070}}. Is there any way I can combat this claim or at least get the skins transferred over to my new account I&#039;ve tried many avenues like Facebook, Reddit etc just want my old account back any help is much appreciated, Thanks ‚úåÔ∏è","replies":[{"poster":"KingB1","date":"2017-06-03T08:30:02.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey I have just had the same thing happened to me. like 3 days ago my account got hacked!. they have changed my user name and my email address could someone HELP ME PLEASE..
