I've tested this before because I was curious.\n\nI'll see if I can test Graves + Runaan's and see what happens when I add in 100% crit. Honestly, I'm not expecting Runaan's to work with Graves just because of the nature of his attacks, we'll see though.\n\nEDIT: Tried it out just now, and Runaan's works. The extra crit chance just means you'll have the 8 (or 10 with IE) shots on your attacks more often, with it being every shot at 100% (from what I could tell that is).","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-11-11T01:37:47.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds weird to imagine","replies":[]}]}
