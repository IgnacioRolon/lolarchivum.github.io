I&#039;m trying to practice support and I would like to have several rune pages to combine them. A few things:\r\n- I have over 110k IP, so buying runes and runepages is not a problem\r\n- I have all champions\r\n- I don&#039;t need a rune page for AP supports (Zyra/annie/etc).\r\n\r\nIf you can point me to guides or basic runes setups for supports champs that are not AP heavy I would be very happy.  This includes Thresh, Leona, Tahm, Bard, Blitz, Lulu, Braum, and anyone else you could think of.\r\n\r\nMastery pages for them are also welcomed.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-13T22:21:54.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Armour marks and quints, hp seals, MR or MR/lvl glyphs is a pretty solid page that is useful on most tanky supports.\n\nTheres plenty of other stuff you can use for more specific champions or in certain matchups, I'd recommend checking out probuilds.net or a similar site if you want a better idea of runes/masteries/builds for certain champions","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-13T14:36:08.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(i'm a Plat V {{champion:53}} main )\n\n**AD Marks, Armour Seals, MR Glyphs, Armour Quints** (I use this for most supports)\n\nOR\n\nArmour Marks, HP/Armour Seals, MR Glyphs, Armour Quints\n\nYou can also run CDR Glyphs if you want but most supports build a lot of CDR so i find it a waste.\nI'm also not a fan of Gold gen runes\nYou can also use Hybrid Pen marks if you really want to. I use them on my AP support page.\n\nI know some Blitz players like Mana glyphs for a little more oomph on their mana shield as well as the extra mana is nice for laning\n\nYou generally want to avoid scaling runes since in 99% of games, you are going to be the lowest level in the game, you usually won't get or take a long time to get the full benefit of scaling runes.\n\nYou can also try:** Armour Marks, Armour Seals, MR Glyphs and Movespeed Quints** (for roaming)\n\nI usually use the classic 0-9-21 mastery page. http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/summoners/masteries/#0.3Cvo_ae.7m1eo.PFaflhk0\n\nAlthough sometimes I might change it to 0-13-17 for more tankiness. http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/summoners/masteries/#0.3Cvo_fK.3ZNwiXfeo.PFaNH880","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matthew Davies13","date":"2015-08-13T12:31:44.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there, I'm a Silver Tier Support Main. \n\nFrom my experience the most common support setups have:-\n-Flat armor runes (since you are almost always against an adc)\n-Magic Resist scaling per level (Generally good defense against the enemy support as they tend to do magic damage)\n-Magic Penetration (as most supports do mainly magic damage)\n\n\nSome optional rune setups include:-\nMana Regen\nGold/second\nHealth/second\n1 x Crit Chance (The thinking behind this is basically, even if it's 1 in 100, that critical might turn the tide of battle)\nDouble Penetration\nFlat AD/AP or Scaling\nMovement Speed\n\nI recommend any guide website for rune pages for specific champs, as well as fine-tuning your rune page to suit your playstyle. For example I carry extra defensive runes instead of offensive since I enjoy playing tanks.","replies":[]}]}
