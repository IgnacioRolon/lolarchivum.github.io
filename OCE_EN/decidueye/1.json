Rediculous, riot once again never cease to amaze me (or annoy me?). Totally unfair just cause they still haven&#039;t figured out  how to fix their horrid client.\n\nEdit: might I add most of the reasons for people leaving champ select in the first place are valid enough to not be punished. Is it too evil I want to leave champ select to play with a friend? what if something comes up mid champ select out of my control? is it too much to ask to be able to leave champ select without being punished?

The catalyst for the white screen is you disconnecting from PvP.net. So the problem is with your internet connection, not the client.\n\nSecondly, I think it is stupidly selfish to want to leave champion select with zero repercussions, wasting 9 other players time just to play with your friend. It was your choice to accept the match. You're basically accepting an agreement that you'll follow the rules when you hit the accept button.\n\nRiot has placed these measures in the game for a reason. I'm sure Riot don't want to be punishing their players at all, but sadly, the world is full of self-gratifying narcissists that think they can do what they want.\n\nRiot is a great company, and we should be thankful for a company that does its damnedest to listen to the community and create on-going content that could potentially last for another decade.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-11-07T13:24:49.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so the client dying is because you lose conneciton temporarily and the game goes to a black screen until the game starts. simple fact that its on you to have a clear connectoin with no dropouts and issues with networks.","replies":[]}]}
