In exchange, instead of using mana, he uses Water Charges. Rush'ka gains a charge every 10 seconds, and has a maximum of 5 charges.\n\nQ [Waterfall] - \n\nRush'ka unleashes a ball of water, which splashes Refreshing Water on allies (not on Rush'ka) and deals damage on enemies. After a brief delay, the ball will unleash a jet stream of water, damaging and stunning all enemies hit.               [SKILL SHOT, MEDIUM WIDTH, SHORT RANGE]\n\n                        Refreshing Water: shields allies for a large amount for 2 seconds\n\nW [Striking Serpent] - \n\nRush'ka unleashes a serpent towards an enemy, dealing true damage, slowing the enemy and applies Deathful Water.     [POINT AND CLICK]\n\n                        Deathful Water: Anyone affected by Deathful Water will take 50% more damage and deal 25% less damage.\n\nE [Rushing Jet] - \n\nRush'ka becomes a rushing jet, gaining a massive movement speed boost. After the effect has ended, Rush'ka will apply Refreshing Water on himself. Using abilities, attacking or taking    damage instantly removes Rushing Jet and puts it on cooldown. Rush'ka will also gain a Water Charge after the effect has ended. Rush’ka will also gain a small heal.    [SELF BUFF]\n\nR [Spirit of the Serpent] -\n\n Rush'ka releases a spirit of a water serpent, applying a huge slow all enemies hit, deals massive amount of damage and applies Refreshing Water on all allies nearby. Spirit of the serpent knocks back enemies at rank 3.      [SKILL SHOT, BIG RANGE AND WIDTH]\n\n                                      Passive: Upon gaining a kill, Rush'ka will gain maximum Water Charges.\n\nAll basic abilities cost 1 Water Charge, while Spirit of the Serpent costs 2 Water Charges.\n\n\nAll of Rush'ka's abilities have an AP ratio. Striking Serpent has an additional AD ratio.\n\nRush'ka is an AP mage who stands in the backline, providing large amounts of damage and crowd control. Rush'ka is extremely effective in 1v1 as his crowd control and his Striking Serpent true damage allows him to break through tanks and squishes.\n\nYou should max out Q as it has the shortest cooldown and does the most damage. After that, maxing W is more effective for the true damage and damage spike bonus.\n\nCombos: Charge at an enemy with Rushing Jet. Use Striking Serpent to apply Deathful Water then use Waterfall to stun them. This should leave them at about 1/2 health if you're not too far behind. After that, use Spirit of the Serpent to finish them off, as it does an extreme amount of damage, and is deadly to those with low health as it is an extremely hard ability to dodge as it has wide width and long range.\n\nWaterfall has a fairly short range, about the same width and range as Maokai's Arcane Smash [Q]. Spirit of the Serpent has about the same width/range as Braum's Glacial Fissure [R]. Rushing Jet has about the same movement speed bonus as Quinn's Tag Team [R].\n\nRush'ka can work in the middle lane, but works well in the jungle. Thanks to Spiritual Water, he doesn't need to worry about mana costs and cooldowns. He has a good gap closer thanks to Rushing Jet, and can provide hard crowd control with Waterfall. He also has the sustain thanks to Refreshing Water. The slow on Spirit of the Serpent is also good in fights, as for example, someone just barely manages to escape its deadly damage, the slow will help Rush'ka and his team to catch up. Rush'ka's main damaging ability is Waterfall as it has the highest AP ratio; deals a good amount of base damage and has the shortest cooldown. With Striking Serpent’s Deathful Water and true damage, Rush’ka shouldn’t have too many problems with tanks.\n\nAlthough Rush'ka has the power to obliterate the enemy team and can deal an enemy's full health with Striking Serpent if he's ahead enough, he has no defensive abilities and without Rushing Jet, he has no escape in his kit. Although he does have the stun from Waterfall, the delay from it may not be enough time considering how low base armour and magic resist he has. It is also dangerous to spam his abilities. Although they have a low cooldown thanks to Spiritual Water, he holds Water Charges instead of mana, which means he has to wait 50 seconds to gain a full bar of Water Charges. Rush'ka can gain a full bar instantly only if he gets a killing blow on an enemy.\n\nRush'ka's an supportive offensive mage with insane damage and can also provide good crowd control and shields for his team.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-30T10:47:34.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rish'ka, it sounds less cheesy?\n\nand i dont think void champs use water...\n\nw a little broken\nditto e\nditto r\n\nwhy is the ult named differently in the cost section?\n\nand w would probably be maxed over q, pretty sure damage reduction and increased damage outweighs a spell that would be used more as a shield than damage\n","replies":[{"poster":"ªµº","date":"2015-11-30T11:00:38.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=VEf5lqgJ,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-30T10:47:34.068+0000)\n>\n> Rish'ka, it sounds less cheesy?\n> \n> and i dont think void champs use water...\n> \n> w a little broken\n> ditto e\n> ditto r\n> \n> why is the ult named differently in the cost section?\n> \n> and w would probably be maxed over q, pretty sure damage reduction and increased damage outweighs a spell that would be used more as a shield than damage\n\nthinking of a new name right now (he's not supposed to be void-related) and E and R are similar to other champions abilities but have slight differences here and there. The W's damage reduction and increased damage always stays no matter what rank and the AP/AD ratios on it aren't very high. The Q has a reasonable ratio and has CC and is a supportive skill. The shield from the Q does not apply on the champion itself, only on allies.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-11-30T06:16:32.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The kit is well thought through, which is easy to see because it contains a lot of everything it needs. Just be careful with the ability to heal allies. Maybe you could make it so that it gives a shield instead of healing, and true damage is okay in a kit, just be careful because (especially with point and click abilities) it could be a little too strong. And one last thing, I like the name. But names with commas are often referred to the void (Vel'Koz Kha'Zix Kog'Maw), so either take out the comma or you could incorporate some void oriented abilities. And Ravenous Hydra {{item:3074}} and Titanic Hydra {{item:3748}} are already implemented in the game, it could be better to come up with a new champion description thing (you know what i mean) which doesnt have 'Hydra' in it. This is a very well rounded champion, and a great start to something that could go a lot further.\n\nI really like the use of a new resource, because if every champion had mana it would get really boring. And you could also think about something cool and snowbally, whereby maybe if Rush'Ka kills an enemy champion he immediately gains a new Water Charge. This could add a whole new dimension to the champion's playstyle. \n\nAnyway ill stop ranting, this is really good though. And you could improve it by adding in a few extra details.\nAll the best in the new season","replies":[{"poster":"ªµº","date":"2015-11-30T10:22:15.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the healing may be a bit too much I guess a shield would be much better. Also the passive on the ult does let him gain maximum Water Charges on killing blows. The name and \"hydra\" concept does definitely needs changing though, so thanks on feedback on that. The true damage on the W shouldn't be too risky, I had sort of Rek'Sai's E damage in mind. The basic idea around this champion is an AP made who works in both jungle and mid lane; can take out carries easily; has uniqueness and has low defenses. Thanks for the feedback though, helped lot. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ªµº","date":"2015-11-30T03:25:59.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd appreciate any sort of feedback!","replies":[]}]}
