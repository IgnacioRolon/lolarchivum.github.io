It basically does nothing other then give you 100 armour...which in the current meta..doesn&#039;t help anyway. I know it got a rework a little while ago and stacking more armour on top of your thornmail &#039;apparently gives it more reflect damage...but in the current state..it does not. Actually ANY lifesteal can basically negate the damage coming off the item..let alone any magic resist or other mean the attacker has. The item&#039;s passive is basically useless and needs a rework to fit the current meta or remove or change it entirely.\r\n\r\nThe old thornmail in the old meta was fine..it punished heavy AD teams and was quite noticeable...only attackers with very high lifesteal negated it effects...these days in preseason I run the item alot and i&#039;ve only ever seen one adc crit me when I was like 300 armour and take &#039;alittle&#039; bit of life off him..and he didn&#039;t have any lifesteal. Basically any champ with some sort of passive lifesteal or ability that does lifesteal in any way the item wont work on. It barely works on auto attack champ with no lifesteal/MR.\r\n\r\nCan you please do something about it...its (was) a great item.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-02T07:18:39.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just choose {{item:3068}}  over it . thormails always been a hit and miss item for any other champ but rammus imho.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-01-09T11:21:39.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but the idea of having items in the game is so everyone can use them if necessary, Not just for certain champs, or they'd restrict all items to certain champs.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-09T12:16:33.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm all for the arguements put forth in this thread ,but in its current state there are better items to put in your build.it would be nice to see it get a buff or a rework sometime this year","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-05T07:58:36.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still get it if they have a fed Yi and Vayne, and maybe have some other fed AD champs. Otherwise I do feel that other items like {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} or {{item:3068}} are better in general. It does needâ€¦. something else. Maybe like a passive where every auto attack you get hit by makes the enemy bleed, increasing with each additional auto (up to a maximum amount?). The more autos, the more damage. It could be more than say Sunfire's damage, but spread out for longer as a bleed effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-02T09:48:07.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the enemy team is heavy AD it is still a good item with it's passive 15% + 25% bonus, BEFORE any resistances, but as it is only from basic or in hit attacks it is quite useless. Recently playing Yi I still notice it hurts given that he is a 99% basic attack champion.\n\nThe problem is not Thronmail, but the new champs who can dish out a ton of damage with nothing but skills, not AA. Given the change to how champions are made they need to include skill shots to also be reflected, it will make someone like Ekko think twice about attacking you since doing 1000 damage will reflect, before resistances, 400 damage. That to someone with 1600 health is not good.","replies":[]}]}
