It says its Opening league but it just cancels the shortcut altogether.\r\n\r\nHow/What do I do to fix this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-11T02:53:20.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, try this:\n\nDelete the lol_launcher and lol_patcher folders located in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects.\n\nRestart PC and without opening anything else (turn off any background programs as well) run the patcher again, the LoL logo will stay there for a while with a little progress bar underneath it. Do not try to run LoL again or any other program, the launcher should eventually appear.\n\nIf this doesn't work I'd recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can get a better understanding of what's going on and provide more specific instructions.","replies":[]}]}
