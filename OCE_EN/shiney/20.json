I've been searching for a duo partner! I'm currently Silver 1 too. I also play adc/supp ^ - ^ Been having trouble getting to gold (that's my goal for this year) so I thought if i found someone to play with, it might actually make ranked a little easier and fun lol. I don't rage and though I'm not 100% confident in my skills, I still try my best none the less. (Won a game as Sona top, yolo). I'm a very teamwork kind of player, always trying to help as I can and always giving my team moral support.
