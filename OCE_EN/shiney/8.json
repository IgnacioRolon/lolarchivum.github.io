There was nothing wrong with old one that was JUST updated not that long ago.\n\nEverything is way laggier, uglier and more annoying to navigate. Its like when your mum decides to move everything around the house and you now don't know where anything is, its the most annoying feeling. Ive never liked when a website has updated unless there was actually things wrong.\n\nWhy are they doing this exactly?

The updated client is built from the ground up in what's called a web stack. This lets us add and support features way more easily.
