Better still, if you really want T7, here is what to do:\n\n1. Form a 5 man dynamic queue group\n2. Pick your assigned roles and don't deviate (you will play this role in the game, more on this later)\n3. Now in champion select, choose DIFFERENT roles to the one you are playing, for example\n\nIf you are say Alistar Support, choose Mid Lane (the system will think you are a god for all of the assists and not feeding)\nIf you are say Ashe ADC, choose Jungle (the system will think you are a god for not feeding, and having twice the cs numbers of a jungler)\nIf you are say Aurelion Sol Mid Lane, choose Top Lane (the system will think you are a god for maintaining good cs without feeding)\nIf you are say Warwick Jungle, choose Support (the system will think you are a god for your cs numbers, assists, and not feeding)\nIf you are say Xin Zhao Top Lane, choose ADC (the system will think you are a god for being melee, not feeding, and csing well)\n\nbut **don't play those positions** in the game of course, you play your assigned role in step 2.\n\nThis way if your team has a winning game, and you play well most of your team will get high mastery scores.\n\nHardest champion to get T7? Easy, the ones that don't feed and are easy to play and rarely die. Champions like Janna, Soraka, etc. You'll need scores like 2-0-30 to get S's on those champs. Scores like 0-0-18, or 1-1-20 don't cut it. A score of 0-0-18 on Janna is an A- if i recall correctly.\n\nBut seriously, who cares what champion mastery level you are, just play the game to improve. Mastery comes as a byproduct of that.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-26T08:46:28.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm an AP Aatrox JG one trick anyway so it works for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-26T09:12:47.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of which.
