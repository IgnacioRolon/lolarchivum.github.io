Pretty cool idea, but Draven heads are funny the first game you play, then they just start getting annoying. And I'm a Draven main for League's sake.\n\nLike seriously, whoever is incharge over there must not like the community. All it takes for Riot to get free money is URF. But they cancel it for something which looks like it was coded in 15 minutes before April, and everyone gets sick of it after about 5 games.\n\nThe whole Draven concept is cool... and the skins are pretty dope... but it just can't compare to URF. I'm hoping Draven's party on the 4th isn't a bust, because right now let's be honest...\n\nIt's pretty lame.\n{{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2016-04-02T04:08:27.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just typed this comment on another thread:\n\n\"This has been the most stupid event I have ever seen in any video game I have ever played. It got so annoying in the matches I played yesterday that I just logged off mid game. Told my team mates before hand. Sure I was reported, when I logged on I get the LeaveBuster Warning that I need to write \"I agree\" not to quit or go afk. I will wait till after its over before I do the acknowledgement. Im not going to play LoL whilst its on anyway so there is no point typing \"I accept\" because if I start a game and there are Draven bobble heads I will just quit again.\"\n\nI don't care if Riot want to suspend my account for going afk. You put stupid/lame things in such as these Draven bobble heads then I just wont play LoL till its gone. If it pops up during a game randomly, give me a button to turn it off, if not then I am quitting.\n\nLast until he 4th? Nice..I am not playing LoL till after then.","replies":[]}]}
