I feel like there is something different for jhin in terms of rune pages, since he is a really unique champion.\n\nAnd this is where the million dollar question comes in.\n\nSince jhin &#039;s passive is -25% total Critical damage, will Critical Damage runes amplify his damage? or is it a waste.  \n\nCritical Damage Runes - (4.46% Quints x3 (13.38%) Total  /  2.23% Marks x9 (20.07% Total)\n\nBut if it not a waste of runes, will it boost my 4th shot damage Mid/Late game? I&#039;m willing to sacrifice my early game Damage (Risky I know) for the stronger Mid/Late game damage.\n\n{{champion:202}}  Any help is much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-09-12T07:48:45.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you can last hit the best runes are 3 quints armor pen, armor pen reds, then  magic res and magic regen blues (5 magic res 4 regen) and armor yellow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-12T06:21:50.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how you had '(help)' in the title xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-12T03:26:20.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think crit damage runes are a waste of time, flat ad, cdr, move speed, hp per level, scaling mr are pretty much his core runes you can swap out hp per level for armour if you are in a an unfavourable matchup like cait, draven, lucian","replies":[]}]}
