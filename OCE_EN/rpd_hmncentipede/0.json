If you use someone like pantheon it will be easy As he has good amount of chunk damage early and his passive to consume the first tower hit. You really want to look at your laners damage cap and cc if you are to pull of a nice lvl 3 tower dive and you most likely have to flash out to save yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Rpd HMNCentipede","date":"2014-12-15T07:30:50.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I figured it'd be like that for Shac.

You could try generating vision and gank protection. You could place your boxes in common opposing gank routes.\n2. If a lane is pushed up. Depending on the situation they are in you can join the lane and push the turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Rpd HMNCentipede","date":"2014-12-15T03:18:09.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome!
