Because of this, you would have received a Mystery Skin instead.\n\n[See some earlier posts on this.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/the-news-hour/skdtu9Lh-enlist-in-ocean-week?comment=000e0000)","replies":[{"poster":"DynastyZX","date":"2016-02-04T11:13:37.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that seems to make sense... id much rather a champ i don't have being that I'm going to grind for most of them now seeing as i have around 7 left my issue is by having more content I've obviously either spent more money or time on the game and then i get something in my eyes worth nothing i got all hyped up for a let down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dusty","date":"2016-02-04T07:44:00.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah,\n\nI dont get the support ticket system...
