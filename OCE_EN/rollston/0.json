Don't just say 'they would be really good considering where they are' because people can get good via other means. Also, a different email address must be used to create an account so no way of checking that.\n* Oceania has a small player base (reason why we can't have TT and Dominion) so enabling a feature that allows you to have a list that says you don't want to play with these people would screw over match making completely. From what I have read, there are 189,000 ish ranked players, the most being in silver 5. If you start compiling a list of who you don't want to play with, you would essentially be having to wait 20 minutes for a match. \n* Lastly, in case you hadn't realised, Riot has implemented the leaver buster system that dishes out hard punishments for those who AFK (both intentionally and not)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-23T23:49:33.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> a different email address must be used to create an account\n\nReally?
