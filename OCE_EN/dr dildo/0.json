Just some basic information \r\n\r\n&quot;country: \r\n&quot;best time to play for you&quot;\r\n&quot;summoners name&quot;\r\n&quot;do you have discord&quot;\r\n&quot;what elo are you in&quot;\r\n&quot;what are your preferred roles&quot;\r\nthese are just some basic things we&#039;d like to know so we can get things started hopefully see a few of you soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Inyourdreams","date":"2017-03-13T10:27:14.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Country of Origin: Indonesia\nCountry & City of Stay: Sydney, Australia\nSummoners name: Inyourdreams\nElo: SEA: Silver III\n       OCE: Unranked\nPreferred Role: Fill but primarily support","replies":[{"poster":"Inyourdreams","date":"2017-03-13T10:27:40.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Discord: Yes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-03-07T14:18:08.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"country: Australia \n\"best time to play for you\" random mainly at night \n\"summoners name\" tm06asf\n\"do you have discord\" not yet \n\"what elo are you in\" bronze 1 \n\"what are your preferred roles\" supp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xentorx","date":"2017-02-25T06:35:47.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"country: Australia\n\"best time to play for you\": At the moment mornings and some evenings\n\"summoners name\": Xentorx\n\"do you have discord\": Yes\n\"what elo are you in\": Bronze\n\"what are your preferred roles\": Support","replies":[]},{"poster":"sheltazoid","date":"2017-02-10T14:35:07.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Country: Australia\nBest time: At the moment i can play pretty much any time, but will change when i go back to uni\nSummoner Name: sheltazoid\nDiscord: yeah\nElo: silver 1 (only like 15 games this season so probs gold if i played ranked)\nPref roles: Adc, sup, a few champs mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"doylep","date":"2017-02-10T06:39:23.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"country: Aus\nbest time to play for you: Most of the days i have off work 8 days then 6 off.\nsummoners name: Doylep\ndo you have discord: Yes\nwhat elo are you in: Gold\nwhat are your preferred roles: Fill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Visualize","date":"2017-02-10T04:46:22.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"country: Aus\n\"best time to play for you: Whenever, usually play at night.\n\"summoners name: Ryhno\n\"do you have discord: Yeah\n\"what elo are you in: Plat\n\"what are your preferred roles: ADC \n\nThnx xxxx","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShiroeTheVillain","date":"2017-02-06T21:37:30.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi ya guys Im Paora and....\n\"country: New Zealand\n\"best time to play for you: on ACC at the mo so i play most days allday.. but when back at work will only be after work\n\"summoners name: XxkayostheoryxX\n\"do you have discord: Yes\n\"what elo are you in: Bronze.....
