Champion custom categories, basically its a system which enables you to sort out your champion pool: from your favourite champs, to champions you are most comfortable in each role and even possible counters.\r\n\r\nThis system should be used to update your preferences out of que within the champion tab. Also, in champ select being able to look at the suitable champions you like to play instead of having the huge champion pool in front of you. The benefits is being able to outweigh the pros and cons of your pick faster as there is less to look at and more actual strategy to your pick.\r\n\r\nI reckon it can be a very positive thing to the game and will be a learning tool to better players.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to add any feedback :D","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-18T21:28:15.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nThis sounds like a great idea and can be very beneficial. I'm sure the majority of the players would use something like this. For now though, you can write it up on stick notes, and put them beside your league client and refer back to them during champ select.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]}]}
