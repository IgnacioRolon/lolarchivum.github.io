Once you've opened the HRT, deselect the \"Automatically Assign\" and \"Add Firewall Exceptions\" options, we won't be needing those.~~\n~~3. Click Start.~~\n~~4.

The first few times it takes you back to the same screen and then eventually it'll throw an exception and you can play the game again. I've missed mages and now supports, lvl 3-4 respectively.
