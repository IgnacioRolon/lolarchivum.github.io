This new client has ruined all of that though. While in the champion selection phase I cannot Choose masteries, ban a champion, pick a champion or change runes but most of the time I can declare a champion. My problem is that my screen is behind everyone else&#039;s e.g. (someone will be banning and i can see that but what i cant see is it is actually my time to ban/pick) but do note that i can get into game sometimes if i just click random places but that is not how i want to play league. Also note that once i get in-game there is nothing wrong at all the game runs smoothly which the client does not.\n\nI just wanna say thanks to riot for giving me this 30 min ban because I did not lock in a champion..... They gave me the time to write this.\n\nIf anyone has and ideas on how I could make the **CLIENT** run smoother please tell me i have spent alot of money on the game and I am not ready for that to go waste.\n\nThings i have tried\n-Hextech Repair Tool (made by riot but probably not for alpha client)\n-Troubleshooting in client\n-Turning off all animations for the client\n-Changing the client to high priority in the task manager\n-Razer Cortex\n-Running the client with nothing else running \n-Updating Drivers\n-Changing compatibility\n-Running as Administrator\n\nAnd I do know about going beak to the legacy client but when ever i try i get a &quot;Kernel Patch Error&quot; and then league of legends closes its self.","replies":[{"poster":"Sebastation","date":"2017-01-08T06:16:12.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sup ghee","replies":[]}]}
