Once I got in game I saw that **all my teams health bars were black and the enemy&#039;s health bars were also black** the epic monsters also had their health number blacked out. I let my computer restart after the game thinking that it would fix it self but i have played a game today and nothing had changed the glitches were still there. So today I have **uninstalled League and Reinstalled it** to get rid of the problem and it **has not worked**. If anyone knows a way I could fix this please tell me.\r\n\r\nLinks below are to what i am talking about.\r\n\r\n[Loading Screen](http://imgur.com/a/wglCC)\r\n[In Game Health Bars](http://imgur.com/a/b2F7p)\r\n[Epic Monsters Helath Bars](http://imgur.com/a/LxRbF)","replies":[{"poster":"Bleach Mouthwash","date":"2017-06-03T00:34:10.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"do many other people have this problem","replies":[{"poster":"Sebastation","date":"2017-06-03T01:39:13.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm yeah I have the same problem...

(League Summoner Information) is a 3rd Party program and when i searched for it a few board posts said that they had been banned for using it can anyone confirm that L.S.I. is a legal 3rd Party software. Why would i use it? You can change the health bar colors to whatever you like and i think this will 100% fix the problem but i will not install it if it has the possible chance of getting me banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-04T09:58:42.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Far more likely you simply need to update your graphics drivers. You never have to install 3rd party software to fix a bug like this, and often they can cause more problems than they solve since they aren't officially supported.","replies":[{"poster":"Bleach Mouthwash","date":"2017-06-05T22:16:12.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.

Obviously it's not ideal, but if it's not an issue with your client then likely that will work as a temporary fix until the next patch hopefully fixes it properly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-06-03T01:42:34.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try [initiating a full repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Bleach Mouthwash","date":"2017-06-03T04:35:33.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i tried doing a full repair and it did not help\n     but thanks\n","replies":[]}]}]}
