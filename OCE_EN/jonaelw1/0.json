When you queue solo, you're playing in Bronze Elo with 1000 MMR anyway.\n\n>I have been climbing recently and i feel like this mmr would screw me over.\n\nDon't worry about it. Dropping ranks can be an OK thing since you regain a sense of progression once you fall down to where you belong. Focus less on your rank and more on improving each game and you won't drop as much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-26T14:22:32.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yep\n\nyou wont drop back to bronze, but you might possible drop to s4 if your not careful.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-07-28T00:53:37.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he can still drop to bronze if he loses a lot","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-28T11:11:16.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes she can, needs to have bronze 3-4 mmr","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NoNerf","date":"2015-07-27T16:07:42.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there is no magical way to improve your mmr, you just have to win games. Since your mmr is so low for your rank you will probably earn very little LP from wins, and lose quite a bit from losses. So don't get disheartened when you only gain like 10LP for a win, because your still raising your mmr to where it should be :)","replies":[]}]}
