Contains statistics, match data and more to help players analyze and improve performance.","url":"http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/310849/Skillyy","image":"http://lkimg.zamimg.com/images/v2/summoner/profile-headers/115_headerb.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**This account is not the account that has been perm-banned, the account that I will be talking about has its Lolking page linked.\r\n**\r\nTo begin, I will mention that I have not played this game since December, making it a good 3 months since I have ever played the game. For this reason, it was a shock to be sent an e-mail by a Riot staff member &#039;Gregory Johns&#039;, who is part of the Suspension Team.  The e-mail was as follows:\r\n\r\n_Hello there (summoner name),\r\nI&#039;m sad to say that since this account has been compromised so many times, we will need to permanently suspend it. I&#039;m very sorry about this but frequently compromised accounts can put other players at risk, so we must take action. We have seen how much time you spent to develop your account, and you have one more chance. If you are the only account owner and have not heard of sharing your account, please provide us with the following information:\r\n\r\nThe following information asked for account details, any purchases made, original e-mail address etc. _\r\n\r\nThis was a complete shock; I have not played the game in such a while that I could not fathom how my account could be breaching the Terms of Service. Never in my entire League of Legends time have I shared my account with anybody, no matter how close they are to me. I then took a quick look at my LolKing page and found _somebody else_ has been playing ranked and aram matches on my account. **If Riot honestly thinks I have been boosting, why have I been in Silver for 3 years?** Keep in mind that although the Lolking history states that I have been playing, this was not me, but the person who has hacked me.  They have gone to the length of changing my name from SneezyYeezy to Skilly. If you look at the matches tab and scroll to the eldest match where the person who hacked my account plays as thresh, you can clearly see the name was previously SneezyYeezy. However, any recent match shows the name has been changed. \r\n\r\nAs a person who has spent an enormous amount of time and money for a good 4-5 years, I answered every question they provided with utmost accuracy. I sent multiple transaction IDs, stated the history of my Summoner Name and even for the questions where my memory could not extend to 5 years ago, I answered those as accurately as I could. In particular, I stressed that I have **not** been account sharing but rather, somebody else has hacked into my account.\r\n\r\nI felt pretty confident once sending that e-mail; I thought to myself &quot;Riot will get me to change my password, maybe my e-mail. I&#039;ll have my account back in no time&quot;\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\nThe e-mail I received seemed to pay no attention at all to the fact that I&#039;ve been hacked. Rather, it seemed to be such a generic e-mail that took no consideration to anything I had stated prior. To prove that the e-mail is likely to be automated, the greeting didn&#039;t even address me by my summoner name.  Here it is:\r\n\r\n_Dear Summoner,\r\nas a result of further investigation we found out that the account has been compromised so many times that we will need to permanently delete it. I&#039;m very sorry about this but frequently compromised accounts can put other players at risk, so we must take action. Before anything else, I know that sometimes we tend to share our account to people that we trust such as our wife. However, please keep in mind that account sharing of any kind is against our Terms of Use, and frequently compromised accounts can put other players at risk so we need to take steps in order to protect them. As stated in our Terms of Use:\r\n\r\n&quot;C. Login Credentials. In creating an Account, you will be required to select a unique username and password (collectively, &ldquo;Login Credentials&rdquo;), which you will use each time you access the Game. You may not share your Account with anyone other than as expressly set forth herein, and you are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Credentials and for any and all activities (including purchases and charges, as applicable) that are conducted through your Account. Please notify Riot Games immediately if you become aware of any breach of security, including any loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure of your Login Credentials.&quot;\r\n_\r\n\r\nWhat a complete shock; Account sharing? How in the world do you **still** believe that I have been account sharing? It&#039;s crazy to think that I have been victimized by a hacker, and Riot&#039;s solution was to perm-ban me, a dedicated player. \r\n\r\nThe reason why I have decided to post here on the forums is mainly to see what the community thinks of this. I would also hope that a Riot staff member could read this and look into my situation further. I cannot reply to the ticket that I was sent as they stated that the ticket is now considered closed. \r\n\r\nTLDR: I was hacked. Riot is set that I have been account sharing and has perm-banned me.","replies":[]}
