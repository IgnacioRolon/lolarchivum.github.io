Everytime I try reloading it - it keeps crashing on me (Bugsplat). I have restarted my client multiple times and my computer and nothing is working. I have also been on another account to test if I can go in to a game (Custom) and still nothing. There is nothing wrong with my internet also. It just keeps crashing! I lost my placement because of this.\r\nIs this happening to anyone else?\r\nPlease help!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-26T01:26:17.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What OS are you on and what are your computer specs?
