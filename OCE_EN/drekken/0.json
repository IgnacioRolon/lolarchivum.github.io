If I get banned again is that a perma ban? Or if you don't get banned for long enough you go back to 2 14 day suspensions before being perma banned. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-02T15:42:39.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is yes. \n\nTypically punishments will follow 4 tiers: 2 chat restricts, a 14-day ban, then perma, so as you mentioned perma is your next tier.\n\nIt is possible to drop tiers, but it's not easy. At last official mention, it takes the average player about 3 months to drop a single tier (which would put you back on 14-day for next punishment), but it is variable in much the same way that honour gains are. *Any* negative behaviour, even if it isn't of the severity or consistency to trigger a punishment, will slow down your progress drastically, while positive behaviour can get you there faster.\n\nThere is also no definite way to determine what punishment tier you are on (other than receiving another punishment). The obscurity is intentional, to prevent people from sitting right on the edge of permanent suspension without tipping over.\n\nAs you may be aware, there are also some behaviours that can result in skipped punishment tiers under some circumstances. I must admit I'm not totally sure how that would interact with a dropped punishment tier. Normally, you can't skip over the 14-day tier, but if you've already received a 14-day ban and since dropped tiers that may no longer hold true.\n\nBest of luck on the path, and if there's any advice you need that we may be able to offer, or if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask!","replies":[{"poster":"Drekken","date":"2019-11-03T07:33:38.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay thanks for the clarification!","replies":[]}]}]}
