This also ties in with clicking more and faster with being able to predict and dodge skill shots and CC without slowing your combo and autos down more than they need to be. \n\nPlay accordingly to all of this. When you hear the terms 'passive' and 'aggressive' thrown around in league the player most likely has no idea how to play. If you teeter on the edge of a fight dodging everything that comes your way, kiting back if you need to and going forward if there is opportunity  whilst non stop doing damage you will be up and far away from bronze and these exact skills translate to lane with the added skill of not missing CS.\nIf you know where to go on the map, when to group, knowing when to push your lane in or hang back a little by knowing where the opponents are or their general vicinity you will climb even higher. Essentially, read between the lines and work on your finesse.\nIt won't change overnight. The most progress to be made is at the lowest level and it will only get harder. Put in the effort and you will be rewarded.\n\nSadly I don't have a tip for the crazy amount of people who instantly give up or start half assing the game just because they fell behind or one insignificant thing didn't go to plan due to the fact most humans are lemmings and will follow suit or they're too stubborn, but sometimes they are carryable. Just mute if they're negative, most players have such a warped sense of pride on this game, on our server, even if you're challenger you are still probably not worth the concern of the top players and teams in the world and if you're under that you are more than likely not worth the concern of anyone in regards to this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tutfrr","date":"2016-06-13T10:36:41.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are not confident enough to play aggressive, just play safe and try to get as many cs as you can early game( get a raka or sons sup). also try to hit the enermy tower whenever you have a chance to do so. tips for teamfight: A good position will always be nice , stay right next to your sup if she knows how to protect you, or otherwise, you are on your own.but it will be really hard for an adc to survive if there isnt any protection from teammates. finally, focus on getting cs instead of kills. im bad at playing ad as well. but those are just some tips from me.","replies":[]}]}
