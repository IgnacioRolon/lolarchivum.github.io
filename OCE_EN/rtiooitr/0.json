Many people enjoy ARAM as a break from the serious or the toxic that can be present in SR, and you are dragging it into ARAM as well. Just because it \"isn't as serious\" doesn't mean you aren't ruining a game for 9 other people.\n\nAs for bots, if you intend to afk don't queue up. Lesser punishments could be argued for bot games, but it's still a negative experience. The smurfs or the high level players in bots likely won't care, but any that ARE new get to see a negative side of the community early on, and that is far from encouraging.\n\ntl;dr Don't be an ass and afk in games. (Or at the very least don't complain about punishments existing for it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2016-02-06T03:56:36.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why join a queue and start a game if you plan on leaving and giving the other team the advantage?","replies":[]}]}
