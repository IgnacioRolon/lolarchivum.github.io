Her q applies an instance of bork 5 times. Then on top of that runnanns arrows are 5 per hit, and we all know that they apply on hit effects, so again, another 5 instances of bork, and the best part is, its all counted in the instance of 1 aa, so each instance of bork isn't reduced until the next attack.\n\nso just say they all have exactly 1k hp and you 1 aa at them with q applied that would be a total of 40% of their hp each (given they have no armor) so that would be about 1200 damage from just the bork proc alone\n\nPs. the onhit isn't supposed to go to the bonus arrows, but atm its bugging so it does\nPps. keep quiet of riot will nerf it to hell, and fix the op bug","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-16T16:15:16.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Her q applies an instance of bork 5 times\n\nGood work being a retard.\n\nHer Q applies on hit effects once.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-16T12:26:09.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A wild thornmail appeared","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-05-16T12:32:39.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did I mention the heal is unstoppable?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
