The way you talk makes you sound like you are low elo, which probably means the supports don't main support, so they should be worse. Also, if they mess up and then you tell them how rubbish they are, they will probably tilt and continue to be rubbish. However, if you encourage them they might actually be decent, but have played poorly early.
