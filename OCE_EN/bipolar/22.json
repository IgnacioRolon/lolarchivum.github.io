As you can see here: http://gyazo.com/e7cb634bd085c7c06e874e7e46f95ab2 -- Normals is no different to Ranked, people still try the same and anyone who says they don&#039;t is lying. (I want champ mastery with my mains before I start ranked)\r\n\r\n**Vayne** has no early game, do not try and fight unless your jungler is there, do not push for level two and fight that, chances are you will get obliterated even more if you&#039;re versing an Ashe, Graves, Jinx or Kalista who will decimate you at level one. Just sit back until Vayne gets her BotRK and wait patiently, place wards when you can but freeze the lane, Ashe will mess up Vayne no matter what, even if Vayne has a lead, the new Ashe is now Vayne&#039;s biggest threat, her burst is off the charts and the constant crits are annoying to deal with.\r\n\r\nDo not ever rage because Vayne is 0/2, most likely that is your fault, most ADC&#039;s will follow their support simply because it&#039;s appreciated to, even if it causes them death, and most importantly. DO NOT ROAM WHEN YOU HAVE A VAYNE AS AN ADC, VAYNE WILL GET DECIMATED IF LEFT ALONE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. Trust me, I&#039;ve seen an enemy Vayne be 5/0 and then the support roamed mid, even though Vayne was at the tower it took my team less than 12 seconds to kill her and then for me to snowball.\r\n\r\nVayne requires positioning and peel, even more now every champ seems to be released with gapclosers or high mobility, do not play a support that has no CC, yes Vayne has CC but it&#039;s situational, Thresh and Leona are solid picks for Vayne, Braum also does well as Vayne is based on attack speed &lt;- which is why her early game sucks, well that and her low base health and armour.\r\n\r\nVayne will carry your team, if you carry her early game, Vayne is one of few that can steamroll an enemy team with no effort at fullbuild, if she doesnt get there she will continue to do badly.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: Play Leona, Thresh, Braum or Janna as a support and peel for her, while Leona is an aggressive support, she can lock down enough for Vayne to get free damage and position for her stun, which will get you early game kills, essentially wait for the enemy to make mistakes, don&#039;t push a fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-04T11:45:40.006+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I main support.

But how about Lulu support for Vayne? Is that ok also?\n\nDepends on the Lulu, I've played with plenty of Lulu supports, as Vayne and as others. Lulu can carry the lane if she's good, she has poke which can work in the favour of the lane, as well as a shield and some CC, Lulu is good in general, her synergy with Vayne is neutral.","replies":[]}]}]}
