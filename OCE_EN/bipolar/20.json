Unskilled Player reports are used for matchmaking analysis to determine if there are players where they shouldn't be.\n\nI totally understand the frustration of having someone on your team who didn't do so well, but there are ways to overcome it. Like banding together and pressuring that lane to help someone get back on track. I am not the greatest top laner and have been bailed out more than once by asking for help.\n\nIt's also about the communication, if you're telling someone to 'stop feeding' for example, it's probably not going to help them. Most likely they are trying their best and have fallen behind - happens to all of us. I know personally it doesn't help me if someone says that when i'm having a bad game.\n\nWhat is useful though is when someone goes 'lets get this top laner back on track!' and you work with your team to get them going. \n\nThis is just one example, the main thing is how you react when someone on your team is struggling, if you help them you can turn a sucky situation into a winning one.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-25T16:40:34.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sephyre,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=iYPElbHl,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-05-25T04:29:22.767+0000)\n>\n> It's also about the communication, if you're telling someone to 'stop feeding' for example, it's probably not going to help them.

Requesting junglers help is good, but when they jungler leaves thats not an excuse to go feed again. Basically it means someone that is chasing kills when behind needs to pull their head in and think about the TEAM not just their kill score. 0-5-0 is fine if they then stop feeding and blaming the jungler for no ganks, when they chased a kill without vision and got ganked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-25T22:21:06.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a bit hard to \"stop feeding\" against a 5-0 dude when you're 0-5.\nIt's easier to \"swap lane\", or to \"get some jungle farm\".\n\nBring your expectations into reality, man.
