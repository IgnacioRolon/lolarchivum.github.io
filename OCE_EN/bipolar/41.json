It has to be somebody who can basically wipe everybody's arse altogether to do it since as we know it, nearly nobody is bothered enough to flush the toilet after using it.\n\nThese problem solvers are dedicating their lives to just resolving everyone's issue, all while some others are living in happiness by producing more and more. It's a twisted world we are living in, hence there is no point bringing more lives into this world atm. Just don't, there is no need to bring children into this world just to suffer, and there is also no need to be driven by reproduction instinct anymore seeing how many of us are already living and suffocating this planet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-25T11:52:07.902+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BuzDBumblebee,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=79nai3AU,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-25T10:56:10.284+0000)\n>\n> I'm just gonna live as long as nature intends for me to live.
