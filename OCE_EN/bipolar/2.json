a useless jungler.\r\nMe: that is not toxic.\r\nMe: that&#039;s facts.\r\nMe: I never swore.\r\nBard: and fact that youre toxic\r\nBrand: ok kalisto\r\nYasuo: are you mentally challenged\r\nMe: Or abused anyone, so try again.\r\nEzreal left the room.\r\nMe: Now who&rsquo;s being toxic?\r\nBrand: im copying that game and sending it to riot\r\nAzir: ^\r\nAzir: ty\r\nBard: ^\r\nBrand: we will let them decide if you are toxic or not\r\nMe: I&#039;m laughing.\r\nAzir: so are we xD\r\nAzir: kekekke\r\nMe: You&#039;re just mad.\r\nMe: You couldn&#039;t carry the game.\r\nAzir: hehehehe\r\nMe: So salt\r\nAzir: you carried xD\r\nBrand: like you said man\r\nMe: Of course I did.\r\nBrand: its a normal game\r\nBrand: I am just playing for fun\r\nMe: I saved our base from 5 waves of super minions.\r\nMe: We would have lost if I wanted us to.\r\nBrand: but your toxicity ruined it for everyone\r\nMe: I said 7 things in /all chat.\r\nMe: I was trying a new build.\r\nMe: verse an Ezreal + Brand lane.\r\nMe: wtf are you on?\r\nBard left the room.\r\nAzir left the room.\r\nBrand: you are simple in your brain if you think the only way of being toxic is through chat\r\nLee Sin left the room.\r\nMe: It is.\r\nMe: Because I did nothing else wrong.\r\nYasuo: lmao\r\nYasuo: you took jungler creeps\r\nMe: They don&#039;t belong to the jungler.\r\nMe: They are neutral camps.\r\nMe: Fair game.\r\nYasuo: looooooooooooooooooooool\r\nMe: He also didn&#039;t touch bot once.\r\nMe: When I asked him to, he shrugged me off.\r\nMe: I needed the extra gold.\r\nYasuo: lmao ok\r\nYasuo left the room.\r\nMe: Next argument?\r\nDarius: From what I am picking up and from experiance in game with you, you are indeed toxic.\r\nMe: Going negative isn&#039;t toxic.\r\nMe: How?\r\nMe: Explain how.\r\nBrand: going negative isnt toxic\r\nBrand: but intentional feeding is toxic\r\nBrand: its whatever man\r\nMe: How did I intentionally feed?\r\nMe: I did not run at you and die.\r\nBrand: i recorded the game and im sending it to riot right now\r\nMe: Check the damage dealt graph.\r\nMe: I did damage.\r\nDarius: Calling somone usless festroys their morale.\r\nDarius: destroys*\r\nMe: I stated facts.\r\nMe: He was useless.\r\nMe: As he let bot lane fail.\r\nMe: Not my issue.\r\nDarius: no, it&#039;s your oppinion.\r\nDarius: not fact.\r\nMe: It&#039;s a fact.\r\nMe: He kept his abuse to team chat.\r\nDarius: dude, he was 7/0/7\r\nMe: And Ezreal was 7/0.\r\nMe: Due to his neglect.\r\nDarius: he was far less than useless\r\nMe: Your point?\r\nMe: He was useless in aspects to bot lane.\r\nMe: calling someone useless is not a derogatory thing.\r\nDarius: yeah ok maybe in regards to bot\r\nMe: Exactly.\r\nDarius: but you SPECIFICALLY said useless meaning useless in general\r\nMe: He had no presence bot lane.\r\nMe: therefore, useless.\r\nMe: No.\r\nMe: I said that bot lane was done, and that Lee Sin was useless.\r\nMe: bot lane = done.\r\nDarius: you wernt specific which made him think you were talking to him in his entirety, that is in fact toxic.\r\nMe: meant bot lane = destroyed.\r\nMe: You do realize.\r\nMe: That he shrugged it off.\r\nDarius: doesnt matter bro, still toxic.\r\nMe: He didn&#039;t take offense.\r\nMe: It is not toxic!\r\nMe: If I swore at him.\r\nBrand: it is toxic\r\nMe: Then I&#039;d be toxic.\r\nBrand: and you are toxic\r\nMe: He told me to go AFK.\r\nMe: I didn&#039;t.\r\nDarius: how can you tell if he is shrugging it off? he could irl be taking to heart? you dont know.\r\nMe: Why is everyone on this game oversensitive?\r\nMe: Because how he spoke back.\r\nMe: do you think he was the perfect player?\r\nMe: Hell no.\r\nMe: He abused me for being negative in score.\r\nMe: Despite the fact said I was trying a new build in champion select.\r\nMe: You&#039;re judging everything on one word that was said.\r\nMe: And then my score.\r\nDarius: well usually the toxic one is overly defensive.\r\nMe: If I was feeding intentionally.\r\nDarius: look at you\r\nMe: I would not have gotten 80% of my kills later in the game.\r\nMe: Lol okay.\r\nMe: So the fact that 9 people targeted me is going to make me just chill?\r\nDarius: it was 4 to 1 aswell.\r\nBrand: if you werent toxic\r\nMe: I need to explain it, so you stop this oversensitive stuff on the Internet.\r\nDarius: hey, we were a third party\r\nBrand: no one will &quot;target&quot; you\r\nDarius: we take evidence into consideration\r\nMe: You&#039;re calling me toxic.\r\nMe: On two things.\r\nDarius: and come to a verdict.\r\nMe: I called my own jungler useless.\r\nMe: As he was in regards to bot lane.\r\nMe: And my negative score.\r\nBrand: =toxic\r\nMe: Really must have been intentionally feeding.\r\nMe: When I did more damage than Brand.\r\nDarius: again, we took the evidence in front of us into consideration and came to a verdict, simple.\r\nMe: Mm, yeah.\r\nBrand: if you are on my team and I get killed at level 1 then flame you for not gangking my lane at level 1 thats means im not toxic?\r\nMe: I didn&rsquo;t flame.\r\nMe: Nor did I ask for a gank at level 1.\r\nMe: It was at level 7.\r\nBrand: you admitted to flaming at level 1 man\r\nMe: No I didn&rsquo;t.\r\nBrand: man\r\nMe: Wtf are you on?\r\nBrand: you must be level 1 in ur brain as well\r\nMe: I didn&rsquo;t flame anyone.\r\nMe: Rofl.\r\nBrand: its not hard to understand\r\nMe: Oh, I asked Bard why he came to lane late.\r\nMe: At level 1.\r\nBrand: flame = toxic\r\nBrand: = you are toxic\r\nMe: I didn&rsquo;t flame.\r\nMe: Are you on drugs?\r\nMe: Curious.\r\nBrand: yeah man\r\nBrand: the drug of life\r\nMe: When I said finally.\r\nMe: That was due to getting 2 PD&#039;s.\r\nBrand: but you ruined it for me with your toxicity\r\nMe: Nothing I said was at anyone in the game.\r\nMe: Considering I said nothing to you.\r\nMe: How?\r\nBrand: intentional feeding\r\nMe: Are.\r\nMe: You.\r\nMe: Serious?\r\nMe: I was 10/18.\r\nMe: Ezreal was 7/0 at the 7 minute mark.\r\nMe: 3 were mine.\r\nMe: 4 were Bard.\r\nDarius: It was pretty obvious you were intentionally feeding.\r\nMe: With no ganks.\r\nBrand: yeah you mean right after you went afk and told us to push mid\r\nMe: Do you expect me to pull 20 kills from nowhere?\r\nMe: With a champion that needs her support around to do damage?\r\nMe: You do realize that bard left the lane and went mid?\r\nMe: At 11 minutes.\r\nMe: Right?\r\nMe: I never afk&#039;d.\r\nBrand: yeah because it was 4v5\r\nMe: If you recorded the match.\r\nMe: Then you&#039;ll realize that.\r\nBrand: you were trolling being toxic and intentional feeding man\r\nMe: I was the third person to hit level 18 on my team.\r\nBrand: if im bot lane and my adc starts being toxic id go help other lanes as well\r\nMe: So much AFK.\r\nMe: Funny\r\nMe: I never said anything to Bard.\r\nMe: Besides asking why he didn&rsquo;t stay at bot to cheese it.\r\nBrand: didnt need to\r\nMe: As our level 1 was better.\r\nDarius: Actions spead louder than words.\r\nBrand: you said things with your actions\r\nDarius: speak*\r\nMe: Actions for what?\r\nMe: Trying a new build?\r\nMe: In a normal game?\r\nMe: Jesus!\r\nDarius: Intentionally feeding, we have been over this.\r\nBrand: intentional feeding man\r\nMe: I did more damage than you.\r\nMe: I did not intentionally feed.\r\nDarius: I was a tank.\r\nMe: you do realize each of my deaths.\r\nMe: I went down fighting.\r\nMe: I didn&rsquo;t run at your team.\r\nBrand: yeah you did\r\nMe: I also got my team&rsquo;s second dragon.\r\nMe: How was I feeding on purpose?\r\nDarius: technically correct, since you are kalista you hopped quickly at us.\r\nMe: Getting pulled by Darius.\r\nMe: Or Tahm isnt feeding.\r\nBrand: on purpose\r\nMe: How?\r\nBrand: 90% of ur deaths were under our towers\r\nMe: They&#039;re both tanks.\r\nMe: Sure I tried to fight them.\r\nBrand: = toxic feeder\r\nMe: But they still do bruiser-like damage.\r\nMe: I even killed Darius once at bot lane.\r\nMe: You win some.\r\nMe: You lose some.\r\nMe: If I was feeding.\r\nMe: I would have let hi mkill me.\r\nMe: I do not understand your logic.\r\nDarius: you realised we were gonna report so later in the game you decided to try, you can&#039;t trick us.\r\nMe: Do you think I care about reports?\r\nMe: I played exactly the same.\r\nDarius: when your not online tomorrow you&#039;ll wish you had.\r\nMe: Throughout the entire game.\r\nBrand: do you honestly think that if a rioter saw the way you played that game he would think you are playing normal?\r\nMe: If you think Riot bans that quickly.\r\nMe: Then I&#039;m laughing.\r\nDarius: Tahm Kench has connections.\r\nMe: Seeing as I have played with rioters that have gone 4/20 before.\r\nMe: No.\r\nBrand: yeah\r\nBrand: but they arent intentional feeding\r\nDarius: there&#039;s a difference between a rioter going 4/20 and you intentionally feeding.\r\nMe: Xin.\r\nMe: Was 11/15.\r\nMe: That&rsquo;s 3 deaths less than me.\r\nMe: Was he intentionally feeding?\r\nBrand: ok ok ok listen man\r\nBrand: lets pretend you werent intentional feeding\r\nMe: I wasn&#039;t.\r\nDarius: even though you were.\r\nMe: Else we wouldn&#039;t have won.\r\nBrand: why did you type push mid in all chat??\r\nMe: And I wouldn&rsquo;t have the second highest kills on my team.\r\nMe: You did go and push mid?\r\nMe: Then I got bot tower.\r\nDarius: I believe you also said somthing along the lines of &quot;I cant believe this team is so stupid to not know when a game is lost.\r\nBrand: ^\r\nDarius: Check and mate.\r\nMe: You twisted the words.\r\nMe: And added stupid.\r\nMe: But yes, I did say that.\r\nMe: because I did think the match was over.\r\nBrand: yeah\r\nMe: That&rsquo;s not toxic.\r\nBrand: you thought it was over at level 1\r\nBrand: when u tell us to push mid\r\nBrand: lol\r\nMe: After I said that I got kills.\r\nBrand: ur toxic\r\nBrand: man\r\nMe: Lord help you.\r\nDarius: the quicker you accept you are toxic the better your life will become.\r\nMe: You&#039;re so belligerent.\r\nMe: I&#039;m toxic, I already know that, but I wasn&#039;t in this match.\r\nDarius: I am anything but billigerent\r\nBrand: Man\r\nDarius: You are ignorant.\r\nMe: Are we done? I want to post this on the forums.\r\nBrand: you are so toxic you dont even know when you are being toxic anymore\r\nBrand: you are toxic all the time but you think thats normal\r\nMe: God.\r\nMe: Bless.\r\nMe: You.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/ccdd13e1d8f7bf686a57977daad0105f.png\r\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/00ab16f6cf04767cf56b84480256e522.png","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-06T21:12:34.162+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did anyone actually read all of that?
