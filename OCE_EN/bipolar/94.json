She has a lot of CC yes, but that's all, what seems to be damage is just the amount of CC she deals, she can land a few AAs in there to deal more damage. She is pritty much a stronger Sion, but only a little stronger. She is perfectly balanced and can be countered if smart, it's just the free week talking!","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-21T02:21:13.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never thought about her being like a sion..
