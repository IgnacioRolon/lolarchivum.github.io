She's harder to play if you are familiar with the old Fiora.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-08-08T16:32:15.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had her in ARAM very terrible. You won't be able to walk up to like a single person as there are 4 people backing them up from gettign attacked by you. Trying to attack their weak spot shown by your passive isn't even going to be easy as I said before 4 people backing the person you want to go for. THEN again this is ARAM she's terrible in ARAM, in Normals I'd find that she's not all that good. How? Shred a Fiora as Nasus with her new Change.","replies":[]}]}
