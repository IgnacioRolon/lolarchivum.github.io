{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-09-18T08:05:54.444+0000","title":"Hello Riot, I'm an abusive player.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":5,"body":"And how you&#039;re handling the _punishment system_ is utter garbage, it&#039;s a joke that it&#039;s gone on this long and it&#039;s joke that you&#039;re still handing out chat restrictions which do not hinder abusive players, but the team that they&#039;re on - you&#039;re making it harder to win games with players that are chat restricted. First of Riot Lyte is an idiot, and I&#039;m saying that as nicely as possible, because knowing him, he&#039;ll see this and instantly ban me for being _toxic_, which is laughable.\r\n\r\n&quot;_In the last season of Leagues play, we excluded some of the Ranked Rewards from players that were excessively toxic (so, exhibited severe offensive behaviors such as racism and sexism) or were persistently toxic (so, exhibited moderately offensive behaviors in a large number of games). We&#039;re going to continue this policy this year_.&quot; said Riot Lyte on last.fm\r\n\r\nYou cannot take away rewards because they&#039;re abusive, you&#039;re going to anger a lot of people, a lot of loyal players who don&#039;t care about people who waste 40 minutes trolling, because the system that you have in place is useless and bans people who swear a little and ignores the trollers or those that are smart enough to bypass the filter and thus not get hit by your garbage system. People are toxic or the better term abusive because you allow people to be, threatening to take away a toy from a child makes said child more angry and aggravated.\r\n\r\n&quot;_One, we always want to encourage reform, and celebrate players that successfully reform by the end of the season. So, players that got a Chat or Ranked Restriction during the season, but manage to reform and DO NOT HAVE active Chat or Ranked Restrictions by the season end cutoff will still get their Ranked Rewards. Players that still have active Chat or Ranked Restrictions by the season end cutoff will not be eligible_.&quot; Lyte said afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to celebrate reform then implement a better system that allows reform, or maybe a system that is player based and not automated? The Tribunal was actually decent, despite the fact I was banned from it on multiple accounts, each account permed. &quot;Players that still have active Chat or Ranked Restrictions by the season end cutoff will not be eligible&quot; This is stupid as hell and you deserve to be fired for this asinine bit on the post, your stupid system handed out 1k+ chat restrictions. Then straight after will give you another 400 if you so help me get reported once - it doesn&#039;t even need to be heavily offensives, just swearing enough will get you heavily chat restricted.\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;_Three, players that have received escalated bans (so 7-day or 14-day bans) for excessive toxicity at any point during the 2015 Season will not receive Ranked Rewards. Players that have received these types of bans have shown some of the most egregious behaviors in the game, and we have a zero tolerance policy against things like racism, sexism, homophobia and other kinds of hate speech. These players WILL be eligible for Ranked Rewards in future seasons if they reform and are not flagged for excessive behaviors in future seasons_.&quot; Riot Lyte said finally.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the line of absurdity is drawn, if players work for their rank then you cannot deny them the rewards, the fault lays with you, Riot, it&#039;s not my fault that your system is garbage, it&#039;s not my fault that back to back chat restrictions were implemented thus pissing off a vast majority of casual players and it&#039;s not my fault that you have no idea how to stop people from being abusive in your game. You ban these people for 14 days and they will make a smurf and do it all over again, threatening to take away rewards isn&#039;t going to make them stop and start being nice, you need to offer an incentive for being nice and the current system for it is worse than your automated banning system. All you get now is a trash banner that vanished if people stop honouring you, what a joke. Good players should get rewards, bad players should lose rewards.\r\n\r\nIE: You haven&#039;t had a valid report against you for two weeks, have a few 100IP, because you won&#039;t give RP or skins, IP is all we have to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe point is, focus on making players be nice and work for rewards, instead of focusing on the bad, because it&#039;s human nature to not care about anyone unless you gain something from it. Do you really think if I hurt someones feelings by swearing? Turn on the filter if it offends you so much, really if you have the chat filter on you shouldn&#039;t be able to report people for verbal abuse and offensive language, that&#039;s hypoctitical.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the community got more abusive when Riot Lyte took over, lmfao.","replies":[{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2015-09-18T23:43:30.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree absolutely.\n\nI played a match the other day and a playerw as constantly abusive after the match.

I honoured this player because he was genuinely quite friendly during the game. However after I did so he started with the verbal abuse, physical threats and paedophilic comments. There was no way for me to report this member for these actions. As once I had honoured him for being friendly the report icon was inaccessible.\n\nI have looked for a ticket option to report via another means and there is no category for abuse, violent threats and paedophilic comments. RIOT facilitates this behaviour and tacitly approves of it by not having an effective means to stop it. The continued occurrence of such behaviour, and I see it on a fairly regular basis, I would think should be quite concerning for RIOT. You guys are providing a community in which abuse, racial vilification, threats of violence and death are commonplace. You may think that this behaviour is simply anti-social - may I point out that some of it is actually criminal acts and you as an orgainisation are culpable in those acts because you do not stop it.\n\nIf you think that behavior of that type is normative and consistent with that which is accepted both socially and legally in normal society you guys need a re-calibration of your moral compass and maybe should consider employing some adults in your board room.\n\nI have personally reported a number of people for comments such as \"I hope your kids catch cancer and die\" or \"If I knew where you lived I would come and kick your head in\", you think that's normal and appropriate? I definitely don't and from many of the posts I see on the boards neither does the rest of the community. However you CHOOSE to do nothing about it. Not once, as in NEVER, have I EVER received an email feedback, as was indicated on posts in relation to behaviour reform, about individuals being punished for such behaviour. What this means is that RIOT either did not punish said individuals or does not want the community to know how actions are being handled.\n\nYour organisation has no transparency - you have created an environment where people are free to abuse,demean, threaten and vilify others at whim with zero cost. It is common place in matches that when players are asked to stop their abuse they tell you \"To fawk off, report me..I wont get banned anyway\".\n\nPersonally I have a list of players that I have reported for various types of abuse which I have on an Excel spreadsheet. Each time I enter champ select I check my team mates against that list. If I see one that I have previously have reported for abuse then I apologise to my other team mates, let them know that I will be not selecting a champ because I won't play with player XXXX because of XXXX. I take a time ban for doing so..wish I didn't but hey atleast I don't have to tolerate such players.\n\nIf RIOT as an organisation doesn't intend to stop abuse and other such types of behaviour then you should provide a means that we as the players can CHOOSE not to play with certain people. I would happily wait extra time in que if, as a result of every negative report I made, the pool of players I could be matched with was reduced.\n\nWhen I first started playing this game I used to spent dollars with you buying skins or champs..now days I don't spent my money on skins..why should I give you coin when you won't make a community where anti social behaviour is minimal. Fine you don't want to fix the issues, then I won't give you my money..fix the issues and I might start spending coin with you.\n\nIt's a great game but its a toxic milieu.\n\nThe game has an ESRB rating of teen for fawks sake..TEEN!! 13 and up..threats of violence, abuse, pedophilia, homorphobia..normative?

Ofc I understand that especially on OCE it would increase queue times, but you could put restrictions on it. Say for example you can only blacklist a certain number of people each month or, you can only blacklist people you report and only reports for say Verbal Abuse and not just for things like Unskilled player (cause that's matchmakings fault). Maybe the queues only account for blacklists if you are solo/duo and not if you queue with two or more other people.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-18T10:24:32.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Verbal toxicity is not even an issue, just mute and move on. Problem solved.\n\nThe real problem lies in intentional feeding and trolling with picks/builds (AP Riven, Disco Nunu etc...)

Check out this Lyte post for more context on verbal vs gameplay toxicity.\n\nhttp://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/132490777026\n\n> We've always taken both problems (verbal toxicity and gameplay toxicity) quite seriously. We launched the new Instant Feedback System that addressed verbal toxicity with instant bans after we launched LeaverBuster, which reduced leavers/AFKs dramatically. These two systems targeted different verbal AND gameplay toxicity issues. We've been working on Intentional Feeders in parallel for awhile, but it was a tougher problem to crack because we have to be very, very careful not to ban players who have occasional bad games (or even really awful games).\n> In other words, it's not that we think verbal toxicity is much more important than gameplay toxicity. We just managed to finish research and development of other systems first.\n\nIn the latest patch we introduced Intentional feeding bans to our instant feedback system (they used to be done in waves manually.)\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers\n\n> Intentional feeders ruin games, so the behavior nets offending players two-week bans, and can escalate to permanent bans if the behavior continues. Through a ton of in-game metrics, chat logs, and even historical play patterns, we ensured the system understands the difference between intentional feeding and being crushed by a Riven main in solo queue. You shouldn’t need to worry about just having a bad game.\n> Like with all new feature launches, the whole player behavior team will hand-review the first few thousand cases to make sure everything’s working right.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-19T07:17:49.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you have anything installed for the trolls that go anivea and wall a player all game as there is no way to report them as its not a rule I have a idea if you were abol to do a chat command like /troll just for example and it wold tell I rioter that there is a troll in the game and they would join the game and see all message's sent it would not tell any one but the one who sed /troll and they can talk to the rioter who and what they are doing lets face it riot has the money to employ some random to do this hell I would do it for free","replies":[{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2015-09-20T00:56:49.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol..some of these champ skills can be so troll right?

Those individuals that choose to perform those activities are committing a crime utilising the telecommunications network.\n\nYour comment reflects a common misconception - that what happens online isn't real life. You will find that is not the case, DDNS attacks, physical threats of individuals in online games as already resulted in a number of people being convicted of criminal acts.\n\nThere is substantial case evidence and research from around the world that demonstrates the games such as LoL, Eveonline, DOTA have all been utilised to harass and bully children in schools. The problem with all these games is that they mix together people of various ages, you can have 13yr old's teamed in LoL with 40+ yr olds.
