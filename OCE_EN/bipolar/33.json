Why not make her next attack on a single target like a flurry of attacks like ww&#039;s ult, expect it doesnt suppress and is a skillshot in a direction and hits all enemies in the lined AoE. See that would be perfect, hire me pelase i would make better champs than most of your devs, thank you bless.\n\nJesus christ the new fedora is gonna be so bad, espeically when cancer like riven isn&#039;t nerfed, rito pls don&#039;t touch my waifu\n\nedit\n\nok I made a high quality drawing to explain better.\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/5ba6a813649847de5d7dd556135904c5.png\n\nas you can see the red is the line AoE, which is a channeled ability, and does damage for each second they're in the AoE in, damage is higher the closer they are.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-23T00:03:38.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you want her to be pantheon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-22T10:33:02.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the looks of what I saw in the video, the AoE healing her ult gives is quite substantial. Plus, up to four opportunities to deal instant %Max HP damage and that's not even counting her other abilities. I think that she is still going to be a great duellist, albeit with slightly less kill potential. But she had two slows and a massive AoE heal, which gives her the utility that she really needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-22T08:05:24.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tempt me once, fine.
