The only thing they can actually see at all is the \"expression of emotion,\" and even some people can't see that before they gag at the picture of the loli which is right in front of them.\n\n>The music is indeed chaos, but to some people's ears, it makes a sound that they enjoy, and which they view as harmony. Just as some people look at classical music and fall asleep, just as many think it's truly fascinating, and they spend years memorizing artist names, song names, and everything else associated to that genre. The same thing applies here: Some find it fascinating, whilst others think of it as pure shite.\nAnd even in terms of technicalities, this is indeed \"music\": Musical tool and programs were used to put this piece together, and there are indeed beats and rhythms to be followed here: Using the previous classical music example, there were any composers back then who made pieces that did not follow the norm at all, utilizing crescendos when they normally they wouldn't, and so forth. Yet again, the same thing applies here: The artist is changing the tempo when one normally wouldn't, and using certain musical cues and techniques that most people normally wouldn't use.\nFinally is the speed, which is obviously inhumanly fast... And really, that is all there is to it. It's fast, and that is it's strong point. Why do you think the \"the quick brown fox\" was so popular? Because most of the songs in that album boasted over 300 BPM, which is about 3 times as fast as any \"normal\" song in the electronic genre.\nI'll leave it off with the fact that breakcore is a very established genre, with many variations: People who do not think of it as music, therefore, are not accepting of the term \"music\" as a whole, and it's modern forms that stray away from the more classic approach: I can only say that they are perhaps biased since they have never heard anything like this before, and are more used to their forms of music which didn't push boundaries... Like heavy metal, rock, punk, rap, classical, or anything from the electronic genre (cough cough).\n\n>Don't just say \"it's not music\" because it's pushing things in a strange direction that you're uncomfortable with: Almost every other genre has done it, too.\n\n>COMPLETELY UNRELATED NOTE: A few words to these people that complain about the naked loli on the cover: First off, lolis are something we lolicons enjoy: It's legal in almost every format, and more than 90% of us have no interest in real life \"little girls\" as you put it: We only like how cute they are. However, I can admit that some of us, including me, like women of that body type. Plus, it's the internet, where everything is disgusting and nothing is censored. If you are crying about something this minor, then get your life-raft because you're going to be drowning if you stay here long enough.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-05-11T12:39:54.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it's just a pile of shit music played at 5.0x the normal speed.
