He for fills to many rolls. Huge aoe and single target damage, large aoe stun which lasts a huge amount of time, aoe slow, a massive shield, lots of mobility, big heal from his ult, invulnerability, percentage health damage and aoe waveclear/poke. He needs to be refined as an assassin, nerf the stun, the shield and the heal that the ult gives and i think he may become balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-06-08T10:06:35.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even summoner spells get wasted on him cause he just ults back out of it even if it's an exhaust..

It deals too much damage and is innately built so that you can't retaliate, unless you have cheap range/gapclosing abilities or are a ranged champion. Even then, good luck get getting an AA or 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-07T13:38:12.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its kinda annoying that we were lied to in the trailer, were he wasnt healed after ulting, but he is now. ffs","replies":[]}]}
