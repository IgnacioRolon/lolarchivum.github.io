The DCing/AFK player does get punished for it but everyone else that leaves after that does not. \nStill, the DotA 2 community is a far more toxic and elitist atmosphere; \"I'm better than noobs, so they don't deserve to play\" type of mindset.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-04-30T07:32:26.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"4 makes sense, heck 3 is even a majority.\nIf you dont like it being 4, you should be thank full its not 3, which is more then 2.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kieshwa","date":"2015-04-30T15:35:03.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anythnig, the surrender vote needs to be 3 yes's, instead of 4. 3 is a majority, why is the majority's opinion discarded in favour of the minority.\n\nAlso, Riot need to learn what abstaining means.

Pre-mades in your team might be planning to play a full match, but suddenly they have to go somewhere; they press \"yes\" especially because the match looks like it won't end soon or that there's a less than great chance of winning the match.\n\nIn saying that, I do understand the frustration when team members decide to surrender prematurely, just because of a badly played teamfight wherein they get aced once at 22 minute mark; when there is clearly a good chance of winning a match and plenty of opportunities to better oneself's plays.\nLow ELO players should simply to not give up so quickly in games. I've had it happen to me a few times.\n\nI tend to \"no\" surrenders by muscle memory to be honest. If we're clearly going nowhere after careful and considerate plays, and warding, then I consciously \"yes\" surrenders. Otherwise I more often than not am the person pressing \"no\" when everyone else picked \"yes\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Markus7575","date":"2015-04-30T13:02:23.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why shouldn't you surrender?
