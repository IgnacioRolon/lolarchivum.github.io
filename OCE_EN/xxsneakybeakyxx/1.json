But would prefer it to be people that are trying to get better at the game and rise through ranks, who are looking to hone their teamwork skills and other stuff like that.\r\n- Top 5 favorite champs are {{champion:412}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:111}} \r\n\r\nFeel free to send me a friend request to play some normals to test how I play (or just go right into ranked if you feel like it).\r\n\r\nUsername: XxSneakyBeakyxX (Obviously not a serious name :v )","replies":[{"poster":"50 shades of ayy","date":"2015-11-25T20:38:42.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adc main. reached d5 last season currently maining jungle on my dia account have a gold account which i want to climb to plat + and want to do it duo adcing again so i stay ontop of my adc game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiney","date":"2015-11-25T01:41:39.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll throw ya an add this afternoon :){{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"RAVENORD","date":"2015-11-25T01:35:44.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI main ADC and was S1 on NA server last season but stopped playing after they moved server to chicago giving me >220 ping.
