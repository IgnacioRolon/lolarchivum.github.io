I have tried repairing the clients, reinstalling the game, all the different pvp.net disconnecting fixes and nothing works. I find it odd that its only this one specific things that triggers it, the actual game and everything else is still fine.","replies":[{"poster":"birdistheword","date":"2016-05-07T22:41:50.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same happens to me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-10T01:49:07.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a look on [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/BuYcQvIy-opening-hextech-tab-immediate-disconnect-please-help-same-problem-for-2-weeks-now)","replies":[]}]}
