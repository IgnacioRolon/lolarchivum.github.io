Our top laner left during champ select (said in the chat) after he had picked his champ (he was first pick), but instead of going back into queue it kept going and put  us into the game. GP never connected during loading or during the first 20min of the game and because of this we lost (we were winning at the start but they took advantage of our low number pretty fast). He did connect as they were pushing for the win and said that he queue dodge to go pick someone up and was confused why he was still in the match. I can understand if he left right before the loading screen or in the last 10 seconds, but a good 2min past before the game started after he left.\r\n\r\nThis is pathetic of riot, it should not be a thing to happen for such a large game.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-11T09:55:02.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry that this happened.\n\nMy guess would be that he _thought_ the client was closed, however it obviously was not.\n\nDid you remember to report the player in the post-game lobby?","replies":[]}]}
