If you want a link to the website to make it easy for you to grab, [you can go here.](http://www.geforce.com/drivers) \n\n**2) Have you tried using a different monitor?**\n\nI have noticed that the issue you were having is linked to a resolution issue. It might be worth trying using a different monitor just in case it might be the game trying to push itself to a resolution that the monitor is not able to display, thus reverting. It might be worth as well trying to slowly work your way up through the different resolutions.\n\n**3) Consider trying a different connection or port for the monitor**\n\nWhen you are connecting your monitor to your graphics card, have you tried using a different connection method or port? For example if you were using a HDMI connection, could you try a different port on the card, or maybe swapping over to a display port or DVI connection with a converter?\n\n**4) When you were re installing league did you make sure to completely uninstall the game before re installing it?**\n\nSometimes when you re install league without first uninstalling it, it leaves a lot of the configuration files behind from the previous install a long with some other things. So if you haven't tried re installing through this method I would give this a try.\n\n**5) Launch league with administrator privileges**\n\nThis is just a guess of something that might work to fix it, I am not sure if it it will, but it is worth a try.\n\n--\n\nIf those don't work could you please send me through a full list of your system specifications? The easiest way to do that would be to do it through a [DirectX diagnostic.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq5) This will help me get a good idea as to what you are running inside of your PC to check for any parts that may clash with each other and cause issues such as the one you have mentioned.\n\nOther than that you could try sending in a [support ticket.](http://support.riotgames.com)\n\n--\n\nThank you for compiling the information and coming out to the Help and Support boards. I hope these ideas help you solve your issue and if there is anyway other ways I can lend a hand, let me know!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Puretwo","date":"2017-01-02T10:47:39.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Found out what the problem was, i was getting the problem on Diablo 3 aswell, turns out its a problem within the xbox app built into windows there is a setting called Game DVR and apparently it stops Direct X from being detected or something, So i have solved the issue\nIf anyone else has this problem make sure to let them know about this RITO <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Perry Perry Saws","date":"2017-01-01T05:52:22.903+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"try unplugging it and plugging it back in","replies":[]}]}
