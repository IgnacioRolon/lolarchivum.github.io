It&#039;s not giving me any option other than reconnecting, and when I tried to reconnect I just get a black screen while it tries to load and then a message saying it can&#039;t connect to it, \nOnly chat working.\n\n\n I&#039;ve tried closing and restarting the client, and I&#039;ve tried restarting my computer with no success so I&#039;m kind of at a loss as to what I should do.","replies":[{"poster":"Alistar Overreem","date":"2016-01-06T03:27:24.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok after 2 hours i got a message saying\nthe game you are trying is no longer in progress .\nPress Ok to continue.\n\nand it returned to normal.\n\nthose who are having similar problem i found this on na forum\n\n\n\nere is the reply from support:\n\nGreetings DragoRoyal,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you were stuck in a completed game. It sounds like you experienced what we refer to as a ghost game. This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will last a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. It often ends much earlier because the game server is simply backed up. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.\n\nAnother side effect of the Ghost game is a delay with receiving your Influence Points, Experience or League Points. Once the game \"clears\" the server, these values will be updated on your account accordingly.\n\nIf the issue persists or occurs frequently, it may indicate a problem with your connection. If this is the case, I would be more than happy to help you find the cause. If it was just this a one-time occurrence, it was likely due to a delay in our server.\n\nI am sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you have any questions.","replies":[]}]}
