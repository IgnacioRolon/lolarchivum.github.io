Since then i have been playing on other accounts and have not received 1 punishment. This is an appeal to get this account unbanned and i realise as my 14 day was my final chance i believe i have reformed and am no longer the toxic person i was 7-8 months ago. If you would like to check my chat logs for account I have used since this account 1 account name is NGU Reformed (Even says im reformed in the name)\r\n\r\nHope to hear a response from you soon\r\n- xPeasant","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-17T02:26:16.322+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, a punishment will not be removed or reduced unless it was made in error. There were tests run that allowed players to retrieve permanently banned accounts after a period of good behaviour, however they resulted in almost universal relapse rates. The cost to the general population was far too high for the benefit it offered the tiny percentage (that reformed) of a tiny percentage (that were perma-banned to begin with).\n\nCredit to you for making the effort to reform, it takes work and persistence! I wish I could give you the answer you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Veximus Maximus","date":"2019-11-18T03:28:47.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Have you ever played league of legends?\n\nJust playing it gives people PTSD. There is no game out there more toxic and awful than League. \njust do away with banning people for speech.  Its why we have mute buttons. Focus on banning people who actually ruin games.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-18T09:00:34.326+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Regularly. When I regularly played Overwatch it was just as bad, arguably worse because you could get blasted in voice chat too.\n\nDifferent negative experiences will affect different people to different degrees. As a whole, both negative chat *and* negative gameplay are harmful, so both are punished.\n\nYou don't ignore one class of negative behaviour just because a different class has the potential to be more harmful to some people than the other one is. Especially when that factor is very much subjective to the individual.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-12-14T07:41:01.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"At some point, you will realise, the person ruining them is you.
