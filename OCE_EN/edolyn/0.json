Not once have I used any third party stuff because I have spent so much money on my account. Tonight I just tried to log into it and it said It has been banned for using third party stuff? I last played League of legends 9 days ago in an aram so I was shocked to see this.\n\nI read the forums and people said to check your match history on oce.op.gg which I just did and what do I see? To my suprise someone has just played four ranked games in the past 4 hours. I don't even get home till 7:00pm because I work full time so this is definitely not me and I'm very scared as to how someone was able to log into my account. \n\nI have never shared my password with anyone nor have I used any third party stuff as again I repeat I'm an honest player that has spent a lot on my account and I'm really upset that this has happened to my account. I have immediately changed my password using my registered email and I sincerely request you to please look into this for me as this has me really worried. \n\nThank you, Edolyn.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-14T10:45:01.086+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"1.

If you submitted a regular ticket they will direct you to open an account recovery one anyway, so you may as well do that now and skip the wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Edolyn","date":"2020-01-15T09:16:44.294+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noted - thanks Ninox.
