We won a game, they added me to play again however their rank was too high for me to join. We queued at the same time and had the same team again. Doesn&#039;t this counter the fact that lower rank&#039;s cannot duo with higher ranks?\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-05-19T03:28:30.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twisted treeline rank is a little bit all over the place since there aren't many people that queue up for it (which is why we have it on set days).\n\nIn order to stop players from waiting for hours on end to have balanced matchmaking it ends up putting whoever is queued up in the same game. Unfortunately it ends up with players getting matched way out of their skillzone. \n\nThe only fix for this is for more players to be playing twisted treeline, so spread the word and get your friends in on it!","replies":[{"poster":"Edolyn","date":"2017-05-19T05:31:00.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Yaiamone,\n\nThat makes sense, thanks.\n\nCan I ask if there is a reason why Twisted Treeline is not open on all days in OCE? I think this may be a cause contributing to the lack of players playing Twisted Treeline as the time frame is very limited.","replies":[]}]}]}
