I&#039;m currently looking for someone who is not so serious about their rank but loves to win at the same time has fun and enjoys the concept of this game :)\n\nI really love to play Shen + Morgana in all 3 ranked modes and currently on an 18 win streak. I&#039;ve come to realize its not as fun when I&#039;m playing alone so I&#039;m interested in starting some DuoQ ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Haidos","date":"2017-05-21T00:29:37.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure if you want to duo with me, im gold 5 and i care about my rank, i want to progress through the ranks.
