Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go.

Only very serious offences result in skipping punishment tiers, so either you have received chat restrictions and missed the screen filling \"CHAT RESTRICTED\" popup and the subsequent effects in game, or you committed an offence serious enough to warrant skipping those two tiers, which typically involves things like hate speech.\n\nAs for \"what verbal abuse?\", your entire log is tearing into your team.
