After the restart the client wouldn&#039;t respond and finally after about 10 minutes I was able to get back into the game (unfortunately too late to be able to stop a defeat). This stuff happens and when it happens to anyone on my team I&#039;m usually pretty understanding, however what I don&#039;t understand is how leaverbuster then puts me into low priority queuing for 5 matchmaking games and makes me wait 20 minutes before being able to play another game for being afk for 10 minutes in ONE game which was entirely their clients fault. Maybe spend less money on cinematics and more on fixing this shocking thing?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-27T10:07:11.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a fuse blew in your computer, or maybe your OS decided \"Yeah, it's time to restart so I can finally apply that update I've always wanted.\" Either way, being inactive for ten minutes in just one game will not warrant a low priority queue penalty unto you.","replies":[]}]}
