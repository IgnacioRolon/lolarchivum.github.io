I fukkin always nerfed Illidan, (him & that stupid eyeball thing): I just unsheath my Frostmourne, a few slices & he dies.\nMy blade can slice through armour, yet still slice a tomatoe. hehe. Afghanim Scepter with Refresher Orb maybe!   :)\n\nI think Talon is weaker, at least for myself. I compound the effect of Mercy with my \"Talon-Originally-Kreated\" rune page that just so happens to be called \"Mercy\".          Check it out on:        http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/OCE/Neo89/runes      * It's No.2 out of eight.\nFrom slot 1 to 6 in my inventory, I favour this build when used with my \"Mercy\" rune page:\nDeaths Dance or Lord Dominiks' Regard, (option No.2 if there are around 2 or 3 enemies with +500 extra max health than I) which also gives my up to +40% extra damage on any enemy that is both under 40% health & under the effect of any slow, root, stun or supression.\nSlot 2 to 6 in order: Essence Reaver, Infinity Edge, Berserker Greaves, Static Shiv & Phantom Dancer. Iron or Wrath potions to finalise power boosts, I usually opt for Iron potion as I already have kuntloads of damage, (the reason is for the extra tenacity that my whole team benefits from when extracting from ganks, & also +500 extra hitpoints).    :))))))))\n\nWith the new Talon in order to achieve somewhat of the same effect, (albeit much weakened): I would 1st have to land a double hit with \"Rake\" then I would \"Q\" for a leap while at the same time, (crucial time is missed out on cuz I cannot blink & slow with the old Q: 99% slow for 0.25 seconds).\n\nWith 100% chance to deal +96% crit strike \"bonus\" damage, when I'm able to deal +40% extra damage from 18/12/0 in mast in a solo dual whilst their also under 40% health: (Warlords, Fresh Blood, Vampirism, Merciless, Wanderer, GreenFathers Gift, +7 Armour pent, Bounty Hunter & Assassin). The olde Talon is more powerful as he is Truly my Deathmaster with his short burst damage. Though I'm usually with Deaths Dance.\n\nWith the new Talon, his new \"W spell\" or \"Rake\" has only 40% slow yet I suspect that is only if the blades hit the enemy twice, I'm almost certain.....\nToo much time is wasted with this in comparison with the olde Talons' \"Cut-Throat\" spells effects!\n\nWhen flash is combined with Exhaust, (they have -10 armour & magic resist therefore): I used to blink with \"Cut-Throat\" which would activate my passive \"Mercy\", I could rake for extra damage until that becomes a waste of my time, (as at full build my basic attacks do a far greater amount of damage than \"Rake\"). The advantage is that I can slay my enemies much faster if I Flash towards them then  use \"Cut-Throat\", I fukking rape them mate. Even the most armoured &/or tanked heroes die within seconds. Berserker Greaves with Warwick on my team, (his Hunters' Call) gives my 100% chance to deal +96% crit strike \"bonus\" damage the ultimate edge.\n\nTruth is though mate, it is quite dangerous to choose this build as I am far too weak in early to mid game whilst they are too strong for me.\nIf one can achieve this build without dying in any game. (with the olde Talon) if you have a good team U will get multiple pentakills no worries!\n\nYou are certainly correct about Talon not being that strong and as for Warwick, I've got over 723,984 champion points on him as of 22:40hrs AEST time in Melbourne, 20th of January.   :)       I used to main Banehallow in Dota 1, I'm 28 and I pre-ordered \"The Frozen Throne\".\nCheck it out on:      http://www.lolskill.net/summoner/OCE/Neo89/champion-masteries\n\nI got Need for Speed Underground on special quite some time after its' release with a meal deal from Pizza Hut, (I also got L.O.T.R. The Tow Towers from the same Pizza Hut special back in the day). Great games.  Legolass' arrows used to shine blue after he trained up some.    Looked so awesome shooting them siege towers at Harrogath, FML I meant to type The Battle of the Hornburg/Helms Deep.\n\n Over 300% magic find with my battle set No.1 out of 2, a pure summon necromancer with the abilities to have 40 in my team, so many fukking skeletons running around. One day I'll exceed quest_1 in Act_3: Hell Difficulty.     I had an error with the Shael-Eth runeword combo in my V_1.12 patch.\nBlizzards'official website offered me nil help, I had a 2 socketable rare shield. I really got fukked over dude it was terrible. Blizzrards' lack of concern fukking nerfed my Nekromancer they are a bunch of fukkking skums, (this happened almost 2 years ago). No time can heal those wounds....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Neo89","date":"2017-01-20T08:11:10.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why say my argument/speculation is pointless??? Really, you think my perception is POINTLESS???? Bro.....    Sis.....     Fellow humanoid....  wtf lol.....\n\nBanehallows' been drawn up, (with the electro-magnetical waves displaying his lifes' essence).\n\nMate, I have 772,992 champion points on Warwick & I've been a noob ganker with squad one players, (I've also played Dota_1 since around the 6.38b patch). Not to mention that I pre-ordered \"The Frozen Throne\" after I installed a burnt copy of Reign of Chaos.\n\nWith Frostmournes' \"Chaos\" damage I've suppressed your responses' effectiveness, (unless you counter with a good argument to satisfy my arrogance). GG\n\nAs to your 3rd & 4th sentences, why would Riot be offended when I state that flash spell already exists & therefore makes Talon & Warwick even easier to claim blood with.\nWarwicks' new Hunger Strike, (which has a leap element) & Talons' new Q has a leap element as well.....       YET FLASH ALREADY FUKKING EXISTS brooooo.\n\nIn hindsight, I think it makes them too strong in that respect & therefore just encourages people who are new to Warwick & Talon to try them out.\nThat factor is good I think, the part that there'll be more players to counter my Warwick & Talon skills!\n\nIf you want, please add me so we can get to know each other.\n\nPs: I lost my first 6 out of 7 ranked games cuz I am so pointlessly lazy...     Happy new years to you mate. Thanks for the stupid argument lol.    :)","replies":[]}]}
