The problem is with the pvp.net client and Optus, not the actual game server (it uses a different server.) if you have another internet provider you can use that to log in, get into a lobby and then either quickly swap net just after the \"prepare yourself, the battle is about to begin \" screen ends ...(IE after the lobby screen drops but BEFORE it it loads into the loading screen, you'll only have a second to do it, but it does work, tried and tested). and there will be a slight pause and it'll reconnect you using your mobile, and you can play fine. At the end of the game it'll fail to reconnect you to the pvp.net client though so you've to re log. alternatively once everyone loads into the game, and your standing in summoners rift you can swap the net over then and you'll disconnect for about 15 seconds and you'll be able to resume play using your Optus net, this will also work, at least it did for me many times. This took a while for me to figure out, and a lot of fiddling. I don't know if it helps any of you, but you probably can play if you really want to, it's just a sub optimal solution.","replies":[{"poster":"1LvL2Highh","date":"2016-05-03T11:41:18.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers man! i think optus might of fixed their shit! im in que right now but it won't log me onto chat, hopefully i can get a game that's all it matters haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"1LvL2Highh","date":"2016-05-02T15:51:39.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"has anyone resolved this mystery problem??? :( im itching for a game haha","replies":[{"poster":"Pastaa","date":"2016-05-02T15:55:46.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope pretty much everyone has tried fixing it and everyone has come up short, trust me im itching for a game aswell haha","replies":[{"poster":"1LvL2Highh","date":"2016-05-02T16:09:53.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awh man :( took work off this week to play leauge and climb!
