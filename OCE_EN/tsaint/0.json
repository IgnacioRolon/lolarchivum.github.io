I&#039;m a support main, in Platinum II atm (season 5: Silver III, season 6: Gold V, placed in Silver III this season), I would prefer if you&#039;re around the same rank as me, and not toxic. I have Discord for communication, but am somewhat quiet though. I&#039;m aware that I have things to improve on, and am working on my skills still.\r\nEither reply to this post, or add me in game please, I&#039;m typically online most days.\r\nSummoner name: Tsaint\r\n\r\nThank you ^^","replies":[]}
