Do focus on your own game, do focus on improving and learning from every game. If you can do that winning will come as a side effect.\n\n* What's the main point of solo queue for you? Personally for me its all about being the best player I can be. How can I improve and climb the ladder till I am happy with my current skill level? It's all about learning. How do I die less? how do I impact the game more? how do I pressure the map? how do I control vision? how do I do everything better? The focus is on myself. It's all about doing everything in my control to impact the game positively and learning what else I can do to impact the game more. If you learn and improve from every game and find enjoyment from that then win or lose it doesn't matter as much. As long as you're improving every game! Winning will come as a side effect if you have this mindset\n\n\n* One thing that has helped me the MOST in changing my mindset to purely focus on myself is to look at my own KDA ((kills+assists)/deaths) every game. Personally I have a mind set of \"If I don't get X KDA then I did not impact the game enough to win (I wasn't good enough there is more to learn)\"\nFor me right now that X is 4, if I don't get a KDA of 4 or more I heavily review why I died so much or why I didn't get assists or why I didn't get any kills. Why did I not influence the game enough?\n\nBelow is an image with your last 14 games, your kda and whether you won or not (red is a loss , green is a win).\nIn your last 14 games you only had one game with a KDA over 4 (and you won that one!) you had a couple over 3.5 and you won one of those.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CR6Isvh.png\n\n \nMaybe go back and think about what you could have done to make more positive impact on the game (more kills + assists, less kills). I guarantee if you can work on your game and work towards 4 KDA each game you will start climbing out.\n\nSomething that really helped me get into the right mind set for ranked games was this great [gbay99 video](http://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc)","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-04T23:56:41.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maraudaur you seem like a nice person, at least better than me.

I stopped playing ranked too just so my teammates don't loose because of my firewall error.\n\nI even posted my issue to the Riot Technical team, now they are talking to the ISP's that are experiencing this issue.\n\nAs you know going afk with a firewall error is not my fault. Is there any chance I can get banned after the 20 mins queue? Can the ban be lifted if the Riot technical team already know they are issue with the server and it is not my fault?","replies":[]},{"poster":"lIlIIlIIIlIIlIl","date":"2015-02-03T09:50:33.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Maraudaur\n\nThere were people in plat 3 two were placed into silver 1 after winning  7/10 games.

While some gold players PUT IN SILVER 5 EASILY AFTER PLACEMENTS easily go back to Gold 3 or higher. The other really %%%%%%ed Gold players are clearly stuck in SILVER 5 or bronze 1's, 2's etc\n\nI was bronze 5 last season, I had KDA of 10/10/10 most games, I tried to carry every game. I learned a lot when being stuck in bronze, I mean a lots, so much that I am better than many Gold 5's now.\n\nThis season was just too easy for me. I picked Jinx as adc, and literally carry my noob supp too many games. I just get the towers and dragons really quickly and I focus on only objectives. Since most bronzes are clearly trollers, you have to do everything yourself. \n\nEven if u tell a bronze to not feed then all of a sudden they start feeding more.\n\ni watched lots of cool stream like iamcutiepie, wildturtle and learned how to vent off the anger.\n\nI do rage many times when players are just purely %%%%%%ed. Luckily this season, all the trolls were kicked to bronze 4 or lower. I know your feeling dude, it suck to be put up with trolls or purely unskilled players who cant even have 100 cs in 30 minutes mark.\n\nBut now it is not troll I am having issue with, Riot is now putting me with bad players but not trolls, most of my players were Gold 5 or higher last season. \n\nBut now the main problem is RIOT TROLLING ME WITH THEIR BROKEN SERVER ISSUES. I told this to them one hundred times. I will keep repeating this like mantra everyday to riot.\n\nHere it comes again:\n\nRIOT PLS FIX YOUR SERVERS, I AM GETTING FIREWALL PROBLEM, LOST 3 RANKED GAMES IN A ROW SINCE I WAS DISCONNECTED. I LET DOWN ALL MY TEAM MATES SINCE I could not connect to the game. SWITCHED MANY ISP's, still RITO U R TROLLING ME. NOW U TROLL BETTER THAN UR INVENTIONS \"TRUNDLE AND TEEMO\".  \n\nREMOVE THE 20 MIN LEAVER BUSTER QUEUE FOR OCEANIA UNTIL YOUR SERVERS ARE FIXED AGAIN.
