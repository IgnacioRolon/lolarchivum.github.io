These chinese players have got nothing good to offer on the OCE server other than serious tilt, AFK, ultra-sensitive ego's and name calling in their native tongue getting off scot free without punishment.\n\nIf they're not from playing from mainland china, they're international students here playing from internet cafe's and ruining the solo queue grind experience for those that try to climb in ranked.\n\nThere's no racist sentiment here, these guys assume and call their teams \"white dogs\" and so forth where the instant report system does no penalise these individuals for clearly racist slurs and offensive terms.\n\nBecause Riot is a stupid company and refer people to open up tickets to support to get any incident or match where such reportable punishment can be looked at, their priority is for profit and revenue, selling more ahri, kai'sa and lux skins to the weebs rather than weeding out systematic issues with their game, starting with these losers who ruin other people's games.\n\nRiot is disgusting, always have been. \n\nIf I was CEO of Riot for the day, i'd fire every single one of those in charge of player behaviour and how the system lets everyone down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Zoidberg","date":"2019-11-05T01:23:20.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is a greedy company and has sexism involved at the company XD.
