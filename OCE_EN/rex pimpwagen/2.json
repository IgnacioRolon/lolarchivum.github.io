Ive been using it every game ive played as sion and it makes a huge difference to his power throughout the game with either tank or ad versions of Sion as a second or third item after. Its basically 800 hp shield for your whole team late game once you hit around 1k stacks on your w and its still really strong before that because of it scaling with any hp you pick up from items as well.","replies":[{"poster":"LRIG Tama","date":"2018-11-03T03:17:44.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because people still can't get over \"Strategically Minded\" Sion?","replies":[{"poster":"REX PIMPWAGEN","date":"2018-11-03T07:35:58.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha yeah that's probably right but it would work on that as well anyway since its so cheap. The champion is too strong atm because of the base power in his kit. You can compare him to mundo in that way, a champion that also has all his power in his base kit and scales purely from def items and quickly realise the significant power difference between the two simmilar types of champion that both serve a simmilar purpose.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-11-05T04:16:21.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just keep doing what works for you. When you get to a higher skill level (it's oce with monkeys in terms of strategy, so probably diamond 2+), you'll see why locket on Sion top is not efficient. Don't complain about idiots not using good strategies, keep it a secret, or use it to boost for money :)","replies":[{"poster":"REX PIMPWAGEN","date":"2018-11-12T09:34:28.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using him as suppport or jungler so yeah i don't need that efficiency because i get better value than that by hitting 6 exactly when i buy the first part of yommus ( both jungle and sup hit the same gold at lv 6 although sup does it later) for the cut people in half power spike then farming like mad between ult cds and counterganks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-11-03T10:16:23.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I prefer to have my toplane tanks building damagey utility such as frozen gauntlet, thornmail and sunfire or even zzrot if we want to do a 4-1 split with a shen, and have the stoneplate locket combo on a support tank. Since these toplane tanks might still duel and pressure a solo lane, whilst a support tank obviously has less gold and so rather invests in 'burst' tankiness.\n\nIt's why toplane tanks like Ornn typically go for the grasp of the undying keystone for dueling, rather than the resistance steroid that is aftershock. The raw stats for dueling of the locket-stone plate is subpar, and only really shines in teamfights for a few dramatic moments.\n\nOn another note, locket stoneplate combo is a lategame value set for a support tank, but ideally you should be pressuring the game before it reaches that point, and for alot of tanks the utility team support items like a frozen heart, thornmail, knights vow, righteous glory, or zekes is generally more effective as a powerspike in the unorganised mess that is soloq, where you will likely only make strong use of locket if the enemy team has a particular AoE medium burst engage such as Sion/Victor/Yasou/Malphite ults, or generally where you need to shield a medium amount of burst across the entire team at once. Since as a solo shield, locket isn't good at providing protection.","replies":[{"poster":"REX PIMPWAGEN","date":"2018-11-12T09:30:22.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just building this on him with yommus and glacial lol","replies":[]}]}]}
