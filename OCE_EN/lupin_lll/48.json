The only benefit I can think of keeping it is to stop spamming, which is good. But it doesn&#039;t belong in the lobby, where people copy paste messages to get roles. The nature of it means people are always going to get blocked unfairly. \r\n\r\nNow the drawbacks\r\n\r\nSometimes the system bans people before it even sends their message, this makes people feel cheated and instantly lock roles because &quot;They feel they should of got the role&quot;. I know, because I know people who do it including me. Feelsbadman.\r\n\r\nSince people spam copy paste when they enter a lobby, sometimes someone calls before them and someone else gets the role but they keep messaging because they don&#039;t see this. They then get chat blocked and can&#039;t try to call a different role as they watch someone call the secondary role they wanted seconds later. This leads to the same as the first argument.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re going to have such a poor system as we do currently, either implement a new better one or remove the features that make this one clunkier than they need be.","replies":[]}
