My cursor is usual windows one, not the normal league cursor. When I first right click, in the background it opens a popup with two options, view sources and something else I can&#039;t remember. Clicking view source brings up a file in a text document. I can&#039;t remember the file name sorry. I can still play, however if I click the point where the popup opens while ingame, it exits down to the desktop and brings it up. I can&#039;t type ingame but can still cast spells etc.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-07T09:16:08.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds to me like you had something running while you were playing league that was taking priority (focus) from the league window.\n\nHave you experienced this issue since?","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-09-08T05:48:12.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha! I just looked at it closely and and it has something to do with Discord:  <title>Discord</title>\nI guess I'll turn off the overlays, or even turn off discord entirely.\n\nThanks for the reply","replies":[]}]}]}
