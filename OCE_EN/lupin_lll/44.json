While she is moving and standing still..\r\n\r\n_Passive_\r\nMomentum: Autoattacks add a stack of momentum, with a maximum of five. Each stack of momentum adds extra damage according to level. You cannot add stacks while dancing. The stacks disappear after 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n_Q_\r\nDance: Jumps to a target dealing 50/85/115/150/185(+50% AP) (+100% AD) physical damage and entering a dancing stance for three seconds. Using this ability expends a stack of momentum, reducing the CD to .5 seconds.\r\nAlso adds a stack of harmony for 2.5 seconds. CD: 8, Mana: 35\r\n\r\n_W_\r\nTake a Bow: Expends all stacks of harmony to heal for 20/25/30/35/40% of damage dealt per stack caused in the last 10 seconds and gaining a 20% speed boost per stack for 2 seconds. CD: 18, Mana: 60/70/80/90/100\r\n\r\n_E_\r\nInspire: Sarea and all nearby allies gain a 20/30/40/50/60%(+5% per 50 AP) speed boost for 2 seconds. If Sarea has stacks of harmony, the speed boost is instead equal to (20/30/40/50/60%(+5% per 50 AP) + 10% per stack) and spending all of the stacks.\r\n\r\n_R_\r\nPrepare!/Perform!: For the next 5 seconds, hitting an enemy forms a tether between Sarea and the target. Hitting another target tethers that target to the next and so on. While tethered, enemies suffer (40/75/110 damage + 5% AP) damage per second.\r\nSarea can choose to activate again or wait for the 5 seconds to end to activate _Perform!_. Once _Perform!_ is activated, Sarea becomes untargetable and travels along the tether stunning enemies hit along the way for 1 second\r\nand dealing (100/200/300 + (60% AP)(100% AD to tethered targets. Hitting champions grants stacks of harmony and momentum. CD: 100/90/80, Mana: 100\r\n\r\nPlaying as:\r\nBuild up momentum stacks otherwise _Dance_ will go on Cooldown and your attacks won&#039;t hurt as much\r\nUse _Take a Bow_ to escape from combat after using _Dance_\r\nInspire grants a large speed boost to allies, use it to help them chase or escape\r\n_Prepare!_ works against all enemies with the exception of buildings\r\n_Dance_ towards foes and then attack them. Reset your harmony stacks before they disapear\r\n\r\nPlaying against:\r\nDon&#039;t let her build stacks off minions for free. Once she uses _Dance_ she can&#039;t build more _Momentum_ for 3 seconds\r\n_Perform!_ will activate so long as she is alive no matter what after 5 five seconds\r\n_Take a Bow_ will win her trades, however she can only heal with it after using _Dance_ and _Perform!_ and the stacks only last 2.5 seconds\r\n\r\nGenerally, I&#039;d say put her in the jungle. She has sustain and _Dance_ to deal with the creeps in there along with utility provided by _Inspire_. Obviously, _Dance_ is good for ganking opponents and sticking onto them.","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-08-04T08:54:54.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a champion concept called \"Kharld the War Dancer\" about a month ago.\nJust asking if you had read it and thought the name could be used differently.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-08-04T10:04:08.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-08-01T12:06:51.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry just isn't a concept that can work in the game, and the concept dosent feel like it would fit in the league or lore or the game maybe next time dude","replies":[]}]}
