Using an ability spends drunkness. Taking a swig restores Drunkness comparative to the % of HP he has lost. \r\n\r\n**Abilities**\r\n_Passive:_\r\nTake a Swig! - After being hit by an enemy champion attack or spell, a 10 second timer is set. If the timer is already ticking, it is reset. Once the timer hits 0, Gandri restores 10% of maximum health and gains cup. At 100 cup, Gandri becomes drunk and loses 5 cup/second.\r\n_Q_ CD: 15/13/11/9/7 Cup: 30 \r\nMountain Strike - Gandri swings his hammer in a 180o arc taking 1 second to complete the swing . The first target suffers 90/110/140/170/200 + (.5 AD) and is stunned for swing time * 1/1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds. While drunk, this swing affects all targets and sends them flying ??? units in the direction of the swing.\r\n_W_ CD: 20/18/16/14/12 Cup: 10\r\nWarden&#039;s Watch - Marks a nearby ally unit with 100/200/300/400/500 range. If an enemy champion hits that target, Gandri may reactivate to jump to the target dealing 40/50/60/70/80 + (1 AD). While drunk, this deals double damage and stuns for .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds.\r\n_E_ CD: 15/13/11/9/7 Cup: 40\r\nWarden&#039;s Grasp - Gandris grabs onto a target, if they move outside of Gandri&#039;s attack range for more than 1 second, they are stunned for .75/1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds. If the target moves away rapidly more than 2x Gandri&#039;s range before 1 second, they are not stunned. While drunk, Gandri insteads grabs the target for 2 seconds, during this time Gandri may throw then ??? units as a linear skillshot. \r\n_R_ CD: ??? Cup: 0\r\nWhirl em&#039; round - The target is spun around over Gandri&#039;s head 3/4/5 times once per .5 seconds dealing 100/200/300 + 20%/30%/40% AD to enemies hit and the 1/2 to the target being spun. Damage to the champion is ONLY applied if they hit an allied champion. Gandri may reactivate this ability to throw the target as a linear skillshot dealing the same amount of damage. After all spins are completed, Gandri has one second to throw the target else they are dropped. CD: 100\r\n\r\nPros\r\nGandri is good in team fights, effectively disabling someone he gets into range with and zoning that area.\r\nGandri is good at trading in lane with his passive.\r\nExtremely good at initiating if he gets into range of someone \r\nBuilding tank along side with AD can still allow him to deal out damage with his Q\r\n\r\nCons\r\nGandri is slow and has no quick initiation tools. This makes him easy to kite/avoid with ranged attacks.\r\nGoing all in on Gandri can negate the use of his passive majorly. Don&#039;t try to have small trades with him.\r\n\r\nPlaying against\r\nGandri is slow and melee reliant. Stay out of his range and he won&#039;t be giving you trouble.\r\nWhile he is spinning someone during his ult, avoid him. He will deal no damage to the victim nor to you.\r\nGandri&#039;s only form of chase is his W and E.\r\nHe can only restore drunkness by _Take a Swig!_.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-11T09:05:42.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a cool concept! Would love to see you double down on the drunken dwarf aspect.\n\nI feel like right now getting drunk has no downsides and happens rather passively. Maybe you can create some risk/reward scenarios instead? All being drunk does right now is empower his abilities. Maybe there is something you can do to make the player feel more like a drunken dwarf when playing him?\n\nIt's important to think about how you want the player to feel when playing your champion and what mechanics can achieve this.\n\nAlso I think Wardens watch doesnt fit well, not a very dwarfy or drunken move imo.\n\nFor Wardens grab are you expecting this to be like a tether (i.e. leblanc chains). Also I am interested in the E and R when you are able to grab/throw champions. Do you feel this is also \"fun\" to play against? what kind of counter play is there for an opponent? Are E and R point and click abilities or are they some sort of skill shot?","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-09-13T05:53:27.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the grab mechanic would work two ways:\n1. Stunning the target for X time, during this time the caster has to perform the relevant skillshot\n2. Tethering the target to the caster for X time in X units, the target can't move out of this radius from the caster, but may still fight back. In the case of Gandri, he's beefy enough to survive the target attacking him. Anything that cleanses CC would count towards cleansing a grab. There might also be a mechanic would the target has to \"tug\" out of the grasp by moving, where the caster has to \"tug\" back to keep them from breaking it. In this time you have to cast the spell to throw the opponent.\n\nI don't think it'd be too toxic so long as it isn't put into a core ability that can be easily used over and over again. That's why I placed it on the ult, and while he's drunk on the E. The ult would be a point and click. He has to get pretty close to spin the target, and it's not too much worse than a skarner ult.\n\nI'll work on updating the abilities to be more thematic","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LiamTheViking","date":"2016-07-11T23:11:44.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a valid idea-hopefully a riot employee sees this","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-07-12T01:02:42.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually a repost on my part, I'm hoping Marauder sees it","replies":[{"poster":"vannetapear","date":"2016-09-10T04:58:30.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im hoping Marauder sees mine too haha.
