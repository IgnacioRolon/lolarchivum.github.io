All of them turned out horrible. She is squishy and doesn't do enough damage IMO. Sure she does % damage, but that is based on CURRENT health. Yes, you can R then E and Q them, but her damage is that bad that they can kill you straight after jumping... It's umm... I dunno. I'm probably just really bad with her :P","replies":[{"poster":"Umi","date":"2015-02-11T21:12:43.322+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elise is a really tough champion to play right now. She's relatively unforgiving with her mistakes and she has a huge amount of mechanics that take a lot of games to get the hang of. From my perspective right now Elise can still do a huge amount of burst damage, but she has to build squishy to do so.\n\nI'm not sure she's necessarily 'weak' right now, from my perspective at Challenger/Diamond games there are still a few Elise mains who have found a lot of success on her, but I do think she's 'hard to play'. If you're interested in committing to Elise I'd say go for it, she's one of the more rewarding champions to invest your time into.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T10:32:56.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bma,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ZPvxbTn1,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-02-11T21:12:43.322+0000)\n>\n> Elise is a really tough champion to play right now.

Everything is so dependant on landing a stun; you're squishy as %%%%... she's just, ugh.\n\nOn top of that she's overshadowed by every other jungle in terms of ease of play relative to effectiveness.

If you build her tanky shes still ok, kinda like a rammus. Provides CC and a tank but has a better smite+execute.\n\nI personally build her slighty tanky. Magus - Sunfire - Sorcs - Void Staff - situational (usually Abyssal) - situational. Provides very good execute damage but doesn't get 1-shot like Full AP Elise.\n\nHer human Q is based on Current Health her Spider Q is based on missing health. She used to be crazy strong, now shes just solid.\n\nHer full combo is (starting in human form human) Q-W-E-R-Q-W.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-11T12:06:09.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's pretty decent in the Top Lane atm.
