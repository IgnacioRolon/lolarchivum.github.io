Fuscious can store up to 10 Chi at once.He gains 50% attack speed, but he loses 5% attack speed/Chi stored. Upon returning to base, Fuscious starts with 10 Chi \nwhich can&#039;t be lost via _Trance_.\n_Q - Chi Blast_\nFuscious charges for 1.5 seconds. During this time he may do anything like normal. After the charge, for the next 2.5 seconds, Fuscious may reactivate, releasing a large cone in a target direction.\nStanding behind terrain protects from this cone. Enemies caught in the cone are slowed by Chi * 1/2.5/4/5.5/7% for 2 seconds. The first target struck, that is at least infront half of the maximum\ndistance of the cone, is stunned for 1 second. Enemies struck suffer 70/120/170/220/270 + (.6 AD)\nThis ability may be recast before the 1.5 second charge, at the expense of 3 Chi, also reducing the CD to 2 seconds and enemies moving towards the direction of the where the cone was cast suffer an\nextra 20% slow, note, this slow extra slow only applies when moving TOWARDS the cast point.\n_W - Trance_ 3 CD\nFuscious enters a meditative trance for up to 10 seconds. Every second within this state, he gains 1/1/2/2/3 Chi. If Fuscious hasn&#039;t meditated for up to 2 seconds in the last 12 seconds, he loses all\nof his Chi stored. Being attacked interrupts the trance. Upon exiting the trance, he gains 10%/20%/30%/40%/50% movement speed for 1.5 seconds. If Fuscious has meditated for 2 seconds, he also becomes\ninvisible and untargetable for 2 seconds (Attacking or casting spells immediately cancels this effect, moving 400 units away from when he exited the trance also cancels this effect).\n_E - Chi Strike_ .1 CD (Read below)\nFuscious&#039;s next basic attack deals 15/30/45/50/65 + (.3 AD) extra damage and resets his basic attack timer. Using this ability costs 1 Chi. However, casting this ability within 2 seconds of the \nlast cast doubles the Chi cost. The first strike costs 1 Chi, the second 2 Chi, the third 4 Chi etc. This enhancement must be used within 3 seconds or it is wasted. If the attack has not yet been\nused, this ability may be recast leaving a copy of Fuscious that attacks his last target. Damage from this clone appears to affect the target, but isn&#039;t truly applied. Fuscious is invisible for 2 \nseconds,however moving 400 units away from the clones target cancels this stealth and destroys the clone. The clone mimics abilities cast by Fuscious, they don&#039;t deal damage, however the clone is \nimmediately destroyed and Fuscious revealed when he deals damage. This recast effect costs 4 Chi, ontop of the original Chi cost. The victim can see their true health when the clone is destroyed.\n_R - Essence_\nFuscious gains 30/40/50 max HP/Chi he has stored. He does not suffer damage or heal when he loses Chi, however his max HP (obviously) can&#039;t exceed what he currently has. \n(If he has 1000 max hp with 10 chi at level 6, and is reduced to 700 HP, then when he uses up all of his Chi, he will still have 700 HP. If he has 800 HP when he uses up his Chi, he will instead \nhave be reduced to 700 HP)**\nFuscious is supposed to be a fighter, presented with many options for fooling opponents into making mistakes and crippling the foe, while being quite slippery. He has an inheritent tankiness thanks to _Essence_. Since _Essence_ scales off his current Chi, Fuscious is presented with a choice of using this tankiness, or assaulting an opponent with the first strike, potentially losing 500 health. It can essentially act as a shield, since suffering 500 hit points then using all your _Chi_ is effectively the same utility. Fuscious has a huge variety of options presented with his abilities. He can start a fight with a _Chi Strike_, wait 2 seconds, activate the recast _Chi Strike_, then use _Chi Blast_ if he has fooled his opponent to stun them, then follow up with another _Chi Strike_. From here he would have to rely on his attack speed boost to finish off his opponent. Proper management of _Chi_, using _Trance_ at suitable times is key to pulling off combos consistantly, while mastering the combos themselves is no easy feat. Fuscious can deal potentionally massive amounts of damage over a fight, however, to achieve maximum result, Fuscious must outplay his opponents and properly manage  _Chi_. The need to manage resources accompanied by the interactivity between the opponent and Fuscious is fairly unique in my opinion.","replies":[]}
