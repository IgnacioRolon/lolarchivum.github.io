The new Fiora ult has the potential to be utterly devastating. However, I would daresay the new ult is THE most difficult ult to perform in the game. Now, I&#039;m not a Fiora main or anything, but I think it might need to be toned down a little bit. Maybe reset Q when she pops a vital. This would still leave it as a fairly high skill minigame, but it would decrease the difficulty from being ridiculous to hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Acrimonious","date":"2015-07-27T21:45:03.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Q reset would be a bit much.
