I was stuck in b5 before but then I learned from my mistakes. You need to improve on yourself not your team. Because of this I climbed now I am b3 on my way to silver. Don't worry you will climb.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-04-14T07:15:18.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GrainZerker is right on this one mate. Never blame your team mates. No matter how silly you believe they perform. There is good stuff that they do at certain times that you can take advantage of, then some times not to follow. Be open minded to what your team does and try and work with it. It could be worth it in the end. A big one is the head hunting on kills over taking an objective lol. Say you have a team fight and take three enemy out, two are escaping, but your right next to an half health tower with minions pushed up? Ask yourself, what would you do?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-04-14T07:14:17.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"FYI I'm just a S4, but i escaped bronze and below is how.\n\nThere is one thing wrong with your question, you didn't mention anything that you do wrong, in other words, the first impression on me is that you believe that you're perfect, in comparison to everyone else. Maybe true, maybe not.  If it is however, get that stupid thought out of your head, not even challenger players are perfect, they make plenty of mistakes, albeit far fewer than us down in lower leagues. Admit your mistakes, you die your fault, never anyone elses, same with not getting kills and objectives. You are responsible for what you do, blaming anyone else is plain stupid and will keep you in bronze for eternity. \n\nAs Dr Forearms previously stated(good advice btw) don't bother looking at how good your team is, as if you see them on tilt your brain instantly goes \" great, just great, this guy is so F***ing sh*t we are so gonna loose\", focus 100% on yourself, no point investigating and blaming your team, cos there's always something you could've done better, ALWAYS! \n\nAs for winning your games, down in bronze and silver I've noticed and abused a pattern, that just about everyone will run around like headless chickens unless someone shows them which way to go, this is how I win most of my games. Play nice in the first 10 minutes-ish, just say it's unlucky if they die, or be polite if your telling them to ward more(not WARD! YOU F***ING Sh*t\") and congratulate them on kills to raise their spirits. Get on their good side and when the time comes(generally when most of or all the outer turrets are down), change to ULTIMATE DICTATOR MODE! and rule your team with an iron fist. Insist that they group with you, drag with you and rotate with you to take turrets, single them out if they don't comply. In a majority of my games, you don't comply you get yelled at by my team, but on rare occasions the whole team won't listen and will probs loose, But ah well, shit happens.\n\nWhy this works? especially at bronze league level.\nThis pattern is very prominent at bronze league and if your the first team to group, the other team likely won't know what to do as the nasus will want to farm more, the jinx will want to split push and the jungler will want to do dragon, all at the same time. Which obviously ain't possible. Your position that you play also affects the amount of influence you have on your team, in bronze I'd say Junglers and mid laners would have the most. Up in silv the supports are added to that list. \n\nIt will be difficult to make the right calls if you decide to start doing this, but just take it slow, steady and you'll be outter bronze in no time.\n\nIf you wanna see an example of how I lead teams to victory, feel free to add meh bra.

Last 20 games you're at 25%. \n\nYou check everybodies performances after a game, what if they do same to you and see that lately your record isn't the greatest? After a loss focus on your own performance not everyone elses. \n\nIt's all about what you can do better as you go into the next game. Not raging and being toxic is a great attitude to have and you should keep it up as you move forward. It looks like you're maybe on tilt or too focused on everyone else. Just take a break or focus on yourself and you could turn it all around. I know there is nothing worse than being on a losing streak but trust me they do even out and you could end up with a great record soon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:54:26.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-04-14T09:55:03.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to never rage at your team or harass them your mates because it will make them perform worst. When they die just say it is fine they are doing good.  Also give them tips on what they can do to help them improve. Like pretend a player is getting ganked a lot tell them to buy wards and not over extend this will help them from getting ganked a lot.  But really it can't always be your team's fault it could just be you. Don't always blame your team you need to understand sometimes that it is your fault and that you need to improve on some things. Learn from your mistakes. When you lose a game don't go back into a match and start playing look at what you did wrong and what you can improve on. Like your map awareness or your csing or anything you are not doing well in. Because you can't improve your team you need to improve on yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-04-14T07:08:17.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just stop worrying about what others do wrong and focus on your own gameplay. The fact that you can't win games in bronze indicates you are doing plenty wrong, even if you don't think you are.\n\nFyi, just watching YouTube tutorials doesn't actually mean anything. You have to actually understand why certain things are done otherwise you're just wasting your time. League is a game lost in knowledge and momentum swings as much as being out skilled by an opponent. Just because somebody is mechanically good doesn't mean they know how to close out games. Seen it too many times to count.","replies":[]}]}
