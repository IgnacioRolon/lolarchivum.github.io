But its not him thats broken, its Devourer. The Unstoppable Tank Udyr has also made a come back. They just need to nerf the Devourer. Take away its initial 40 on-hit bonus OR halve the on-hit bonuses against Champions. So that it doesn't effect their jungle clear or tower damage, but they can't 1-shot people anymore without a lot of stacks.\n\nThey nerfed old feral flare by making you get 30 stacks before it could start doing anything, now they decide to let you just buy the feral flare equivalent outright with 40 stacks on it...\n\nAs for Pantheon, they are probably going to have to look at increasing Dragons attack speed (which would probably mean lowering its damage). So it takes a little bit of thought to \"balance\" it.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-27T17:37:43.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was already changes to Devourer in the PBE, along with other Jungle things.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-27T17:48:07.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There was already changes to Devourer in the PBE, along with other Jungle things.\n\ni didn't see devourer changes.
