Thinking about it, i realise my account has been hacked as i didn't play the games nor say in chat what the logs are reporting (hacker has been toxic on my account in game). What else can i do to restore my honor level as submitting tickets on the support forum just leads to bots auto solving them with links back to the 'toxic behaviour' that was conducted by the hacker?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-05T13:38:16.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit an account recovery ticket through support. Once ownership and security are verified through that process they will usually reverse any punitive actions taken on the account. It's worth noting there are exceptions to this. \n\nIf you have ever shared your account, chances are you will have to live with the consequences of that willingly compromised security. There are other exceptions, but that's the most common one.","replies":[]}]}
