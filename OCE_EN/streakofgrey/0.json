How it works is there are basically a few administrators who will be on, and if the see behavior that should be reported than your out of the team. The group will be in contact via facebook, viber etc. \r\nThe plan is to have about 20+ people so there is always people to play with. will be an open format so you dont have to be locked into lanes either.\r\nadd me in game or leave a comment below.\r\ncheer","replies":[{"poster":"Caeli Pluvia","date":"2015-09-01T13:34:39.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-09-01T14:39:22.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in just to upvote","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-09-01T14:39:55.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disregarding the reply I made earlier, I'd be happy to play with you, add me in-game!","replies":[]}]}
