Attack moving can be extremely useful when checking bushes that aren't warded, in team fights in case you miss click or while moving around the map.\n---\n\nThe other advantage to using Attack move is if you don't use the quick casted version \"attack move click\" you can see the auto attack range of the champion you are playing before you click in the target that you want to hit. This can be very useful when you play a variety of different champions that have different auto attack ranges. A good example would be if you played both Graves and Caitlyn, both have extremely different auto attack ranges.\n\n---\n\nThe quick cast version does have its advantages as well though, since you don't have to click after you hit the A button the command will go off faster than the non quick casted version. This helps you combo it with your abilities in a much faster fashion such as if you are playing Caitlyn and trying to get the headshot in immediately after every ability usage. \n\n---\n\nSo when it comes down to quick casted or non quick casted both have their pros and cons as to which is more effective and I think its based on a players personal preference. I personally prefer the quick cast version since I am a very high APM (actions per minute) player that moves around a lot clicking very close to my champion. However I have friends that don't have as high APM and prefer the accuracy of knowing exactly where their auto range is every time. \n\n---\n\nThe other really cool thing and the last one I want to note on is when you use attack move to auto attack, it can make last hitting minions easier. Attack moving can make it so that your auto attack animation comes out faster when going for last hits on minions, it sounds odd but in practice once you get used to it, you will find last hitting a lot easier.\n\n---\n\nThe last thing I want to note on is that it helps with kiting in team fighting. If you constantly are having to move backwards while auto attacking in a very fast fashion it can help to have that buffer of attack moving to hit behind you. While you should always move your mouse back ideally to click on the enemy champion, in this fast paced situation, even if you barely miss click because of the way attack move works, you will hit whatever is closest to your mouse at the time.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, if there is any other questions I can answer or anything I can clarify on let me know! Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-13T09:26:24.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what exactly is A click","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-14T03:37:53.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes\n\n> [{quoted}](name=monkiinator135,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=qYJ1zmY9,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-01-13T09:26:24.616+0000)\n>\n> what exactly is A click\n\nAttack move is something RTS players would be very familiar with. It is a move command with the added \"attack any enemy that comes within range while I move there\". If you click normal move into a bush and find an enemy there you will not react anywhere near as fast as this \"automatic\" attack command. This helps with FOW and kiting but is also a part of certain combos like Singed sky attack where you flip them and instantly attack move at your feet and barring minion block you will auto them in the air. This also works with a Trist jumping over your head and other times champions move very quickly like Reksai ult, but you obv need to be within auto attack range at some point and not have another enemy closer to take the \"agro\" for it to do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-18T05:26:42.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Laken","date":"2017-01-12T07:57:18.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no 3 clicks is far too much effort\nright click (kite)\na\nleft click (activate a)\nit's much better to invest your time on dpi movement and control/accuracy of dpi\nplay osu or a game that requires high reaction using mouse movement","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-12T01:11:26.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long answer ^ Short answer - Yes","replies":[]}]}
