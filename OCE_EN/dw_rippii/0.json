I'm studying sport science, and see performance coaching as a potential way to get into the eSports scene (I'm way too bad to get in any other way); however I know that the OCE region is still slowly developing and therefore the demand for more specialist coaches is still non-existent.\n\nHere's an article about coaching in eSports that I found particularly interesting, and I hope you will too.\nhttp://www.liquiddota.com/forum/dota-2-general/462152-coaching-in-esports-a-comprehensive-look","replies":[{"poster":"DW Rippii","date":"2017-07-27T10:24:51.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Taltarni,\n\nThis is an interesting question; I would like to start by saying that at the moment especially in Oceania there is little to no 'Performance' style coaching. Although within Dire Wolves we do have a performance director who leads the way on this front and is constantly teaching me about traditional styles of coaching and sports psychology. Other teams in Oceania are starting to follow suit, I believe AV also have invested in similar ventures. \n\nTo answer your question properly, I personally believe Performance Coaching is absolutely crucial to creating and facilitating a world class team. Concepts such as creating a culture of trust and high performance are only possible through ideas within performance coaching; although I do believe in an ideal world you would have a coach highly capable in both macro game strategy as well as traditional coaching practices. \n\nThe downside to having multiple coaches is that throughout practise the head coach who is familiar with the macro (in-game) strategy will be dealing with the players 80% of the time and should be consciously implementing leadership and coaching ideas in real time (Not waiting for the other coach to pick up the slack). \n\nThe most ideal combination for a high performance environment in my opinion would be...\n1. Head coach (Preferably ex-player familiar with macro and micro game strategy)\n2. Analyst \n3. Performance Director (Acting as a sports psychologist/Mentor for coaching and management)\n\nSharp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Anniesaur","date":"2017-07-27T06:36:08.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"srs question who does the most healthy wanks in the house","replies":[{"poster":"Phantiks","date":"2017-07-27T10:18:34.241+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chippys disappears into his bedroom for unknown reasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chippys","date":"2017-07-27T09:52:06.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nathan \"rippii\" Mott wins by far","replies":[{"poster":"Anniesaur","date":"2017-07-27T10:16:41.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idkboutthat","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"jimuskin","date":"2017-07-27T06:17:46.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"@Chippys: What have you done to seek revenge on the silver fizz which clearly showed dominant in the 1v1","replies":[{"poster":"   DW SHERN1FIRE","date":"2017-07-27T09:55:42.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chippys","date":"2017-07-27T09:52:36.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm patiently waiting for him to get challenger then i'll get him back {{champion:105}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakon551","date":"2017-07-27T07:09:14.904+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait i thought the fizz was gold not silver *thinking emoji*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jimuskin","date":"2017-07-27T06:15:01.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tits or ass?","replies":[{"poster":"Anniesaur","date":"2017-07-27T06:33:33.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ass or goodbye","replies":[]},{"poster":"BECOME STRONG","date":"2017-07-27T10:21:00.818+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not both {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"pIayboicarti","date":"2017-07-27T10:04:56.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personality","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chippys","date":"2017-07-27T10:04:29.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:3}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phantiks","date":"2017-07-27T09:57:54.911+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Face","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Solas","date":"2017-07-27T10:20:14.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, This is mainly a question for Destiny but others can still answers if they want.
