Ask us anything!","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys,\n\nFrom 7pm AEDT tonight, we will be around to answer your questions. For those that aren&rsquo;t familiar with us or just started following the OPL, here&rsquo;s a brief history of the team. \n\nThe original roster was formed by Rippii in August 2014, which was the birth of the Dire Wolves organisation. Our first major tournament was the 2014 Oceanic Regional Finals RO8 at EB Expo Sydney, where we defeated Team Immunity 2-0, advancing to the RO4 at PAX Australia, finishing 3rd/4th.\n\n2015 was the beginning of the Oceanic Pro League. We cruised through the regular season in Split 1 to face Legacy in the semi-finals, who we defeated in a convincing 3-1 series. Later we faced Chiefs in the Grand Final, dropping the set and finishing 2nd. Split 2 we had a little less success falling short to Legacy in the semi-finals. \n\nWe are currently 4th place in the [OPL standings](http://oce.lolesports.com/standings) heading into Week 10, looking to secure our playoffs spot.  \n\nThe team is as follows:\n**Sharp** - Top\n**Sybol** - Jungle\n**Phantiks** - Mid\n**Raes** - ADC\n**Cuden** - Support\n**Rippii** - Sub/Manager\n\nYou can follow us on:\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DireWolvesGaming/)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DireWolvesGG)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/direwolvesgg/)\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/DireWolvesGaming)\n\nAsk us anything or just say hi!","replies":[{"poster":"Chippys","date":"2016-03-18T07:08:26.347+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"How big are raes's ears?","replies":[{"poster":"Phantiks","date":"2016-03-18T08:55:40.712+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"let's just say that Dumbo's ears are dwarfed by them","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThighHighs JP","date":"2016-03-18T07:23:23.647+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are Raes' ears so big?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-18T07:14:41.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will you ever make it to Worlds?","replies":[{"poster":"Raes","date":"2016-03-18T08:12:17.469+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as i'm on the team","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-18T09:15:32.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ayyy lmao","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHF Spookz","date":"2016-03-18T09:01:41.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you say your favorite feature on a person is?

I think its healthy if players feel a little bit of stress to be alerted and ready but too much stress is not.\nState of the art equipment/studio is lacking in our region compared to others but I do not believe it is holding us back significantly but it would help our esports scene.\nUnderstanding the meta is absolutely crucial to be successful in esports as they are proven to be most optimal champions/items to win. Understanding your opponents is important when against specific teams but is it not as important as the other factors in esports.\nBeing friends on and off the rift comes naturally as everyone has similar aspirations of winning OPL and have to devote a large number of hours together playing League together. Especially with the rise of gaming house, it is beneficial for the team to have certain level of respect and satisfaction with each other.\nOverall, I believe pushing your limits is the most important for success in esports. Everyone should always be striving to improve themselves in every aspect such as macro, micro, attitude, behaviour and mechanics. Alot of teams become complacent after winning and if they kept pushing their limits it wouldn't have been a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"ModBrat","date":"2016-03-19T20:10:59.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, this was a perfect answer.
