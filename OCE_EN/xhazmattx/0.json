Everything is moving. Twigs stir in the wind, blown about like weapons being drawn, leaves scatter across the ground like a thousand tiny assassins, the boughs bend like giant warriors preparing for battle. Everything is moving. But I see him, and he doesn&#039;t see me, as I leap from my current perch to a neighbouring tree ten meters away. \r\n\r\nThe symbiotic carapace instinctively protects my face as I land, deadening its own purple glow as it understands that we are on the hunt. How, I do not know, but we work as one, we hunt as one. The landscape shifts into stark relief as the visor enhances my vision and I see my prey clearer. As the symbiote understands we are about to engage, my shoulders birth two pods and I feel them fill with matter and energy. I pick my moment. I pick my time. I determine this hunt. This is my re-birth. In an eternal exchange, I kill so that I am reborn, I pay the eternal toll of the hunt with their blood, and am gifted new breath in exchange. \r\n\r\nI feel it hunger. The void craves. I will feed it.\r\n\r\nI leap from the tree, and the fall is beautiful, the rush of air against flesh, it is a moment of peace in my war. My shoulders burst with energy, the missile pods streaking in a heavy rain towards my prey. They are on target, smashing into the ground in a beautiful crescendo of void energy that startles the creature and fills its flesh with shrapnel. It runs, but the plasma from the barrage has marked it clearly for me. I fire my weapons, the void matter tearing at the skin of the thing- it howls in agony- trying to flee faster. I hit the ground and the symbiote absorbs the impact, I immediately shift into a dead sprint, my visor tracking the plasma dripping from the bleeding thing. On cue I hear three shrieks as its brethren answer its plea for help. \r\n\r\nMore mouths to sever to starve the void then.\r\n\r\nI am faster than their intervention. I leap forward both weapons firing searing hot blasts of plasma that smash into the carapace of the creature. Sending it hurtling head over tail, a gooey mess on the jungle floor. As the puddle of what was once a void thing begins to steam in the cold night air, three of its kind leap into the thicket. I roll, firing as my visor tracks my foes, the first few shots pummel into the first void creature, exploding its carcass in a bloody mess over the other two. More shrieks pierce the night as the rest of this clutch run to aid. \r\n\r\nI leap at a nearby tree as a void-thing follows my movement, I immediately connect with shock absorbent legs and throw myself into the air, twisting mid leap to smash my weapon into the head of the creature. It&#039;s still carcass pummels into the tree and collapses at the base. Four more creatures burst from the brush, shrieking and howling, plasma spittle dripping from their gaping maws. I feel the symbiote seethe with hunger. It is the nature of the void- it does not care what it feeds on- as long as it is fed. I feel the pods on my shoulders reload with matter and I unleash hell. The missiles swarm around the creatures, blowing flesh off in thick gooey chunks of chitin as bodies are scattered. Smoke fills the clearing.\r\n\r\nMy visor detects one living void-thing, sprinting, some unnatural instinct telling it this was a lost battle and to return to a larger clutch. I take aim, and fire- the Void Seeker blast strikes the animal in the spine and I see the mark rupture on its skin. The Void Mark that normally bespeaks my foes death. I leap into the Void. \r\n\r\nThe nightmare washes over me. The glow of fear and non-dead things that are also non-living. The things in the shadows. The unquenchable hunger. I am there for but a second which feels two eternities as I burst back into reality upon the marked creature. The symbiote building up my armoured exoskeleton in case the thing should enter a death throe, I land on it&#039;s back and point my weapon at the top of its armoured head. I grin.\r\n\r\nMy Second Birth. I fire. Die.","replies":[{"poster":"Melk","date":"2018-03-06T04:35:27.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ayyy, I like this alot!","replies":[{"poster":"xHazMattx","date":"2018-03-06T08:59:23.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Melk! Thanks so much bud! I didn't have much of her to work with since I obviously haven't even played her yet. \n\nI think I twisted her lore a LITTLE bit since Riots own release was a little \"I still have my innocence\" kind of thing. But thanks for the feedback!","replies":[]}]}]}
