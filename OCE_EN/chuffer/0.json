I&#039;ve been playing games from an early age in my current life and probably all my previous lives. I started off with the Age of Empire&#039;s franchise and soon moved onto warcraft 3. From warcraft 3 (the actual RTS) i moved onto the custom games available on battle.net and eventually got stuck into DotA and more importantly, sheep tag. My friends slowly coerced me to play league of legends because i was the best juggernaut in my school but i was really timid at first (mainly due to the fact that league of legends had no juggernaut and i would be exposed as a fraud to my schoolmates). \n\nI eventually did start playing league of legends and between the normal games (where i showcased my unparalleled Vladimir skills to my schoolmates) i would hop onto a smurf and practice really hard to maintain my pro-but-havent-played-much image. \n\nA few decades later, after playing for mythical teams (Such as Your Soul Shall Chuffer which  won a few go4lol&#039;s (the most prestigious tournament at that time)), Jish approached me and asked if i wanted to play for Dire Wolves as their current ADC, (king) was too young. The team had the right balance between good players and udyr mains and i decided to leave a team i was sort&#039;ve playing for to pursue Dire Wolves. Dire wolves had a roster of charlie101, Sharp, Magzilla, Rippii(udyr) and we managed to qualify for the winter regionals via ACL after having a very close match with the veritas-nada fuelled AV. \n\nAt that time i was the ADC for Dire Wolves, having changed from middle lane from YSSC and towards the first split of OPL i made the transition into support with king returning as our ADC. \n\nThere is alot i probably missed with that brief brief description of my career so feel free to ask me about anything in particular!","replies":[{"poster":"Maaneskygge","date":"2015-06-06T08:46:24.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\nBeen a fan since your adc days, been following you guys in the opl!\n\n I would just like to ask what is your favourite joke?","replies":[{"poster":"ChuffeR","date":"2015-06-06T09:02:46.524+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"i love telling people about this one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shiney","date":"2015-06-06T08:48:06.104+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you ever killed a man.","replies":[{"poster":"ChuffeR","date":"2015-06-06T09:12:51.991+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"i kill level 2 men in lumbridge on a daily basis.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aurelion No","date":"2015-06-06T11:40:00.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah!

There is still not enough infrastructure for the scene to take off, so its hard to answer this question as i probably can't talk from a true proffesional gamer. \nI can say that it is a lot of hard work though, practicing the game even when you don't want to play it starts making it into a chore or work. Teams expect players to practice 4-5 games of solo queue a day and 3-5 games of private matches after that, so it can be quite bearing.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T12:12:33.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Follow up but unrelated question, how long did it take for you to get to challenger after starting league?

If you only started last season and made it to diamond in this one then you have made incredibly, and i mean incredibly good progress. \n\nYou need to push a little further to get that last bit into masters and i'd recommend watching streams for this step. I think its really tedious to watch yourself and look for your own mistakes. Rather, be conscious of your mistakes after every game, every DEATH is a mistake. Watching not only the really good pros (i'd recommend koreans) but also LPL and LCK for ahead of the meta macro plays and champions. \nLast but not least, keep practicing, you've made amazing progress and practice is how every other player at your stage has gotten better.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T12:51:49.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your advice, i will definitely dedicate some time to watching streams and LPL and LCK.
