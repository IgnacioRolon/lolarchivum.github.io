It made me think how could we incorporate the old Sion with the new? It would be so great if the Arnie voice came back and I hope others would agree, so here is my suggestion for incorporating old with new: \r\n\r\n**Special Forces Sion**\r\n\r\nPeople can help me out here this is just a rough brainstorm but I hope the jist of it is relayed.\r\n\r\n- Sion to be kitted in Military Apparel holding a military combat Axe, maybe even a Shotgun Axe to fire his E add sunglasses of course\r\n\r\n-Add some great lines from Arnie&#039;s Predator/Commando/Terminator movies into his kit.\r\n\r\n - The Creme de la Creme would be Sion&#039;s ultimate; he jumps into a Hind (Russian Attack helicopter) or swings from it and for sure he should be yelling &quot;Get to the Choppa!!! or &quot;ANG-ANG-ANG-ANG-ANG!&quot; (Die hard fans should get that...I hope...)\r\n\r\nI hope Riot thinks this is interesting enough to consider and if Sion die hard fans also agree or disagree with this skin/idea.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[]}
