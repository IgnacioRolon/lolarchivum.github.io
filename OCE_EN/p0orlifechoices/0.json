There are so many threads about this and there is still a lot of people who have still not resolved this. In short, it&#039;s not your firewall or DNS causing the issue.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on 100/40mbs NBN, firstly with OzLinked (now in liquidation) and then ANT Communications (don&#039;t bother) when I had these issues. It turns out these resellers were not providing true speeds and were often bottle necked by the wholesaler. Whilst I had no lag in game there was packet loss.\r\n\r\nAs much as 1% packet loss will cause the game to drop out and you&#039;ll constantly battle this issue until you resolve it with your ISP. I moved my ISP to TPG 100/40 (a backbone provider) and now I have 0% packet loss and a flawless LoL experience. \r\n\r\nA great way to the validate your issue is to test your bandwidth here - \r\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/ and download WinMTR \r\n\r\nRun tests on \r\n103.240.227.5 and then 103.240.227.25 \r\n\r\nAnother tool to use is ping test - \r\nhttp://www.pingtest.net/\r\n\r\nIf you are getting packet loss then your only solution is to look at speaking to your provider or swapping altogether. If you are going through NBN please ONLY buy through a backbone provider.\r\n\r\nBig shoutout to the LoL Support crew who did a great job helping me circle the issue. \r\n\r\nHope that at least helps some of you out there!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-07T11:23:55.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I moved my ISP to TPG\n\nBut absolutely everything I've heard about TPG has been terribly bad. I've never had it myself, so I can't really judge, though this is the first time I've ever seen someone praise it.","replies":[]}]}
