They said that the type of game or how long it goes on for do not matter. You get the same amount of Honour per game (and only an ever so slightly higher amount if you were honoured or if everyone in your team honours someone).\n\nSo if you spam Intro/Beginner Bot matches, that will give you the maximum amount of honour in the least time.\n\nIf you manage 3 bot games an hour, you can easily manage 30+ a day and get a few hundred done by the end of the season. Plus, you won't lose any honour since why would anyone report in Coop vs AI unless you flamed them? It's a shame we don't have Treeline Bots, or you could spam 50+ games in the same amount of time.\n\nIn fact, spamming bot games are what those Chinese leveling companies do, and they manage to get to Honour 4 or even a few checkpoints from Honour 5 in the span of about 200+ games. You could easily climb 1 Honour level and 1 checkpoint in this time.\n\nOf course, this is not easy (why would it be if this is extended punishment?)... it's playing 30 boringly simple games a day for like a week.\n\nHope this helps, and all the best :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istypuff","date":"2018-10-31T09:56:08.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=tndz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=AH92OENJ,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-10-29T07:42:52.396+0000)\n>\n> I dont know if this is the right place to post this but I got unbanned at around early august this year. i think i played more than 400-500 games after and have more than 20-40 honours a week.

Dont do anything but comepletely melt face.\nIf not you will be reported and ban for the most dumbest shit you have ever heard of and Riot will say \" Hey you did this. \"","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-29T23:33:46.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easiest way is to not be a dick. Just mute trolls and play.\nHonour 5 is easy.\n\nYou go to honour zero because you type in chat. Just don't.\nIf you can't refrain, even when it's directed at trolls, just find a way of not typing in chat. Unbind the enter key, mute all as soon as game starts, whatever.\n\nJust don't take the bait.

Honour is meant to be a season long achievement. It takes the average player 3-4 weeks to earn a checkpoint above level 2. Below honour level 2 this process is a little bit slower.\n2. As obvious as it seems, to earn honour progress you have to be honourable. It's not just about playing games, and it's not just about getting badges. Dishonourable or negative games (even if they don't and wouldn't ever result in punishment) will prevent you from progressing from that game, and positive games will earn you honour faster.\n3. You have earned 2 checkpoints in 3 months, for below level 2 this is about average. Credit where credit is due so good job on shaping up your behaviour. Unfortunately, you are likely too late to earn season rewards this year. Earning 6 checkpoints in less than a month is very unlikely to happen.","replies":[]}]}
