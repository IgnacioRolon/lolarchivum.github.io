(10 is just a random number... hell make it every 50 champs you can mark down one.)\n\nI was collecting all the champs back when I played SR, now I basically only play ARAM and I really don't want such a massive pool of champions to random from... I could just remake a new account and only unlock a couple that I like but I'd prefer not to as I have unlocked far too much in this game to restart fresh.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-15T10:36:23.627+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's ALL random.\n\nNot somewhat

bother to play this game.\n\nI've played since beta so I got bored of the same old SR map over and over, so ditched the game for a while, ARAM came out I enjoyed it so I played it, ditched the game for a while... recently have came back and thought having a way to grey out a couple champs I don't enjoy would be an ok idea, so why not bring it up for discussion...\n\nSo you are saying someone that has unlocked EVERY champion in ARAM, is on an equal playing field to someone who has only unlocked champions that are \"OP\" in ARAM?\n\nI don't really see why everyone has a stick up their butts... you have the option to unlock a champion and play it, why not give the option to lock it again?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ZRKBBLADE","date":"2015-02-15T10:39:54.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is better off that way. \nYou actually get to play those champion you

pointed out, it is suppose to be all random, sure you might not like a few champions you get, but there's a reroll system for that. \nThe reroll system is basically the solution riot give to the problem you are having right now, since you own a lot of champions, you should get a lot of reroll points per game. \nFurthermore, you pretty much already put a solution to your own problem tbh \"I could just remake a new account and only unlock a couple that I like but I'd prefer not to.\"  This would be the most suitable solution to your personal issue.\nLets hope riot see this and do something about it. \nHowever, there is simply not enough demand for riot to implant this.","replies":[{"poster":"Aarku","date":"2015-02-15T11:44:33.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making a new account to cheese the system shouldn't really be encouraged

not new, plenty people have asked for it... so it's not just \"one guy\" (some of them take the point out of \"random\", just like rerolling a new account does)\n\nI was throwing out an idea that required you to have a boatload of champions to be able to get a minor adjustment to your potential roster, which at least for me would still have a massive selection of champions to random. (I have unlocked all but 3)\n\nI doubt I'd even block out more than 4-5 champions and I'm usually out of rerolls because I reroll to fix team roster problems (All AP/AD/Melee etc), I trade and reroll for others who say they have no rerolls left.","replies":[{"poster":"ZRKBBLADE","date":"2015-02-19T00:36:41.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you read the comments here you would realize a lot of people are against this idea. \nSure. It might work, people would have the choice of using it or not. \nHowever, as i stressed before, there is simply not enough demand. The time riot spend on doing this would be better off doing something else. \nIn the end, it come back to the point of ARAM, which is all random all mid. Sometimes you will get unenjoyable champions, that is how the system was designed. \nThe fact you brought up making a new account and only unlock the champions you want is abusing the system in the first place. \nBlacking out champions don't stop this. \nIf it is 10 champions one black out, people will still have a massive pool of champion to choose from. \nIf you want pure enjoyment, making a new account is your best bet, you can unlock all the great poking champions such as nid, lux etc.  \nLosing is a part of the gaming experience, so is playing non-enjoyable champions in ARAM. Sometimes your teammates will go 1/10 and no matter how hard you try you can't carry them. \nI understand that you play the game for enjoyment, but we should't wrap players in cotton wool all the time. If you think playing those \"unenjoyable\" champions isn't something you want, why even bother play aram? Use team builder, then you get to play who ever you want.\nSometimes you get wacky teams in aram, all melee, all ap but that's the whole point, it is exciting, surprising and fun.\nI think it is too hard for me to deliver that point to you ,thus i'm ending my conversation here. \nI sincerely think this can be done and I wish riot can give this post some attention. \nGood luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-16T02:35:46.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So if I owned 10 champions and mark 1 of them down so I don't play them.
