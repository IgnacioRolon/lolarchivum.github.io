In ONLY my first 10-15 games as a lvl 9, I have witnessed things in this game you rarely see in other MOBAs. \r\nThese are constant whining! trolling! constant afk&#039;s! blaming! lying to the other team to get them reporting! griefing! and general toxicity! Boy, have I never used the report system in ANY game so much in such little time! Not only have I experienced all this in such a small amount of games, before it even starts, they complain and complain because their role was taken! or go back to searching again! don&#039;t you also love it when everyone in the game get lag spikes?!\r\nI sure have the perfect timing of joining the game during this blue essence drama!\r\nBest of all! I love seeing the surrender prompt pop out every game! it comes out everytime someone not doing so well dies! how exiting! what a unique system this game has!\r\n\r\nPerfect use of my time installing and playing the game!    .10/10  \r\nIl be playing this game so much more, thanks league of legends community! {{champion:105}}","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-30T03:30:30.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty, when OCE first started (I began on NA when OCE didn't exist), it was a great community.\nDownhill every year since.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2017-11-30T03:16:34.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xD You're gonna need to either ignore the people or git gud, gold is where u wanna be","replies":[]}]}
