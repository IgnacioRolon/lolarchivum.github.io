I&#039;m sorry if I should post it in another corner of the discussion but this is the first time I&#039;m writing a discussion.\r\n\r\nSo I really need some help with my game.\r\nYesterday my game worked just fine but whenever I want to open it today I just get the message &quot;another instance  of the launcher is running. Do you want to terminate it?&quot; even though there is no other instance. If I click yes, bugsplat opens and tells me that this game crashed.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what to do? I already restarted my computer and I opened the game as an adminstrator. I really don&#039;t know what to do now...","replies":[{"poster":"HERMES LAD","date":"2016-11-18T22:07:27.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:21}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T12:43:09.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LuziferSonozaki,\n\nAn antivirus/antimalware application may be interfering with League of Legends' ability to run properly.
