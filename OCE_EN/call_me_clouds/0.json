It's just that mods usually delete threads for either being offensive or being in the wrong Board category instead of moving them for some reason (really have no idea why Board mods can't just move threads), and that considering this kind of rather void and/or off-topic threads are for GD instead of Player Behaviour so it probably would be deleted idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-14T16:11:37.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, we could delete it. Might still but I'll leave that to the other mods. Something like this technically comes under the spam rule since it's taking up space for the sake of taking up space.\n\nAs for why we don't move threads, it's because we can't. It's things like that which are why we need boards dev cause there are features (both player facing and otherwise) which are missing. As of now what we can actually do with threads is quite limited from a \"moderation should be as clean and painless as possible\" standpoint. It works, but it could work better.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CapKebab","date":"2017-02-15T06:44:04.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mod on another website, and can say - threads like this are frustrating.\n\nLike 'Seras Dargon' has said. \nYep, it takes up room. \nWhich ultimately, ruins the boards for other summoners & eventually costs money.\n\nI haven't seen much censorship in these boards to be honest.\nI mean, what else has been censored in your case Clouds? \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}
