It's a luck based game. It's supposed to be.\nIt's not exactly supposed to be testing your mechanical skill or anything..\n\nTheres enough different strategies with combining class traits and items, champ choice and positioning, but there is a lot of luck.  I don't really see a problem with that.  Aren't pretty much all card and/or board games luck of the draw?","replies":[{"poster":"rito are scambgs","date":"2019-06-27T13:53:10.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what does different positioning do my champs just jump at random places of the map when game starts","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-06-27T14:00:53.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because those are assassins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2019-06-27T11:05:04.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its all strategy which someone like myself loves. Yes it is partially luck based if you get completely shafted by items. But if you're willing to be flexible and constantly adapt then you can often place top 4 pretty easily. people seem to forget sellback on champions return 100% value and often stick with a team comp they arent getting champions for. However some tags like noble and pirates are just god aweful, if they were a little better then it wouldn't feel like you were getting unlucky.","replies":[{"poster":"rito are scambgs","date":"2019-06-27T13:54:31.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which are the best comps","replies":[{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2019-06-27T14:52:54.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've played so far its: \n-6 nobles/phantom or dragon\n-4 or 6 Glacial/dragon/shapeshifter/wild\n-4 imperial/phantom/dragon\n-4 demon/void/3 assassin, \n-6 Assasin/knights or void or phantom (depending on if you stacked kass or mordekaiser early or if you have garen/darius/morde - you can also add kindred with morde for phantom) This one is sketchy cause it depends on if you can snowball with level 3 assassins early.\n-4 Wild/shapeshifters/dragon \n\nThese all mostly depend on how well you build early and transition into the late game. The safest is wild/shapeshifters/dragon due to the nidalee + warwick start into an easy shyvana + gnar transition with asol for late game. Adding in ahri for the last wild is my reccomendation.","replies":[{"poster":"rito are scambgs","date":"2019-06-27T15:36:42.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh thank you dude! i am total noob at this game so appreciate tips :p","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-28T10:02:46.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had a lot of success with Glacial/Elementalist (spatulas to fill out your 2 traits where possible) with Brand as the carry unit, but it's not an easy comp to roll since pretty much all units are Blue+. Even without hitting 3-star units the comp performs very well.\n\nThe biggest thing (regardless of comp) is adaptability. Remeber that you get full refund and items back when you sell level 1 units, and you only lose a little gold on 2 stars, so you can change your strat on the fly for most of the game if you're just not rolling what you need.\n\nAlso, in my experience, trait and item combos matter way more than stars. I've beaten boards with 2-3 3 star units with only 2 stars just from comp and items.\n\nPositioning matters! If your units aren't performing/are getting stuck/aren't going on who they need to be, switch up your positioning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2019-06-27T18:31:17.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its hella luck based, mainly on items. If you don't get any decent items for the comp you're building its pretty well gg.\n\nAnother reason why you might be losing or not having fun is the try hards uisng the \"OP Lulu/Kayle\" strat, which is have multiple level 2 lulu's or level1/2 kayles and you instantly win due to abilities constantly going off and not being able to kill anything.\n\nIts a beta, so don't be too hard on it, it'll get better with each patch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"F4R W3ST","date":"2019-06-27T12:19:56.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ATM it relies too much on RNG, especially regarding items.\nThe champions pool is random but at least you can adapt to it or reroll. The main problem is that the amount of items you get is random. You can get from 0 item per monster/CS killed in PVE rounds to 2 items per unit killed (maximum I've seen, but it may even be possible to get more). As long as riot doesn't implement limits to it, they can't seriously make it a ranked game mode. The best case would be that everyone gets the same amount of items from each PVE round.","replies":[{"poster":"rito are scambgs","date":"2019-06-27T13:55:26.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wth lmao that explains why enemies have so many items and i dont","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SUPER DOOT","date":"2019-06-26T17:28:22.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm confused too.\n\nThe game mode is boring AF.\n\nWhat is rito smoking?","replies":[{"poster":"rito are scambgs","date":"2019-06-26T18:05:51.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure if boring but there's so much luck in it\nits a simple mode with rewards so people can use it to detilt","replies":[]}]}]}
