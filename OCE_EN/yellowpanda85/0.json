But all she has to do is farm and she can just win the game? i don&#039;t think thats very fair. All the times i&#039;ve played up against a Shyvana they just end up farming all game and apply zero pressure. You usually see her again at the 30 minute mark where she is now 4 levels higher with 2 items advantage. Why is that fair? She did nothing but farm her jungle but is able to just be stronger than everyone else who has put pressure on the map?","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-10-02T17:12:31.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana is a bad champion. Her passive is not very good. If she powerfarms the question is.... what is your team doing? If they are all inting then there's not much you can do. Especially a platinum 1 adc inting vs a bronze 2 adc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yellowpanda85","date":"2018-10-02T16:20:18.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like if she out jungled me by ganking and applying pressure ill take it. They're better than me. But if she jsut afk farms and can come out on top then whats the point in applying pressure as a jungler?","replies":[]}]}
