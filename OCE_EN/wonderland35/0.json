I usually play Soraka {{champion:16}}  in ranked games and I&#039;m currently Silver 4 (hopefully I don&#039;t drop lol), I preferably want someone who&#039;s in silver or gold to play ranked with but high bronze is okay too ^-^ Please add me on the OCE server, my league name is **wonderland35!** Add me into any of your games! Thank you :D","replies":[]}
