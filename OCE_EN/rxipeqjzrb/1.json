Say you were gold III this season, then next season if you won most of your placements you'd get placed around GV (as I understand it, basically it drops you a little lower). If you were to play ranked in preseason and bump your rank up to Plat V, you wouldn't get a plat border or anything but winning those placements would drop you closer to GII~. Basically preseason ranked is a low risk (since you don't lose rewards and your rank gets reset) way to make sure you have less to climb next season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-11-15T13:11:08.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we dont get a gold border, but it does affect where you will be placed next season","replies":[]}]}
