To Climb to gold and perhaps further.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey been in bronze for 2 months finally got to silver about 4 days ago and I am already silver 4 finding it a lot easy to climb still looking for a duo tho. I comfortably main Mid as Viktor/ Ahri/ Fizz and I main Support as/ Leona/ Thresh/ Morgana/ Malphite. I also Main ADC as Kalista and can play Sivir and Jinx. I can play all roles and it doesn&#039;t bother me what I play. I am on quite a lot and I expect to be doing ranked most of the time I don&#039;t mind norms tho if learning a new champion for ranked. If we play a game and you not satisfied with me no hard feelings feel free to leave I hold no grudges. Let me know thanks :)  oh and Add I Smiley I","replies":[{"poster":"maoriboyalex","date":"2015-07-13T14:37:17.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me ingame IGN: maoriboyalex","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-07-13T07:35:58.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you forgot to mention your ingame name.\n\nNote: I have checked, its not 'RxipeQjZrB'","replies":[]},{"poster":"Macbethsex69","date":"2015-07-13T07:13:44.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm keen, add me In game: macbethsex69","replies":[]},{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-07-13T05:58:02.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll find more success finding a partner in the 'Team Recruitment' section.","replies":[]}]}
