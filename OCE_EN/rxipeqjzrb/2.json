Hopefully my advice can help you do better","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-01T20:34:01.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sensei Le,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=U1AEF7il,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-01T12:51:29.878+0000)\n>\n> If you start losing 2 game +  stop playing rank do something else beside league flashing your mind up and come back start flash again. listen to music while you play rank is not a bad idea help you focus and every game after take 5 mins break think what did you do wrong or what can you do better and that game.

Also if you're hungry or thirsty or otherwise discomforted by something outside the game, fix that first.
