I decided to jump into a solo game (wasn&#039;t entirely sure what to play/stream) and was pushed into jungle role. I originally called support but ended up giving it to the duo squad that was insistent on being bot together. I had told the team I wasn&#039;t comfortable with jungle and hadn&#039;t update my runes (fifteen seconds left, yolo, random runes). \r\n\r\n**And thus... that s**t talk had begun. **\r\nI wasn&#039;t doing well, I knew that. It added salt to the wound. \r\nAs petty as it sounds, I wish we had lost that game... \r\n\r\nI mainly wanted to post this to vent my frustrations but if you have any recommendations I&#039;d highly appreciate it or if you have a similar scenario I&#039;d love to hear it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-04-20T08:23:19.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stop playing, it really never gets better.\n\nAs much as riot want's to say they do shit, it always seems to be the guy who is frustrated that is the one banned, not the one being a %%%% all the time.\n\nIf that is true or not, as someone who has played plenty for years, that shouldn't be my perception and yet it is.","replies":[{"poster":"Stephanie","date":"2018-04-20T12:05:56.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be avoiding solo for a while now, especially after that experience. \n\nThank you for your honesty :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2018-04-22T09:02:48.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stop playing if you can't handle it.
