Played 1 game with 5 then the next 4 placements with 4 of the same people and 1 other during those 4 games. \n\nSo far sent out 5 invites not including team maker and we are unable to invite another person to play. Only ever had a total of 6 people in our team. Now two of those people are unavaliable to play for a while and we cant invite someone else to fill the spot. Theres 9 spots on our roster and we only have filled 6 of those AND on the information pages about inviting people to teams it says you can invite 3 people after placements and we have invited ZERO after placements and it still wont let us.\n\nFrom everything I have read I feel like we should be able to invite more people to our team as we have barely anyone in our roster and cant continue playing if we dont have more invited to fill our roster out. \n\nUsername: Jackzoid\n\nTeam name: The Zoidz\n\nNumber in roster: 6\n\nInvites avaliable: ZERO\n\nDays till next invite: 5\n\nDo we really need to wait almost a week before we can play becuase some random technicallity about invite numbers being screwed up in a loophole with finishing placements?\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-18T11:27:20.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very unfortunate that it's happened, and by the time you get a support ticket about this answered, it will have probably been five days anyway. Maybe it would be worth to invite the two others with the time penalty?\n\nBut yeah, we can't really do anything about this from the Help & Support board. Best course of action is to submit a support ticket.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
