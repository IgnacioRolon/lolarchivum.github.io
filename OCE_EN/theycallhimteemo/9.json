It sounds op at first but when you look at the other runes it really isn't that bad. If it was like 4-6 ad per stack for melee and 3-5 per stack for ranged it doesn't sound too overpowered. Plus champions like jax and tryndamere would benefit perfectly from it.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-11-29T10:16:19.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i agree{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheyCallHimTeemo","date":"2017-11-29T22:11:55.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly what i think.

You Q then W then E then R and then they die.\nWhen I started to play this game back in S1.. It was about doing damage over time and waiting for R. Now it is just as I said. You Q W E R and your done.\n\nPTA is just that in a rune. So whats it matter.. Everything in this game is about one shotting people now","replies":[]}]}]}]}
