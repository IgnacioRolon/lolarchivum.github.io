Is there any reason for updating randomly?  Take Ardent for an example.  Insanely op item that even the pros want to be nerfed.  What does Riot do? leaves it alone for 2 patches forcing us to wait at minimum 6 weeks of autistic meta.  What happens if Riot doesn&#039;t change it in the next patch?  That&#039;s another 2 weeks we have to wait.  Don&#039;t get me started on the fact that you even THOUGHT if buffing ardent.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-23T12:21:52.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updating randomly would create a lot of confusion.\n\nFirstly, you could log on one day, play a champ or an item, log on the next day and play a different champ/item with the same name, and have no idea whats going on. _(and how would you even tell people about the changes? it's not like you could have patch notes when youre just throwing things in at random times.)_\n\nSecondly, players _(particularly higher elo)_ need a stable environment to play effectively, it's better to have a stable but too strong or too weak environment than it is to have a completely unpredictable and random one _(any sailor will tell you that they'd prefer a wind that was strong but consistent to a wind that was gusty.)_\n\nAnnouncing changes a week or two in advance gives people time to adjust themeless to upcoming changes, it gives them time to start relying on different items or stats so they aren't in for a shock when the changes hit live.\n\nAnd riot does do small balance changes mid-patch, but they are rare and are usually only to fix major issues that arise with new content such as champs that are too strong on release. However they can't do this too often or it could throw players off so they only resort to this when absolutely necessary.","replies":[]}]}
