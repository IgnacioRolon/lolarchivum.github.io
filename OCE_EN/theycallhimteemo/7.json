This is why tanks are insanely broken right now.  They can afford to build full tank so they take no damage, but every time they attack you they deal 8% of your health.  What can you do against that. You cant kite them because every tank now applies a slow, some kind of cc ability or a gap closer. They out damage you and out tank you.  This is purely the reason why League isn&#039;t fun anymore because there&#039;s no balancing with % health damage.  Why cant ADC&#039;s have % health damage? They&#039;re supposed to do damage.  There&#039;s only 1 % health item that ADC&#039;s can get and that&#039;s BORK.  That&#039;s why ADC&#039;s cant 1 v 1 them.  And removing % health damage on tanks wont make them useless, just add high cc and peel onto them, _**like a tank should have**_, forcing the enemies to focus them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-06T10:16:27.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, tanks should have damage that scales in such a way, _instead_ of normal base and ad/ap scaling damage.\n\nfor 2 reasons:\n\n1. % HP scalings mean that they do do a chunk of damage, however, it also means that they can't do MORE than that amount of damage. Which means you don't have tanks like Renekton, Volibear, and Garen who genuinely out-burst most non tanks.\n\n2. Tanks having % HP damage doesn't actually affect anything except tank vs tanks. as % HP damage is virtually useless against squishy champs. Pretend you have a 25% HP damage ability, you would 4-hit tanks and that would be op as fuck! but you would also 4 hit ADC's, but seeming ADC's already get 2-hit by other champs, being 4-hit isn't a problem at all. It's when ADC's and other damage champs have % HP damage _(Vayne)_ that they become problems, because they make tanks pointless.\n\nA tank with %HP damage, doesn't to anything to ADC's. But an ADC with %HP damage absolutely shreds tanks, and seeming ADC's are supposed to die quickly and Tanks aren't. It is more balanced for tanks to have %HP scalings than ADC's.","replies":[{"poster":"Princess Dubz","date":"2017-08-15T08:30:24.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not fun playing adc into chogath \nor adc into darkin kayn\nor adc into kled\netc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-06T10:40:15.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he's complaining about health items giving damage, Deadmans, Titanic, Sunfire, and Cho'gath ult (stoneplate interaction is stupid).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-06T07:47:56.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adcs aren't supposed to 1v1 tanks. You're supposed to provide dps from the backline. In a traditional teamfight scenario, the tanks clash at the front and keep the bruisers from getting past, whilst mages and adcs provide the dps from safety behind the tanks, shredding bruisers, and eventually wearing down tanks.\n\nThe general rule of 1v1 potential is:\nFighters>Bruisers>Assassins>Mages>Tanks>ADCs>Utility>Healers\nNotice that ADCs are not the top of this chain. This chain is a general truth, that is universal among mobas, mmos, rpgs, and most games with a class based system. \nThere are exceptions, where sometimes a bruiser might counter a fighter, or a mage counter an assassin, but this is the general foodchain for people who decide to play solo in a multiplayer game.\nNow that's not to say Adcs are bad, or healers are useless, they are in fact some of the most influential players in teamfights in mobas, boss raids in mmos, and party members in rpgs.\n\nSo to you, I say, stop trying to get up close and personal with a darius or nautilus and go for a 1v1 and expect to win, as say ashe.\n\nTanks build defensive to survive you, since you'll probably be pouring out the pain whilst they're jostling with your team's tanks, and they need to threaten kill pressure since for the most part they'll be held off by other tanks, and if tanks can't do a measurable amount of damage, then there usually isn't enough reason to peel against them in metas where tanks have high durability and divers/assassins are scarce, and games stall out for too long, and you end up in an only bruiser/fighter meta which is very generic and doesn't have any strategic depth.\n\nAll that said, the damage reduction not applying for cho'gath's ult + stoneskin is stupid. Tanks aren't supposed to have 1800 true damage burst. Tanks are supposed to do mild damage over time and provide peel and a frontline, which creates pressure to force enemies to peel and hold them in a frontline. Tanks doing decent damage over time and wearing their opponents down is how it's supposed to work, having high 100-0 burst signals that something is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-06T10:18:23.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Fighters>Bruisers>Assassins>Mages>Tanks>ADCs>Utility>Healers\n\nYou make it sound like you've never seen a Zed 100-0 a Nasus..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-06T07:10:12.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When cho gath deals true damage for building health {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
