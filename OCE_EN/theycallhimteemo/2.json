I didn&#039;t think sheen was supposed to give tanks 100 - 200 bonus ad after every ability. What&#039;s that? Conqueror gives them another 20 bonus ad and converts 20% of damage dealt to true damage? So my 250 armour Garen with bramble vest and 12% damage reduction from all basic attacks, as well as a 15% attack speed slow and a 30% damage reduction doesn&#039;t mean anything? My bad guys, sorry for believing this misinformation.","replies":[]}
