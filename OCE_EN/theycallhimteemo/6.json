Is there any particular reason for this?  Iv&#039;e seen countless of old 2013 posts on this, saying that the current bots aren&#039;t programmed for that map.  If this is so, then how come a while ago, 7.2 i believe, you could add bots into howling abyss for a short time?  I had so much fun being able to 1v5 with all the bots mid, and so did many other people, (for example https://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/nVkaMBEE-howling-abyss-custom-and-bots ).  If anyone could explain it will be VERY much appreciated, and will we see this in the future maybe? \r\n\r\nJust a quick question,\r\nThank you for your time\r\n(P.S. Sorry if this is the wrong board)","replies":[]}
