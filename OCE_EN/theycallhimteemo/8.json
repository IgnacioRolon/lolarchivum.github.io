Like being able to make it dark and rainy, or maybe foggy.  Would be a nice atmospheric alteration.  I really like it when Doom Bots came around again because the Rift looked a lot darker and it felt nicer.  I&#039;d imagine this would be extremely hard to do and kinda pointless.\r\n\r\n-Ya boy,\r\n       the casual unranked player.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-27T10:09:32.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I reckon you could make a pretty decent featured mode out of this concept. Have each type of weather give specific buffs/debuffs (for example, Fog could reduce vision distance, could include thunderstorms that give a random chance of causing minor damage etc), and have it randomly cycle through the types of weather.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omega","date":"2017-09-27T09:20:15.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be good if it was a normal part of the game (random weather), it'd presumably lower potential FPS to have those kind of effects but it would certainly be nice and maybe even add some potential for affecting the game.","replies":[]}]}
