Please be aware that this is a problem with *your* client, not with the client itself.\n\nPERMISSIONS: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204134104-Setting-up-your-Permissions\nHaving the wrong permissions can cause the install to be unstable and end up all dodgy, making things break or only half workm, this would be my best guess as to your problem.\n\nPERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH LCU:\nEnable “Low Spec Mode” and “Close Client During Game”. This will remove the LCU’s influence on in game performance. If problems persist then they can be investigated further.\nIn game issues are not caused by the LCU once the above steps are done as the LCU does not have any impact on in game files since the splash client and game client are seperate, and the game client has not changed. The only impact is negated by turning on “Close Client In Game”. If the problem persists then it lies elsewhere.\n\nFPS: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting\n\nCONNECTION: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\nI don't think connection is your problem, but anythings possible so I'll drop it here too, but I'd recommend leaving it till last.\n\nTICKET SUPPORT: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\nIf all else fails, Player Support can help you more than I can, since they know all the ins and outs. But try the Permissions fixes at least first.","replies":[{"poster":"TheyCallHimTeemo","date":"2017-05-12T22:57:25.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, this helps a lot!
