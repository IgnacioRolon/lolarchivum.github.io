I have attached a picture illustrating the small issue. The issue is that the club chat gets spammed with people logging in and out, instead of being able to see a dialogue of actual chat.\r\n\r\nA solution could be as simple as an added option to disable seeing login/logout messages in the club chat.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my suggestion,\r\nAnthropic","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-23T03:53:38.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing would be extend the cap on clubs you can be in, 3 is kinda low honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"The TeemoNator","date":"2016-04-23T05:08:52.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=NjEElsTI,discussion-id=ahV0mTf9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-04-23T03:53:38.205+0000)\n>\n> Another thing would be extend the cap on clubs you can be in, 3 is kinda low honestly.\n\nYou club whore\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"King J","date":"2016-04-23T04:07:22.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so we're clear - by high elo I mean Gold 1 currently, was Gold last season and Plat season 4.\n\nCheers\nJ!","replies":[]}]}
