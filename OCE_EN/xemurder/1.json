No-one like running into the same bullshit champion five games in a row.\r\n\r\nThe main reason the people I know who stopped playing after URF isn&#039;t because they aren&#039;t enjoying the game mode, or were worn out by it, it&#039;s because they finally got fed up with the complete ignorance expressed by the development team, who only listen to a few people bitching, and ignore the majority. Ask *all* your damn players, make a survey popup, we all know you can do it.\r\nPersonally, if ARAM didn&#039;t exist, I wouldn&#039;t play this damn game at all. It&#039;s just not fun anymore to slog through a 40-50 minute Rift game to come out with nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd above all, if you don&#039;t change from ARURF, at least make the damn thing properly random.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-22T12:59:11.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I had a better idea. \n\nA URF is A-OK BUT here's the issue. \n\nYou vs the same **** people again and again and again or get the same **** people again and again. So how about, everytime URF gets enabled, it randomizes the whole champion order.\n\n\nNow here's the catch, you only get the champion once and then you won't ever get him again. Given you played every single champ in existence, it re-rolls again.\n\n\nWith this approach, we can ensure people play the same champion only once. Now I know it might be too little, it could be tweaked. But as it stands, getting the same champs again is really god damn annoying...\n\nThe problem normal urf has: People pick the same person every time. You vs different people everytime so therefore, in theory, you will still vs the same champs over and over cause you are being put with different players. I don't think limiting it to 10 will affect much tbh. But then again, I don't think my method would do some good either, who knows...","replies":[{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2018-06-23T06:04:55.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking about the people who can't play many champions (the 10 is arbitrary, it could be more, 15-20 would be fine), they would suffer most in a system where you couldn't play the same one more than once before cycling through them all again. I mean, there's 141 champions, and I doubt many people would play that many games during the event, even if it went over several weeks. The only reason ARAM works for those people is it isn't actually random, it has specific biases which are supposedly based on what players use (although I've seen little evidence to support that), and it holds the free rotation champions at a higher weight (I have had it gave me Fiddle five damn games in a row, and other times where there was an Illaoi in the game 5/7 games).\n\nThe main thing I want is to get rid of is Riot's bullshit \"random\" mechanic, which just picks from the same 30-40 champions.\n\nIt is the hated most aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-26T23:15:22.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I hate it. In Aram, I get unfair matchups all the time. Aurf is even more important because certain champs have the power to abuse their abilities like there is no tomorrow, in comparison to others.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
