If so please report them here so we can have Riot reinstate the removed animations, or have them comment on why they are removed and why we are no longer told about such changes.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T22:44:07.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol\n\nmuch serious business\n\nvery prof rito","replies":[]}]}
