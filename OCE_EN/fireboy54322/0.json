Sure the rune pages cost a shit-ton and you only got two at the beginning, plus you had to buy each individual rune that you wanted with ip that took a lot of time to gain, but I was okay with that.\r\n\r\nMainly because of the Mastery page.\r\n\r\nWith the old mastery pages, I was able to create up to 20 different pages for 20 different champions/group of champions, which was useful as I would be able to create pages for the mains I would use in ranked for each of the different roles (Top, Bot, Jg, etc.) or just for the group of champs I used most often. This was beautiful for me as each of my favorite champs had a mastery page specifically for them.\r\n\r\nThen the new runes came out.\r\n\r\nNow don&#039;t get me wrong. I love the new rune pages, as there are now 116640 different combinations pf runes you can make. You can design each page to suit a specific champion and/or its playstyle. You have 15 different keystones you can choose from, as well as 45 sub runes to help build up your playstyle and what stats you need a champion. I love the new system, but there is one problem that puts a wrench in the plans of the new runes.\r\n\r\nYou only get 2 rune pages, and the other 18 you have to buy at 6300 BE each. \r\nNow for most people like me, who don&#039;t stream LOL and thus don&#039;t have an excuse to play league every day, this puts a hamper on gameplay, as it means that we have to constantly grind in order to obtain the very little 70-100 BE that you get each game, not counting the first-win BE bonuses that we get one a day as well as the fact that on average, each game takes 35-45 minutes to play each game. It takes away time from unlocking the new champs that you would like to play, in favor of getting a simple rune page that you would use to customise a champ that you have already gotten, especially since these pages cost the same amount as a new champion. With all the new runes that we have got and the removal of the mastery pages, in which we could hold up to 20 pages, we want to make sure that the champs that we play the most have the right runes necessary to carry and win the game, especially for people that play ranked, but the fact that we have to pay for the rune pages creates a gap between new players and old ones regardless of the skill, the latter of which have played for so long that they have these huge stockpiles of BE. It essentially means that it puts new players at a disadvantage, either forcing them to constantly grind for BE or use RP to buy the pages, which has created minor case of grind-to-win/pay-to-win, which hampers gameplay as new players (Especially to ranked) are unable to set up their mains due to the lack of rune pages for at least 5 mains, one for each role. It results in players not having the specific runes for each \r\n\r\nWhich I why I am asking, to the person in charge of the new runes, to please give us our 20 rune pages back, similar to old masteries.\r\nI would like to be able to set up the pages necessary for each of the mains/back-up-mains-in-case-of-ban/pocket-picks so that I don&#039;t get screwd by people who have brought all the pages and thus have champions that all the right runes to boost their desired playstyles. Sure it might make BE a bit more worthless, but for new players, it would lift a burden off of them as they wouldn&#039;t have to prepare for playing the game before being able to _acually play the game_. Also, we already have to grind for the new champions already, and the season 1 players won&#039;t be affected due to their already large amounts of BE, so it wouldn&#039;t affect the game that much for veterans.\r\n\r\nPlease hear me out and please make the new rune pages free. The change would help out a lot of people.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-11-15T06:32:54.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there is a need to make rune pages free, although it would be much better to earn blue essence more easier.\nI do wish that Riot have a 'Buy two rune pages at the price of one' offer at some stage every year, so that it makes things a bit easier.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-15T07:04:02.213+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if they do that, they don't get as much money.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-15T13:42:41.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In your logic no business should ever offer price cuts then.
