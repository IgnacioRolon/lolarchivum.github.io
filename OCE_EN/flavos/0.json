When you try to log in or when you try to start a game?\n\nIf all your drivers, directx etc are up to date, One thing you could try is [repairing the game client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) - there are a few other potentially useful suggestions on that page.\n\nIf you're still having problems I'd definitely send a request to player support (via the \"Support\" link at the top of the page), as they'll be able to help you get to the bottom of the issue.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
