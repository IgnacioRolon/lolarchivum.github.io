There are so many \"combo's that work really well\"  why not try it?   Break the \"expected system\".   As throwing your opposition off will definitely contribute to a win.....or is Sun Tzu no longer relevant??\n\nI even researched a few links where players \"Break the Norm\" and \"Break the oppositions back\"........ seriously, play to WIN...not to a META!!!
