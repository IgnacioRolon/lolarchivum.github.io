I Main support ( any coincidence with my job? :) )\r\n\r\nWhen im finished with my 12 or 24 hour shift, I start a soloQ match, to have a little bit of fun. And often I find out after 10, or 20 mins of gaming that my playmates do not share my behaviour with the gameplay. The toxic community (camping afk botlane, typing Ez after a 4v5 game, blaming others even if there is no reason to, buying troll items, or even not trying hard in ranked and so on.) is literally driving me crazy. \r\nI DONT WANT TO start the game with /mute all. I want to express my joy when my jungler comes rigth in time, when the toplaner pings in time when his/her laner teleports to bot etc. When I get a good compliment I find out that why i keep playing this game, and I want others to feel it too. I apriciate that, when after a good game my adc thanks my help, and ofter honours my work. But i literally can&#039;t stand the tiniest flame, toxiciy, negative behaviour. I Dont think punishing somebody will help in the future, not even banning.\r\n\r\nI Would like to play an exclusive soloQ with optimistic, tryharder, good mentality summoners. Even if I would have to wait 5-6 minutes to start a game.\r\n\r\nI considered a lot of times to stop playing only becouse of the community. I Think the support role contains more the warding, pinging, zoning etc, I believe that we need to improve our teammates mood, and with that improve our chance to win. But no matter what I do, i can&#039;t break through a tilted players imaginary barrier covered with anger.\r\n\r\nI accept that every player has bad days, bad hours, bad plays, when im over 2 beers, when im not in my maximum skill to play (Tired, angry, etc) i dont play ranked. I would like to see the same from my fellow playmates.\r\n\r\nSorry for long post, for my english, and there is no potato.","replies":[{"poster":"SollyTuatara","date":"2017-04-07T11:03:55.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like can feel for you. Also a support main and every promo i have at lease one person is sitting either feeding their ass off because they don't know how to play the most basic champion or trolling.\n\nOne game about 2 mins into a game my mid goes afk for 5 mins because they feel like noodles then comes back to lane and feeds ","replies":[]}]}
