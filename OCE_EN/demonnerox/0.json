I want to say this:\r\n\r\n\r\n What a terriable reworked champion that is. His&#039;s mana is not that much, Mana cost is a significait, CD is too long, Damage is too little, skill shots too much.And brainworks is just all the time. And most two important features that i dislike and want to point out. Is that the E and W has way too long lag that it should be. Imagine you on a battle field. No one gives you a second to let the E lands on him and Then you just can&#039;t rememeber to put the W on insteand you just want to Q him because it does more damage. And since you had him Rooted and gains a soul frangment. Then is time to relase ultimon. Then in combat . There is not much usage of skill shot W! And what is more that R require soul fragment to active. So imagine you are level 6 and enemey are coming for you. You just go like. Oh hang on let me put a rather slow~~~~~~~~~~ E~~~~~~~and W~~~~~~~first~~~~~ then we go R shall we~? That is so idlotic. The battlefield changes every second. you can just have long lag and then release a super long R that requires time to release the much more powerful blast wave! What happen you meets yasuo or other speedy champï¼Ÿ\r\n\r\nAnd the Q. my god the worst. I calcaulated. is like 10 Q can get your mana out at lvl 6. even tho it says can restore mana. but is it possible you just realease Q all the time rather WER? BS. and does it gain soul fragment? no. does it heal you? no. Ok! then it must has big damage! yeah sort of. but it has to be relatively close and by compare this damage to Veigar&#039;s Q. which it has a long range high blast damage plus hits people twice. This is really a terriable skill shot. \r\n\r\nThe UI Design is really GOOD! I give you that.It looks really cool and stunning. but is that why you designer think: Ugh, for a champ that looks that cool we must give him some sort of decent arrgont gentleman like skill. So it fits the character. omg. The battle field changes every second. No body gives the one second to make that decent arrgont statment and gesture. You just hit the face with your fist all time. I don&#039;t know who come out with this idea to give swain 3 skills shots and 2 of them has really long lag. But it is the worst idea that fits the function follows form rather than the reverse style that a gerneral style champion actucally is.BS. Oh wait after this much long context i finally can release my Second R wave. how rejoyceful.\r\n\r\nIn the old time the old swain can still gets some kills and gets the beat up. But now the new swain is compeletely depend on teammate. If a teammates does not jump out to help you to CC your enemey and you miss your E. Then you can not catch the enemey by anyhow. And getting kill is much harder because its current skill and damage.\r\n\r\nIn essens. This is a champion that riot design for the designer, not for the player.\r\n\r\nWaiting to get my account banned.\r\n\r\n\r\nGG fk off.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-07T02:42:23.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol you like the model which is what the community hates and you hate the rework which the community likes hahahaha","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-07T04:43:47.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SwainMains/comments/7sxo23/in_response_to_reav3rant/dtao88t/\n\n>What we have found with all VGUs is that the reddit/baords comments don't always represent the majority though sometimes they do, and when they do we usually discuss making changes.\n\n>Believe it or not every single VGU since Sion has had the majority of mains like the rework. Galio, for example, many players will say that many Galio mains hated his visuals and we changed Galio way too much, yet Galio was one of the highest rated in theme/visuals from mains compared to almost any VGU we have ever done (Evelynn I think was tied with him.) In fact, the most controversial VGU we have ever done was Evelynn, in regards to her gameplay specifically, where about 70% of mains loved it and 30% disliked it, and that was one of the highest dislike ratios we have ever had.\n\n>Anyways that wasn't really about Swain as he hasn't hit live yet so that we can start gathering feedback from players across all our regions. If we do find that the sentiment of Swains Visuals is felt by a majority of our players we will of course discuss as a team what makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-07T08:17:32.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol what?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-07T10:28:22.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just thought it gives a bit of insight on what people think of reworks, since you were saying the community hates the model and such.
