Especially not for a distance changing particle like Zoe's E.\nThe closest thing is what JasonWazza has described.\n\nBut really the best way is just to play that champ a lot, and you get very very very good at instinctively knowing just how far your ability will go.\nI have pretty much all my usually champs' ranges instinctively stored in my mind because I've played them so much, so I know with like 98% accuracy wether my ability will reach that far or not without even having to think.\n\nEven in the short time Zoe has been out, I've started to memorise her ranges quite well, even the changing ones.\nIt doesn't take as long as you think.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-26T22:35:41.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch Bjerg Zoe he sometimes shows cast range for E because it is sketchy through some walls which is why I want it","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-29T04:35:00.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you'll find he has exactly what i'm telling you, it just only shows up when you hold the button.\n\nEither that or he turns it off autocast.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-29T05:01:03.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn’t turn it off and he doesn’t have what you’re saying.... for the record I figured out how to do it in hotkeys spell cast 3 change seeing range indicator to shift e so now if I shift e it shows range .... thanks for trying to help anyway","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-26T07:13:55.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres an option in the casting menu to show a range bar when your smart casting (which will basically give you a range indicator for all abilitys, and then cast as you let go of the button.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-26T07:51:16.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you see I don’t want that because when you use abilities with that the white circle flashes for a short time","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-26T09:02:26.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean that's the only option for this case so *shrug*","replies":[]}]}]}]}
