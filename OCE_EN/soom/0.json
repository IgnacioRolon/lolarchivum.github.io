Pretty crappy that we only hear from a Rioter after 5 hours of not being able to play. Maybe that’s just me being pissy though. I had trouble with my internet provider yesterday and finally got it fixed today. I was excited to continue using the K/DA Akali skin I bought when this crap happens.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-09T10:01:24.114+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about that.
