Personally I don't think Zoe was ever as strong as everyone makes out to be, I never seemed to have a problem with her.\nHowever if lots of people are having problems, then something must clearly have been wrong, regardless. \n_(And some of those changes were just common sense.)_\n\nShe is not an easy champ to play, and the one thing that carried bad players was her easy insane damage. With that gone, people now need to actually try, and low and behold, putting effort in is harder than they thought.\n\nTBH win rates are only relevant to people who are new to that champ anyway. Experienced players should almost always have above 50% on their champions, regardless of how hard they are buffed/nerfed, _(I had 70% win rate on Aurelion Sol, in a mobile assassin meta.... case closed)_.\n\nWin rates pretty much just show how easy it is for new players to do well or not with that champ. Which is why more difficult champs like Azir have consistently lower win rates, not because they are weak, but because players who are new to them struggle.\n\nA good Zoe player will still be 50%+, it's just everyone else who played her for spammy high damage, that will be feeling these nerfs.\n\nI am very pleased with her new changes.\nPeople should have to put effort in to do well, and the changes reflect that. If you hit your combo correctly, you will still 1-hit people, if you fail it, then you can't and the enemy will probably punish you for it, thats how it should be.\n\n__________\n\nThe only change I don't agree with is constantly taking W spells away from minion drops.\nLike whats the point of minions dropping random spells at all, if you can't even get the good strategic ones like TP?\nI can see why they did it _(and I personally abused the hell out of getting teleport)_, but once you start taking them away, it hardly becomes random anymore, and just becomes: _\"Here, have some toys to play with, with no sharp edges or small pieces to swallow, in your little inflatable baby pen.\"_","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-02-24T05:32:44.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly all they needed to do to her was allow people to remove drowsy, that was the only issue she really had","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-23T23:05:54.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I personally think Zoe is overnerfed and wouldn’t be surprised if we see some buffs on PBE next few days .... the difference between the worst mid laner and second worst mid laner is 5% with Syndra being 47% winrate... and I just think it is unhealthy for a champ to drop 8% overnight... and it’s no just new Zoe players. ITS ALL OF THEM. Experienced and not. I talked to Zoeincidence (first Zoe player to hit 1 million mastery) and you can see she is really struggling in her games too.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-02-23T23:48:54.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone struggles the day after nerfs come in, because they've been used to playing her the other way for so long.\nthe next few weeks will seperate the good Zoe players, the ones who reliably land their skills and combos, from those who just play her _\"cos she dose DMAGE!\"_. \n\nWhen Azir was in the pits, most Azir mains had big win rates on him still, despite his offical win rate being low 40s, if you practice a champ enough, you'll be good regardless.\n\n________\n\nAlso your definition of 'worst' might need some redefining. Win rates are only one aspect of a champion, and there are so many contributing factors, that a winrate is not an accurate depiction of how strong a champion is.\n\nTake Janna for example, her winrate is almost 5% higher than Zed's.\nWho do you hear more people complaining about? \nSpoiler, it isn't Janna.\n\nJanna has a lot in her kit to help win the game, so her win rate soars. But as a stand alone champ, Janna is sub-par, as opposed to supports like Blitz or Leona, who are terrifying in their own right, but don't have little things like shielding towers, or team-wide move speed buffs, that help win games. It doesn't mean Janna is more powerful than Blitz, her kit just impacts the game in a different way, one that is less frustrating to fight, but more impactful in the long run.\n\nKindred is a useless Jungler, but if the game gets long enough, she becomes a late game monster because she isn't a jungler she's a  hypercarry ADC, and wins the game regardless of how much she was shat on in early and mid, jus because at full build she has so much damage. Meanwhile, Lee Sin is probably the best equipped jungler in the game, but if the game stretches out, he loses some of his impact late game.\n\nIs Janna more of a problem than Zed? No.\nIs Kindred a better jungler than Lee? No.\nYet their win rates are way higher.\n\nThats just a small example of one way that win rates aren't an accurate portrayal of a champion's strength.\n\nLook At Zilean's win rate, it's the highest in the game, when have you ever herd anyone moaning about a Zilean being too strong?\nBut you hear lots of people complain that Ornn is too strong, yet his win rate is a good 8% lower than Zilean's.\n\nThere is far more to a champ's strength than how often they win games.\n\nMore often than not, it is how frustrating a champion is to play against.\nYasuo's win rate is pretty balanced. But the vast majority of people absolutely despite that champion! and would rather play against Anivia _(who on paper has a much higher win rate)_. \n\nSo who is more powerful? Yasuo or Anivia?\n\nZoe is a frustrating champ to play against if you cant predict skill shots, so regardless of how strong she was, she receives a lot of hate.\nAlso Riot stated that these nerfs were probably too harsh and she would likely be buffed later. Thats not in dispute:\n\n> That's a lot of nerfs, and while Zoe is frustrating to play against, her win rate numbers aren't reassuring. We're bumping up her base health and passive scaling so she still has power, just less of the the \"one-shot you with naked Q\" levels she was sometimes reaching. This isn't an even swap: we expect Zoe to land on the weak side when 8.4 hits. But we'd rather hit as many frustration points as we can in one go and address power later, rather than continuing to draw the process out.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-24T05:26:10.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alg she getting buffs","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-23T22:55:25.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's like old Azir, does alot of unfair things, is still decent in high level play for the few players than can pilot her well, is overall too hard to play reliably when she isn't op.

She just had that much damage.","replies":[]}]}
