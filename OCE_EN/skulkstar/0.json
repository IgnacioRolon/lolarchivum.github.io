I played a few days ago and it was fine, now I can&#039;t even update let alone log in. \r\n\r\nMy computer is a Mac using OS X Yosemite version 10.10.3 if that matters. \r\nPlease help if you can!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-27T11:55:57.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#section-mac) and try everything there.

If so, try uninstalling it and repatch League. This includes anti-virus software and firewalls (if you uninstall a paid software, make sure you have a way to reinstall without buying again first!)\n\nIf you have anything such as a VPN or proxy in your network setup, try patching without those. If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you probably shouldn't worry (unless you aren't the person who setup your internet connection).\n\nOf course, make sure everything is updated and maintained.\n\nGet back to me soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
