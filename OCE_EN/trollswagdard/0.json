What happened to chat restriction?","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"TrollSwagDard: you are so fucking dead ezreal\r\nTrollSwagDard: i swear to god\r\nTrollSwagDard: cheesed me level 1 last game\r\nTrollSwagDard: ?\r\nTrollSwagDard: how\r\nTrollSwagDard: im you, but a bit better\r\nTrollSwagDard: *sips V*\r\nTrollSwagDard: SORRY\r\nTrollSwagDard: ez\r\nTrollSwagDard: i have more farm\r\nTrollSwagDard: ur bad xD\r\nTrollSwagDard: why\r\nTrollSwagDard: because you dont know how to play safe\r\nTrollSwagDard: or ask for a gank\r\nTrollSwagDard: wait\r\nTrollSwagDard: i just bmed lol\r\nTrollSwagDard: shut up %%%got\r\nTrollSwagDard: %%%got\r\nTrollSwagDard: getting a teemo to camp me doesnt make you better poofta\r\n\r\nThis is what i was reported for. It&#039;s not the worst but its decent enough to get reported. But the game before this me and the same guy who reported me where taking shots at each other without harm. He even flamed me and i didn&#039;t report back because i thought we were just on good terms having fun.\r\nIs this really 14 days ban worthy? Do they even read both chats or just the person getting reported?\r\n\r\nI also feel as if chat restriction works better than this. You can still play, still communicate, while trying to contain on your flame (in this case not flame just having fun but he reported idk why when it went on for 2 games) IS there no more 3 strikes rule, just straight to 14 days suspension. And what about the trolls i report. I never get the pop up message saying that they&#039;ve been banned anymore. I see more people getting banned for fake flaming instead of trolling. He knew we were just taking shots so I don&#039;t see why he reported me. Clearly I can&#039;t prove this but if you read his chat logs we were saying XD and ez, question marking each time we killed each other, just for fun. I don&#039;t think this 14 day suspension is worth. even if their is foul language, it was just for fun and he was well aware.\r\n\r\nEach part of the flame I can explain, So the first part was an AD on tv which is clearly a joke. The guy says hes better then sips an energy drink. The next part I clearly said &quot;I just bmed lol&quot; stating it was a joke and the team knew that, it wasn&#039;t even in all chat, just to my team. And the last part the guy kept saying he was gay and said say that one more time as if he was egging me on to say it so I wen&#039;t along with it thinking it was a joke. Then finally he said he was way better than me and I said etc etc while he flamed spamming ez.","replies":[{"poster":"Requinox","date":"2017-11-10T23:48:25.658+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"Few tips for you to follow:\n\n1. Don't post your chat logs here, it just puts you in an embarrassing situation.\n\n2. Mute players you think are being abusive towards you. Mute them.\n\n3. Never ever flame your teammate or enemy team. Compliment them instead, be nice.\n\n4.
