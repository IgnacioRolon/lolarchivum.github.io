I am low ELO and these changes don&#039;t make much sense to me. \r\nI can understand that they are meant to empower her ultimate greatly, however they only seem to nerf her laning phase and remove her power spike at level 9. \r\nRiot spoke about &quot;Making her abilities evolve&quot; and then did nothing of the sort. \r\nThey kept with the passive that doesn&#039;t come into play until at least level 9. \r\nWhy speak about &quot;Evolving abilities&quot; when they aren&#039;t that of any sort. \r\nWhere is the context on the change?","replies":[{"poster":"Pararnore","date":"2016-05-04T21:10:50.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How is it a nerf whatsoever? She has the same E effect on her passive once its rank 5, YOU CAN HAVE LIKE 8 SPHERES OUT WITH EASE, her Q ratio is up, E cooldown is lowered... there's nothing but buffs. OH, and she can grab 3 spheres at once. Balance.
