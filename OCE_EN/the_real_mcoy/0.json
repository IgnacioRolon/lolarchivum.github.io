Also I've been taking devourers mainly as I dont feel warrior is good on her as armour pen overall inst a great stat for her as by the end if a game half my damage is still magic, while at attack speed buff from e synergises well with the devourer. If i wasnt comfortable taking devourer I would just take juggernaut. But to the point with these items as my core almost every game should I be building a gunblade. it seems like a decent item just not sure its the best","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-21T12:45:35.065+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:3085}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3271}} {{item:3719}} {{item:3504}}  {{item:3050}}  this is my usual build path","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-21T13:03:51.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wumachine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=pLwuN3XH,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-21T12:45:35.065+0000)\n>\n> {{item:3085}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3271}} {{item:3719}} {{item:3504}}  {{item:3050}}  this is my usual build path\n\nDude, Mobi Boots on Jungle Evelynn?

I played Evelynn once and fed super hard. Unlike a Bronze 6 scrub like you, I know how to play Evelynn. You need the gold you spend on upgrading your boots to get through your jungle item, so that you may rush the Ardent Censor for the attack speed you get from ulting, which equates to 0%. wtf Ardent Censor is glitched! It clearly says \"Unique Passive: Your heals and shields on another unit grant them 25% attack speed for 6 seconds. This does not include regeneration effects or effects on yourself.\", so why don't I get the attack speed bonus from shielding myself?","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-21T13:19:26.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"DONT TELL MI WOT 2 DO MUM IM 12 NOW IM A GROWN UP, Y DOSNT RUNAANS WORK IN EVE HER ULT IS LIKE 7 BILLION RANGE OMFG REPORT RIOT GLITCHED GAAAAAAAAAEEEEM WOW FEEDERS KEEPING ME IN ELO HELL I DESERBE 2 BE DIAMOND KOZ I BEAT ONE!!!!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Respect Women","date":"2015-01-21T15:59:41.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"youre trying so hard to be funny and its just not working out","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-21T21:59:14.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zzrot is OP....but the rest is really odd...\n\nwhy put a blatantly OP item into a set of troll items? for a moment i thought it was a legit build and was going to ask how ardent works on eve if self shields dont proc the passive...lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-21T23:22:03.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in what world did you think runaans wasn't a troll pick for eve XD","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-22T00:33:22.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it didnt load for me at first, thats why when i went to comment i realized...","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-21T23:04:05.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gunblade stopped being useful on Eve 2 seasons ago.\n\nWasn't going burn build {{item:3151}} + {{item:3068}} the meta anyway?","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-21T22:01:27.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3060}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3512}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3265}} \n\ndont need jungle item, just get the smite upgrade. if any, get the AP one until you have other CDR items.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-21T12:56:59.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually you can build Gunblade or Bork, not both.
