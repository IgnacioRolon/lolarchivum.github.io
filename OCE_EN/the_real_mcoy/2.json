Also I had a suggestion ...\r\nSo I was thinking that one solution would be to replace his e with some kind of pull. Obviously this wouldn't be an exact ripoff of a blitz pull, and would also have to be a skill shot,  One way of changing this would be to allow you to cast the w on an enemy (dont much care what if that has an effect, possibly a dot), but change e to be a skill shot with slightly increased range, and if it hits a target already hit with w then the target is dragged (slowly) towards morde.\r\nI think that this idea would work from both a game play point of view as well as a thematic viewpoint. From a game play point of veiw it would potentially feel much better as I feel currently Mordes kit isn't particularly coherent, and you end up using e tons to poke, w a little bit on the off chance that they try to trade (sometimes to farm), and q rarely, as most people either wont get in range of Morde, or will kill you. And as many people have said the problem with the kit is that morde is an immobile melee mage, so its difficult to balance him so that everyone in the lane has fun. I feel like this would give morde more playmaking options tho, especially if you gate his power by controlling the cool down on the w, meaning he has an option to try to help a team mate who is getting caught by increasing their defenses (or making sure he gets an assist for their kill, whatevs ;), or going for the gamble, casting it on the enemy, knowing he has to hit a skill shot to secure the pull. The final argument for this kit is that I feel like Morde is supposed to be a immobile carry, it would just be wrong to see him dashing all over the place. While I get that this could potentially be op, I feel like there would be balance options to ensure that morde lanes just got so much more fun.\r\nFrom a thematic point of view pulling your enemies towards you feels like something a revenant should be able to do, particularly when the revenant is a massive empty suit of armor (havent checked the lore but I'm pretty sure Morde at least loosely qualifies as a revenant). \r\nAnyway let me know what people think.","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-02-06T11:26:36.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play ad morde and never go back","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2015-02-06T08:55:45.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what Morde needs is paragraphs","replies":[]}]}
