I have just attempted to play several games of league with each time resulting in the same problem. After champion select heading into the loading screen it stops me and says i am unable to connect to the server and my firewall may be causing the issue. I tried again with all my security systems turned off in a custom game but i still had the same issue. I have tried repairing league and also restarted my computer to no success. If anyone has any solutions or has had the same problem it would be great to hear from you. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: i also attempted to play league of legends on another computer using my internet with the same results as above.

Optus, Telstra, Dodo, TPG, etc. IP stands for Internet Protocol. Think of it like your postal address, except the one used on the internet. It's private for a reason.\n\nDo you use a virtual private network such as WTFast?","replies":[{"poster":"PureRoze","date":"2015-02-12T03:30:43.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol sorry my ISP then is local guy who runs his own wee small company so farmers could actually get affordable fast internet unlike the astronomical prises and slow internet speeds larger companies offer, and so i can contact him about it but am trying to take it into my own hands first so i know what i can do next time if it happens. I recently downloaded WTFast but have not really used it yet.\n\nAdditionally, i should have said this at the start but the exact same thing happened about 6 months ago but i thought i was a computer problem and took it to the pc \"doctors\" but nothing was wrong and after about 2 weeks after it started, it sorted itself out.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-12T23:18:36.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">local guy who runs his own wee small company\n\nDoes this company have a name? Actually that's really weird, because you need a **lot** of buildings, networks, cabling and maintenance to have a connection to the internet; one person would not be able to do that. You sure that it's not just him using another ISP, but connecting you all up to that? Ask him about it. How does he connect?\n\nThe reason why I asked if you use a VPN is because the use of those are usually the cause of this. If you aren't currently using one, then don't start. It will not give you good results. It's also against the EULA of this game.\n\nNow here's what can be done about it. Go to [this site](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and perform an analysis. Make sure that no other applications are open, and that your OS is not doing something silly like updating automatically or maintaining your computer. Do not post the result's url or the report itself, as it may contain personal information. In the summary, find the parts highlighted by red and post them here. This will help identify the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"PureRoze","date":"2015-02-14T21:48:25.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so i ran the test yesterday and one of the red things was it said i was on a XBL blocklist. So i checked it out myself and it told me i  had a zuestrojan so i went through the process of removing it and got myself off the blocklist. The other red things just said \"internal server error on test report\" under DNS tests and network security protocols. Additionally there are two yellow items under reachability tests but idk if i should post them. thanks for helping so far btw :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-14T23:59:41.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The other red things just said \"internal server error on test report\" under DNS tests and network security protocols.\n\nI have never seen something like that before from Berkeley; their servers are usually always functional. Could you run the test again and see if that same result comes up?\n\nAside from that, what exactly did you do to get yourself off the XBL blocklist? And has doing so resolved the game not working?","replies":[{"poster":"PureRoze","date":"2015-02-15T01:05:34.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i have done it again and it still says \"Internal Server Error on Test Report\" under \"Direct probing of DNS resolvers\" and the yellow stuff is under UDP connectivity and more specifically UDP port 1701 being blocked if that means anything. To get myself of the blocklist i searched why i was on there, it gave me a program to remove it the \"norton power eraser\" and i removed me from the block list and i havnt been put back on so it mustve worked. After doing that it still hasnt let me play league of legends unfortunately so it must be something to do with the yellow stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T03:03:23.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That port is unrelated to League, so the blockage of it shouldn't be affecting your ability to play. *But* the fact that it is blocked at all without your consent might be related to it. Yellow stuff you don't really have to worry about; no ISP is perfect and basically everyone has a few improper things going on in their connection (from a production point of view, as long as it connects, you don't need to fix it).\n\nOh yeah, the fact that it's still saying \"internal server error on test report\" does mean something's up. Do you have any firewalls or anti-viruses running?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
