With glyphs, if you divide 1.17 by 18 levels it will be 0.065, but if you divide 1.20 by 18 levels it will be 0.066666666..., which is repeating decimal 0.0(6), which was, probably, displayed as 0.06 without brackets.\nIt would be more accurate, if they change it's display to at least 0.066.\n\nI hope this helps, good luck!","replies":[]}]}
