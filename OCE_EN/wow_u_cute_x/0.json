It was about how people report you not based on your language in the chat but rather your performance. If you carry a team they most likely won't report you if you said something like \"kys\".  If you under-perform and say this however, get ready for a 14 day ban. \n\nI remember these two people named [REMOVED] and [REMOVED - Reporting Other Players] who proved that the IFS only cares about toxicity. They ran it down mid lane for **MANY** games before something was actually done. I don't think they were banned until they tweeted about it. Not sure if that was the story 100%, but it was more or less the case. Just imagine if they didn't tweet... Probably still be out there intentionally feeding. \n\nChat related punishments are a myth too. They say if it's **REALLY** serious you will skip it, but what's the difference between not so serious and very serious? Is not so serious like \"you're bad?\" and  serious like \"kys\"? I really don't understand where the line is drawn, but I think even if there is 0 tolerance for toxicity, there are other ways to punish than jumping straight to a ban. One of these is maybe a permanent chat restriction. I've been told a permanent chat restriction is stupid because people will find creative ways to troll, however, all they can really do is purposely AFK and run it down mid. I find this a bit ridiculous, because who would run it down mid or AFK just because they're chat restricted? If anything it will encourage them to use the little messages available to them in order to communicate properly. Pings exist too, and if you fear further toxicity why not fully strip their speech away?\n\nI think many, and almost all players would prefer to be muted/chat restricted rather than 14-day ban or permanent ban.

I also very much agree that those who consistently demonstrate such behaviour need to be stopped as fast as possible. It just wasn't the main discussion point (or so I understood).\n\nI also very much wish that gameplay offences were identified and addressed much faster than they are, but unfortunately for now that is what it is.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-09-12T02:40:09.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, i somewhat agree having been done for a similar thing a few weeks ago.\nWhat i actually got banned for was ridiculously minor, but after 4 years of playing this game, it has whittled me down from being the person who used to say \"calm down guys, we can win this\" to being the guy asking people if their parents are related because they are so dumb.\n\nSo I guess i needed the ban to reset. Now i just try to type \"unlucky\" even when my team does stuff that is beyond stupid.\n\nBut Riot explicitly said a few months ago that any death threats, use of the word \"retard\" or similar or any form of \"kys\" will be an automatic ban with 0 tolerance. Its the rules and you agreed to them when you sign up and play.\n\nJust a heads up too, it takes about 30 games of being \"honorable\" to get up 1 checkpoint in honor. So to get back to level 2 where you can get ranked rewards again, it takes roughly 270 games... good luck.\n\nLevel 0 (locked) - Level 0 Checkpoint 0, 1, 2, 3 - Level 1 Checkpoint 0, 1, 2, 3 - Level 2.\n\nAs someone who normally only plays about 400 games a season, its been a real pain the ass.","replies":[{"poster":"wow u cute x","date":"2018-09-12T03:13:55.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I had no idea kms and kys were on the instant ban death threat list.\n\nLosing all honor instead of losing half, or even losing 3 levels, is the most excessive part to me, being banned seems fair. I was one checkpoint off 5. It's like you have hundreds/thousands of people that enjoyed playing with you, and you say one acronym on a \"death threat\" list and that's completely irrelevent and you are in the same category as people who make a new account to run down mid. \n\nI'd be more willing to accept the ban if I could believe that there was the same zero tolerance policy for intentional feeders and people who stop trying when a play goes wrong at 5 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-12T04:34:07.381+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intent feeding and other gameplay offences do result in instant 14 day suspensions (skipping the first two punishment tiers and leaving the account a step away from perma), but they are unfortunately harder to identify/confirm and as a result take longer to issue.\n\n'kys' in chat is pretty cut and dry, but a 0/15 game can easily just be a horribly tilted game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2018-09-15T12:44:47.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why is that I reported a person who in after game lobby told me to KYS and they are still playing to this day?

Complete and utter BS that some get banned and others get away freely.

It's entirely possible they *were* punished with a chat restriction, which you wouldn't be able to see simply by knowing when they're playing. It's certainly not behaviour that should be ignored, though.\n\nIf you do feel it needs to be followed up further, you can submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Report cheating, phishing, or negative in-game behavior\" option) and that should trigger a manual review, though they wont be able to give any information regarding the outcome.
