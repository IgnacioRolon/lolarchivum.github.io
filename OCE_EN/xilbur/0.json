This is better since if they have to go under something that wasnt planned, they can continue playing League. On the other hand, for the guys who rage quit and want everything their way, they cannot get IP or level up even if they did good. This is just my opinion dou. Tell me your thoughts. It is ok to hate, just explain why.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-26T08:13:19.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or how about this.\n\nInstead of wanting to change LeaverBuster, change whatever it is that causes LeaverBuster to attack you.","replies":[{"poster":"Xilbur","date":"2015-06-26T08:31:27.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have to change unexpected things?
