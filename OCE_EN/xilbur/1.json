This means that she has a shield that is on a low cd and can still have the same amount of damage since her e scales off of ad. I would really appreciate if they either:\r\na) Make it scale off of ap\r\nb) Make the ratio lower\r\nc) Make the cd higher\r\nIdgaf if you down vote dis, and feel free to bitch about me but this is my opinion and I think this is what should be done.\r\nDiscussion below pls :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T04:11:43.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy\n\nThey've already addressed this by making her shield have an incredibly low duration. Most of the time it won't even reduce damage, it's so hard to time. It's mainly used for its mobility instead.","replies":[]}]}
