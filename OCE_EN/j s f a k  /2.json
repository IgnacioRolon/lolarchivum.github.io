I peaked at challenger last season but unfortunately stopped playing for several months and decayed to Plat 1 and am now currently sitting in D4. I am mostly going to put most my spare time into grinding solo q again and trying to get back to where I was but would like to also have a team to play with to kind of tweak my overall performance in games. I am very easy going, open to constructive criticism and can make you untilt from our losses with my positive attitude! \r\n\r\nBut seriously, wish you all the best of luck in your Season 8 grind. Hope to hear back from someone.\r\n\r\nPeace\r\n\r\n- Jason\r\n\r\nIGN: J S F A K","replies":[{"poster":"The Only Latvian","date":"2018-01-27T02:04:17.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Jason, I'm currently looking to create a new high-elo competitive team in OCE:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/7t9eeu/oced4starting_a_competitive_team/?](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/7t9eeu/oced4starting_a_competitive_team/)\n\nYou are saying everything I want to hear, and I look forward to hearing some more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SupaNewbee","date":"2018-01-21T17:01:45.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pogchamp.
