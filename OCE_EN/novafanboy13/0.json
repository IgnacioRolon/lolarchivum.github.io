Rather than encouraging reform and continued good behaviour, the result was an almost 100% relapse rate.\n\nIt sounds like a good plan in theory, but in practice all it accomplished was undermining the stopping power the threat of permanent has. \n\n>making our 4th violation and forgetting we've made those previous statement to other players\n\nThis is essentially the key here. You had 3 warnings prior to your permanent suspension and none were enough to make you realise the consequences. It took the severity of a permanent suspension to make you realise that. If a permanent suspension wasn't truly permanent, would it have?\n\n>but i acknowledged i deserved it, i messed up\n\nAnd that is why (with some very specific exceptions) Riot bans accounts, and not players. That is your chance to prove you've reformed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SecondAirbane","date":"2018-10-17T13:51:04.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're currently experimenting with this project in NA only for a limited # of players\nwhich started in july though no further details were announced after the project launched","replies":[]}]}
