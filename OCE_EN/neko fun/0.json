I was told that it was a rare skin. I just want to know how rare is  this particular skin or is this one of those skins which come into appearance a lot. I would love to see some statistics such as in how many games does it appear or how many people actually own this skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-19T15:36:10.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rare in the sense it is no longer available, and won't come back on cycles like say the Harrowing or Snowdown legacy skins. But as far as the number of people that have it, A LOT of codes went out for it. I don't actually know if it was ever available for regular purchase, I imagine it was, but a lot of people got codes so a lot of people have it (noone says no to a free skin).\n\nBut it is relatively unobtainable now, so you might as well enjoy it :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-19T09:45:33.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll find the site you're looking for [here](http://www.elophant.com/league-of-legends/champions/skin-popularity).
