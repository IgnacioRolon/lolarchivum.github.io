And if anything that just proves my point what kind of terrible matchmaking there is if that's possible.\n\nWhy the hell is sub-30 overrun with Smurfs? I'm not sure I've seen a single player that's actually NEW to the game yet.\n\n\n> is an NA smurf....complains about needing to vs lvl 30s....bronze 5 smurf? no REAL smurf would complain about pub games....\n> \n> also, the idea is to play beginner bots till lvl 10, and int bots to lvl 20. thats why the IP rewards are set up the way they are....infact in korea and garena, its locked out from playing pvp till lvl 13 and 15 respectively.\n\n\nI'm a Oceania \"smurf\", who's main is on NA and never left NA when the server came up. Mostly because NA seemed to get stuff earlier and isn't going to be closed down due to lack of population (ie another game I played). Unfortunately, that meant I was always playing with sub-optimal connection and 30's has slowly become more and more of a cesspool of the ranked rejects so I just had enough and made another account on Oceania this time. Evidently I didn't log into that one by reflex... lol\n\n\nAnd I don't think it should be a shock that a player who can't afford a 3150 IP champ yet nor take smite shouldn't have to face off against 6300 IP non-freeweek champs who CAN take smite, Flash, and everything else. That's just blatant pay-to-win against other players... who are MEANT to be new to the game already.\n\nSeemingly everyone sub-30 is a smurf and just as abusive as the 30's though, it's pretty sad.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-26T06:46:26.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">And I don't think it should be a shock that a player who can't afford a 3150 IP champ yet nor take smite shouldn't have to face off against 6300 IP non-freeweek champs who CAN take smite, Flash, and everything else.
