Queue times are fairly annoying at the moment, if there was some sort of indicator for what roles are required to fill teams / which roles have the lowest estimated queue times that would be pretty great. \r\n\r\nI personally shy away from going fill, due to being ok at only a couple of champs in JG and Supp, meaning if they are picked or banned then I am in a bit of trouble. This way I can choose between the other three roles and minimise queue times by picking the ones that are needed most to fill teams.\r\n\r\nWhat does everyone else think of this?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T12:17:48.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"While this is good, it will basically be \"We need supports\" and \"Quit trying to get mid lane, everyone else want's it.\"","replies":[]}]}
