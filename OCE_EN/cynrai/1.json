As you have probably checked already I'm in bronze. \n\nMy real world friends are always talking about how immensely easy it is to get to atleast high silver with very little effort and I have talked to multiple online friends that are higher ranked who say it does not even require effort to be high silver even gold.. \n\nThis is what is stressing me out the most... If it requires such minimal effort then why am I finding it absolutely impossible to even win a few games in a row at the very bottom of ranked... I mean i am winning a game or two but for them wins I am taking upto 4-5 loses after it.\n\nI believe in my mind that I have a good understanding of the fundamentals of being successful in the game. I check the map extremely often and base my choices of things I will do around it (I main jungle) I use pings regularly and communicate alot with my team, I ward alot to maintain an idea of where the enemy jungler is. I even use dragon timers to ensure that no dragon slips away undetected and a vast majority of the time I can even get sneaky solo dragons early I  the game. \n\nAll this combined and I am still taking a pounding in what is considered the absolute worst players in league division, it gets me down knowing that I try my best and give 100% but I still lose so much. I don't flame, I encourage teamwork and I mute toxic players so that I do not get distracted. Hell I even push for objectives over kills and never chase a champ on 20hp across the map only to find myself suddenly surrounded by enemy champs. \n\nI do not wish to believe that with all this in mind when I play I am still so bad that I cannot get above bronze 3, it's making me want to leave the game because bronze players get immensely hated on like we are the scum of the earth.. Long story short is I just needed to vent and possibly ask for any kind of advice on how to break this torturing cycle..? I blame noone but myself for my placement but I honestly feel like there is something I am doing terribly wrong for me to be considered this bad by the ranking system.. Thanks in advance if you're still reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"Foster My People","date":"2015-03-09T14:03:16.811+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try not to get too stressed after all in the end it's just a game and it is there for enjoyment. The thing I noticed about bronze is that there are actually a fair few players who actually have some decent skills and probably don't belong there, I find that it Is rather easy to be placed into silver but much harder to actually climb from low bronze to silver. As in the end it is a team game and you only make up 20% of that team.\n\nMy advice to you to help you climb is therefore avoid Adc and sup as at that elo you are likely to get troll/or unskilled players matched with you and that makes the lane a lot harder.\n\nIf you decide to play in lane make sure you focus on map awareness and csing - one thing I also notice about a lot of bronze players is they play too aggressively and therefore die to ganks, minions and other avoidable things. try play champions that can carry team fights as many bronze players are constantly out of position both before and during team fights hopefully this helps a little bit and if you can keep a 55% win rate you will climb you may just need to play a fair few games.","replies":[{"poster":"Cynrai","date":"2015-03-09T15:28:45.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have chosen the jungle as my main role as I like the freedom to roam and apply pressure and assistance where it is required. The champs I would like to focus on playing the most is Lee Sin(I Conside him my main champ) VI and Maokai. I believe all three of them have plenty of carry potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Prancer XL","date":"2015-03-09T19:58:43.711+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man! jungle main here, i did my climb out of bronze / silver with shyvanna as she is very tanking and when built correctly does an absurd amount of dmg. she is very good in lower elos becasue she is extremely good at dueling and most importantly if YOU get the kill when ganking a lane you can use it to carry in the late game. Lee sin is very hard to \"carry\" with. He falls off completely late game and ideally you want all the kills to go to those whose lane you are ganking so that they can carry late. Also lee sin takes a ridiculous amount of skill the be on the same level as other junglers.\n\nHero choices aside, climbing out of lower elo is a lot about mindset. Don't get caught up in arguments (you probably dont), always be focusing on what needs to be done next for the team to win. If people start flaming ignore them straight away as it really is distracting reading a running argument throughout the game. If you can feel yourself getting angry or emotional after a game then you pretty much have to have a break! you want to be calm and collective when playing so that every decision is calculated and so that you dont force any bad plays! \n\nalso people are saying LoL is just a game annnnd yeh it is but honestly ranked is more than just a game. People are not playing ranked just to have fun. They are playing for the competitive aspect of the game and are usually trying very hard to win.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-03-10T02:42:12.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the teamwork essentials down but unlucky for you teamwork alone won't get ya into dat sweet dream rank.\n\nLearn to carry: \n- Be that selfish player that takes blues off the mid laner as ADC.\n- Time and save skills so you can guarantee you're gettin the kill.\n- WARD A SHTLOAD PURELY FOR YOURSELF BECAUSE 9.8 TIMES OUT OF 10 YO DAMN TEAM DOESNT EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND WARDS IN THE SHOP.\n- Prac the sht out of your mechanics deadset work on them until it's straight up natural for you pull off the kinda stuff that amazes your mates.\n- Learn to capitalize on EVERYTHING.

But I really think I did make a mistake doing it. I mean I love playing with friends 8/10 games but seriously, the game starts its good your winning and all, then the sup thresh and jg hecarim decide to build full attack speed against a fed riven, even after a while reasoning, only jax was willing to build armor. Also, in my opinion the ranked picking order is extremely stupid. There are people who don't even give a pref call, they just lock what ever role they feel, because they think they are better, because they are above you in the select. For example someone might ask for jungle because they excel at it, then at very least ask not to go bot because they have a horrible winrate in botlane, ill give examples;\n\n(remember just example figures)\nTop: 78%\nMid: 62%\nJungle: 86%\nSupport: 14%\nMarksman: 21%\n\nof the games they played in those roles, yet because of the stubbornness of these people it can ruin the game for others.\n(looking at you full attackspeed thresh and hecarim, whom if built properly would of won, letting that person go up into the next league)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-09T13:30:30.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKMfGYdQEg0&spfreload=10","replies":[{"poster":"Cynrai","date":"2015-03-09T13:55:45.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
