Sometimes this would result in death by turret or other undesired consequences.  But, when playing Varus, I noticed the same thing didn't happen.  Varus would not attack anything that wasn't in range. Both are marksmen.\r\n\r\nWhy?  \r\n\r\nIs this something I should be able to predict when choosing a champion?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-13T02:46:21.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AAing turned on, dynamic range with kog W. his range isnt defined so he might target things out of range when in normal range. walking too close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-13T02:14:52.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"turn aa off","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-01-13T00:34:59.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you have aa on in settings?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shoklimb","date":"2015-01-12T23:47:57.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never have this problem, you can turn off auto-auto attack in settings. most people who have it on constantly move around so it doesn't effect them","replies":[]}]}
