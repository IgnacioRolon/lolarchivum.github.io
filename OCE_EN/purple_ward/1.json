In this time i have had my ups and downs, tilts and streaks but when it comes to BM and being toxic.. i admit it i get PISSED really easy. \r\n\r\nFor you to have the audacity to punish me with a 25 game chat restriction when i clearly was trying to keep my team to play as what i just told you we are. a team. you have gone to far with punishing me. Yes the chat was out of hand at the 15 minute mark where i was talking shit to the players who deserved it.\r\n\r\nif you look closely, many players have recieved bans for feeding and in the chat i clearly state that someone is feeding. I ask them to stop and i even thank an enemy who tells them to stop.. well they stop and the enemy they fed snowballed to the point *MY KDA AND WIN RATIO* MY* was fucked. for your system to match me with a toxic fuckwit who doesnt even reach the age limit to what the game requires on signup. \r\n\r\nleading to me becoming toxic after 15 minutes into a game that my team is 1-15 when im 1-2-0 with the only kill over the period of time.. outplaying an enemy udyr. Not saying im good but jesus....... cmon fuck u if u are gonnu keep this up. u cannot punish players who clearly start the match of with telling the friendly botlane to stop argueing after giving firstblood and a double kill. .... to then having one of the two feed because they dont agree with the fact that shuttting the fuck up and playing the game will accually give us a chance.\r\n\r\nim am writting this with one hope. that u will stop punishing those of us who clearly show the leadership skills that half the fking community lack. Autism is evident and so is the underage part of the community. ..... simply put it if a new account is made with the IGN &quot;xX_QuiikSkopes_Xx&quot; u should immediatly ban the underage fuckwit for not applying by one of the FIRST rules seen  on the signup page. because put it simply they will feed they will have tantrams and they will refuse to communicate with college students who dont have the time to fuck around and who accually try to fit time in to play competitively.\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediatly i will have responses stating that those who are banned are the toxic ones and they need to learn.\r\n\r\nYou cannot teach someone to chill when they are pissed. and you cant teach someone to not be pissed.... SO stop trying to teach these things and enforce the other rules that accually will put an end to the good part of the community getting toxic. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-18T14:54:59.637+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Having a 25 game chat restriction means you have most likely already been punished with a 10 game chat restriction. It looks as though you have still yet to see why your behaviour is problematic. \n\nHere's a handy hint for ya:\n>Don't meet toxicity with more toxicity!\n\nNo players \"deserve to be spoken ♥♥♥♥ to\". Not matter how bad they are doing, even if they are talking ♥♥♥♥ to you, you should never ever contribute to the negative atmosphere by adding your own toxic slew to the mix. It escalates the situation and everything becomes a while lot worse for everyone involved. \n\n>if you look closely, many players have recieved bans for feeding and in the chat i clearly state that someone is feeding. \n \nThere is a massive difference between intent feeding and being a bad player. A lot of people (especially those at our elo) are bad players and are going to go  0/8 in laning phase, and that's ok, they can learn from their mistakes and improve in their next games. What is not ok, is you pointing out that they are feeding. Who is that going to help? It won't make them play better, if anything, it will make them play worse\n\n>well they stop and the enemy they fed snowballed to the point MY KDA AND WIN RATIO MY*....  outplaying an enemy udyr.\n\nLooking through your match  history, I can tell that you also have some pretty bad games. There are probably people that feel the same way about you, that you feel about other players. \n\n>cmon fuck u if u are gonnu keep this up. u cannot punish players who clearly start the match of with telling the friendly botlane to stop argueing after giving firstblood and a double kill. .... to then having one of the two feed because they dont agree with the fact that shuttting the fuck up and playing the game will accually give us a chance.\n\nYou probably aren't saying anything nicely to the \"friendly botlane\", otherwise you probably wouldn't have a ban. Even if you are starting the match nicely, you aren't ending that way. \n\n>that u will stop punishing those of us who clearly show the leadership skills that half the fking community lack. \n\nIt is possible to have leadership skills without being toxic. I have had plenty of games where team members are nearly going AFK or are going 0/7 in the first 10 minutes, that I have managed to lead to victory through my words. Never been banned for my leadership though. \n\n>Autism is evident and so is the underage part of the community.\n\n**Not cool using someone's life as an insult**. If this is the way you act in game, you should probably reform ASAP as you are heading towards permaban territory. \n\n> simply put it if a new account is made with the IGN \"xX_QuiikSkopes_Xx\" u should immediatly ban the underage fuckwit for not applying by one of the FIRST rules seen on the signup page. because put it simply they will feed they will have tantrams and they will refuse to communicate with college students who dont have the time to fuck around and who accually try to fit time in to play competitively.\n\nIt is impossible to tell the age of a user simply from their summoner name. Some may be using them ironically, some may have had the same login name since they created their first email account age 10. \n\nYou don't know they will feed. I know some 13 year old players that are way better than 20 year olds. Evidently, having online tantrums and refusing to communicate in a positive manner/at all isn't limited to a certain age group. Look at Tyler1. He isn't exactly a youngin'.  \n\n>You cannot teach someone to chill when they are pissed. and you cant teach someone to not be pissed.... SO stop trying to teach these things and enforce the other rules that accually will put an end to the good part of the community \n\nIf you can't chill and reform your own behaviour, you are going to end up being perma banned. It won't be in error, and it wont be due to Riot punishing your leadership skills. You are toxic. \nYou are not a nice person to play League of Legends with.\n You are not the kind of player that makes up the good part of the community.  \n\nI would personally suggest that you take some time away from league of legends, and evaluate how you could improve your behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Purple Ward","date":"2016-04-18T15:43:41.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"ill keep this short.\n\n\"Don't meet toxicity with more toxicity!\"\n\n- its the way i am... yeh ill recieve a chat ban every now and then ... thats a 10 game and i know i deserve that. so i dont care about it. its almost once a year. : u have the audacity to piss me off and lose me a game that i struggle to fit into my study hours..... ???? thats not nice... and u can honestly go fuck urself if ur that type of person.

Understandable, but my point still stands. \n\nDon't meet toxicity with more toxicity. Like **Hybridz** said, mute players from the first sign of negativity. Focus on your own plays, don't get too caught up in trolls. If you feel the need to let out some steam,** say what you are thinking instead of typing it.** That way, you get it out of your head, and the others don't have to see it. It also means you can't get reported for  it. \n\nI know it can be super frustrating to set aside an amount of time to have a game, only to have it ruined by toxins,  but you can pretty much negate the chance of having your least favourite types of players in your games by playing with friends. If you don't have enough, I would suggest heading over to the t[eam recruitment board.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment).\n\nIf you encounter negative players, be sure to report them at the end of game. Every report counts. Be sure to do the same with the intent feeders. As you know, the punishment system works and these types of players will get what they deserve.","replies":[{"poster":"Purple Ward","date":"2016-04-18T22:27:32.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^_^ thankyou","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-04-18T16:28:53.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"in general dude, I suggest U just mute ur team, concentrate on using the ping system, and play the game rather then letting it get to you, I too have had some pretty bad games and have üsed pretty bad language at players, You can't say anything that may get you banned they have tightened the grip on the language abuse factor on lol.\n\nMy suggestion is this, Don't say anything use the ping system, lots it will help you and your team, and if two people or 3 do start arguing and it starts causing tilt start focusing on ur own game, chuck them on mute keep pinging when required if they refuse to help and keep feeding to where you get tilted and don't try to contribute in the next games, then you possibly deserve a mute, or a ban yourself.\n\nThe reason is this... its simple\n\n\n1) the minute you talk, language, harrass, abuse, swear, say anything you can get reported and end up with a mute suspension.\n\n2) if you don't communicate with your team mates because they are arguing you are not at all going to get any sort of suspension as you are entitled to play the game without feeling like you are being harrassed or watching harrassment  take place excuse my grammer.\n\n3) we have rules for a reason it sucks but hopefully you understand why, I chose the same path I was very toxic swearing and yelling at players, but now if i see s...break out and get real intense i throw people on mute and focus...................... if I can turn 1 out of 5 games I feel like ive done something, rather then allow others to dictate my mood when I play.\n\nI have also saved money I will be real honest and personal with you right now, I went from buying a new keyboard everyday from getting angry at LoL to now having 1 that has lasted \"cross fingers\" 3 months now............... its very expensive breaking keyboard but I too deserved to be muted even though the games I was toxic in not necessary my fault for losing, but it never excused me getting angry, breaking a keyboard, smashing a glass which badly cut my hand and ended up in hospital.. nothing has ever helped me more than realising I can just mute the dick heads and fucking tell them to shut the fuck up so i can fucking play..\n\nyes im still toxic, but hey Idgaf.. If u want to be a troll in a game I have a mute button for a reason, saves me from getting 25 game mutes, and save money on broken keyboards\n\n\nThe end :) thanks for reading my story!{{champion:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Purple Ward","date":"2016-04-18T13:32:27.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First game tonight and look at this.\nhttp://postimg.org/image/mezue70aj/\n\nanother retard who possibly has cost me the game.
