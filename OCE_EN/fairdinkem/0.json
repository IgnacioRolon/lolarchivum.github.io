I'm no Angel myself but i will defend myself in a heated fury, and yes, i flame people if they are doing poorly, but if they are new to a champ or new to the game, i give advice. It's the people with thousands of mastery points and 100's of player levels that think they're amazing but are complete trash that bug me the most. Blaming the rest of the team for the loss because they're a terrible team player and can't fight as a team, or can't build their champ to counter the enemy.\n\n_**3.**_ The reporting/ban system is still completely stupid because they still hold players hostage in games. If people were allowed to leave games freely... Since, you know, people do actually have lives outside of League of Legends, there would be a lot less toxicity. I've had multiple games where i've told teammates to just leave mid-game when they needed too because we won't report them for needing to leave.\n\nI might sound biased here, seeing as i just got my first 10-day chat ban this afternoon, but here is the story of how this happened. I play ARAM Exclusively, i refuse to play SR, as it's even worse in there than it is in ARAM. I have had very fun matches in ARAM, and have met a bunch of people that are genuinely decent people and good to play with. We can mess about while playing and still play to win, and not ruin other peoples games.\n\nI know there will be the, \"It's only ARAM, OMG Stop trying\" comments, but before you do, have you ever thought about why people only play ARAM? It's to get away from you people and still play a competitive 5v5 PvP game. The people who go into a competitive game mode, and say that crap, are half the reason people get pissed off at them. You're literally saying to your team, that you came in here to lose. Today i got put in a game with a Duo who were quite clearly trolling. Refusing to go in with the team, waiting until everyone had died to engage, then when i '?' Pinged one of them, he replied with; 'If you keep pinging me, i'm going to fucking mute you' To which i replied with 'How about you actually help the team, rather than sitting back doing nothing?'\n\nThis escalated as the game went on, soon after the last discourse, i was told to go kill myself in real life. To which i continued to rebuttal, and i know i shouldn't have, but i am so sick and tired of the amount of trolls i have come across in this game lately, and half the reason it's so god damn annoying, is because you CAN NOT LEAVE! You are forced to stay in this game with them, otherwise you risk getting banned for leaving/AFK'ing. I tried to surrender at 8 Minutes, and what a surprise, the Duo refuses to surrender even though they are already at our Inhib. As soon as that match was over, i loaded into my next game. Coming out of that next game, i was hit with my first Chat Restriction. I know it takes more than 1 Report to get restricted, but i have also come across trolls in more than 50% of my last 30 games. Some of which where even my teammates were getting annoyed. One game, a troll duo convinced the enemy team to report 3 of us for toxicity/negative attitude... It is just a game of trolls now.\n\nRIOT Seriously needs to do something about this shit. If you were allowed to leave the game, the Toxicity levels would drop ENORMOUSLY! I know people will say \"But then people would just constantly leave games\". To which i reply, so what? The only place that should lock you into a game is in Ranked, where you are playing for more than just a win. I will happily take a loss if it means i no longer am held captive in that toxic environment. It would also help people cool off and not retaliate. Meaning less toxicity in future matches. What difference would it make if someone who was toxic was allowed to leave the game? Better yet, how much better would you feel, being able to actually get away from the toxic people? Hell, even if they made it so you couldn't Queue for another game for 10-15 minutes, i would be happy to wait for that timer, as i'm sure many others would be too.\n\nThere are plenty of competitive based team games that allow players to leave games mid-game with no penalty and they are doing just fine. As i said above, the only place that should have a leaving ban is in Ranked matches, not in Co-Op, ARAM or Normals. Then again, this is also the same company that holds it's workers hostage by law, and forces arbitration... So we all know none of this will get fixed.\n\n\nTL;DR - RIOT Needs to fix a lot of shit, mainly the bans for leaving games that aren't Ranked games, to lower stress and toxicity levels. Also it would be nice if they would actually get rid of the Inting Bot Accounts. The amount that i reported levelling up to LvL 30 was Insane.","replies":[{"poster":"Potato King","date":"2019-05-21T08:40:01.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the chat log from the 30 minute game of everything i said and will own up to everything i said.

Granted if this wasn't in a game with trolls, i would happily take the Chat Restriction no questions asked, but seeing as these people are literally out there to make peoples lives hell... I think it's fucking stupid and RIOT needs to do something to fix it.\n\nI'd also like to mention, that outside of pre-mades i do actually get a few honours. Hell, one of the messages i got said \"You received 101% more GG's than the average player\". My point is, the Honour and Ban system needs a serious overhaul.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-21T09:36:40.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> As someone who played the game back in high school in 2010, who soon after stopped playing because of how toxic the community was, to now coming back 9 years later.

That's how you play ARAM, you don't let your front-line go in by themselves only to sit back with full health and do nothing for the first 8 minutes of the game and then abuse them for pinging you... The abuse started with them, i defended myself and it escalated over the course of the game. If you could see the absolute crap that they were putting in the chat you would understand why i got so heated over the course of the game. Not to mention telling people to off themselves. As someone who has depression and has lost people too depression, that's the worst thing you can say to anyone you aren't acquainted with, but you're going to sit here and tell me that it's not toxic? That i shouldn't defend myself?\n\nBeing told to kill myself simply because i told them to help the team is not at all a valid response. If you're proposing that i have a child like mind, then the people that i am being forced into a game with and being help captive with, lest i yearn for a ban for leaving, must still be in the womb.\n\nBetter yet, telling someone to kill themselves is supposed to be an instantaneous 14-Day ban, and yet, i'm here after 1 bad game with these trolls, sitting on my thumb with a 10-Game Chat Restriction, whilst that same troll is still out there with no inflicted penalty. The system is completely broken. If it was seen that someone was actually defending themselves from the start, then the system might actually work better.

I was just queuing with my friend who is new to the game, he is low level and we see a lot of bot accounts.

They cant even hear your tone, let alone see your teary eyes. Especially if they are the kind of people that are hateful.

As i said, if there was just a Queue penalty of say 10 minutes for leaving a game early, and it counted as a loss whether your teams wins or not, seems to me like a completely valid option. Sometimes people have genuine outside reasons they need to leave the game, for which there should be no penalty, but there is.\n\nAs for the supposed budget you think they have, you may want to look at who wholey owns RIOT, maybe even look into what else they own... even how much money they have. Yes as a sub company they would have a form of budget, but they pull in so much money its not funny. Rather than adding more skins and doing events, why not focus on one of, if not the biggest problem in the game currently?\n\nLike i said, this is the same company that can't treat its own employees fairly... and is still refusing too after mass walkouts.\n\nIf i missed a point or something is spelled incorrectly, i apologise as i am typing this all on my phone.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-22T09:15:05.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Also, i've been through your comment history on the forums and you constantly say the same things over and over.

You aren't there to spark debate, you're there to get a rise out of people, because that's just who you are. You confirmed it for me when you said you game the system so that you can sneakily get away with insulting people without getting banned.\n\n_**2.**_   You act high and mighty, and you try to speak as if you are more intelligent than everyone you 'converse' with, yet your posts are full of grammatical and spelling errors, ALL of them and you contradict yourself repeatedly.

Close-Minded and immature. If you knew anything about the way the world works outside of a computer screen, you wouldn't go around saying things like that. Thinking that maturity and age are linked, and then saying that life experience is maturity are contradictory. Life experience is wisdom and maturity does not denote ones intelligence.\n\n_**4.**_   My final point as to why you're a troll... You have no match history. On OP.gg or through the forums here. Your match history is non-existent, which says a few things. Either you're banned and you can't play, in which case you shouldn't be here, telling other people how to play **OR** You don't even play the game in it's current state and you can't speak for how the game is for everyone, which again, says you shouldn't be here telling people what to do.\n**OR**, this one is my favourite, You have a different account you play the game with, so that people don't know who you are on the forums...

You say i wasn't playing the game properly because of a false quote, the actual quote i believe you were looking for, was this one; \n**_KaijuuWRX: Imagine if you waited for your team\nKaijuuWRX: LOL\nKaijuuWRX: Thats literally what you were doing at the beginning_**\n\nThe reason this is part of the conversation, was because i was waiting at Nexus Towers for the rest of my team to spawn before engaging a 5-Man enemy team at our Inhibitor... The trolls went in together as a 2v5, and blamed me for their deaths. If i had gone in with them, not only would the towers have been lost, but it would have been an Intentional feed. My point still stands... ALT-Tabbing, would still result in a report, but instead of just the two trolls, it would be the entire team and potentially the enemy team as well after my team asks them to report me for AFK/Griefing. Moving around doesn't stop the reports side of being AFK/Leaving the game, it only prevents the automatic side.\n\nPain doesn't separate greatness from trash? That statement alone is enough for me to judge you falsely mature. Where do you come up with this crap? Are you reading fortune cookies? You have more one-liners than an Adam Sandler movie. Pain is pain, and everyone experiences it at some point. Pain doesn't change ones life unless it's a comic book. You think because I've been through a lot of pain, i'm going to be a Super-Hero/Villain? Us NORMAL people, work through our pain, and then continue with our lives.\n\nYou don't know what lessons I've learned? You clearly have no idea what you're trying to say, and if you do, it's not coming through clearly. I can call it unjust, and i will. That's exactly what it is, unjust. Hypothetically... If i were to stab you in the leg as i walked past you on the street but no-one saw it, and refused to help you, you would call it unjust as well.\n\nHere's one for you, since I've seen you ask other people a very similar question, if my situation was real life. In a workplace, seeing as that's where us adults spend the majority of our lives. If we were in a team situation and i asked our team member to come help us, and he/she turned around and said \"Shut up or i'm just going to ignore you forever\" to which i replied asking them to just come and help, and they started abusing me then continued to do things to make it difficult for the team, and later told me to kill myself. How long do you think that person would continue at that workplace, better yet, how well do you think they'd go in any workplace following? I know for a fact, that no employer would give that person a good reference.\nThat would be enough for instant dismissal in most cases, and at the very least a formal warning, of which you only require one now in Australia before you can be legally dismissed at any point following with poor behaviour.\n\nIf you can't see the world failing, i think you're completely blind. You sit behind your computer, ignoring everything but your forums clearly. Probably watch the night-time news and think the world is peachy. Do you even know what's going on outside your window? Countries falling into economic ruin, governments fighting against their citizens, civil wars breaking out in many countries currently. You want proof? Go look at what's happening in South Africa after a bill was passed last year for black people to take back white FARMING land without compensation, go read about what those people are doing to the farmers and their families, how they're taking back that land. Go take a look at Venezuela, tell me how that Socialist regime is going. Not to mention the wars going on in the middle-east, outside of what you hear on your nightly news.\n\nI am here to try and make the game a better place. If i were here to oust the 2 trolls, i would have put their names in to shame them and i'd be crying to RIOT to lift my chat restriction, which i have already worked off. Like i said, i accept the restriction, i know i did wrong. I'm not here to cry to pathetic people like you, i'm here offering an extremely valid solution to said problem. Otherwise i'd be in here saying i'm boycotting the game and how i'm never going to play again. You can ask anyone i play with that these problems are something I've complained about since coming back to the game. I didn't start this thread, i only came here to voice an opinion similar to the person that did and i gave my story of how i have faced trolls in this game. You do really well to read between the lines and see what you want to see. I could have just as easily not posted the chat log from my game, and just said what had happened in my own way to make myself look better, except i chose not too. I posted it, as it is vital in being able to see how i progressively got more and more aggressive over a 32 minute game that i was STUCK in.\nIf this doesn't happen on a regular basis... Why are all your comments on similar posts? Saying the same things over to try and provoke already annoyed people?\n\nBots **ARE** one of the biggest problems in the game. People are ILLEGALLY making money by selling accounts. RIOT refuse to ban the accounts, therefore those illegally selling said accounts, are getting away with it, over and over again without punishment. **ALSO**, it makes it extremely difficult for new players to get into the game and learn to play properly if they're being matched up with bots all the time. Without a new player base, you're stuck with the same toxic people creating new accounts after they get their old accounts banned, you won't have a player increase and the game will die off. That's simple mathematics.\nYou think people will just continue to play League until the end of time? **Wrong.** People are getting sick of RIOT and the lack of care they show towards their player-base, and without new people coming in to fill those slots, the game will die off completely. I'm not saying it will be this year, or next year, but it will die off. The worse you treat those people who are on the brink of leaving already, the less money they will spend if they are even spending any, and eventually they will get fed up completely and leave. There are still relevant options to leave League for; SMITE and DOTA 2 are still going strong. SMITE is on multiple platforms as well and offers more options to play.\n\nYour final statement is idiotic and serves no purpose in this conversation. I get what you're trying to say, but you're essentially saying that if someone were to leave their job at RIOT they would never find another job to support their family... I don't think you know how the game development industry works. People in the game development industry are lucky to hold jobs for more than a year or two in most situations. You can even go and research this.\n\n_**My final statement**_, as i am going to refuse to reply to you any more;\nI suggest you stop trying to prod people on the forums unless you do it in a manner more kind than what you have been previously. Nobody wants to converse with you because of how much of an ass you come off as when you comment. If you want to genuinely have a proper debate, don't start with false accusations of people you haven't met before or played with before. Try to find out both sides and take your own advice and treat people as you would want them to treat you maybe? Notice how up until now, i have put up with your snide remarks and condescending tones? Some of us have patience, so maybe don't test it immediately, and you'll have better luck in conversing with people here. Especially if they are already in a bad mood from playing the game, unless you are just the troll i suspect you to be.\n\nLastly. Go play the game. If this is your only account, it shows that you haven't been playing the game, and no-one will listen to someone that isn't playing the game in it's current state. Now, I bid you adieu. I'm going to go back to actually playing the game, and i will continue to report the trolls that i encounter in my travels, as i have done previously. I really hope you can wake up to yourself, and leave this false identity you're living in, behind.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-25T14:12:43.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 1. You go in, claiming to spark debate, but you do it in the most condescending way possible. You aren't there to spark debate, you're there to get a rise out of people, because that's just who you are. You confirmed it for me when you said you game the system so that you can sneakily get away with insulting people without getting banned.\n\nSpark a debate? talking with people that uses their emotions as fact, can hardly be called a debate. \n\n> 2. You act high and mighty, and you try to speak as if you are more intelligent than everyone you 'converse' with, yet your posts are full of grammatical and spelling errors, ALL of them and you contradict yourself repeatedly. Not to mention... You're just an ass to everyone.\n\nHow do you learn if you don't make mistake? Your perception of me only speak volume about your insecurity. The truth is strong and bitter. You don't have to like it. But better than indulging in honey coated words and poisoning yourself overtime. \n\n> 3. You think that maturity and age are co-efficient's, which immediately tells me that you, yourself, are immature. Close-Minded and immature. If you knew anything about the way the world works outside of a computer screen, you wouldn't go around saying things like that. Thinking that maturity and age are linked, and then saying that life experience is maturity are contradictory.\n\nI don't think it. I don't even mention it. You are confused. All that I've wrote was, age is not a factor when it come to learning how to be a better person. You need to face the experiences of life using intellect and personality traits. Those 2 indication combined are the greatest teacher. But logically, a person learn as he grow older. When an adult is behaving like a child, you would encompass its as immaturity. In other words, he is lacking in experience and wisdom; Loosely speaking, lacking **in that aspect **of behavior. Do you understand?\n\nI don't know if it is me, who is not being concise with my words. Or it is you who cant understand a simple statement.\n\n> ****Life experience is wisdom **and maturity does not denote ones intelligence.**\n\nExperiencing life does not grant you wisdom. One need to reflect on oneself; Extracting profound knowledge drawn out from one's misery, in order to find a path to a better future. That is what wisdom is. And it is VERY, very hard to accomplish. A person with feeble character and courage can live for a long time and will never achieve that mode of being.\n\nAs for your second point. Where did i mention age and intelligence shared the same path? \n\n>  4. My final point as to why you're a troll... You have no match history. On OP.gg or through the forums here. Your match history is non-existent, which says a few things. Either you're banned and you can't play, in which case you shouldn't be here, telling other people how to play OR You don't even play the game in it's current state and you can't speak for how the game is for everyone, which again, says you shouldn't be here telling people what to do.\nOR, this one is my favourite, You have a different account you play the game with, so that people don't know who you are on the forums... So which is it?\n\nThat is because you are too shallow on your outlooks. How many years can you count on my OP.GG that I've played the game? All the way back in season 2 started in NA. Now, if you sprinkle a dose of rationality. It is easy to tell my kindle for the game has dwindle. My last game played on league was about** 1month ago**; And just like you, i played ARAM for the casualness of it. \n\nHas the game and it's populace changed so much over the period of a month? Should i believe you that people can turn bad this quickly? That would be plausible with a 1% probability; Like a new tyrannical rule was introduce and cause a mass riot. \n\nIf it hasn't, and these few complains that are coming in, which seem to rinse and repeat itself in a pattern. Can i make the assumption that people like you are running away from yourself? Why sit down and give yourself hard questions to think about, right? It is way easier to blame it on the lowest hanging fruit.\n\n> **Pain doesn't separate greatness from trash?

What become of a person** after knowing pain**, is what will SEPARATE greatness from trash. \n\nDo you understand what it mean? I wrote it in a simple manner without complexity.\n\nFor example. Look at you. After your ban, did you ever think that you did something wrong? Did you ever think that if you didn't start a provoking statement AND CONTINUING IT, those 2 players wouldn't react negatively to you and things wouldn't be where they are now??\n\nSo **what did you do after the pain come**? You ran all the way here, complain and complain. Not once did you look at yourself. Did you pick a path of greatness to tread on? For sure you have not. No real man would be so quick to blame everyone else and ignored himself.

Everything is in your favor, you're the righteous one here and everyone else is clearly a thug. Are you implying this scenario is what got you punished? \n\nWay to go, paint everyone else the villain again, poor you. This is what its all about man, this is how you see the world isn't it?.

RIOT refuse to ban the accounts, therefore those illegally selling said accounts, are getting away with it, over and over again without punishment.\n\nYes, this is true. But there is nothing you can do about it. Those bots are scripted, 1 computer can generate 10-20 bots. The game is F2P so they can just remake account free of charge.

gives no fucks about the players only there fucking fat pockets i know where i am going,, this game is legit AIDS, it will ruin any positive aspect you hold over time,,, the staff are ignorant , and you cannot contest anything because they do not care, \n\ni played 1 game today after not logging on for 2 weeks,,,, i was having a joke in chat, after asking what rank is a certain player,,, he says he is gold 2, then gold 1, blah blah heard it all, i am platinum 3 really, but got banned on my first account for the exact same reasons, people getting people banned for basically doing nothing but retaliating over time to there ignorant ass who does it on purpose and laughs about it,,,,,,\n\nthis account is now banned for 15 days because the guy reported me because i said gold = bronze you are still learning the basic mechanics of the game,, throughout the rest of the game i tried to give them advice and pointers of what they can do to get better,, and help there gameplay , NAH they had none of that abused me more,,,,, i got banned that fast for fucking nothing while i was writing my statement to report these guys, the client closed and i was unable to report them, \n\nso i am here banned again for basically no reason i cannot dispute it ,, and i cannot report them because i got banned that quick my client shut down,,,,,,,\n\nthe staff of this game are putrid and they don't give a fuck , \n\nthis game is literally a dying breed , there are that many botters and scripters it's not even funny, and the community of this game is that far gone there is no point in trying,,,,,,\n\ni have never seen such an ignorant and childish community in my entire life of gaming, i have been gaming over 12 years now , and not once have i ever seen such garbage community, AND STAFF,,, it's like they pay these guys to do this so they can feed on your energy, \n\n\ni've had it this game is un installed  i will never return , i wasted so much time and money on this game , just to have someone who has been playing for a few months to get me banned over nothing , \n\n\nit's not worth my time, \n\nthis game has gone backwards since release,,,, there banning system makes it worse,,,,, even before hand the system was extremely bad,,, it's like that on purpose to spread negativity , fuck this game off play something worth your life and time,,,,\n\n\nplay a game where the devs appreciate you and respect you and listn to you , and take into consideration all circumstances, not this ignorant backward company,,,,, they will ban you just because they know you are addicted and will be back , even if you spent hundreds upon hundreds , i could write  a book about this game , i have played it that long it is downright disgusting,,,,,\n\nthe whole system is bad not just the players,,,, MM is really bad and i'ts like that on purpose,,,,,,,\n\n\nthe playerbase is shrinking rapidly and it will die,,, so goodluck
