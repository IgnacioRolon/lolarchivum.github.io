There are circumstances where such a thing may be beyond your control (internet cafes) or something may cause a false positive (having a disallowed program installed then removed but not removed properly/completely), but if someone is banned for scripting it's not just because they were really good at dodging. It's because an actual malicious program (or seemingly malicious program) was interfering with the client in some way (and/or the account was compromised and the intruder used scripts).","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-04-16T03:21:06.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Terribly sorry XD I should have worded that differently.\nI mean my friend got banned from people reporting him being a scripter/hacker. I don't believe he resulted in a direct ban from the system picking up on malicious activity.
