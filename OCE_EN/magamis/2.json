I hadn&#039;t been on for maybe 1-3 days, but then I would log into my account today and be permanently banned. Before the whole, you must be responsible for your own account speech I&#039;ve done everything to my ability to keep my account safe. Long password, numbers, capitals, copying and pasting my information rather than typing it down... the lot. Of course, to my dismay again to get banned but this time permanently. This is rather unfair for a player who doesn&#039;t play that often, but comes back every now and then. Especially to get perm-banned for such behavior that was displayed on my account? I was confused, because I never usually chat and block people immediately. No time for drama, when you want to have fun.\r\n\r\nBut obviously now I can&#039;t and I&#039;ve been banned. Making a new account after losing all the champs, having every single one and a dozen cool looking skins. It&#039;s not worth it.","replies":[]}
