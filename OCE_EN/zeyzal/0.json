I would like to hit Gold this season and continue improving from there. I'm therefore looking for a coach who is in Diamond or higher. I'm happy to pay a little bit per session but I'm not particularly rich, so we can discuss that. Essentially I'd want you to watch replays with me and analyse my gameplay, spectate me to see what I'm doing wrong still, and even duo with me so you can correct me in real time. \r\n\r\nAdd me on league: MetaHew if interested, or respond here with a method of contact.\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"HippoHunt3r","date":"2015-01-30T05:31:53.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill do it for free we could duo even cause im fuking gold this season LBAWS","replies":[]},{"poster":"MewMew","date":"2015-01-30T05:10:58.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What roles are you looking for coaching in?
