It sucks balls to lose a game cause of that and I feel you man =(\n\nTo answer your question what is actually being implemented here;\n\nYou can read all about our systems here;\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Y9YJ60Fn-player-behaviour-faq\n\nWe have Intentional Feeder Detection\n\n> What about intentional feeders?\n> \n> There is a separate system that focuses purely on feeders. If someone is feeding intentionally in multiple games then they will face temporary account suspensions and possible bans if they show no signs of reform.\n\nIt's there and we continue to have a team dedicated to improving the experience for you all. It's not perfect but we continue to iterate and improve as we move on. Unfortunately there has been a delay in updates and features in this space because of all the work required to bring it all into the updated client, but as that gets closer to release and moves out of beta you should see more progress in the Player Behaviour space.\n\nI went to investigate whats going on here....and lets just say the system has already investigated and taken the necessary action on the account.\n\nBut to be honest, punishments alone wont prevent you from having this experience again. Punishments might help you feel a sense of justice after the fact but it doesn't shield you completely from experiencing it in the first place. It will prevent a little bit as some players may be deterred knowing that punishments are in place.\n\n> There is no silver bullet that solves negative behavior in online games. Players are a diverse bunch, and each player has different motivations and responds differently to different consequences. We design diverse systems using three core philosophies based on reform, punishment, and reward.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-19T00:29:13.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue is human nature, if you do not provide consistent and clearly visible punishments then players will act as such.\n\nTake eve online as an example, the things that ccp does not tolerate very rarely happen, because provide concise, very visible punishment to deter people from doing it.\n\nBut anything that ruins player experience that ccp tolerates? happens en masse.\n\nTake goon squad as an example.\n\nor the bank of eve.\n\nThese are major operations that had a negative impact on literally the entire playerbase of eve, every single player from the whales to the little guys just starting out encountered them at some point.\n\nThe assumption, that people will just be nice, out of the goodness of their hearts, is quite frankly naive, and its one of the reasons i absolutely fucking hate the automated systems.\n\nBecause even if they do work, and we still dont have proof of that only anecdotal evidence from riot employees, and quite frankly with all the bullshit you guys have spun in these past few years i dont trust a red names words farther than i can throw phreaks forehead.\n\nIt doesnt feel like it does.\n\nWhen players are toxic and say \"report me it wont do anything\" they dont say that to deter reporters, they say that because they believe it.\n\nFuck when players want to report me for flaming i say that, and i damn well believe it, infact i flame because i believe it, in no other game am i toxic, but boot up a game of league and its like dr jekyll and mr hyde, because i suddenly go from one of the nicest blokes you will ever know, to someone about ready to punch a hole in their monitor screaming at you about how you shouldve been aborted because you cant manage a simple task like pressing a button.\n\nAnd why do i make that change? part of it is because i wont get punished for it, i dont just think that i know that, and the other reason? its because the rest of the playerbase is like that, monkey see, monkey do.\n\nand quite frankly ill bet you any money for every instance of a ban made by your systems that you can give me, i can probably find five other people flying under the radar.\n\nTo summarize, it doesnt matter what your results are internally.\n\nWhat matters is the response to the system from the community, if the community doesnt feel like they are safe from toxicity using this system then, i dont give two shits if your automated systems are 90% accurate, the community doesnt feel safe period.\n\nAnd the community comes first, because without us, you wouldnt make a fucking cent.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-12-19T00:35:44.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify my word vomit, the reason the community is still toxic, is EIther \nA) the system just doesnt work in the first place\nor\nB) the placebo effect, and because the system isnt transparent (like the tribunal was) we honestly cant tell that it works and as such we dont fear the reaper.\n\nbecause why make a punishment system, and then not instill fear of being punished, the system may aswell not exist in the first place if you dont drill it into peoples heads that it will hit them hard with the book.","replies":[{"poster":"syncorolls","date":"2017-01-02T08:43:53.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree with you Yellow, i also feel that the system isnt as transparent as the tribunal and people just feel free to be toxic. \n\nThe tribunal was a great system that self regulated the players.

Glad to know that the associated player has to face the music.\n\nOn a side note, i remember that the client used to give prompts to let you know when a player you reported got dealt with accordingly. Similar to how Vainglory's client would give you a speech box saying that a player you recently matched with got banned for toxic behaivour, what happened to that?","replies":[{"poster":"syncorolls","date":"2017-01-02T08:46:32.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I think i used to play against you in Twisted tree line along with My Little Pwny.
