I say this as someone who's been from the bottom of Bronze through all Elos up to there.\n\nToxicity is high in Bronze and Silver, it drops gradually in high Silver through Gold to low Plat, but then as you get to high Plat/low Diamond it spikes to extreme levels.","replies":[{"poster":"Headhunter Akali","date":"2015-08-28T02:30:07.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it less toxic in lower elos, that why i smurf. not because i can play better, but because its less toxic. \n\npeople play more for fun down in bronze-low silver, i dont know why though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2015-08-28T00:31:27.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know how you feel, plat-diamond can give you a headache.\nHowever my advice just chill and play the game, just play the best you can, and do what you can with out getting angry to make the best of the situation.\nits just not this elo either its every bracket .\n\nIm not sure what everyone else mentality towards this is but i just dont get upset about it. humans suck we are rude ignorant &amp; cruel.\nI just play the game chill talk to friends on skype listen to some good music and get on with it. If you lose then so be it say GG and re queue or if it has up set you or you notice your going on tilt do something else, maybe go out for lunch or to see a friend.\n\nIts ok to take the game seriously if you wanting to go pro or just focused on getting better or learning a new champ but all with in reason.\n\nAll in all, most people just need to chill and just do what you can in any given situation and if all else fails....
