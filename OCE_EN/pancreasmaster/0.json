I hope that the moderators and Administrators will delete any posts on here which are a) childish and b) misinformed and abusive.\r\n\r\nRiot has a problem. They are currently endorsing a culture of violence and abuse without punishment. For years, we have had a server here, which is highly utilised by the entire Oceanic community, and yet, after promises of &quot;A tribunal&quot;, we are still no closer to it now that when we started. \r\n\r\nI realise that there is significant interest in generating revenue, whilst maintaining the excellent standard of release of new characters, however, there is a toxicity brewing within the Oceanic community which will, in my educated opinion, result in the serious / grave injury or a real human. Other games have seen this occur, whereby Suicides have been directly linked (cited in a letter) as a significant cause of the distress of the victim. \r\n\r\nMy past experience with Riot has been lip service, paid through false words. I hope that I this thread will receive a reply, not from a community member, but from an honest to god, actual Riot employee. \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-06T01:14:31.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't it less than 2% of players are genuinely toxic, and the rest of what you see is just people kicking up a fuss over that? Something unbelievable like that.\n\nJust remember that one rotten egg stands out a lot more than eleven fresh ones.\n\nIn all honestly a red will probably never read this. There is a Tribunal being worked on, and we *might* see it by the end of this year. Until then, people will only be penalised by the report system, so make use of it.","replies":[{"poster":"PancreasMaster","date":"2015-04-06T02:02:50.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to see the research and qualitative data behind the \"2%\". Unfortunately, whilst there is a generally accepting community, there is, in my opinion, a significantly higher portion of players with the \"I cannot be punished, therefore I can say/do what I want\" mentality. \n\nAlso, you mentioned a \"Tribunal is being worked on\"... I have heard this line thrown out since the Oceanic servers were implemented. We are absolutely **NO** closer to having a Tribunal within the Oceanic community. What is your source behind this information? Is this merely a continuation of the current rumour? \n\nI sincerely hope that Riot actually does take the time to respond to this. There is a difference between ignoring a trolling/inflammatory child and the discussion of mature adults.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-06T02:15:08.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoops I didn't exactly phrase that right. It's not 2% of players being toxic, it's 2% of games include players that are toxic. [Here's the post about it, the information being near the end.](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/player-behavior-design-values-punishment) If you'd like to find where they pulled that number from, ask Lyte.\n\nSince there's ten players in every game, though, that still effectively means *way less* than 2% of players are toxic (around 0.2%).\n\nAs for the Tribunal, [here's the most recent news post about it](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/tribunal-oce). As you can see, it's one year old, so in general I don't think much progress has been made in recreating it.\n\nThing is, though, it's not limited to just OCE. [Check out this board discussion on the NA server.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IPYjre4K-tribunal-in-recess) The entirety of the Tribunal is being reworked to be bigger and better than ever! In the meanwhile, we just have automatic chat bans and Leavebuster.\n\nWhy we couldn't just have the old version of the Tribunal running while they worked on the new one is beyond me, though.\n\nPray unto the holy reds for salvation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
