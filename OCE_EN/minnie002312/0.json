I can fulfill jg or mid (although not as well but plausibly). However, I never can get my head around ADC (and top but i dont think I'll ever play top ._.). I try playing adc and never have I gotten a positive ratio. I always end up giving kills early and I have to struggle to catch back up in mid/late game. What am I doing wrong? Any advice for playing adc AND staying positve??

CS as in minion kills get as much as you can preferably more than the ADC CS like if I have 40 CS and the other enemy ADC has 30 its good.\n2. You will be fragile. Since you are building mostly ad and have little Amour and Magic Resist  try not to get ganked by other enemy champions and in teamfights stay at the back and harass the other champions especially the enemy ADC.\n3. Relating to number 1. Having those extra minion kills can mean getting those expensive AD items like Bloodthirster, Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancers etc much quicker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeeDab","date":"2014-12-12T04:39:09.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play support until you know the role inside out, then play adc.
