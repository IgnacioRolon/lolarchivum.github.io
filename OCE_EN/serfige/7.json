Even the 12 year olds (and you know they&#039;re 12 because you can hear them over voice chat) rage less than the average LoL player.\n\nThere are no reports for &quot;toxicity&quot;, nobody cares if someone called you a degenerate scumfuck bastard (because you probably are). Racism and sexism are rampant but nobody ragequits, nobody makes death threats or wishes cancer upon their teammates and, on the whole, everyone seems to be enjoying themselves a lot more. Rito would have you believe that the community is inherently &quot;toxic&quot; (stupid fucking term) and you need to suck the dick right out of your teammates&#039; pelvises to get anywhere but it&#039;s all bullshit. The only conclusions that are open are that LoL players are inherently more unstable than CSGO players (perhaps) or that Riot is actually making things worse, either with their stupid player behaviour initiatives or poor game design.\n\nIn conclusion, the CSGO competitive community puts you to shame with no player behaviour controls whatsoever. How does that make you feel?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-29T14:11:09.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I highly doubt what you're saying is true.\nI've played a lot of Counter Strike over the years, and it's community has never been anything short of brain dead.\n\nGo ahead, try suggesting a map other than Dust. You'll be ripped far worse than a noob in DOTA.\nTry suggesting that the AK-47 is a terrible gun.\nOr hell, try suggesting that only one member of your team gets an AWP instead of 90% of the team.\n\nAlso you're not very observant are you?\nValve encourages reporting more than Riot does.\nIf you step out of line in the Steam community you'll be facing a ban faster than any other system I've seen.\nHell, that's where I first saw the \"Oh but this isn't my account, report it if you want but it wont stop me\" crap that you see all the time. Sure enough thirty minutes later you'll see messages on your Steam profile of them raging at you because they got banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-11-29T15:14:00.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"See, this is exactly what I mean. You don't suggest a map, you queue specifically for the map/s you want. If you're playing casual and the team doesn't vote for the map you want to play next then just queue up for a match on the map you want to play. Your \"suggestion\" is just you trying to get other people to do what you want.\n\nWhy would you suggest the AK-47 is terrible? If it's terrible then don't use it. Nobody gives a fuck what you think about the AK-47. \n\nAnd, finally, if you try and tell your teammates how to play the game then you deserve to be told to fuck off.\n\nThis is all typical LoL player behaviour that isn't tolerated in CS. It shouldn't be tolerated in LoL either but LoL players are a bunch of whiny softcocks.\n\nReporting is for cheaters. Nobody reports you for saying naughty words or buying the wrong gun, nobody cares. Stop being such neckbeards.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T01:31:38.255+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"And see, this is how I know you're a 12 year old child, who is completely self entitled and has no idea about what community is, yet alone how it applies to online gaming.\n\nThere is swearing lightheartedly, and then there's being an utter %%%%. If you be an utter %%%% you deserve to get your arse ripped and banned.\nThat's how it's been all the way back to when online gaming started to take off.\n\nNow see back in the day when we typically had to search forums for people to play against in StarCraft, if you were a total douche lord in game people would note that on the forums and you'd never get another match.\n\nHow here's a little quiz for you, in TF2 it's very common for people to have casual conversations while they play. Community Servers end up with their own little niece communities of players.\nWhat happens to someone who goes out of their way to disrupt all this?\nOh right they get banned.\n\n\nOverall, no one wants a %%%% in their games, that's why this whole \"toxicity\" thing Riot goes on about exists.\nThe only reason you don't see it in CS:GO is because you're one of the %%%%s who spread it.\n\nTL;DR grow up kid.","replies":[{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-11-30T04:06:39.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-11-30T04:54:24.654+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"And there we have an insight into your life, and just how pathetic you actually are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
