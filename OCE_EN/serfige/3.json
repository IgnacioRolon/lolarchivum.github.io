As Riot Lyte said at the Season 6 World Finals. &quot;SKT have, once again, proven that their ability to complement the opposing team and be tolerant of other cultures is second-to-none, that&#039;s why they&#039;re being awarded the championship trophy before any matches are played. Their veganism and enforced policies of feminism and homosexuality have once again taken them to victory. But that&#039;s not all, in an effort to combat toxicity we&#039;ll be applying the same principles to solo queue. We want to send a message that you can&#039;t play our game unless you&#039;re a basket-weaving, quinoa-eating SJW. We want our players to be more bubble-wrapped than the most sheltered children in the world.&quot;\r\n\r\nWe understand that you must be excited about our new initiative but it will take us a while to weed out and ban the toxic elements in our community. First on the ban list are:\r\n\r\n- straight white college-educated males\r\n- people, otherkin and non-human identifying entities who don&#039;t render at least three complements per game to their teammates and opponents\r\n- players without at least one honor ribbon\r\n- players who use gender-specific pronouns\r\n- players who don&#039;t offer a sacrifice of ethically-grown kale to Lyte, the eponymous god of political correctness and warm fuzzy feelings, at least once per day\r\n- players who have been reported for having &quot;negative energy&quot;\r\n- players with normal testosterone levels or higher\r\n\r\nWe understand that there are far more players who could ruin your gluten-free positive vibe while playing and we will deal with them in due course. \r\n\r\nStay safe on the fields of gender-neutral justice and remember, if someone hurts your feelings it&#039;s always their fault and you should report them to us.\r\n\r\nRiot Serfige\r\nPlayer experience coordinator and head of anti-oppression operations","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-11-09T10:23:00.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mentioning of gender identity and otherkin. ill just not say anything","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-11-09T10:11:33.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is Riot impersonation and is bannable.","replies":[]}]}
