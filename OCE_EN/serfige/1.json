It's just the majority spoken language, it's like saying Spanish is the main language of America/Europe due to the crowding in Mexico/Spain\n\n          If anything, (There really isn't a main language IMO) the main language would be Japanese (I'm biased though because it's the language I'm learning), as I'd bet more people know about the word Kawaii than Kě'ài.\n\n         Literally, ask \"what is Asia\" in the internet and find the most stereotypical answer to be \n\n        \"Kawaii desu Anime, body pillows, otaku, tentacles, Hentai, rice (Okay this is most of Asia but still), sushi, etc. What else would you expect baka.\"\n\n         For the same reason, you'd get: \n\n        \"tea, biscuits, and the queen\" rather than 'tacos' when asking for a stereotypical interpretation of Europe.\n\nPS. I'm Asian, and make fun of my own race with my friends when the situation calls for it.\n\n\nMore on the topic, I seriously think the boards aren't the best, but it's because of the things they don't do that Reddit actually does. I'm going to make a thread on it soon, but chances are it might be downvoted until it never sees daylight because of what it'll be about","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-10T12:02:35.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I can make sense of it and it isn't racist of offensive I will up vote it.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-11-10T13:51:34.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No need to put your address on internet bud.
