Two of our current roster played together in a previous ranked team and achieved diamond in ranked 5&#039;s by the end of the season before the team disbanded and we are currently looking to repeat that success with a newer roster. Since the two who moved over (adc,supp) were mainly the shot callers as well we believe with the talented enough roster this should by no means be a hard goal to achieve.\r\nRequirements:\r\n- mic\r\n- a lot of free time since we play whenever we have 5 on\r\n- Willing to follow the meta (let you play champions you are godlike on tho)\r\nPlease message on here and add &#039;i am flawless&#039; to your friendslist and let him know that you are interested in the top lane position\r\nBTW please remember you arent the only one playing for the spot, so dont be disappointed if we dont pick you since there are a lot of talented individuals out there, and sometimes we just prefer someone who meshes well with the team even if you are in our eyes equally good mechanically and with game knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"RageBlade","date":"2016-03-25T08:06:45.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mr Flawless himself!

It would appear that someone has been telling some porky pies to Riot games regarding false accusation. Well now, why don't you prove your skill ^_^ it's been awhile since I've had a challenge.
