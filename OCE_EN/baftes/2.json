Had trouble closing it.","url":"https://youtu.be/b_LrwGH4nVU","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b_LrwGH4nVU/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ll try make this short as possible. I started a Rank/solo game which was all good.\r\n\r\nAs I got in the game my FPS was dropping down from 50 to 12-10 the whole game. unsure what the problem was I checked to see if i had anything running. After confirming league was only running I noticed the client and the game was using a huge proportion of my memory. Unsure what to do I continued to play till the end. Once the game ended I experienced another weird problem.. After they took out the nexus nothing else popped up.. and I was unable to get out of the game as shown in the video.. It lasted that long that i was able to download a program called (Hyper cams) and recorded the problem\r\n\r\nIn the video I show the following problems:\r\nI show my internet speed (if that could be a problem)\r\nI show the high usage of memory. (It kinda dropped a little after the game got to this part)\r\nI show what happened once I forced it closed in task manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n[](https://youtu.be/b_LrwGH4nVU)\r\n\r\nWhat was going on here and is this a common thing to happen. I never really experience lag at all in the game. This was a one time thing where my FPS was dropping like crazy and I have no idea why, Also the ending was super weird too..","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-10T04:48:40.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSeems like your game failed to display the \"Defeat\" text, I'm not sure why this happened but it seems the game completed as expected so I don't see an issue here.\n\nIs this a common experience for you?","replies":[{"poster":"Baftes","date":"2017-08-25T19:32:16.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about taking 4 months to reply to this but no it was a 1 time thing, also has been fixed now as the defeat or victory screen doesn't require you to click continue anymore as it's auto","replies":[]}]}]}
