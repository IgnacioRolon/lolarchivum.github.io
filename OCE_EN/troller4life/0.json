STOP THE BOTS. Add another report option to report as BOT or something. thanks.\n\nyea i see these almost everyday in AI.  I play a lot of AI as I'm trying to relearn a lot of the game since returning after a long lay off.  Sometimes they will just walk around spawn, others will walk around their tower.  Some will even act somewhat normally like the in game bots.  It doesn't take a genius to spot them.   Unfortunately I don't think many people report them.  People don't seem to care.  Maybe because they don't understand how things like that can seriously harm a game in the long run.","replies":[]}]}
