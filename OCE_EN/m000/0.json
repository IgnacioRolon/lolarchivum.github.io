Before patch 6.9 Gunblade would not go through wind wall as it was fired from the champion to the enemy as a bullet projectile. As of patch 6.9 Hextech Gunblade now zaps the enemy and most likely isn't considered a projectile anymore; like a lux ultimate.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM6T8zNQexU","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GM6T8zNQexU/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A demonstration of the new gunblade going _through_ Yasuo wind  wall in an online and private match. I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s intended or not due to how  the old  gunblade worked (as a gun) and how the new animation looks (as a lightning zap). other moves that are similar to the new gunblade are Lux&#039;s ultimate and Kennen&#039;s w, electrical surge.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-12T02:25:38.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windwall only blocks projectiles.\n\nNew gunblade isnt a projectile.\n\nProblem solved.","replies":[]}]}
