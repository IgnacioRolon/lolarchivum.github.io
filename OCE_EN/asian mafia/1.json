I knew a few people have wanted a new Illaoi, Taliyah and Aurelion Sol (add any other ones) but these are the champions which only have one skin. I know that it is up to Riot to decide but I personally would pay money for a new Kled skin.

That is by no means a rule of course, but thats the rate at which it seems to happen, and there are of course obvious exceptions _(Ekko got a new skin after a mere month, meanwhile Yorick has NEVER received a new skin in the history of league.)_\n\nMost people would agree that Illaoi is overdue a new skin _(Dunkmaster Illaoi would be my preference)_\n\nJhin recently got one so that crosses him off the new-champs list.\n\nAurelion Sol is new enough that a new skin isn't outright needed, but it he did get one, no one would mind because he has been around for a decent amount of time now (roughly a year) so a new skin wouldn't go amiss on him, and any skin released for the Star Dragon would be pretty well designed.\n\nTaliyah is still fairly new, she isn't in current need of a new skin, her Freljiord skin is a lot better that most other skins in its price range _(it even has new voice over lines)_ She is in the same situation as Sol, if she did get a skin, it wouldn't feel wrong, but she certainly isn't outdated enough to NEED one, and there are other champs more needing of a skin than her.\n\nKled and Camille on the other hand are still new enough that their novelty hasn't quite worn off. While skins for them would be really cool, I think there are other champions that would be more deserving of a new skin. (Yorick, Swain, Illaoi, etc)\n\nThats my view anyway.\nBut anything could happen, and I for one would not be opposed to a new Kled skin! _(although I live for the day that Sol and Taliyah get new skins :3)_","replies":[{"poster":"Asian mafia","date":"2017-04-09T01:16:33.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. It does start to make sense for me on how Riot does things when it comes to skins for new champions and what not. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-09T03:42:07.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh no one really knows how Riot chooses skins for champs.\nIt seems to have no visible logic to it apart from \"oh that would be cool on that champ, lets do that.\"\n\nThey don't want to force a champ to have a skin if they don't have a good idea for them _(which is fair enough)_. But unfortunately that leads to champs like Yorick never getting a skin, champs like Karthus getting 1 skin in the last 6 years, and Ezreal getting 1 skin every year. So while whatever system they have does work, its far from perfect.\n\nBut historically, new champs seem to get a skin roughly a year after release.\nBut i think there would be hundreds of really clever ideas for Kled _(as he is so unique)_, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if there was a Kled skin released in the not too distant future.\n\nWe can only hope ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-04-11T02:08:21.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's probably because they need to come up with original ideas XD \nthere is so much fanart out there, that if they used the idea of someone else, they could potentially be running into copyright restrictions >_<\nbut that's just my guess :P","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-11T03:01:15.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that as well at first.\nBut if you read the terms and conditions of the game, is states that you are **not allowed** to submit fan art to Riot, and if you do, they have the right to use it.\n\nSo its not that haha :P\n\nPlus Void Fizz, Bloodmoon Yasuo/Diana, Gravelord Azir, and others were all made by the community before Riot made them.\n\nDespite it being in the terms and conditions that they aren't allowed to look at our fan-art, (which is just to protect their asses). They do encourage artworks, and if the community begs for a skin, it's likely that some part of that skin will be incorporated into the game (Like Void Fizz)\n\nand in the case of Cosmic Reaver Kassadin, they asked the community for ideas.\n\nThats one of the reasons that makes Riot such a good community-based company, in my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
