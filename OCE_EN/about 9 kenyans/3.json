League of Legends is pretty broken what with tanks building full tank and still bursting people, unbalanced champions take ages to finally be nerfed (e.g Irelia), the terrible community but that's probably because its the biggest community.\n\n2. Dota 2 is also rather broken but that's because that's how the game is designed, everything is overpowered which for that game it works because of the way it was designed unlike LoL where overpowered champs just break the game, Dota is harder to learn, community is terrible there too.\n\n3. Who gives a shit about this game? It doesn't get any casual than this, its basic as fuck nothing high skill required, everyone shares things like gold and whatnot, teamfights all the time, new game so the community isn't so bad yet but lets be real its gonna be terrible just like the two mobas above.\n\n\nTake your pick, they're all pretty crap but you will keep playing them, hate LoL because of how fucking broken the game is and the terrible community but been playing for over two years, shits worse than smoking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-03-30T01:09:28.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play SMITE, TOME, HotS league is just the less broken one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enderlord12","date":"2015-03-29T20:51:08.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Heroes of the Storm is the best, and i don't think this because i was in the Alpha, Not saying this because i'm in the Beta.. and i'm not saying this because everyon int he Alpha didn't have to pay for the game... I love it because of the fact it's based around, quite possibly, my favorite set of fiction characters..\n\nHowever, League of Legends, is quite fun, just LOL is more addicting for me.","replies":[]}]}
