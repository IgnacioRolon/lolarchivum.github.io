Would you like to share your chat logs and we can go over them?\n\nAlso just to echo Seras, two wrongs dont make a right. If you want to call out someone for being racist just say \"Don't be racist\" no need for the extra unneeded word. We definitely don't support racism or any abusive/offensive comments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-28T07:58:01.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Abuse is abuse, doesn't matter who started it.

That's how pathetic the automated system is! Someone gets butthurt or simply feels the need to report you (we all know how childish people can be in league) and BAM, notch one up for verbal abuse.\n\nIt really pisses me off how Riot and people alike try and defend this automated system when it has more holes in it than swiss cheese! It can't detect sarcasm, it can't differentiate between simple friendly banter and alike, i'm 99% certain it cannot detect who the comment was aimed at even if it was in your own team chat and about the enemy player as I pointed out above. Not to mention people will constantly come up with new slang words etc to abuse you with that won't be picked up by the automated system.\n\nBut whatever, this game is perfect, the banning system is perfect and I'm just a salty noob.","replies":[]}]}
