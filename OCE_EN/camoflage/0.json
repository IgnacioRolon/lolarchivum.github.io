I keep getting a shaded screen during champ select that makes me unable to access the client. The only option i have is to run whatever my previous mastery/summoner spells with a champion if i am lucky enough to click one before i get shaded. This, if dodged, is giving me time penalties. Does this have something to do with the changeover to a new champ select or is the client just doing so because it knows that it is being replaced.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nCamOFlage","replies":[{"poster":"ilazygamer","date":"2016-01-14T17:27:42.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"something is wrong with the update.     \ni'm having the same issue windows 10. \n\nhttp://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b272/silva69/lolgreyscreenofdeath_zpszpmkikeo.png","replies":[]},{"poster":"iiPerfection","date":"2016-01-14T12:00:52.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/hprhLF4v-61-champion-select-bug-unable-to-select-champion-after-changing-summoner-spells) fam\n\ntl:dr it's getting fixed","replies":[]},{"poster":"IodineAwesome","date":"2016-01-14T11:51:50.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has happened to me several times now and it is sooo frustrating!! It doesn't just happen before games for me either it happens after them too. I now have to wait 15 minutes to play another game because I have had to close so many games! The screen just goes blurry and I cant do anything but close league :( This has only just happened after I updated the client this morning.
