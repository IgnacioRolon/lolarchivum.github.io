Five entrants who beat our scores would be randomly selected to receive the KD/A skin and champion of their choice.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a humbling experience as we were almost immediately crushed and better scores continued to flow in over the following weeks.\n\nHere are the lucky winners and their prize:\n\nShadowKnoight - K/DA Evelynn\n(Expert Score: 512910)\n\nBlueThunder14 - K/DA Akali\n(Expert Score: 486113)\n\nXshadow - K/DA Akali\n(Expert+ Score: 579152)\n\nLuka - K/DA Akali\n(Expert+ Score: 732743)\n\nBrianGod - K/DA Kai&#039;Sa\n(Expert Score: 510957)\n\nWinners should see the skin (and the champion if they needed it) on their account immediately.\n\nAdditionally, players who submitted the top 10 Expert+ scores have received a Mystery Icon. We couldn&#039;t NOT reward such kickass performances:\n\nthank u go next - 804366\nRiphtrox - 770462\nLuka - 732743\nShinsoo - 680316\nXPegasusX - 668812\nRashays - 667911\nNepInMyNip - 638550\nEjay - 613633\nAxiis - 587901\njohno48 - 580755\n\nGGWP all.","replies":[{"poster":"Luka","date":"2019-01-09T09:34:42.494+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys <3\nNeedless to say I was very pleasantly surprised when my two of my most played games decided to have a collab event out of nowhere!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2019-01-08T04:32:40.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GG, and cheers to the player with the name \"thank u go next\" ðŸ˜‚","replies":[]}]}
