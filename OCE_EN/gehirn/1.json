Was it based on past results or potential results? I know RTT in NA always suffered from a really low player base (mostly comprised of older players who started playing with all the game modes back in in S1/2) but lots of Bronze players were taking it up as an easier way to get the Silver or Gold Summoner Icons. Perhaps this could be used to incentivise new players - different season rewards for RTT?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-13T10:20:10.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Gehirn,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=BX05N9lh,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2016-07-13T07:46:46.118+0000)\n>\n> We recently re-assessed releasing Ranked TT, looking at OCE and larger regions currently running the queue.

As a newer player maybe a throwback gamemode would be fun, like a gamemode that uses maps from really early seasons (I really want to try out green buff and the old twisted treeline) with really old items. Doesn't need to be balanced, people would just have fun playing on different maps with different and unusual build options like force of nature, heart of gold, wriggles lantern, ect... Nostalgia and you don't even need to retexture the map really. Let it look old and crappy because it will help build appreciation for the new map textures and I'm sure just as many people would enjoy the old look of the map as much as the new one.\n\nThis new gamemode would require some work but probably less than nexus siege and would most likely be better received. (I have never seen people act more toxic than in nexus siege, like people in ascenion, urf or even definitely not dominion are chill but not nexus siege) so it would simply involve digging up some old backups of the textures and items and fitting them in. I'm sure there would be some broken combos with new champs and reworks and old items with new masteries but I feel that would be half the fun of it.\n\nYou could even give it a 'time' theme and tie it together with zilean and ekko somehow for thematic presence.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2016-07-22T02:08:59.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why did we go back to back on Nexus Siege?
