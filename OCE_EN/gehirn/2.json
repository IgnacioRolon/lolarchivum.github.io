This has led to poor matchmaking and higher queue times for Ranked TT, especially at higher MMR&#039;s.\n\nAt the same time, many consistent players of TT Normal Blind have either stopped playing TT or moved over to playing mostly TT Ranked Flex. This has helped sustain TT Ranked Flex somewhat and this is partly why we&#039;ve waited so long to make these changes, but it has massively reduced the quality of games in TT Normal Blind.\n\nTo restore the quality of games for both TT Normal and Ranked, we&#039;re reducing the number of nights that both queues are available and moving Normal Blind to one of the more popular nights of the week. Specific changes are:\n\nTT Normal Blind:\n- No longer available on Tuesday and Wednesday nights\n- Now available on Friday nights from 3 PM AEDT to 1 AM AEDT (AEST after March 31st)\n\nTT Ranked Flex:\n- No longer available on Thursday and Friday nights\n- Still available on Saturday and Sunday nights from 3 PM AEDT to 1 AM AEDT (AEST after March 31st)\n\nThese changes will take effect starting next week.","replies":[{"poster":"PepikCz0","date":"2018-03-29T06:03:44.281+0000","up_votes":16,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand queue health has been very poor lately, and these changes are supposed to help the short term queue health of the mode, and i appreciate that it is now on weekends + Friday rather than Tuesday - Friday when no one could play, an improvement over last year. However i am sure we would all like to see the queue return to a 7 day status and the only way that can happen is if we bring more players into the mode. I believe going straight to cutting queue times is very counterproductive and lazy on riots part. There are so many options to be explored before resorting to this. \n\nAdvertise The Queue!\nThe amount of times i have heard \"when is ranked 3s on\" or \"i didn't know 3s was ranked\" etc. is absurd.. nobody knows when it is on, and there is no indicator to show whether it is ranked or normals before they get into the lobby. Not everyone checks the boards for queue schedules, there needs to be a notification within the client that tells people when Twisted Treeline is active. Maybe even a greyed out icon that when hovered over will display the queue times. Just add something... anything in the client to tell people when TT is up.\n\nIncentivise the players and engage with the community first!\nI like the Twisted treeline dedicated victorious chroma last season it was a great idea. But it is not enough. Where are the champion shards from twisted treeline? And we are still yet to see any physical challenger rewards for the top players.\nRiot added missions for a reason. Twisted treeline dedicated missions, will give players a reason to try the game mode, and could spark some interest and bring in new players. What about double XP weekends or 3v3 tournaments.\n\nBots!\nI know, I know, another queue is the last thing we want for healthier queue times. However introducing players to twisted treeline from the beginning would help new players gain interest in the mode, too many players reach level 30 without ever seeing the game mode.\n\nFix the LP for high ELO players!\nThere is zero incentive, scratch that.. negative incentive for competition amongst high ELO players. When no matter what, they lose more lp than they gain, often gaining 1-15 and losing 30-50 and even in a 3 challenger vs 3 challenger team it was +12 -25 so it is never worth playing against someone unless you have a 90% chance of winning the game. This effect is exaggerated when challenger/master players like Bma start smurfing, and then they get +3 -30 for win/loss vs challenger players.\n\nFix the game mode!\nHonestly, as much as i hate to say it, as fun as twisted treeline is, it is broken. There is such a massive gap between low ELO and high ELO players in the mode. This is mainly due to the meta. Low ELO players just do not know, do not understand, or straight up refuse to learn the meta. People do not understand that twisted treeline is an entirely different mode than summoners rift. Just look at the ladder, there are platinum solo queue players in Diamond/Challenger 3s, and Challenger solo queue players who don't get out of gold 3s. Even Riot players refuse to play the meta.\n\nI would like to see Altars removed and perhaps the health relic replaced by a neutral monster for junglers to fight over along with the slight widening of the map. Or even reduce the starting gold, so that support meta cannot clear as quickly. And not being able to walk to vile maw without being within turret range is pretty dumb. \n\nI am sure there are many other options, just ask the player base! Create an open forum for rioters and players alike to discuss the mode freely, offer suggestions, communication is key!","replies":[{"poster":"Bma","date":"2018-03-29T12:00:21.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason I smurf is because it's a waste of time to play on my main during certain parts of the day. My solo experiences go something like this:\n\n- Is Fince/Maximo/Vigilis/Zenith etc trio queueing with each other?\n- If yes, I will pop into them\n- I will lose 3 lp (same amount as a dodge btw)\n- I get 2 silver players on my team vs 3 challengers (this is both silver in SR Ranked and TT Ranked, btw)\n- Almost impossible to win (90% chance to lose at least)\n- Waste of queue time, and then I have to play out an inevitable 15 minute loss\n\nIf I don't pop them, then they're in queue for 1-2 hours. \n\nIronically, this is also the reason why all of those guys  duo/trio all the time.\n\nIn the end, the problem is duo/trios at Master Tier + in particular. I think people should be allowed to play with friends, but unfortunately \"healthy queue' and \"duo/trio queue at master +\" are mutually exclusive.\n\nAll these suggestions about 'lowering queue times' is misguided. You can't 'lower the queue times' without considerably destroying the experience of non high elo players. The end result is the destruction of the queue. You can't have a high elo without the pyramid base that is the low elo players.\n\nSimilarly, it makes no sense to adjust lp gains. 3 lp is the fair amount to give a 3 man challenger premade that defeats unranked/gold/silver players.\n\nAnd as a side note, almost the entire challenger ladder refuses to queue up when I actually do 3 man with Emph/Zorenous and Nelis. So it's not like I can premake anyway because everyone is too scared to play. Fince and Maximo are like the only 2 good players in the current Challenger Ladder and they won't even play with any of the other 4 players in the Challenger Ladder as a trio vs ours. Maybe before players like LemonMD shit talk me, maybe they should try to queue against my 3 man with theirs. Except they won't, because they're too scared of losing.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Morphz1","date":"2018-04-05T02:45:56.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Griefing Account","date":"2018-04-05T03:44:04.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"stop the support meta \" \n\n\nYes because playing meta is the problem ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯   it isn't  because people are \"big brain players \" and do play  \"Jungle \" which offers them nothing ..\n\n\nSmitecarry metta is optimal , It's like going into summoners rift and playing duo top and bot with no jungler .. it makes no sense  , Why would anyone think farming 3 camps is a good thing .. ? \n\n\nand ganking is super weird too considering you can see them from either lane they come in ... the whole concept of jungle meta is just weird .","replies":[{"poster":"BladeFrenzy","date":"2018-04-05T08:23:07.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZedShot,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=b4EUvoMX,comment-id=0005000100020000,timestamp=2018-04-05T03:44:04.270+0000)\n>\n> It&#x27;s like going into summoners rift and playing duo top and bot with no jungler ..\n\nI think a better analogy would simply be both bot laners trying to farm bot lane. essentially pre-season 1 double bruiser bot meta. which was immediately replaced by the marksman + support bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Griefing Account","date":"2018-04-05T10:30:44.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless, jungling is just inefficient.\n\n\nWhenever you play supmeta into big brain casual players, they're alway going to call you a tryhard when you're slapping them or a noob u tell them jungles bad .","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"U4Kell","date":"2018-03-29T08:38:01.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PepikCz0,realm=EUNE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=b4EUvoMX,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-03-29T06:03:44.281+0000)\n>\n Advertise The Queue!\n> The amount of times i have heard &quot;when is ranked 3s on&quot; or &quot;i didn&#x27;t know 3s was ranked&quot; etc. is absurd.. nobody knows when it is on, and there is no indicator to show whether it is ranked or normals before they get into the lobby.\n\nactually they have added that now, it shows up the same as SR below the icon.

Maybe setting a rank matchmaking 'limit' could help with the poor matchmaking, and cause challengers to not be able to match against or with players that are below a certain rank, (say d5 for example), and forcing challengers to solo queue would also be great for the health of matchmaking.

Some players only realizing that TT Ranked was available in OCE after ranked rewards were announced last year is proof of that, and it's guaranteed to be the case this year if there are TT specific rewards again.\nWe used to put messages in the alert ticker (little exclamation point next to Play button) but these can go unnoticed and should be reserved for when issues are occurring so that we don't dilute the importance of the alert ticker tool.\n\nWe also tried weekly news posts that also appeared in client which stated TT was \"available now\". But a lot of players who commented on those posts voiced that they didn't care about TT, and the amount of notice those news posts got decreased quite rapidly. (If the same thing frequently appears in the same spot in the client, you begin to ignore it, same with the alert ticker). Also, the queue did not show a sustained increase in interest after a while of these posts being a regular thing.\n\nWe've explored other options such as the gold highlights that used to appear for RGM queues, but it turns out that that would require development work which can't reasonably be prioritized.\n\nOutside of exploring low-effort options like this, it sadly isn't viable to expend a lot of time on big promotions or in-game events solely to get TT more attention.\n\nGetting players' attention about modes that they are hesitant to even look at is quite the challenge, and if they already prefer the other modes then who are we to tell them to play TT instead?\n\nAll that being said, in Ocean Week 2016 and 2017 we promoted TT by having two days with double points given for wins in TT.

You probably didn't see any issues, and it is possible that this change will only give a minor improvement to your experience. But for players in much higher or lower MMR's the queue times were significantly longer and matchmaking was terrible (Challengers matched with or against Gold or lower, for example).\n\nIdeally, we should have made these changes earlier in the year when we first started noticing a serious decline in number of TT players and before too many players had their quality of TT experience decline so much, as it likely drove them away from the queue. If we had waited longer to make these changes, it is likely even you would have started noticing longer queue times and more lopsided matchmaking.","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil","date":"2018-04-13T05:25:34.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find this amusing though - myself and half a dozen friends stopped playing league when the queue times for TT got cut.\nPretty hard to play it competitively 1 night a week.
