We&#039;re looking into this now and will hopefully have an update for you here soon.\n\nUPDATE 18:39 - One of our content delivery networks seems to be the source of the problem. We've since disabled the use of this particular CDN and seeing players able to log in again.\nOnce we've confirmed that this CDN has resolved the issues on their end we will re-enable them, but players should be able to login just fine now.\n\nUPDATE 22:43 - New Zealand players were still experiencing this issue until recently, we made another change a little while ago to rectify and this seems to have solved it for almost every player. We've since confirmed this is a global issue and still working on the primary source of the problem so there may be a few players who experience trouble until the primary CDN is back online.","replies":[{"poster":"ASIS","date":"2018-10-02T08:37:16.586+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your prompt response ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ray Hudson","date":"2018-10-02T11:18:39.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still can't log in :( I've tried restarting my pc & running the client as admin but still have the same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lata Bich","date":"2018-10-02T09:42:33.571+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still getting same issue?
