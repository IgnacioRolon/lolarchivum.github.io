Here are a few steps that may resolve the issue for you:\n\n1) If you have recently upgraded to Yosemite (OSX 10.10), you may need to complete a fresh re-installation of League of Legends on the new 10.10 version.\n\n2) Make sure that your connection is stable. If you are on wifi, disable this and connect directly to your router via wired Ethernet Cord. In addition, make sure to try all of the steps in our Connection Troubleshooting Guide.\n\n3) Some players have reported that [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/8b0EJ8nP-mac-wont-open-dec-3-2014-fix) trick has succeeded in opening the client.\n\nIf you're still having issues I recommend that you lodge a support ticket [here](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new).","replies":[{"poster":"BAP Kpop Zelo","date":"2015-01-11T09:10:47.528+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I cant redownload because the download link isnt working.....","replies":[{"poster":"CNxK1e1n","date":"2015-01-11T18:00:49.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here...page can't open...tell me why.....","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-01-12T01:55:15.119+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi guys,\n\nWhat link are you using?","replies":[{"poster":"Gurdurr","date":"2015-01-12T05:49:48.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This one doesn't work: \n\nhttps://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload","replies":[{"poster":"LittleTall","date":"2015-01-16T05:42:19.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same one im using here, wont work","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sitris111","date":"2015-02-21T07:07:52.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me too but i waited like a few weeks or months before i was able to download the launcher again but now im getting the stupid message of \"Unspecified error occurred.

Looking further into this I found that people have been suggesting a DNS hotfix. I tried this it but nothing changed. I also tried uninstalling and re-installing but upon clicking the 'DOWNLOAD GAME Oceania, Windows' button it failed to redirect me to the link to download the installer for the patcher (see attachment). \n\nI think that this DNS problem for connecting to http://l3cdn.riotgames.com/ is directly linked with the RADS error for starting the patcher (also riot support website doesnt seem to connect and comes up with same DNS problem). I managed to find a LoL installer from a third party website and it installed, but when I opened the patcher it came up with the same RADS error. \nCould your team at riot look into this?\n\nDetails about the RADS error: clicking on the shortcut to start league (even with 'Run as Administrator') promptly leads me to an error saying:\n\"Could not connect to the HTTP server. Please check that your Internet connection is enabled and that your firewall is not blocking access.\"\n\nNote: I am using windows 7 so I don't think this is an OS problem.","replies":[{"poster":"LittleTall","date":"2015-01-16T05:50:10.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL i just found the solution, works for me. this is from FatNinja12345  \n\nThis i am pretty sure is the windows instructions but just in case you guys arent too sure what i did was:\n1.

When I was on 5.1 before the RADS errors AGAIN, my client would not reopen after any of my matches (even tried clicking the riot logo from the \"show hidden icons\" at the right of the windows task bar). I noticed that when I rebooted my league client I had to reboot twice for it to work. When finally logged in I noticed that my status from the previous client instance didnt save. Not sure if this is relevant to my current RADS error problems. My RADS errors returned after I tried closing the client without having played a match first (to try and update my status properly).\n\nNot sure if this information is of any use to you in solving my client issues.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lilium Ashes","date":"2015-01-14T06:41:18.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly the same problem I have on my Macs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BAP Kpop Zelo","date":"2015-01-13T08:32:45.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please help me.
