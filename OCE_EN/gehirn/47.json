We&rsquo;ll be continuing with general balance patches as the need arises and prepping for the 8.17 release.\n\nSpeaking of 8.17, we&#039;ll be shipping a larger update than a micropatch. Some of the changes we&#039;re working on are:\nMap changes (with a scuttle crab in the bottom lane)\nSome new events\nA new reward\nA new item\nNumerous system changes\n\nPlease share here any feedback you have on Nexus Blitz regarding anything at all, and we&#039;ll pass it on to the team developing the mode.
