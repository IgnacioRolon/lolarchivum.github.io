The Transfer Service has been down since early November, and Player Support agents have been unable to process any transfers manually due to this. We&rsquo;ve disabled the option to purchase account transfers in the store for the time being while we work on a long-term fix.\r\n\r\nWe know this is pretty terrible timing; we&rsquo;re right in the middle of the holiday season, and a lot of us use the service this time of year. While we continue to troubleshoot this issue, it&rsquo;s looking like a fix won&rsquo;t be possible until February, at which point the service will be back up and you&rsquo;ll be able to transfer your account normally again.\r\n\r\nWe faced a similar issue with account transfers around this time last year and it&rsquo;s clear that this can&rsquo;t keep happening; it&rsquo;s absolutely a frustrating situation, and if you&rsquo;ve been affected by it we sincerely apologize. In the meantime, we&rsquo;re committed to finding and fixing the root cause of the problem, and will keep you updated as that progresses.","replies":[{"poster":"Hatsu027","date":"2018-12-16T09:15:34.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until february, unbelievable what a good transfer service hah {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DKF6","date":"2018-12-15T00:57:49.134+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a very long time to have an important service down for...\n\nI hope there will be free transfers to and from OCE when they do come back up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talonted","date":"2018-12-17T16:30:21.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so i have to wait almost 4 months total to transfer my main back from brazil?\nyeah not acceptable riot {{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]}]}
