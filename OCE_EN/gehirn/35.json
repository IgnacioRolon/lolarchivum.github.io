The image below breaks down the new size settings per region:\r\n\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/OcAbyYQ\r\n\r\nThis change was effective as of Challenger tier promotion becoming available. So Summoner's Rift Ranked Solo/Duo and Flex went from 200 Challenger slots each to 50 slots each in Oceania.\r\n\r\nBut what about Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex?\r\nTT Ranked has had 6 Challenger slots available [since early 2017](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/oTA7PnYT-twisted-treeline-ranked-flex-updated-11th-april-2017). But as of this season, **TT Ranked now also has 50 Challenger slots available.**\r\nWhereas previously the amount of slots was limited based on the size of the queue relative to SR Ranked Solo/Duo, given that Oceania has effectively gone from 406 Challenger slots available across all queues to only 150, it's possible that there may be more interest from and competition between players attempting to earn a Challenger spot in any one of the OCE ranked ladders.\r\n\r\nHere's a refresher on the other unique settings that exist for OCE TT Ranked Flex:\r\n\r\nOCE TT Ranked Flex is available on Saturday and Sunday evenings from 15:00 to 01:00 AEDT.\r\nMaster to Challenger tier - Each game played grants 4 \"banked\" days of no LP decay, up to a maximum of 16 days saved up.\r\nDiamond IV - I: The number of days before a promo series expires has been increased to 8.\r\nDiamond IV to Challenger: Premade teams are restricted to Solo/Duo only (no 3 player premade teams).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're wondering about the general state of ranked, particularly among the apex tiers (Master, Grandmaster, Challenger), then [check out the latest Dev Corner post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/voxV8l2u-ranked-2019-dev-update-3) from SapMagic.","replies":[{"poster":"Rito POS Client","date":"2019-04-01T00:44:20.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are going to open it up to 50 slots can you then increase the window that TT is available? The queue is never going to build if ranked is available for 2 half days, \"new\" players to TT won't want to invest in something that has such limited availability.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-01T09:07:05.748+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"But if you open it up too much queue health drops, which in turn lowers the population of players as they move away from the unbalanced mode, which leaves you worse off than you started even if you drop the queue back to what it was because you have less players. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nBasically, you need more population before you can expand the queue, but you need to expand the queue to increase the population, hence the conundrum. \n\nThey did have it up for more days relatively recently, but the extra population dropped off so they had to pull back the days before it started affecting queue health. Ultimately, it's up as much as can be supported right now.","replies":[]}]}]}
