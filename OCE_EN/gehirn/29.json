Drop them a question in this thread to find out what goes into keeping OCE Rioters happy and productive, which country is the hardest to get pro players into, or how to fix a leaky roof.\r\nWeirdyBeardy is also joining us, who can sate your curiosity around how we take LoL&#039;s huge publishing pipeline and distribute the contents across all of our channels OCE (lol.com, client, lolesports, social media etc) (Also, WeirdyBeardy shaved their beard off for charity recently, we weren&#039;t ready for that)\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAchenar, Madplumerian and Smoothie - The Talent Team\r\n\r\nWe form the Talent Team for the Oceanic office. The Talent team is responsible for all the behind-the-scenes work that supports the Riot Sydney team - all the facilities and services that other companies would refer to as &#039;HR&#039;. As a result we know all the Sydney team&#039;s secrets - from their favourite snacks to their life goals. Without us, the team sits in the cold dark, starving and confused. ;)\r\n\r\nMadplumerian has been with Riot Sydney since the very first days of the office - Smoothie has just joined our team last week. You may know Smoothie from that time she took second place in the Music Cover Contest!\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAchenar\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a part of the Talent Team, I&#039;m also the delivery manager for projects like Rift Rivals or the OPL Finals. For this I take care of all the project management and event production, and overall trying to make sure our events are the coolest possible.\r\n\r\nAs a passion project I also run Oceania&#039;s fanart, fanfic, and cosplay community programs.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be finishing up at Riot Sydney at Christmas time as I&#039;m moving to the USA for a few years - so want to use the opportunity here to say a huge thank you to the community for their passion and creativity. You guys rock, and I&#039;ll miss you!\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nWeirdyBeardy\r\n\r\nAs the Head of Publishing for League of Legends in Oceania, it&#039;s my responsibility to ensure that players in the region get a regular flow of content and experiences that keep League fresh and exciting. I work with the teams in LA (such as the creators of Odyssey and K/DA) to publish their content in Oceania, and work with teams locally (such as the OPL or our League Partner Program) on anything from content creation to marketing and promotions.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-12-07T08:43:25.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And once again:\n\nEbon Hawk or Millennium Falcon","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-12-11T05:13:18.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, you've totally hit an entire group of non-Star Wars fans this time!

Every time I announce a contest, or when we open the doors to an event like Rift Rivals or OPL Finals - the sheer adrenaline of being able to create and share an experience with you guys is like nothing else I've ever done. It's terrifying (because what if we mess it up???) but so rewarding as well.\n\nAnd the job totally scales to however many Rioters are around at the time - because one person starts changing the bulb, another jumps in to help, another has a creative idea about how to do it better...someone starts memeing about it on Twitter... ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Shywolf","date":"2018-12-11T10:33:45.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive only been playing for 5ish months my fav champ atm is probably Leona {{champion:89}}","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-12-11T21:12:44.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leona is a total badass, that's a great pick :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WeirdyBeardy","date":"2018-12-11T05:13:44.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, my fave (some would say 'only') champ is Caitlyn. \n\nThe best part of my job is the variety, my background is in the creative side of things, so being able to work across anything from content to video to design to animation to [recreating Summoner's Rift IRL and building giant statues of Baron](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/08/red-post-collection-gamescom-2014.html)...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smoothie","date":"2018-12-11T04:58:51.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shaewolf!\n\nSmoothie:\nYes, I do play League of Legends, any spare time I have is comprised of it.
