However I cannot find data on the total amount of ranked players on TT in OCE (You guys will have this information). Since there are like 12 players in diamond and 6 players in chall on the TT currently I'd assume theres only like 2000-3000 players (GENEROUSLY) ranked in TT so 2000-300*0.14% = 3 challanger slots.\n\nTo be honest 6 is excessive statistics wise, I highly doubt you should raise it even higher in the future. People asking for more slots are the people who just want to make sure they get their rank easier and lock it in without trying. I hope you do reconsider making the slots higher.\n\nRealistically there should only be 1-3 slots for Challanger Tier in TT on OCE, the issue is more of catching up to the players with enormous LP who are just banking the slots.\n\nTL;DR 6 slots is too many statistically I'd be cautious raising the cap even higher! Don't make TT a dump queue for people to just get an \"easy\" rank!","replies":[{"poster":"zham8787","date":"2017-04-13T09:52:03.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In addition I read the posts on the other thread all the people scared of the limit are the ones who are challanger and want to retain their rank so they are all highly bias.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-04-11T14:09:00.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully we'll see better health in the queue soon, I am not a fan of the inconsistency bringing Plat+ players into my Silver games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iliketurtle","date":"2017-10-11T19:12:44.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for riot.

I would have loved to have played this but I had no idea the queue still existed after the mistake at the beginning of the season where the queue was up everyday and it got taken down. Just ditch normal 3s and let us play ranked.","replies":[]}]}
