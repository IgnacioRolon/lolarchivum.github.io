Though Nexus Blitz&#039;s run is coming to a close, we still want your thoughts! At this point, everyone&#039;s had several weeks to explore the mode and formulate opinions beyond first impressions; we&#039;d love to hear about how your experience has changed and evolved since the alpha started.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-09-07T00:37:00.671+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"> UPDATE:\n> **CHAMP SELECT BAN TESTING IN OCE**\n> We'll be testing bans in Oceania from now through Monday morning Oceanic time. Though our intent for Nexus Blitz is to avoid an atmosphere of strict competitiveness, bans have been one of the most common requests we've seen across regions—so much so that they're at least worth testing! **This isn't a guarantee that theoretical future versions of Nexus Blitz will have bans**; like everything else in the alpha, we're just experimenting to see what _could_ work.","replies":[{"poster":"Zoedorable","date":"2018-09-08T10:44:00.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Please no. It's supposed to be a quick join a game, pick what you want and just play mode. I have 160+ games in Nexus Blitz and haven't seen any champions picked fairly often besides maybe Pyke, and I would much rather have you guys just balance down champions with base stat nerfs that you have already been doing instead of adding bans.\n\nAlso with how hated some champions like Yasuo, Zed, Zoe, etc are it would essentially prevent people who main those champions from enjoying the game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2018-09-09T09:31:20.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can't play more than one champion, then that's your problem if they get banned.\n\nA ban system will deal with some of the bullshit the super heavy snowballing champions cause.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ændrider","date":"2018-09-08T15:47:31.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that by nerfing their base stats just for one game mode adds more of a mess to coding, there's no need to nerf any champion just because one game mode just because they happen to be broken that game mode. it's the whole reason urf is now arurf and why bans are in oneforall. Some things are just not fun or healthy to play against. \n\nMyself, i'd welcome bans. It'd be less buggy than nerfing base stats.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thighdeology","date":"2018-09-05T08:01:41.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"1. I never knew we had a feedback board for this, maybe a post in the news section would help gain attention (or something after nexus blitz game?)\n\n2.

I've seen nothing to indicate that a ranked Blitz would perform any better in the long run.\n\nShort term certainly it would likely thrive, but as people settled into their ranks and stopped playing, it would fall into the same limbo of not enough players to have accurate matchmaking meaning noones rank is accurate meaning even if the population increases MM is unbalanced and therefore not fun meaning the population won't grow.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Definitive S","date":"2018-09-06T20:12:37.883+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an awesome map, definitely fast paced and interesting buffs keep the action flowing.

I tried him around the release and he was beaten by almost every one. it would be a great help to help improve it as certain junglers are really strong champions like kha'zixs rengar are really powerful whilst tanks like maokai and malphite are also really strong. further more on the laning note and specific characters Daruis is really powerful and impossible to deal with due to the fact that he can use the flair in this mode for free attack speed and damage whilst healing him self with his Q not only that he can built full tank for less damage even with the negative of taking extra damage and a lot of his damage is AOE and allows him to team fight doing spread damage to every one he can also snow ball and solo carry him self hope this was a help just putting my opinion out there just thoughts on characters that just dominate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XeMurder","date":"2018-09-09T09:34:55.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest issue I have with this mode is the damn fire buff.\nIt doesn't make the games any faster, it just means that if someone like Trynd get it, they will win.\nFor a gamemode which is hard-capped at ~20 minutes, creating a buff which makes the already winning team even more opressive just subtracts from the fun of it.\n\nAlso, why do the death timers have to be so bloody insane late-game?\nBeing locked out of the game for over a minute, when the game only lasts 20, is rediculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AimAssist","date":"2018-09-08T11:20:26.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can Kayn not get locked out of the other transformation? or at least shorten it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jack Dalt","date":"2018-09-08T07:53:28.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think Rift Herald should be so powerful. It ends the game on its own when the game already ends on its own usually 5 minutes later or so. I get the point is to make the game a fast paced brawl fest but its actually impossible to deal with the sieging power sometimes, and it makes it so the team with herald doesn't even need to fight. The swarms of baron minions + herald himself are more powerful than the 5 champions with the buff, and getting strangled out like that in this mode just feels awful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"corylulu","date":"2018-09-08T01:18:51.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My feedback:\n\n1. Catapult is way too strong for it to persist for the whole game with no cooldown. I think there are a few things that could be done to balance it though: You could cap the number of times a player can use it, you could make it so you can only jump to areas where you had vision (or make it like teleport and require you target a friendly target), you could disable it during events, you could put a timer on it, or something like that to better limit it's OP-ness.\n\n2. Caitlyn's Blessing needs to either do less damage or have some way to know when you are about to be targeted more easily... being randomly targeted by 2 at once when you are 50% health is super dumb... It's a death sentence for a squishy... \n\n3. Events need to be pingable from tab page, like other timers. And Sudden Death needs to be its own timer so it can be pinged independently. Sudden death should also have a more pronounced 30 second warning. Just about every Sudden Death I play in, someone dies right before and doesn't realize it was Sudden Death.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nabura","date":"2018-09-07T22:07:21.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I had to say one thing, it'd have to be to decrease the chance of getting the blessing of Janna, there's nothing more boring than getting a bit of mana/health regen for an action-packed game mode.

I think the way the bans are is a good balance. Doesn't feel as competitive since you don't pick one at a time afterwards and it seems to pass quicker. I like that more events were released as time went on. I really like the idea of having a number of different 'loot' champions and 'bardle royal' conditions. Appreciated the addition of the scuttle crab, could a second be added between Herald and red buff? \n\nAs someone else said junglers often just stay in lane. if another thing with impact on the game was added to the upper half of the map that could change that? be it an extra camp or two, a different buff. maybe even some way to take the jungle tower or some reward for managing to do it perhaps. Overall I have really enjoyed the game mode","replies":[]}]}
