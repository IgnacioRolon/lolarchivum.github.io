If you don&rsquo;t get a notification, then you&rsquo;re already good -  and if the notification is annoying, then verify your email and we&rsquo;ll stop nagging.\r\n\r\nAs the first region to test this new flow we would love your thoughts on how well it works and if there are any improvements we can make.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPlayer Support &amp; Security","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-29T05:05:13.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so people with duel account or more on the same email will not be banned or deleted? asking for a friend","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T07:49:25.768+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=00shots00,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=3E8WROON,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2018-01-29T05:05:13.550+0000)\n>\n> so people with duel account or more on the same email will not be banned or deleted? asking for a friend\n\nAsking for self, pretending he has friends. ;)","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-29T21:18:24.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what are friends?
