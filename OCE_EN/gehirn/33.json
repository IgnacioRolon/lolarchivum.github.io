Over the last weeks and months, we’ve heard your feedback that it feels rough to be knocked down to Honor 0 or 1 by a chat restriction in the closing days of the season, so we’ll be offering a one-time only re-grant of in-game rewards in February 2019.\n\n**There are important conditions that affected players must meet to re-earn their rewards.** So for all the important details and answers to some likely questions, [check out the post on the Dev Corner over on NA Boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/TGYs0hwO-2018-end-of-season-rewards-and-honor).","replies":[{"poster":"Neeko Neeko Ne","date":"2018-11-14T01:44:14.761+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is just like saying those that demoted from Gold V in the last week of the season can get Victorious Orianna if they get Gold IV in February.\n\nIf someone couldn't put in the effort to uphold the Summoner's Code, even for a few days, then they don't deserve to be rewarded as if they had. If they want Honour and Season rewards, either they should have been honourable in the first place or they simply have to try again next year.\n\nAll this does is lessen the quality and the achievement for those of us who are honourable, or worked hard to get Honour 2+ after falling to Honour 0 or 1 earlier in the season.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-14T02:42:38.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My best guess as to why they are doing this for this season is because there has been a rather large jump in the eligibility requirements.\n\nIt used to be that only an active chat restriction on season end would prevent you from earning ranked rewards, whereas in this system a chat restriction earned a month of two ago can also prevent you from earning rewards (ban timelines are similar to the old eligibility requirements).\n\nTo have such a jump in conditions when there has previously been much more leniency for just chat restrictions, likely seemed harsh both from player and Riot perspective. It seems like forever ago but this is still an adjustment period, it is the first season with these requirements after all.\n\nI imagine this is designed to test the waters and determine whether the climb from Honour 1-2 is too harsh, and if maybe some re-balancing is due like maybe making the climb from 0-1 harder, but 1-2 easier to maintain the impact on Honour for bans or multiple offences, but reduce the harshness for single chat restrictions.\n\nThere has been a lot of complaints that the hit to honour is too harsh for offences that result in a 10 game chat restriction, and I can't really *disagree* with that.\n\nPersonally I agree with the principle of the test, but feel that those on an active restriction at season end shouldn't really be given the chance. I imagine it's an all or none kind of deal there though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TwitchTVSeeEL","date":"2019-01-27T03:09:52.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Honour Didn't reset  to honour 2, also how do you find your user ID","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-27T03:48:56.675+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are below Honour 2, your Honour does not get reset.
