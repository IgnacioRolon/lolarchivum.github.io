So 18 spots available to play!\n\nUPDATE 3 - 12:00AM: That's it for me! 17 games since 5 PM, great effort everyone and GGWP. Zaps is still running a lobby and so are some community members such as MagicalLoliJuice.\nBe sure to check out the final [Dominate Dominion tournament VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/dominategamingtv/v/48346192) if you missed it and want to see what competitive Dominion looks like.\nIf you just want to see what Dominion is all about, check [THIS comeback](http://www.twitch.tv/dominategamingtv/v/48346192?t=03h47m47s) out.\n\n----\n\nHey Everyone!\n\nI&#039;m starting a Dominion customs train at **5:00 PM AEDT tonight!**\n\nI&#039;ll be present in the DominateDominion, Dominion, and PlatWithRiot chat rooms and inviting whoever is around.
