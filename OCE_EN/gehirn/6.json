We&#039;re seeing sustained engagement with the queue so I&#039;m happy to announce that for now the queue is here to stay **as long as engagement keeps up**.\n\nWe&#039;d like to increase the amount of days per week that TT Ranked can be played to make it easier to engage with the queue on a weekly basis.  Expanding the number of days allows more people access to the queue who may not be able to play on a single given day. \n\nHowever, there are real concerns that this could exacerbate queue times - if players are choosing to play on only one particular day, this would reduce the amount of people who are in the queue - particularly towards the beginning and the end of the day. The focusing of players into a shorter period of time is why limited queues are able to sustain themselves when they wouldn&#039;t if available 24/7.\n\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\nWe&#039;re taking a small step in that direction, by TESTING an expansion of TT Ranked to two nights a week, but reducing the amount of hours that the queue is active per day. Starting this week TT Ranked Flex will be available:\n**\nThursday: 5:00pm - 0:00am AEST (7 hours)\nFriday: 5:00pm - 0:00am AEST (7 hours)**\n\nIn short, total hours that TT Ranked will be available is going up to 14 hours per week, from 10, and 2 nights per week from 1.\n\nAgain, this is a test, and any changes may have to be reverted or at least iterated on. We&#039;ll keep you up to date if anything changes.\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\nAdditionally, due to the tiny amount of players relative to Summoner&#039;s Rift, we&#039;ve had to set a special configuration for Diamond, Master and Challenger tiers in TT Ranked.\nHow special? Well...\n\n**Since there are so few opportunities to play TT Ranked, we&#039;ve eased the pressure on decay rates and promo series timeouts at the top of the ladder:**\n\nChallenger &amp; Master tier - Each game played grants 4 &quot;banked&quot; days of no LP decay, up to a maximum of 16 days saved up.\nDiamond V - I: The number of days before a promo series expires has been increased to 8.\n\nThis effectively means that you are able to miss **one week of ranked TT before decaying in Master/Challenger** and can reach a promo series in Diamond one week and still be able to play it out the week after.\n\n**TT ranks in OCE above Diamond I are now restricted to only allow the following amount of players:**\n\nMaster tier - CORRECTION: there is no cap on Master tier. If you can achieve a high enough MMR in the queue, you can break into Master tier.\n**UPDATED** Challenger tier - Maximum of **6** players\n\nSo, pretty special. There are already 3 Challengers sitting atop the ladder, so get up there and knock them down!\n\nSee you on the Treeline.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Emphasis","date":"2017-02-09T04:03:00.128+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":0,"body":"Curious as to how this is supposed to encourage more people to play. There's currently about 7 competitive 3s players, 4 of us are already at the top of the ladder and another 3 or so which are in diamond 5 or below thanks to getting unlucky placement games. Not only is it a non-incentive for the people who are in the lower rankings trying to climb because the others are effectively 500lp ahead of them already plus promo series luck, but it's also a kick in the nuts to us 4 at the top. We have all played together in some combination to climb to the top so now 1 of us will have to get the short end of the stick. It seems like a lose / lose situation for everyone involved. I understand that the population for OCE is small and that physical rewards from challenger mean that there would have to be some cutbacks in order to maintain fairness and value in the rewards, but why 3 as a number? Surely 6 or 10 would have been a better way to promote competitive games. You could even just do what you did with 5s last season and not give out the physical rewards to everyone in challenger, that worked out well for everyone, it kept the top of the ladder active and competitive and every team played against each other in order to try and secure their spot. If i hadn't started playing 3s and wanted to but saw this, then looked at the ladder, I would definitely not be encouraged to start playing.\n\nedit: since the queue availability update there have been more decent and close games, so that's a good sign. it does appear that most of the people are still struggling to get out of platinum, perhaps you could again (as per my previous suggestion) go the way of 5s and if people have good enough mmr give them the ability to skip division promos (not league promos). It's good seeing more people playing and playing well but i feel like they aren't progressing as fast as they should.{{champion:34}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Huey Dewey Louie","date":"2017-02-09T04:47:30.796+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There should definitely be more space in the 3v3 challenger ladder for the many talented oceanic players putting in the hard work of climbing and keeping to a strict time frame ranked schedule.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fabulous","date":"2017-02-09T04:14:58.503+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, there are roughly 7 high elo players who actually compete in OCE 3v3.

I'll try to clarify our stance on this a little.\n\nWhy 3 challenger slots?\n\nWe want to maintain the status of Challenger as representing the very best in the queue. Given the size of the TT playerbase this was almost impossible. We went with 3 Challenger slots to at least accommodate the standard team size in TT.\nDouble points Ocean Week encouraged a bunch more players to give TT Ranked a shot. So now the amount of players on the ladder facilitates a total Challenger pool of 3 players quite well.\nIf the regular Ranked TT playerbase continues to expand, then the amount of Challenger slots will rise.\n\nI was incorrect in saying that Master tier is limited to 9 players, it isn't. If you can achieve a high enough MMR in the queue, you can break into Master tier.\n\nWhat we won't do is customize the top of the ladder to any individual player's desires or to accommodate a group of friends. This is an objective approach to maintaining the status of Challenger in an extremely low population queue.\n\n--------------------------\nOn time of day:\n\nThe days were expanded to increase the opportunities to play to more than once a week (in terms of days). Players can now miss a day if they need to. The times were condensed for the stated reason that less players in queue at any time means lower quality matchmaking and higher queue times. The current times are strictly based on the most popular times of the day. Unfortunately this does lead to some crappy availability for players who play from WA primarily before 5PM AEDT or at the later hours of the night.\n\nThis is hard to solve, as expanding the queue will lead to worse queue times overall and possibly start to hack into match quality.\n\nI've only got a week of data to analyse: so far, slightly more games are being played when compared to the previous schedule, but queue times have increased. \n\nIf the queue could be expanded out slightly to accommodate the western timezone a little better, what would be your preference? The numbers tell me I should expand the queue to start at 4 PM (at first), but this of course simply won't benefit everyone in WA.\n\nWe'll assess this option in the near future once we've got a bit more data to run with.","replies":[{"poster":"bubberboy","date":"2017-03-03T08:31:34.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps adding some sort of IP boost to Twisted Treeline would entice some people to try out the map and maybe join the ranked tt community.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-08T10:15:30.943+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice, I haven't played the queue in a couple of weeks because of reasons.

Not only this, as fellow players of Twisted Treeline Ranked have mentioned, although the queue times have been created to promote flexibility, the limitation on the number of people in the Challenger tier counteracts this idea, with the mindset encouraged being that players should play with the same team every game.\n\nI am also curious how promotions from Diamond I to Master tier will work if Master tier is already filled up. Will the player who won their promotion series merely be unable to move up? Will the lowest player in Master tier be faced with demotion, regardless of the amount of league points they have accumulated, negating their hard work? The banked games and increasing the time frame of the queue is a step in the right direction however, as well as the time you have to complete promotional series. I hope to see an increase to the amount of players allowed in the higher ranks and perhaps further flexibility in queue times, but besides that, these changes are most welcome, especially for the more casual Twisted Treeline players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-09T01:09:40.076+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bma","date":"2017-02-09T04:54:53.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm currently the top ranked player in 3s, have a few concerns.\n\nFirst one is what Emphasis said. Limiting the number of Challenger spots is unlikely to drive motivation to play the queue mode.  The current top 4 players regularly queue together, and now one of them is going to have to give up the Challenger spot. As far as I know, no other queue type has such a skewed ratio of 3:10. I don't even think there are 200 master tier players in solo queue (when there are 200 spots in Challenger), so it does seem strange to do it this way.\n\nSecondly, if it's due to population density that quantity of challenger spots has to be limited, then it similarly makes no sense for Ranked Flex 5v5 to be able to have 200 spots in Challenger Tier. That queue is even more of a joke than twisted treeline (let's be real guys).\n\nThird, I think the queue should be open for one more hour on both days. The current queue times make it almost impossible for any player who works full time to get more than a few games in within Western Australia due to timezone differences.","replies":[{"poster":"Thomasm","date":"2017-02-17T18:11:12.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why only 1 hours ? more like from 10am to 1 am on both days atleast... its so ragy to play twice a week already...","replies":[{"poster":"TheatriX","date":"2017-03-01T02:12:56.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Casual TT players that have school Thursday and Friday would never get to play this queue though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ivdiv","date":"2018-02-27T22:55:56.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible to see what the current Schedule is for both Ranked and Normal TT?\n\nThe most recent Rioter post here still seems to state that Ranked is up Thurs/Fri but I noticed it was actually up last Sat/Sun.\nThere seemed to be an increased interest last Sat/Sun when the Ranked queue was up.
