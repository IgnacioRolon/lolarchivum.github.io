We&#039;ve now had some time to analyse the performance of these queues around queue health (queue times and matchmaking quality).\n\nIt&#039;s taken us a little longer than we&#039;d have liked to adjust the queues&mdash;due to bugs occurring with Ranked Flex immediately after launch&mdash;but we&#039;ve now gathered and analysed enough data on both queues&#039; performance to decide on how best to proceed.\n\nFor most of the day, both SR Ranked queues are healthy with fairly even sized player-bases. However, certain hours of the day have significantly fewer players online. During these times, both queues occasionally have issues maintaining high-quality matchmaking or queue times.  \n\nRather than disabling both queues during these hours, we&#039;re going to see how they perform when only one queue is available during this time of day.\n\nThe following changes will be implemented early December 2nd:\n\n* SR Ranked Solo/Duo will be disabled daily during the hours of 04:00 AM to 07:00 AM AEDT (Disabled for 3 hours)\n* SR Ranked Flex will be disabled daily during the hours of 07:00 AM to 10:00 AM AEDT (Disabled for 3 hours)\n\n----------------------\n\nWe&#039;ve also been investigating the possibility of enabling Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex in Oceania.\n\nWe&#039;re going to trial running a single day each week to gauge interest in Ranked TT.  This will tell us if it can sustain high-quality matchmaking and reasonable queue times. To do this, we&#039;re going to replace one day of TT Blind Pick with TT Ranked Flex.\n\nWe&#039;re doing this to understand how we can maximise the availability of the two queues without impacting the quality of the matchmaking or queue times for either.\n\nAfter a some time we'll decide if we can continue running TT Ranked Flex or not.\n\nChanges being implemented from December 1st:\n\n* TT Ranked Flex will be enabled on Thursday during the hours of 03:00 PM to 01:00 AM AEDT the next day\n* TT Normal Blind will no longer be enabled on Thursdays\n\n-------------------------\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWe&#039;re changing the following queues from December 1st:\n\n* TT Ranked Flex will be enabled on Thursday during the hours of 03:00 PM to 01:00 AM AEDT the next day\n* TT Normal Blind will no longer be enabled on Thursdays\n\nWe&#039;re changing the following queues from December 2nd:\n\n* SR Ranked Solo/Duo will be disabled daily during the hours of 04:00 AM to 07:00 AM AEDT (Disabled for 3 hours)\n* SR Ranked Flex will be disabled daily during the hours of 07:00 AM to 10:00 AM AEDT (Disabled for 3 hours)","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-29T10:21:11.773+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck oath TT ranked love it.

What an absurd solution. Utterly nonsensical. Remove a queue entirely instead of letting it have longer q times or match people with a broader range of elo. Retarded. If nobody plays the game it's a shit game and you should fix the game itself instead of only allowing people to play certain hours so they don't get bored shitless with your shit game.","replies":[{"poster":"Dreamcast","date":"2016-12-07T02:49:25.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who tf even plays from 4 am to 7 am","replies":[{"poster":"stay sweet","date":"2016-12-10T15:45:50.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People in WA having a *really* late night","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joakes","date":"2016-12-06T10:06:41.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reported for toxic :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr Fathead","date":"2016-12-07T05:57:22.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man I can't wait to play 3v3 again I missed it so much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-12-04T04:20:17.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"does flexed rank affect my solo/duo queue rank at all say if I place bronze when in solo/duo I'm gold will it affect my placements next season in solo/duo?","replies":[]},{"poster":"imbiger12","date":"2016-12-03T16:18:04.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have me skin riot girle tristana","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Lizard","date":"2016-12-03T01:43:54.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yo why do we get 2 queues when we could hardly support 1 for the majority of our existence. We went from having a decent matchmaking pool where 90% of games allowed you to play as your 1st or 2nd role and then we're given 2 queues, one which as far as I'm aware no one cares about and we're told that it's going to be permanent autofill. \n\nThis seems like a massive step backwards.","replies":[{"poster":"King Lizard","date":"2016-12-03T01:46:57.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I'm told I'm feeding, ruining the game, a troll etc etc. Because I'm trying my best in a role I don't know how to play at the level of skill I am currently placed, that makes me not want to play anymore.\n\nIt is effectively forcing me to dodge any games where I'm not given the roles I was able to get to my Elo by playing because it wouldn't be fair on my team or myself to play any other ones.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-03T12:43:54.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=King Lizard,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=5ruA0Wov,comment-id=00060000,timestamp=2016-12-03T01:46:57.430+0000)\n>\n> When I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m feeding, ruining the game, a troll etc etc. Because I&#x27;m trying my best in a role I don&#x27;t know how to play at the level of skill I am currently placed, that makes me not want to play anymore.\n> \n> It is effectively forcing me to dodge any games where I&#x27;m not given the roles I was able to get to my Elo by playing because it wouldn&#x27;t be fair on my team or myself to play any other ones.\n\nthen play norms in games in those off roles, even if itys just one champ you get a little experience on, there was a time that you didnt always get to pick two roles. we learnthow to play every role to some degree, even if it was just play like a bitch and farm.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ezrealer","date":"2016-12-17T17:35:23.780+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just wanna know when can u change it back as S6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Kimchi","date":"2017-06-11T20:08:05.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"when its after 8am in your time zone but hey you cant play ranked until 7am in a different time zone.. bastards.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NcyFzwYfS0","date":"2016-12-07T07:19:40.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Well this is shit twisted treeline is garbage.
