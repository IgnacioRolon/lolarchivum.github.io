I understand there are issues with OCE and the server size with regards to TT, but please give us an update so we can stop some whining over TT.\n\nRiot have repeatedly said they are gathering data on the normal TT queue to determine if a ranked queue is feasible, also stating that the queue requirements are stricter. could you please release the data gathered, comparing it to say the SR queue and give some clarification on what you mean by stricter requirements. I think if the data clearly shows a ranked TT is not going to work most people will stop complaining.\n\ncould you also answer why we can't just have a Ranked TT 3 nights a week instead of normal TT. Ranked 3's is never going to be SR, its not going to be part of the league esport, all the OCE players want for TT is to have some sense of accomplishment and a clear sense of where we individually sit in as a TT player. \n\nSo can't we have a flex 3v3 ranked queue as the only TT, this will be the best of both worlds and keep the OCE community happy. I don't see why we can't do this, can you please explain it?\n\nagain please just let us know what's going on. there used to be a running thread about twisted treeline with active riot members replying, as far as i can see that disappeared in 2014. all we want is some clear communication not just \" we are gathering data\" .","replies":[{"poster":"Trr1ppy","date":"2016-12-20T02:05:45.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think TT would get much better population if you had a formal announcement on the client home page that TT is available on a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday, its just simple advertising.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mystíc","date":"2017-06-12T06:28:32.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3v3 would be cool","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-06-12T10:36:52.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we have 3v3 on 4 nights a week [(2x normal and 2x ranked](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/oTA7PnYT-twisted-treeline-ranked-flex-updated-11th-april-2017)) :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"epicowners","date":"2016-11-16T09:16:00.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man, ive been wondering and asking the exact same question and its never been answered for over 2 years now, they just keep disregarding it (Cazknight)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2016-11-09T02:26:33.365+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"just saying im going to be pretty damn annoyed if ranked flex is the default queue instead of solo/duo","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-09T03:21:08.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=420 Afgooey,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=wgM0WBsO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-09T02:26:33.365+0000)\n>\n> just saying im going to be pretty damn annoyed if ranked flex is the default queue instead of solo/duo\n\nI'm willing to bet that solo/duo will get dropped off and flex kept in due to our lack of population.
