We are working on a resolution but heavily suspect that the crash occurs only after you enter the in-client store.\nThe crash tends to occur sometime after entering the store or if you leave and then re-enter the store. This means that you may experience a client crash when you queue up for a game or even after entering champion select, as long as you accessed the store sometime prior.\n\n~~To avoid the issue, if you intend to play a game please refrain from using the store beforehand, or make any intended purchases and re-log in to the client before queuing up for a game.~~\n\nWe know this issue really sucks and we&#039;re thankful for your patience on this one.\n\n**EDIT:** This has been fixed, we found a misconfiguration and have been testing extensively with no crashes. Please let us know if you continue to see issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Renie","date":"2015-05-22T07:27:14.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've asked you twice but ill ask you again can I get my promotional games back?","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Folds","date":"2015-05-22T12:32:24.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=em0rhc,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=qGggBnHi,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-22T07:27:14.774+0000)\n>\n> I've asked you twice but ill ask you again can I get my promotional games back?\n\nTry submitting a ticket instead of posting on forums..","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T03:11:48.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried submitting a ticket?
