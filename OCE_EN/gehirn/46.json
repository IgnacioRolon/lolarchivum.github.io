Legendary Snowball actually started at 19:00 AEDT on December 23. It is live right now.\n\nIf you purchased a Legendary or Ultimate skin between 00:01 and 19:00 AEDT on December 23 ~~can you please contact player support.~~\nUPDATE: We've identified every player who was affected by this and have handed out mystery gifts to them in a batch. **There were some that were missed** and ~~we will be performing a new batch shortly.~~ < This batch has also completed.\n\nIf you already opened a ticket, you can reopen if you need clarification on your situation.\n\nReally sorry about this :( We made an error with the version of the site showing live.\n\nEDIT - NEW ISSUE: Hi Everyone, we're aware that some of you **purchased Legendary or Ultimate skins after the start time of 7 PM AEDT on the 23rd and still did not receive your free mystery gift** through the Legendary Snowball promo.\nWe've identified how this happened and are now working on a solution to get a mystery gift to anyone that was missed.\nThe issue should no longer occur for future purchases.","replies":[]}
