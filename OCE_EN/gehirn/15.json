We kept those nerfs out of TT however for that patch since we didn't want to add it last minute without enough consideration and at least some TT specific bug testing. 8.15's a possibility however, and to help us understand whether we should add the gold funnelling penalty would be great to get a bunch of feedback from you folks.\n\nWhat would be particularly helpful here:\nA clear for or against position on the gold funnelling penalty on TT\nSome context on how much TT you've played and when (links to match history, boards posts with longer thoughts as potential examples)\n\nTo explain the second point one concern we've got is that when we talk about gold funnelling on TT a lot of voices in the discussion seem to be well meaning people who don't actually play TT. Intent there seems to be good, but we're particularly looking for feedback from people with a lot of experience on the map since their experience will change the most with any changes we make.","replies":[{"poster":"Afince","date":"2018-07-19T11:39:30.093+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey.\nI'm [Afince](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=afince) and I am currently Rank 2 in 3v3 in Oceania. I peaked at 1050LP this season, and I've played 300 ranked 3v3 games. I was challenger last season (600LP) and played around 400 games. I've played over 600 normal games of 3v3 since we had the queue available in Oceania.\n\nI personally believe that both support meta (funneling) and jungle meta can be balanced in a way that both metas are viable. I personally feel that both metas can be nudged in the right direction with incremental changes and testing. \nSupport meta has seen a few nerfs this season already, but it is still the strongest meta and picking jungle meta right now is not viable. \nThe nerfs that affected support meta:\n - Timeworn support items losing the bandit passive\n - Flat health nerf on the relic shield line\n - Spellthief income lockout change\n - Top turret being easier to take in the early game\n - New runes making supports generally squishier\n - Not being able to take a jungle item + support item\n - Ardent Nerf\n - Giving the locket shield a health ratio\n - Redemption scaling with heal / shield power stats\n - Forbidden idol cooldown reduction down from 10% > 5%\n\nThese changes are nudging jungle meta in the right direction but I think a few changes could push both metas into a state where support meta has a clear weakness in the early game. I think the inherent weakness of the support meta should be the support being weak / underlevelled and being at a disadvantage in fights.\nThe jungle meta vs support meta dynamic right now is not looking good. In this matchup, the jungle meta team is put on a timer to get a lead and map control. This time is usually before the first recall of the enemy duo. In this matchup, jungle + top and support + hypercarry must be seen and treated as a 2v2. \n\nJungle meta faces three problems also:\n - Once the 3 jungle camps are cleared, there is a lot of downtime and not much to do other than to spam gank lanes\n - Jungle + top falls behind in xp quite fast compared to support meta.\n - The ap bot role feels like it has low agency against a support meta team.\n\nSupport meta also gains an edge once the support completes their core items, which are Face of the mountain, Ionian boots, Knights Vow, and Locket. I also think that the support role right now is too strong and that weakening the role will have a strong impact on how viable jungle meta is.\nNerfing this role allows for an inherent weakness and a commitment to choosing to play support meta. This also hits co-ordination a bit and requires the support role to take more skill to play in the early game.\nMy suggested changes:\nNerf the gold per 10 on all 3 items. Right now, Timeworn Targons Brace gives 4gp10, which is actually ridiculous. Delaying supports core items by a few minutes gives the jungle meta team a fighting chance earlier in the game and presents inherent weakness.\nAll 3 items need to have their gold per 10 nerfed. If only the relic shield line gets nerfed, people will just take coin or spellthief instead. A few supports use the spellthief line already (Fiddle, Lulu), and without a nerf it just makes these picks stronger.\nThe goal here is to delay supports core items by 2-3 minutes. Flexing off onto different items becomes a bigger opportunity cost (executioners), allowing a bit more flexibility in the jungle meta comp.\n\nIncrease the XP gained in a solo lane and reduce xp gained if 2 people are in one lane. This has many effects. The goal here is to let the top laner keep up in xp while having the enemy support fall slightly behind. Right now, the hyper carry and support reach levels 5 and 3 quite fast and can make it very hard for a jungle and top duo to fight them.\nThis should also have the side effect of making supports reach level 6 later, which is a nerf to Taric (he needs one), and presents a window where the support comp has 2 ultimates while the jungle meta comp has 3.\nThis change also gives the bot lane more agency, allowing the bot lane mages to hit level 6 before or around about the time the support reaches level 4. A level of risk is also presented to supports who can roam early, and gives you an incentive to pick junglers instead with safer and stronger ganking power in the early game.\nThese changes should give the jungle meta bigger windows in the early game to punish support meta, while also giving them inherent weaknesses. Jungle meta vs jungle meta largely remains unchanged here.\n\nThe benefits of having both metas:\n - Interesting dynamics between the two matchups\n - More champs become available. If you want to play a support, you can play support meta. If you want to play an adc you can without getting crushed in lane. If you want to play a top lane bruiser, sure, why not?\n - 5 roles become available rather than 3 (top, jg, ap bot), by having the option to play support and hypercarry.\n - The benefit of an easier time in champ select as a solo or fill player. Having 5 roles and also more champions to pick means that you can queue solo and get a team comp together in either meta without feeling as much grief playing against a support meta team.\n - Current TT players will stay, but with jungle meta not feeling so bad new players may join and stay more interested in the queue. These changes make jungle meta more attractive in lower elos especially.\n\nI also do NOT think that the monster hunter debuff is a good solution. -10 gold is quite painful but does not solve the other issues that I discussed above, especially with the support role. It also is a kick in the nuts for hypercarries who do not rush the jungle item. It completely removes tiamat users from play (in jungle meta too!), and other champs who would prefer to sit on the base jungle item.\nIt would also have the side effect of forcing the hypercarry to start machete + talisman, making the hyper carry super susceptible in the early game. I feel like this would be too much in a lot of cases and would just keep the S tier hypers in S tier, and would push down the rest.\n\nAn alternative change would be to make the monster hunter debuff reduce xp gained from lane minions by a %. I'm not sure what number, but it would allieviate some stress as I have pointed out above.\n\nI would also personally dislike a meta where only jungle meta exists. I have played both metas and at a higher level I believe if both metas were balanced the game would be a lot more interactive and fun. Z3nith made a comment on the NA boards that talks about the dynamic of the 2 metas and how interactive they are. Rather than copy paste it I will link it [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/PvrpURlA-quick-gameplay-thoughts-july-18?show=flat&amp;comment=0056)\n\nAnother thing I'd like to bring up is Vilemaw. \nI think Vilemaw should get indicators for its attacks like Baron does in SR. Lots of people (especially here and in low elo) do not know that vilemaw attacks mostly in a cone, and people stack together and tank damage. An indicator for the web would also be great. The debuff also needs some kind of VFX because people don't know that it has a debuff or what it does. Right now it is also incredibly easy to sneak with a hypercarry (especially early) and I think it needs to be slightly harder to kill. Fighting over Vilemaw needs to be a bigger deal because a taken Vile can guarantee 2 turrets or an inhib even in the midgame. In the case of a hypercarry, it is incredibly easy to solo and vs a jungle meta team it can be hard to track.\n\nThanks for your time. I have probably missed a few things but I really hope this comment gets taken into consideration. {{champion:78}}","replies":[{"poster":"Z3nith","date":"2018-07-19T12:43:16.892+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already posted a rushed version of my thoughts on the global post by Meddler which Afince linked to in his post.

(please do not play \"just for fun\" in ANY of my ranked games. ever)\n\nI'm silver and main adc on SR, previously mained support. kinda still do - especially on TT. and love the extra opportunity to achieve end of season rewards, with my preference for learning about strategic value before dumping what limited time i have in queue. I don't play TT \"just for fun\" (or SR for that matter). Putting strategy into action is how i have fun because winning consistently validates the strategy and validates me earning end of season rewards, because i put the time and effort to learn and apply them effectively. I basically spend what time i have on the weekends solely on TT instead of SR, unless invited to play with friends.\n\nMy considerations would include how easy/powerful (skill:power ratio) is ganking on such a small map? how to close out a game (as/against any comp)? seige? splitpush? vilemaw? how viable are these options, if people are pigeon-holed into jungle meta on such a small map? will people be forced into risky tower-dives? (is ohmwrecker still avaliable on TT? hahaha)\n\nwith only 3 people on each team, the numbers themselves seem to promote skirmishing, and hard to establish a 'big teamfight'. New players will keep defaulting to generalist bruiser/mage comps. bruisers own 1v1 lanes even more now (assuming all the markman nerfs apply to TT). there's no intuitive role/position for supports/marksmen new to the gamemode to fulfill without the 2v2 lane, because there's no early-game neutral objective equivalent to dragon, and there's only 2 lanes anyway.\n\nI've seen new players just go duo lane anyway, but by the 2nd game they'd have smite so they don't have to completely ignore/give up the jungle. I assume they'd slowly evolve into the hyper+support that is the current meta.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cawwi Me","date":"2018-07-22T00:23:52.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Who the hell cares about TT on OCE?

And I am very much a player who prioritises fun over success.\n\nI wont profess to being a particularly high rank, or the best player out there, and if that somehow makes my opinion less valid, so be it.\n\nI have been playing TT since before the OCE server was a thing, back when we were all on NA, and losing it was a huge blow when coming to this server.\n\nI dont know exactly how many games I've played in TT, and I'm sure its nowhere near as many as some people. But it is a mode that is important to me and my friend group, so I'm here representing our clan.\n\n\n_________________________\n\n#The Reasoning\n\nThe great thing about TT, is that it combines the best parts of many game modes.\nYou have the tactical elements of split-pushing/objective-control/teamfighting/jungling etc. etc. of summoners rift.\nBut also have the fast paced skirmish focused gameplay of ARAM.\nAlso, like many of the rotating game modes, the meta for TT is far more malleable than SR, and teams have a little more freedom to create their own interesting comps, _(a personal favourite of our clan is Annie/Ivern/Yorick, for those out of the blue 3v6 team fights!)_.\n\nSo on one hand, funnelling is a strategy that someone has thought up, and given it a go, and it worked, and great.\nSo to remove that from a gamemode that is all about anything goes and finding your own strategies, just because it was a good strategy and it worked, is a bit iffy. Its like saying _\"You can't pick Yasuo+Malphite in games, cos its strong and you might win.\"_\n\nHowever, looking at the other side of the argument: The ultimate point of League of Legends, in any game mode, is to have fun.\nAnd its hard to deny that the fun in funnelled games, is significantly less.\n\nThe person getting funnelled is having a ball, but no one else is. The enemy team sure aren't, no one likes having a fed Yi cannonballing through them, and even the team doing the funnelling is having less fun as well, one _(sometimes both)_ poor soul misses all the farm and is near useless, and the other guy is just irrelevant most of the time as Yi wipes the floor with everyone. \n\nNot to mention that funnelling heavily promotes the _'one person just carrying the game'_ playstyle, which if anything _(as a team game)_ League should move away from. League is about working with your team, making plays, combining the vast and interesting selection of champions and abilities. Not about stuffing the beginner champ and then just sicking him on the enemy.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________\n\n#My stand\n\n**I am _FOR_ adding in a penalty against funnelling on Twisted Treeline.**\n\nTwisted Treeline has a ranked element, but it isn't as ultra-competitive or as highly regarded as ranked SR. Its a game mode designed for quick **fun** playing. So super competitive strategies like funnelling aren't really necessary, and remove the fun element. Maybe if worlds was set on TT and all eyes were on the best players and the perfect macro/micro plays, where the goal was _'winning at all costs'_ rather than _'playing a fun game after school/work'_, then maybe strategies like funnelling would have a greater place in it.  \n\nBut that isn't the case, TT is a mode for people who don't want to commit 40+ mins to a long drawn out struggle on SR, but still want fast paced tactical skirmishes.\n\nIt's the sad truth, but if you're diamond on Summoners Rift, everyone adores you. If you're diamond on Twisted Treeline, thats great, but nothing really comes of it. No company is going to come and give you a multi-million dollar contract because you're good at Twisted Treeline. So if thats not going to happen, can we focus the mode around fun rather than the high end competitive scene, and their 'win-at-all-costs' strategies?\n\n__________________________\n\n#TL;DR:\n\n1. League is about fun. Funnelling a game is less fun for 5 out of the 6 players in the TT game, than it otherwise would be.\n\n2. League is a team game, game mechanics should revolve around each member of the team participating equally and playing their part towards the ultimate goal. The main positions are: _Top/Jungle/Mid/Support/ADC_, _(obviously not all feature in TT)_  because everyone has a role to play, and no 1 role should be any more or less important than any other. Funnelling not only is frustrating for 50% of the players in the game, it also makes players on your own team feel less important and that their contributions are less than others because they aren't the funnelled player, and that isn't the feeling we sign into league to get, so why should we encourage it?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-07-20T12:12:41.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The hell did I say that was so terrible?\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}]}
