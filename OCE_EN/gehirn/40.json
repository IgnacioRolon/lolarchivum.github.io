We are currently working on upgrading store systems in OCE and if players were to transfer their accounts while this is happening there is a chance that some purchased content could be inaccessible or lost after the transfer. So until this work is completed transfers need to remain disabled.\r\n\r\nSorry for the lack of notice and the obvious inconvenience. We expect that transfers will be disabled until the 8th of Nov AEDT.","replies":[{"poster":"TìltLord","date":"2018-11-08T00:45:21.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will the account transfers be back up today?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-08T00:46:46.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They actually are back up now, I was just about to take this post down :P\nWe're working on removing the alert ticker messaging in client but you can transfer in and out of OCE now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ironarcanine","date":"2018-11-11T11:44:02.660+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its 3 days later, and I still cannot transfer, trying both **yesterday **and **today**.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JohnJohnYu","date":"2018-11-08T11:27:58.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not working atm, tried transferring from NA to OCE 3 times, and everytime i can login back to NA with the same amount of RP as if i didn't use transfer at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Battleborn","date":"2018-11-04T00:30:23.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah. it's pretty sucky. i spent money i could have saved to have my north america transferred on the first.  is a bit frustrating.{{champion:9}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risé","date":"2018-11-03T14:23:55.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"??? \nand what if some one move from OCE  (physically  ) like me ? what can i do when i cant play any game cuz i got lags every game and high ping ??","replies":[]}]}
