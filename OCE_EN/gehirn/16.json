{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-09T00:11:08.537+0000","title":"OCE Preseason Ranked Queue Testing - UPDATED Feb 8th","subforum":"Announcements","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hi everyone,\n\nYou may recall that in the [2017 Preseason site](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017/ranked) we revealed the new Solo/Duo queue and Ranked Flex coming to ranked and highlighted concerns that our smaller population in OCE may lead to unhealthy matchmaking if both queues ran side by side.\n\nWe want to make both queues as available as possible to Oceanic players while ensuring the queues are healthy - meaning high quality matchmaking and optimal queue times.\nWe also want to offer players the chance to show us what they prefer to play in order to gauge interest in the new ranked queues - before we determine their final configuration for the 2017 season.\n\n**So what&#039;s going to happen? We&#039;re going to test the queues and adjust their setup as we go.**\n\n-----------------------------\n\nFor the first week of pre-season, Solo/Duo Queue will not be enabled in any region.\nDuring this period Ranked Flex will be turned on with 24/7 availability. This queue gives you the ability to queue up as a solo player, or a 2, 3, or 5 player premade group.\n\nThis will give as many players as possible the chance to try the queue, while we closely monitor matchmaking quality and queue times.\n\nAfter one week, Solo/Duo queue is intended to be launched alongside Ranked Flex, with the plan being that it also operates with 24/7 availability. However, depending on how Ranked Flex has been performing and the expected impact that the two Ranked queues will have on each other, both queues may need to be restricted to certain times of day.\n\nWe&rsquo;re aware that Ranked Flex will require some solo players in order to function with 2/3 player premade groups. This means that, in the longer-term, further changes in the configuration of Ranked Flex premade group sizes may need to take place.\n\nIf necessary we will move quickly to make changes to the configuration of Ranked Flex, or the hours that either queue is available, to ensure maximum stability and queue health for both queues.\nIf and when those changes are made we&rsquo;ll be updating the current status of the queues here.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n- We&#039;re TESTING the new ranked queues.\n- We&#039;re turning on Ranked Flex with 24/7 availability at the beginning of the preseason - Nov 9th.\n- Globally, Solo/Duo queue will be turned on one week after Ranked Flex, with plans to also enable it 24/7.\n- While the queues are active, we will make rapid changes to their configuration and/or available times to ensure that queue health (matchmaking times and quality) is good\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Current Queue Configuration:**\n\n**Ranked Flex:**\n\n* Disabled between: 7:00am - 10:00am AEST\n* Allows queueing of Solo players or 2/3/5 player premade groups\n\n**Solo/Duo Queue:**\n\n* Disabled between: 4:00am - 7:00am AEST\n\n**TT Ranked Flex:**\n\n* Enabled Thursdays & Fridays between: 5:00pm - 0:00am AEST\n\n-----------------------------\n\nUPDATE Nov 16th: Solo/Duo Queue has been delayed slightly while we work to ensure there are no issues with the ranked MMR reset as there were with Ranked Flex.\n\nUPDATE Nov 18th: Solo/Duo Queue has been released. Both Solo/Duo and Flex will continue to run for 24/7 while we monitor their queue health.\n\nUPDATE Nov 29th: Starting December 2nd, SR Solo/Duo and Flex queue will be disabled for some hours of the early morning each day. One of the two queues will always be available to play.\nStarting Dec 1st, we're testing TT Ranked Flex, replacing TT Normal Blind on Thursdays.\nDetails [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/5ruA0Wov-scheduled-changes-to-ranked-queues-in-oce).\n\nUPDATE Feb 8th: TT Ranked has expanded to 2 nights but reduced hours per night.

When we thought we could release Solo/Duo alongside Dynamic at the start of this year, we quickly learned that we were wrong and that our announcement was premature. Dynamic queue matchmaking and queue times still needed massive tweaking to optimize them, and we've been making those changes all year.\nNow, we're finally at a place where Solo/Duo existing alongside a dynamic style queue (Ranked Flex) is a possibility.\n\nThat being said, given our small population in OCE it still might not work out. This is all a test and the outcome is not certain. Either Flex, Solo/Duo, or both will have to be adjusted in their setup depending on which one players choose to play most.\n\nIf we weren't going to try it, we wouldn't be trading Dynamic for Flex and removing Normal Draft from other regions. So I'm pretty confident that re-releasing Solo/Duo in some form is the plan.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fiend of Funk","date":"2016-11-13T11:22:08.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, i have a quick question, if I have the silver rewards from last seasons dynamic que but i make it to gold using the flex que avalable, will i get this years gold rewards or will i stick with  the silver ones?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-14T01:44:02.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your rewards from this year will always be based on your rank from Dynamic queue at the end of the 2016 season (Nov 8).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ExAmbush","date":"2016-11-10T01:46:17.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question, will the pre-season flex queue placements affect the 2017 ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-10T01:58:08.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Any ranked games you play now will have some effect, but your ranked will be soft reset before the official start of the 2017 season.\n\nFor example, lets say you climb to Gold during preseason: when the soft reset happens your rank will be set lower than Gold, but higher than it would have been if you'd not climbed to Gold at all.\n\nYou'll still need to play 10 placement games at the start of the 2017 season, which will also affect your starting rank.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mpowered","date":"2016-11-09T23:11:33.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Quick question, if I play in flex queue during preseason will this effect me in any way when solo/duo comes out in a week?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-10T01:30:23.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nope.
