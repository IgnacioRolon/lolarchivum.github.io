We&#039;re working closely with other teams at Riot to figure out what is going on and resolve. I will provide any updates here.\n\nThanks for your patience while we work on this.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all of your help with the logs everyone, very useful! No need to send any more through.\n\nFor a good breakdown of the issue please see Riot Zaps' post below.\n\n\n**Update 3:38 PM AEST:**\nA change has been made that looks like it should resolve the issue for most players! Please let us know if you're still seeing the issue after the time this post was updated!\n\n\nSome players in other regions may still be unable to log in. Other teams at Riot are currently looking into fixing this for those regions. THIS HAS NOW BEEN RESOLVED.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-07-13T03:56:43.863+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":2,"body":"We've been able to track down where the problem is occurring. When you're logging on to LoL, you're logging on through a system called the Login Queue. This system allows for many players to logon at the same time without overwhelming any particular system. The login queue is accessed through a service called a [CDN (Content Delivery Network).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)\n\n[CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) are basically networks owned by companies (third-parties) that have many connection points across different geographic areas and ISPs. We use these to make sure there is a fast response regardless of your ISP or location.\n\nCurrently, we're seeing problems with connection points that are used by particular ISPs (Spark and Telstra). At the moment, we're working to get the issues with these connection points fixed, but because there is no direct control by Riot, this can take longer to resolve (and be harder to give an ETA for) than a problem with our own systems.\n\nWe're currently working with the CDN to get this resolved as quickly as we can - this is our highest priority.\n\nEDIT @ 2:42PM AEST: \nA few notes below on workarounds that might help you out while we're getting this resolved:\n\n* If you're connected through Telstra:  \n    * If you reconnect your modem and force a new connection, you may be directed to a different connection point (described above) when you try to log on to League, and you could get in.\n* If you're on Spark or Telstra AND you have a secondary connection / mobile phone internet\n      * Because this issue is solely with the logon process through your specific connection - if you go through the logon process with that connection, you can then switch back to your normal connection and then play as normal. **This likely won't work if your phone is through the same **ISP as your normal internet connection. \n\n\nEDIT @ 3:38PM AEST:\nA change has been made that looks like it should resolve the issue for most players! Please let me know if you're still seeing the issue after the time this was posted! \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"XxFordxX","date":"2017-07-13T04:12:27.738+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"any closer?\nplease give me good news","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-07-13T04:20:24.195+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're still working on getting this fixed - there's no clear ETA yet.
