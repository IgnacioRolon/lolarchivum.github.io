This is the result of a fix that went out this morning to correct all the previously wild placement results and matchmaking that was going on until now.\n\nWe&#039;ve made changes to OCE first, because it was the first region to release Ranked Flex. These changes were aimed at correcting MMR problems that originated from issues with Ranked Flex&#039;s launch. These problems with everyone&#039;s MMR have caused most players to be incorrectly placed after their provisional games, and created issues that led to very poor matchmaking and inflated LP gains.\n\nAfter the changes this morning everyone who completed their placements will have to play one more game to be correctly placed.\n\n**So did the fix work?**\n\nSince this morning we&#039;ve monitored the effects on player MMR and which leagues players were being placed into, and saw that players were looking much closer to their actual ratings. Unfortunately, for players who have climbed ranks rapidly as a result of incorrect placement and inflated LP gains, this correction to their actual rank feels punishing. We know some players were stoked to be climbing higher and faster than they ever have but it&rsquo;s pretty likely that the matchmaking for those players was a bit of a clown fiesta in the first place, and that their placements and LP gains were largely inflated.\n\nUltimately, for ranked to be as competitive as possible, we wanted to make sure they (and their opponents) had a fair climb up the ladder and this means resetting everyone to their correct rank. Although for some players, this also means being placed higher after today as their incorrect MMR had identified them as lower than their true rank.","replies":[{"poster":"Triumphant Ryze","date":"2016-11-15T05:48:49.616+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"I finished the season at Silver 5 and after playing my 10 flex placements either 6-4 or 7-3 I was placed in bronze 1 which felt fair as my mmr was going down the hole with how I was playing losing many games dropping from silver 2 to silver.

Since this was only a few days, a re-do from the beginning of last season's mmr + proper reset is more reasonable.\n\nThing is, you're only going to see complaints here from players that placed lower after getting their mmr reset due to the messed up matchmaking. What about all the players who dropped massively in rank due to the joke of an mmr reset and craptastic matchmaking that followed?\nThis is why we have to apply the same solution to all players, otherwise we risk inflating populations at the top of the ladder with players who got there while matchmaking was so bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-16T01:56:03.721+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose the logical solution would be to have no reset at all.\nPeople start the new season at the same place as the last one. \n\nIts very rare that you hear someone being placed higher than they used to be through placements alone, so this would be beneficial for everyone.\n\nOr maybe a reset, but a softer one. \ne.g. you cant drop below division 5 of the tier you are in, but also cant rise more than 4 divisions above you.\n\nBut removing someones year long work by dropping a whole tier (silver 3 to bronze 3), seems a little harsh. People worked for that score, and they haven't done anything to lose it.\n\nI know what you'll say: \"But the landscape of the game has changed now that the preseason changes are active, so it is inaccurate to keep the same score now the game is different.\"\n\nand thats fair enough, but i seriously doubt that people who were platinum, will now be playing a low-gold/high-silver level, just because theres a couple of plants that go boom when you auto attack them.\n\nI know that riot's focus is on the mid-high level of play, and not on the extremely high or the low levels of play.\n\nBut while MMR resets don't mean much to diamond/platinum players, for the majority of bronze/silver players trying to get to gold, MMR resets are lethal. Many bronze players spend a whole year slogging to get out of bronze, finally get to silver 3/4 then get reset and begin the climb all the way from bronze 5 again, just to get silver 3/2, then get reset again and start from bronze 4, and climb to silver 1, then get reset again, and have to begin the tedious process all over again. \n\nWhen you're platinum, its fine, you drop to low gold, and think \n\"Ok well time to get back up again, even if i don't make it, i still get my victorious skin.\"\nbut when you're silver and almost gold, and have to start again right from the very bottom every season.\nIts soul crushing.","replies":[{"poster":"grimnear","date":"2016-11-16T08:45:03.010+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soul crushing indeed I finally climbed to silver 4 last season then Im straight back to B3 after placements that is where i started last season! \nI know climbing out of bronze isn't hard but its frustrating and it doesn't help me improve i had a consistent 70% win rate last season from b3 all the way to silver 3 why do i have to do it again if i can win so consistently should i really be at that rank?\n\nIt takes so much time to just keep throwing games at the league system so you can get to your actual rank then start learning and climbing again.\n\nThe messed up flex matchmaking is the most fun in league i have ever had i actually faced decent players that forced me to learn and adapt to win and i did consistently win against platinum's and high golds during the period. but now im back to bronze 3 trying to be respectful of the person abusing me and threatening to afk because they are having a bad day.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"muzzleflare","date":"2016-11-16T04:08:28.106+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And those players who rose by sheer luck that matchmaking didn't screw them will naturally fall to where they belong.

I hope this is a bug and don't want my newest account to be placed in this low elo as I've been doing my best to win every game and have done so.
