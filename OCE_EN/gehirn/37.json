There's no real answer here.\n\nThe problem has remained persistent, that is, with every patch the patcher will reach 32% and then fail. My most recent test with pinging l3cdn.riotgames.com actually works now, but the patcher is failing in the exact same method (also, it's still going to address 184.84.220.112 instead of 14.200.100.27).\n\nI found out that the patcher is **not** marking the game folder as completely downloaded, thus it then attempts to download the missing files, but the files are already there and it fails. This issue is not isolated to only I. A solution is to manually mark the folder as completely downloaded after the patcher downloads the patch and fails, thus making the next time it boots up it will just work.\n\nIt's a tad bit complicated, though, and users shouldn't have to go to such extremes just to tell the patcher it's actually done. If you could fix that behaviour in the patcher, you would solve a lot of people's problems.\n\nBest of luck in bringing attention to this, Riot Gehirn.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-05-19T05:56:47.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry I didn't see this reply for so long. :(\n\nYou're right, players should not have to reinstall the game or go through the above workaround every time they are required to patch. I'm interested in getting to the root of this problem, I'd like to talk to some other Rioters about why such a workaround would solve this issue and that may lead us somewhere.\n\nCan you describe the workaround in more detail? How do you go about performing: \"manually mark the folder as completely downloaded after the patcher downloads the patch and fails\"?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-19T08:33:51.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a tiny bit of coding experience, so I just presumed based on what I was doing that that was what the initial coder intended on doing.\n\nThe exact workaround is as follows:\n1. A new patch is released. Open the client and download the majority of it. The patcher gets stuck at 32% and spouts out \"Unkown Error\".\n\n2. Navigate to ...>Riot Games>League of Legends>RADS>projects>lol_air_client>releases> where ... is replaced with your install directory.\n\n3. Create a new, empty file in the current version folder named \"S_OK\" with no extension. Restart League with admin privileges.\n4. The patcher automatically jumps to 32% complete, and scans files for a while. Then it finishes downloading the patches (usually only a few megabytes, since the majority was downloaded beforehand) and 'applies' the patches for the remainder. Usually the remaining 67% is completed *much* faster than the initial 32%.\nLeague works now, but all settings retaining to it as a application are reset, ie. if you set a custom volume for it via Sound Mixer, it will go back to 100%.\n\nI'm still consistently getting this problem whenever a new patch for League is released. What I'm thinking is that, in order to simplify/optimise the process, the patcher will only 'apply' the patches if it reads the \"S_OK\" file in the directory of the folder it plans to copy the files too. Under normal circumstances, upon completion of downloading the preliminary files it would create the \"S_OK\" file and then start up the scanner to check it, and then the files would be copied over, but it seems like it's failing to create the \"S_OK\" file in the first place. I monitored the folder as it was patching and found that the patcher only creates the 'temp' files from the downloading process and not the \"S_OK\" file, along with any directory architecture required for the files to be transferred. It *may* be a permissions issue, but I find that the exact same behaviour happens if the application is started with admin privileges.\n\nIt could be that the patcher was relying on some sort of dependency to create the \"S_OK\" file, but it's lacking on some systems and hence it brings out an unexpected result. Could it be related to the fact that Microsoft renamed their file explorer (which is the biggest candidate for possible dependencies, as all Windows computers need it to function, much like Internet Explorer) between versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8.\n\nI appreciate you responding to this even after so long. If you need any more information I'll be glad to give it.\n\nBest of luck in finding a fix for it.\n\nEdit: Ok so it just doesn't like back-slashes.
