It appears that the issue is no longer occurring although you will notice some issue with your LP gains and promo series' or demotions if you played 2+ games during the issue period.\nSee the detailed description at the bottom of this post for more info on what happened.\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThere was a known issue that started after 09:00 AM AEDT today in which ranked game LP changes were not being properly recorded. When later games were recording LP it made it look as though you lost LP or gained very little.\n\nRegrettably, we won&#039;t be able to fix any issues with LP or promo/demo issues caused by the issue, but LP gains should normalize you back to where you were supposed to be after a few games because MMR gains appear to have been recorded correctly.\n\nIssue start time: 01 Mar - 09:13 AEDT\nIssue end time: 01 Mar - 16:43 AEDT\n\nThe real problem becomes visible after you played 2 or more games during this time period.\n\n\n**More detailed description of issue:**\nDuring the time the issue was occurring, if you played 2 or more ranked games, the games would start failing to record LP changesâ€‹ even though the end of game screen showed no issues (your LP would look like it changed as normal at first).\n\nYou would then start gaining/losing LP or promo games as if the games you played previously never existed. So you would see:\n\n- LP losses or no gains after a win (if your missing games were wins)\n- Large LP gains after a win or loss (if your missing games were losses)\n- Finished promotion series would fail to complete, staying at x out of 3 or 5 games played instead of succeeding or failing (your promo games that were missing basically didn't count and need to be played again)\n- Demotion after losing while being above 0 LP (Your wins that got you above 0 LP were not recorded)","replies":[{"poster":"CM Darkeyt","date":"2017-03-01T18:41:11.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well you're unable to fix that kind of things but when you put the draven skin for free by mistake you can take it back for every single account lol , there's a difference between i cant and i dont want to say the things like they are at least, this game is becoming really sad and it's kinda pissing me off , rankeds are hard enough and tilting enough i just got demoted after a victory thanks to that and obviously you guys doesnt care as long as you dont loose any money .","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-03-02T00:01:16.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reversing a bugged skin purchase across any amount of accounts is easy.

For example if a bug in the store costs players RP that they shouldn't have been charged, we'll absolutely go through and ensure they all get their RP back. That is another thing that is really easy to do as we can easily identify those players, there are so few variables and only a single identical action required across every account.","replies":[{"poster":"CM Darkeyt","date":"2017-03-02T06:51:55.326+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You still could do that for people who took the time to open a ticket on the support even if its not solving every single case, instead of just answering by \"no we're sorry but we cant do nothing about it,you just gotta accept that\" loose prevented wasnt even enabled lmao got demoted thanks to that bug and there's obviously no indemnity at all.. :)))))))))))))))) and even if its not an easy job you're still supposed to correct your mistakes and you said that doing it \"isn't something we can perform with that level of ease and reliability\" which mean that you could do it if you wanted to but why would you since you wouldnt make any profit on it  right? ^^ no money => no work riot changed across the years thats sad but its just a fact.","replies":[{"poster":"Visualize","date":"2017-03-02T10:26:13.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"drops mic hehexd","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-02T05:14:21.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really think they have the manpower to individually go through every single game played for that duration and adjust the LP?","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-03-06T23:43:29.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not about the manpower, or how how hard it is.

Wouldn't you just have 1) remove gains/losses of LP/promos between the times that this error occurred. 2) simulate the results of matches recorded in match history for the duration of the bug. 3) Recaculate where people should be currently taking into account the new wins/losses during the period of the bug. \n\nDoesn't seem all that crazy to me.\n\nI was in my promos with 1 free win.
