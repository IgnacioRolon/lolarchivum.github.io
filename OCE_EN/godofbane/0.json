The changes to IE and Essence Reaver were just a huge nerf to him Essence Reaver is all but useless on him and you have to build another crit item ontop of rapid fire while having an infinity edge to get remotely close to 100% crit (which makes you sacrafice building damage )not to mention stormrazor is an absolutely backward useless item , it only crits for 150% of the damage unless you have 100% crit where itll then crit for its 200% damage but by that point you wouldnt even need storm razor so i dont even understand the concept behind it. I love jhin but i just cannot seem to be able to do anything in games untill i have atleast a 3-4 item build even if i get a big  lead i eventually end up just getting smoked by mid to late game as the new changes to the essence reaver benefit other ADCs a ridiculous amount and most other ADCs benefit alot from getting crit and attack speed so they arent wasting gold to just build crit.\r\n\r\nIve had no problem playing Jhin in the past and had always done well with him but as it stands when i play him i need atleast a 4 item build compared to other ADCS 2 items to feel like i can remotely compete anymore maybe i am doing something wrong and let me know what success youve had this patch but i just feel like those 2 changes are just a huge hit to Jhin and he needs to be looked at","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-02T03:07:29.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just build {{item:3095}} according to my plat jhin OTP its semi-decent on him, makes up for the shitty change to IE","replies":[]}]}
