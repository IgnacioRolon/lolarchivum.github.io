I am unable to buy items, upgrade abilities and even move around the map without attacking the nearest thing to me. \r\n\r\nI used to use this function with kalista and never had any problems with it being stuck.\r\n\r\nClosing and restarting the client works but this can prove costly in game.. Sometimes I am lucky enough to have the time to do so while recalled because we are winning but more often than not it costs me a death (due to my inability to disengage) and a minute or two to reconnect. \r\n\r\nMost of the time I think it happens after chatting in /all (shift+enter).\r\n\r\nIt could be a problem with my keyboard or a setting that I have toggled on but in around 700 games I have never had this problem, and now its happening almost every second game.\r\n\r\nI made this issue apparent to riot and they were little to no help and just directed me here, so I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem while playing and knows of a fix? \r\n\r\nNot a fun thing to have happen when you're the last one alive trying to guard a tower as a melee champ then randomly engage in a 5v1...","replies":[{"poster":"sitonmysub","date":"2015-03-24T06:43:33.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, I dont think it is the shift key though because no matter how many times I press it once its toggled on it doesn't reset it. I have to close the client and upon reconnect its back to normal. Hasn't happened in the last 5-6 games though so I may have weathered the storm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-23T22:44:43.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try checking if its the shift key first you could try keytweaks and make shift a hold it down let go if it continues it means your shift key is sticky if not just restore defaults and check your hotkeys on LoL or restore defaults as you might have clicked something you didn't mean to when changing the settings","replies":[]}]}
