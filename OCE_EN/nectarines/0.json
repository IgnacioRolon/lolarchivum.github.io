If I tether to my mobile device (Telstra) I am able to login no problems at all. I have tried port forwarding to the league of legends ports and still no success. I have changed my Dns settings as well and tried repairing/reinstalling the client. Anything else anyone recommends in order to resolve this?","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-05T00:01:34.469+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is Riots servers.
