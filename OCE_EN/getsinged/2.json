Every ranked game, not even just limited to ranked games. I know everyone has had enough of these post about &quot;oh i cant get out of bronze because of my team&quot; but I&#039;m not saying that it&#039;s all their fault in games, i mess up a lot as well but i mean, in the games where i actually go good in these people ruin the games.
