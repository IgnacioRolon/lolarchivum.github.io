I would just like to know that, is there a possibility of which we could download and play the original version of league (as to when league was first released) and to change the versions of the game to play (solo or with mates on that current version) to test and discover the roots of league and to experiment all of the past features. I believe that it would be very enjoyable and entertaining learning experience into the base game and all the changes (both major and/or minor) throughout the years. A sort of blast to the past kind of experience. I truly believe that, even though this is currently not a thing, it would be a great feature for a great experience. (Even though you probably don&#039;t have the original versions of the game any more and i am seeming as though a completely silly person xD).","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-08-20T09:27:12.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support this wholeheartedly.
