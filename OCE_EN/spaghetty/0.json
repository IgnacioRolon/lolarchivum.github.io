If that involves the season 4 map, then so be it.

Simpler, fast, with less disconnects.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-02-06T02:51:56.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old map was an outright eyesore, not to mention the terrible inconsistencies with geometry which caused issues with Blink type spells and warding.","replies":[]}]}
