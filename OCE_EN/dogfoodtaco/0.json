The rewards haven't appeared (If I was supposed to get any) but I know there is a bit of delay sometimes. Someone please tell me!

You are not eligible for any rewards during this period, no matter what division you get into.\n\nSorry about that, but the new season has started, hence meaning you're now eligible for the 2015 rewards.
