I play a less desired role in higher elo as well (top). I can&#039;t imagine how cancer it is for someone who mains ad or mid.\r\n\r\nLike the idea is nifty to have pre set roles but this server doesn&#039;t have the fucking player base to release 3v3 and no one played fucking team builder. So why put the stupid fucking queue system on OCE. Riot are so out of touch, it&#039;s unreal. \r\n\r\nAlso what makes it even fucking worse is what it does when someone misses queue. Like one person missed queue how fucking hard is it to grab another person queued up for that role.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t give a shit about dynamic queue, so what if you face stacks or what ever. Id rather just fucking play but i can&#039;t fucking do that with the changes to the queue system. \r\n\r\nOffpeak = 20-40 min queues\r\nPeak = 5-20 min queues (usually 10-20)\r\n\r\nHell as i write this post i&#039;m fucking 35mins into queue. I even dropped after 25 to put support on and here i am. Raging on the fucking forums.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m only d3, i don&#039;t want to think of how fucked it&#039;s gonna be if i go up.","replies":[]}
