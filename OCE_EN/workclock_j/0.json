I was watching a video of Kkoma and saw he earned this skin border at the end of the game. Following up with like 3 other skin border things. Very confused as to what this is to be honest.\r\n\r\nAlso, question as to how to get Blue Essence. When I first logged into PreSeason I got a Blue Essence quest that got me 9k, and I asked a few of my friends about it. Some didn&#039;t even get the quest and other either got less than I did or more. Very confused with this new Blue Essence replacing IP thing. \r\n(Side-Note: I realized in the video that Kkoma was able to get 90k Blue Essence from the same quest I completed too...)\r\n\r\nIf anyone could answer these questions that&#039;d be great! So far the only way I&#039;ve seen people get Blue Essence is by dismantling champion shards and completing that one single quest...\r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-11T00:37:30.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot gave you extra things depending on how many rune pages you bought with RP and how many of the old runes you owned.\n\nI personally got 5 skins and 40K essence from my missions.\n\nThe whole thing is explained in the [FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115012640908-Preseason-Update-FAQ)\n\nAs of right now the only way to get essence is leveling up and disenchanting the champion shards you get. Riot may add more (or better) ways to get it in the future since most people have complained about this system already but we will have to wait and see.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-11-11T00:14:37.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the reward you get from the blue essence quest is based on how much ip you have spent on runes and runepages in the old system, kkoma probably had all the runes and runepages, the best way to describe it is a refund rito refunded the ip  you spent on runes with blue. unfortunately it wasn't a 1-1 refund, however kkoma got 90k i got 50k and you got 9k. \n\nas far as getting blue essence goes 450ip champs gibe you like 90 while 6300 give you 1kish you also get a few shards when you level up so it shouldn't be to bad","replies":[]}]}
