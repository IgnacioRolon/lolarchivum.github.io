He is much too unbalanced to be in the game and should be nerfed ASAP. My reasons for this, he is very tanky yet dishes out more damage than most squishy champions. He is extremely easy to use and anyone can play him and still dominate the game, no problem. He has a silence, true damage and an AOE spell that makes it nearly impossible to take him down while he&#039;s alone or in a group. Garen needs to be nerfed immediately, anyone else agree?{{champion:86}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-30T06:06:02.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis board is for help and support regarding technical issues with the game, your thread would be better suited over on the [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) or [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) boards.","replies":[]}]}
