It was started in March of 2011 by two friends, DrMath (James) and Legit (Stan), to be a gaming-centric community focused on a providing friendly atmosphere, a sense of family, and a team passionate for gaming free, of the drama of bloated structures and politics that often comes with it.","url":"http://www.zealotgaming.com/content.php","image":"http://www.zealotgaming.com/images/logo_current.png"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"WELCOME TO ZEALOT GAMING : A TRUE GAMING COMMUNITY\r\n\r\nhttp://www.zealotgaming.com\r\n\r\nTeamSpeak3: ts3.zealotgaming.com\r\n\r\nHello everyone, welcome to your introduction to Zealot Gaming, a community created over three years ago which now boasts over 450 members. At Zealot Gaming, a community made for gamers, by gamers, we strive to provide a fun environment where members grow through experience in teamwork, skill, and networking. While many clans are really \"looking for group\" organizations, we want to stress that we are more than just a group of people who queue up together in games. While we understand that having people to queue with is a benefit, it should not be the only reason someone wants to join our great community. We are looking for dedicated and motivated gamers who want more out of their games than a simple match history. Are you someone that enjoys partaking in the bigger picture? Are you someone who has ideas to share? Do you prefer to know your teammates better, interacting both inside and outside of games? If so, then Zealot Gaming is right for you!\r\n\r\nMISSION STATEMENT\r\nThe mission of Zealot Gaming is to provide and continually develop a fun and friendly gaming atmosphere for its members through creating a strong community setup, engaging members through activities and events, and providing more avenues to game with like-minded gamers. We aim to encourage respectful behavior from all members toward each other and non-members alike, and instill the core values of loyalty, integrity, and zeal in all of our members.\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT\r\nAs we mentioned earlier, one of our goals is to create a fun environment for all of our members. Our VOIP server (TeamSpeak 3) coupled with the use of Skype(http://www.skype.com ) and the message boards (http://www.zealotgaming.com/forum/forum.php ) makes communication with your fellow members fast and easy. We host custom game nights for all of the games that we support, and also provide contests and tournaments, often with prizes. On top of that we have a simple and efficient leadership system which provides our members with plentiful resources and many opportunities to participate in leading the contributing to the community. But as we mentioned before, you will not really know any of this unless you are involved in the community. Being active on the forums and in the game will ensure that you get the most out of Zealot Gaming.\r\n\r\nGAME SUPPORT\r\nZealot Gaming currently supports the following titles:\r\nCounter Strike: Global Offensive (EU)\r\nLeague of Legends: (NA)\r\nLeague of Legends: (EUW)\r\nLeague of Legends: (EUNE)\r\nLeague of Legends: (OCE)\r\nSmite: (NA)\r\nSmite: (EU)\r\nStrife\r\nAnd more!\r\n\r\nWe are also currently expanding into new games and hope to grow as long as our community is interested!\r\n\r\nWHAT WE LOOK FOR\r\nZealot Gaming is looking for motivated individuals that enjoy participating in gaming events and clan matters. This does not mean that members need to be outspoken, just that we appreciate those who have input to share. We value maturity, virtue, honesty, and leadership. What this means is that we prefer members who: maintain a positive attitude both inside and outside of games, make good interpersonal choices, and can admit when they have made a mistake. Most often this is all you need when playing with other people.\r\nAlso note that we do not accept any applicants under the age of 16 for legal & maturity purposes.\r\n\r\nANTI-RAGING POLICY\r\nRaging is a very real and sad part of League of Legends. Our clan has chosen to take a strong anti-raging policy. There will always be games that don't go well, and you cannot win them all. Do not feed troll players and fight back, never rage at your fellow clanmates, and do not use harsh language, especially racial and sexual slurs. Any use of these terms, just as they result in reporting by members in game, shall result in either reporting and warning within the clan, or an immediate ban depending on severity.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITIVE SUPPORT\r\nZealot Gaming also supports competitive play. Members are encouraged to play with others and discover who they play best with and form their own teams. All teams are considered \"official teams\" to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to join a team or start their own.\r\n\r\nHOW TO APPLY / JOIN\r\nVisit our website at http://www.zealotgaming.com/index.php/join/ to join! All new members must register an account and confirm their email. \r\n\r\nOnce that is done, make sure to log into the Zealot Gaming Teamspeak as much as you can. It is the quickest way to get in contact with our Admin team. The quicker we make contact, the quicker an application is processed, and the quicker you can start playing with the clan. \r\n\r\nAlong with that, Division Leadership will contact you as quickly as possible through the League of Legends Client. Our in-game names are Undecided, Farfigshitter and Colonel Wong. If you receive a friend request from any of us, don't ignore it. It's our primary way of contacting you outside of Teamspeak.\r\n\r\nNew members undergo a probationary period during which all members may vote on your membership and vote to remove you from the clan if your attitude and behavior is poor. New members are also expected to fulfill general requirements to become full members and are given 1 month to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen applying, please list your Main Game as \"LoL OCE\" in the open field asking you what other games you play. This will help us know you are applying for our LoL OCE division and our staff can contact you as soon as possible. We are currently looking for fresh faces and potential new leaders who are interested in taking the reigns of our League of Legends (OCE) division!\r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing you on the Fields of Justice.\r\n-[zG]LuckyFractal - Division Officer of League of Legends OCE","replies":[{"poster":"Ethereal Dracico","date":"2015-01-30T18:10:43.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like a great community :3 but i'm wondering, since english isn't my main language ( living in New-Caledonia so I'm basically french ) would you still accept a player like me in your clan ?
