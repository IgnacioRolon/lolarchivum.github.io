I was up against Garen so I thought I needed sustain and bought corrupting potion. However I lost lane 0-4 with even with help from my jungler. Every time I used my clone he wouldn&#039;t use his Q (probably because he knew) or any abilities. How can a wukong player beat an experienced garen?","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-06-29T15:42:43.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The advice I would offer is just spend time farming passively, if Garen wastes a skill prematurely try to punish him, don't die because  that will only tilt you further. Don't let him ambush you from bushes.","replies":[]}]}
