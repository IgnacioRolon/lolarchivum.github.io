We've all been waiting a while for this, but it's almost finished now. I'd be expecting an announcement in a few months.\n\nIn the mean time, be sure to report summoners with our current report system. It is working and people are being punished for offensive behavior.

I've posted a threat outlining the flaws with the new system, though I doubt Riot will care. We MAY one day see it mentioned and looked upon in a 'Riot Pls' post, though I doubt it. Basically at this stage the majority of bans result in players simply creating new accounts and spending more RP (which Riot actually allows), so it's in Riot's best interest to continue allowing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-18T03:06:15.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tribunal was removed for many reasons, chief among them that it was not efficient or effective in the right ways. It incentivised the wrong kind of behaviour in those involved and ultimately was not as effective as the current system. However you seem to be under more than a few misconceptions about the system so I'll try to clear that up for you. I'll get to your main post soon but it's gonna take me a while to respond to that one.\n\nOCE has NEVER had a tribunal, we have always functioned on the automated system. Tribunal in other regions was taken down for reworking. Tribunal IS coming back to other regions and IS coming to OCE. We have no concrete details on the new system yet but it will be much more rewarding, fair and effective for all involved.\n\nOnly 0.06 of players ever receive a permanent ban. The chat restrictions/14 day ban are more than effective in a majority of cases of encouraging reform.\n\nOCE Tribunal: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/tribunal-oce\nTribunal ETA: https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133246162370\nTribunal ETA 2: https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134200448962","replies":[]}]}]}
