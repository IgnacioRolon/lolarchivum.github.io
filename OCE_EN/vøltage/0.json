E.g if I had to play 4 more games to get rid of leavebuster, would the remake game count as a game and decrease the amount of games to 3?\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-17T08:49:28.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry for the delayed response, I had to chase up a few people for an answer to this one, here is the response I received.\n\n>remade games DO NOT count towards leaverbuster penalties, as you must play a full match in order for it to count.\n\nThis is currently not mentioned on any part of the FAQ for leaverbuster and remake, however the appropriate teams have been notified and it should appear soon.","replies":[{"poster":"FourInchesOfFury","date":"2016-07-22T07:53:31.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SephirothSG,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=KGTOiXqA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-17T08:49:28.527+0000)\n>\n> Hey there,\n> \n> Sorry for the delayed response, I had to chase up a few people for an answer to this one, here is the response I received.\n> \n> This is currently not mentioned on any part of the FAQ for leaverbuster and remake, however the appropriate teams have been notified and it should appear soon.\n\nIf that is the case, do you instantly rejoin the que after the game has conceded due to remakes? because if not it seems pretty unfair to have to wait an aditional 20 minutes through no fault of your own(due to someone not connecting), after already waiting for the 25ish minutes involved in the initial que time to get into the champ select+champ select +loading times.","replies":[]}]}]}
