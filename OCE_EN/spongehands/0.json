I would like to propose that you make a normal mode draft pick option.\r\nwe had that in the UK and I much preferred it. it makes choosing your position better and gets you ready for ranked with picks and bans. also stops the mirror matches which I don&#039;t really like.\r\n\r\nwill there be any consideration for this mode? it would make the game much more enjoyable for myself and I&#039;m sure many other players who like the draft pick but hate the seriousness of ranked games.

I've spoken to Riot over a number of matters and the general response has always been about a lack of player base to sustain X. In this case X would be normal draft pick. Interestingly enough, I believe normal draft pick would be chosen more over blind pick. But the one thing blind pick has over draft pick is the fact that you don't require 16 champions to do blind. Draft pick would make it harder for lower players and/or new players to get a game when the majority of normal players would probably switch to playing draft pick to avoid the troubles that come with normal pick. As I said at the beginning. The major reason for not having normal draft pick here is the fact that Oceania is a relatively new server comparatively and the player base is smaller than other regions. The current queues are already strained enough at match making, especially at higher elo. Adding one more queue to split the player pool even more would just make that strain even bigger. Once the server gets a larger player base I'm sure Riot will re-instate the normal draft pick.","replies":[]}]}
