Specifically somebody who can still be useful when behind and but with a decent skill-cap because I tend to get a bit bored with one-dimensional champs. Preferably also having decent sustain (either self-heals or life-steal) and good versatility (not being only good in the early or late game for example). I don&#039;t really care if they cant 1v5 carry a game and not too fussed about what lane as long as its not support since there&#039;s a few sup&#039;s that I do well enough with already.\r\n\r\nFor reference I like champs like: {{champion:83}} {{champion:90}}{{champion:107}}  {{champion:222}} {{champion:37}} \r\nand dislike champs like: {{champion:84}} {{champion:136}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:238}} \r\nDon&#039;t really know if there is a common theme there so take it as you will.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-08-08T12:43:38.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Ekko. He's fairly low-floor high-ceiling skillwise and you can make some pretty sweet looking plays with him once you get the hang of it.\n\nAlso versatile enough to be top/mid/jg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-09T03:18:31.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:74}} \n\nMy personal favourite champ. Depending on your elo and the matchup, easy double kills if you get ganked. You can harass the shit out of most people in toplane all through the early game. Mid-game you get a decent power spike, and late-game you can one-shot all squishies if you build correctly. To summarise, harass early, relatively strong mid, very strong late.\n\nDoubt he'll get nerfed any time soon because no one really plays him. He never gets banned and most people have no idea how to verse him.\n\nI play him mid and top, but he's also a decent support.\n\nHigh damage + high skill ceiling + loads of fun = perfection.","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2017-08-09T07:31:29.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yeah, I love when i get him in ARAM, my biggest issue is that he seems to really suck against anybody with good range and/or poke, who can destroy his turrets without even being in range.","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-09T16:09:55.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That can be an issue. Luckily for me, that's not really an issue in toplane. The main problem you can face in toplane is people with too much sustain for you to bully effectively. For example, In this current patch, {{champion:75}}  has become quite difficult to deal with because of the change to his ult and his e.\n\nMost people that are played top need to engage and have to dive into your turrets in order to get kills are usually really fun and relatively easy matchups unless you mess up.\n\n{{champion:92}}  is a good example. If she gets ahead, she can dive into your turrets and not need to worry. If she's behind, she can't do anything at all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-09T06:39:14.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny enough my main {{champion:122}} fits into your preferences perfectly. He has very good sustain with his q and has an average skill cap. Best thing is if you are behind you can still be useful as you just need to get 5 stacks off on somebody and you get 100+ free ad and you just go and dunk everyone on sight. All you really need is black cleaver then go full tank and he can still 1 v 5 the enemy team when behind. Very fun to play and my favourite champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2017-08-09T07:33:33.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only played a couple of games as him (my first was a mirror lane against a mastery 6).

Or is that just a high-elo problem? As for Gnar, I never could get into the rage bar part of his kit. It's an interesting mechanic but really hard to time well and very predictable to play against.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-08-08T16:36:48.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so panths problem late game is that he doesn't have a gap closer of any kind and his ult is easy as hell to just layer cc when he drops down. On top of that if you go for damage on him you die in an instant, on the other hand if you build tank you do no damage and can pretty much be ignored. Now as for champs to play, if you like your big wombo combos then I would say {{champion:61}}, or even {{champion:99}} assuming that your any good with your skill shots. if your after top laners I would say either {{champion:122}} or {{champion:62}}.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-08-08T11:34:16.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would probably recommend maokai, theres some skillcap stuff like w outplays and using q to hit multiple parts of your ult on one target, but also relatively simple to be ok at (especially in jg where you dont have to lane) and good utility at all stages","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2017-08-08T12:31:07.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heh, never play him jungle actually.
