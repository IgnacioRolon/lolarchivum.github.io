I am unranked and under level 30, please stop matchmaking me against Gold 1 players as it is way above my skill level and i usually lose.\r\n\r\nSeriously though. any idea why this happens? there are 27,000,000 daily LoL players so i would think that there would be some unranked players around. Does playing against bots cause matchmaking to poop itself thinking i can go 50/0 in a normal game and would never playing bots help stop it?\r\n\r\nI dont want to sound whiny but i enjoy this game a lot more on the rare occasion that my skill level and the skill level of my opponent are similar skill level.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-04-25T23:43:58.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because someone is gold or whatever other rank, it doesn't mean that they're playing at that level in normals. If I'm playing normals with friends or trying out a champ I've never played before, I'm certainly not playing as well as if I was tryharding in ranked with my best champions. Peoples performance varies alot from game to game in normals, there's no way the matchmaking can tell beforehand if I'm gunna try out a new champ for the first time or play with a fun/troll build, or play a champ I'm actually reasonably good at. The same guy that dominates you one game might feed like crazy the next cause hes playing something he's much worse at.","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2016-04-26T01:19:04.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"while that is true, some of their skill will be there regardless. Map awareness, warding, strategy (like when to push, take dragon etc) and to some degree last hitting for example. And in the case i was referring to he had the mastery badge thing so i doubt he was new to the champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-04-25T07:11:29.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is literally a difference of the matchmaking for normals  from most things, see they use the same mmr system but everything is tuned down a  notch so there is below 1k so brionze-plat then above 1k which is diamond-challenger so you cant stop it","replies":[{"poster":"Obscene Elbows","date":"2016-04-25T07:19:08.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well that explains it, thanks.
