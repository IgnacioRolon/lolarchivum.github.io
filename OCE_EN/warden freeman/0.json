The void was like a blanket of darkness, completely different to the Void that Kog&rsquo;Maw or Kha&rsquo;zix came from, for theirs was a land of mysterious creatures and filth. His void was an expanse of nothing. Even Thresh enjoyed peace and quiet, the wails of his victims were the among the loveliest sounds but even he had an appreciation for silence. \r\n\r\nThresh was deep in his thoughts, pondering the events of Bilgewater, long past, when suddenly he felt himself chosen, power suffused through the body of the spectre. A Summoner had chosen him to do battle on his behalf. Somewhere on his twisted face, Thresh smiled, it was an honour to be chosen by a Summoner.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What delightful agony we shall inflict.&rdquo; He whispered, knowing the Summoner was listening.\r\n\r\nSummoners were beings of another world, they were mysterious, extremely intelligent. Even the The Chain Warden had respect for those more powerful than he. Thresh closed his eyes as he felt the tug of the world ripping around him. He opened his eyes and found himself on the Rift. \r\n\r\nThe Rift was beautiful from the podium Thresh stood on. _Beautiful in the way that it should be ravaged,_ he thought. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Thresh turned around and saw the Champions he would have to work with : Kalista, Lissandra, Kha&rsquo;Zix and Irelia._ As long as Lucian isn&rsquo;t here.  _\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our fates are intertwined.&rdquo; Kalista declared. Her black spear embedded itself into Thresh&rsquo;s chest. They were bonded by shadow. They traveled down a lane and waited for the Krugs to emerge. Kha&rsquo;Zix needed help and even though Thresh thought it weak for Kha&rsquo;Zix to need help, he was not willing to risk defeat by letting him die to the simple rock monsters. He aimed his chain and dragged the larger of the two across the ground and sunk his hook into stone. Kalista threw her spears, and claws of the Void made quick work of the Krugs.\r\n\r\nThresh found himself facing Leona and Ezreal. _Pretty boy_. The two damage dealers began their practiced killing of minions, the mindless creatures that fought each other over nothing but carried gold on their bodies. Kalista killed the first one and stooped over it, pocketing the gold.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Ezreal fired a blast of magic at Kalista, she leapt to the right and threw a spear, Ezreal sidestepped, the spear grazing his cloak and leaving a gaping hole in it, she threw another spear except this time Leona caught it on her shield of sunlight. Thresh felt compelled to wind his hook, he threw it to where Ezreal was standing, it flew through the air with a whistle but with a flash of magic, Ezreal blinked to the left and fired another blast of magic. It hit true and Thresh absorbed it with a grimace of pain and annoyance. Another blast of magic hit Thresh, he staggered and fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nKalista grabbed him, poured life into him, green essence flowed from her into him. _Summoner spell: heal,_ a direct interference by a Summoner to aid them in battle.\r\n\r\nLeona took advantage of the momentary weakness of the spectres and threw her blade. It hit Kalista, sinking into her arm. Kalista began retreating, Leona began her rush towards her. Thresh wound his chain and swept Leona away from his partner. Stunned at how fast Thresh reacted, she retreated behind the front line of minions. Kalista nodded at Thresh and began her counterattack. She leapt to the left, sidestepping blasts of magic. Thresh felt a surge of power that moved quickly across his body, he suddenly blinked past the frontline of minions, _Summoner spell: flash_. He felt compelled to throw his chain to the very far left of Ezreal, nowhere near his target. The hook travelled in the air with a howl. Ezreal panicked, fear on his face at the sudden movement of the spectre of torment, and with a flash of magic, blinked. \r\n\r\n_Snick_, the hook sunk into bone. \r\n\r\nThresh was astonished at the prediction, he dragged the now helpless Ezreal towards him, spectral walls began to build around Thresh as he laughed. \r\nKalista leapt towards Thresh and threw a spear. A searing flash of sunlight fell, the heat stunned Kalista while Leona ran at her, catching spears on her shield as the now immobilised Kalista tried quell her charge. A lantern fell at Kalista&rsquo;s feet. She grabbed it. The spectral walls of Thresh&rsquo;s prison parted for her, welcoming her into the ghostly midst.\r\n\r\nLeona was trapped outside of the walls, helpless. \r\n\r\nA quick spear into Ezreal ended him. Kalista tore it out of him with authority. Blood mixed with dirt. They took his sack of gold and left.\r\n\r\nKalista and Thresh left the battlefield, Leona was nowhere to be seen. Thresh grinned as he tapped the glass on his lantern, it lit up with a new member.\r\n\r\nSomewhere, in another world, a stadium roared at a botlane fight. The elite of the elite were in battle on the Rift to prove that they were the best. It was the average day in Runeterra, the average day on the Rift.\r\n\r\nIt was the championship game of the world.","replies":[]}
