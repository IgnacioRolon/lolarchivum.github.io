Now we generally have a full team of friends so we don&#039;t really care but he dropped out for one game, it had been a long time since the last one and he has been placed back into it.\r\n\r\nHowever this was for the 20 minute queue despite him already going through that one for five games and not &quot;leaving&quot; games for a lengthy period of time.\r\n\r\nShould this not be five minutes or does the queue time not reset despite time passing.\r\n\r\nThank you for your answers.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T01:59:08.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Five minutes is the lowest form of low priority queue. If your friend is getting upwards of a twenty minute wait, then that means he's been leaving games regularly.","replies":[]}]}
