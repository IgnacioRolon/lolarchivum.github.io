For example, you might play jinx in ADC, but set your role to support and have your support set their role to ADC. It does work, just like it's easier to get an S on {{champion:99}} in support than in mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-04-14T06:15:43.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what it's like as an ADC but in top I generally find I can pick up an S by maintaining a cs/min over 6 and having a KDA of around 4+\n\nI'm guessing the cs/min requirement is higher for ADCs but I can honestly say I've never got an S ranking with a cs/min below 6, with the exception of one game where it was like 5.8 but I went 7/0/5.\n\nMore wards will help too. You should always have a red ward active in laning phase and throw down extra wards pretty much as soon as they're off CD. Then when laning phase ends go throw a new red ward onto your team's red or blue buff brush and replace it as needed. For the sake of 75 gold each time it'll help your overall rankings a fair bit.\n\nSo yeah. Farm more. Ward more. Die less. Participate in more kills.\n\nPretty simple really.","replies":[{"poster":"dodo hunter","date":"2017-04-15T06:04:43.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSimpleBlanket","date":"2017-04-14T05:33:38.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u watch anime","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-14T04:24:49.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-04-14T02:29:12.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a set criteria you need to achieve. For good reason too, can you imagine games where people are completely ignoring their teams just so they can get x farm, x objective assists and eventually x/x/x KDA? \n\nIn the end, the grade you receive is based on the[ **same champ** in the **same role**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery) compared to everyone else on the server. You have to be in the top x% of players playing whichever champion in whichever role (they treat annie mid and annie support differently for example). \n\nJinx has been gaining a bit more popularity recently and as a result it is becoming increasingly harder to get the S ranks on her. I have spent the past month playing a lot of jinx, and went from getting consistent A and S- ranks to averaging a B rank without much of a change in score. Like the others have said, CS plays a massive role in getting a high rank as an ADC (even getting[ 221 CS at 30 mins results in an A](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/168806470/200910244?tab=overview) unless you have a massive KDA to pad it)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-14T02:11:39.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"S based on how well you did compared to other jinx players, because jinx is a strong piece of crap late game nothing actually beats, you gotta do really really really well on her to get an S.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-14T01:37:57.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"175cs in a 30 minute game as an ADC.\n\nThat's why you got no S.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-14T01:33:11.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Improve your cs, ward a lot, die less, it's not that hard, I always get an S even when I'm playing champs I never play so I don't see everyone's problem\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Dark Lörd","date":"2017-04-14T00:48:59.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't die at all with those stats or if you killed a lot more you would have got an S.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-04-14T09:02:02.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Increase your English skills, that writing/spelling is pitiful....","replies":[]}]}
