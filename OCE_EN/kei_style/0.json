I don&#039;t care that i got banned or am i here to cry about getting banned. But i want to make it public what a joke the ban system is.\r\n\r\n\r\nso this is what happened in the game i guess i have to write the whole thing out since I don&#039;t get why if riot is going to ban you they don&#039;t send you the whole chat history of that game, so it makes you look like you&#039;re the bad person. \r\n\r\nOur team \r\n\r\nsinged top doing the usual run into tower and intionally feeding \r\nLee jungle Myself\r\nCorki mid \r\nRengar and alistair bot. \r\n\r\n\r\nso as the game went on everything was fine and normal i ganked mid twice before i would gank i would ping twice i went in and the corki just sits there farming and does nothing so as it says on the chat &quot;dont expect anymore ganks&quot;. so i left mid then i proceed to go bot to gank. they had a j4 and cait vsing our rengar and alistair they were just before the enemy tower  again i pinged and typed &quot;push it in&quot; i waited for a good 20-30 seconds and they just decided to ignore me all together and farm so ok thats fine i left bot lane and never went back down since they did not want to play as a team so i camped top and helped singed the game was fine until our bot lane started losing then proceeded to talk trash to j4 and cait about j4 (I quote) &quot;playing a cheap assassin in this patch and he&#039;s shiiit and he that he actually thinks he&#039;s good&quot; so they were having their trash talk with the other teams bot laners then our alistair decided to start on me and say im shiiit and consistently trash talk me and spam report lee all game along with rengar because i just ignore them and they were losing and feeding. and yet after the game I get banned from one game? literally it just says game 1 chat history.  what kind of ban system is this? if you&#039;re going to ban me then at least send me the whole chat history of everyone in the game.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nKei Style: do that feeding crap and i will report you -  towards singed after he started running into tower and intentionally feeding. after that he stopped. \r\nKei Style: dont expect anymore ganks                      - after ganking mid twice \r\nKei Style: push it in                                                      - while ganking bot\r\nKei Style: stfu                                                               - roughly about 10-15 min into the game when bot was talking trash with the others then started on me.   \r\nKei Style: legit                                                              \r\nKei Style: lmao                                                             \r\nKei Style: im mad ?
