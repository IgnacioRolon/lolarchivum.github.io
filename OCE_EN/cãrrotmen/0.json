It is very very unfair , not to mention completely inadequate.   But it's a graball system put in place by lazy game hosts and designers who are incapable of putting in place proper, fair and decent systems .   Put up or shut up basically,  because Riot won't discuss or review any issues or grievances.   The only time that company's like this will ever listen is when their bottom line gets affected...  so im guessing at the moment it isn't an issue,  because at the present time it's Riot first always,  and customers second always.","replies":[]}]}
