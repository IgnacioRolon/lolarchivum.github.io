Which would have been understandable however, the case in point is that Riot is reducing the amount of Exp gained throughout the game from Jungle camps of 150% to a huge 125% NOW for those who don&#039;t Jungle or play those lvl 2 gank Champs this might not seem like a big deal but for out of meta Champs or AP focused Junglers this is highly infuriating and only giving a buff to the LvL 2 gank strong Champs instead of Balancing the effectiveness or nerfing it some, this only largens the gap of the meta Junglers and doesn&#039;t reward the players who enjoy or uses strategies when gaining CS for a power spike or to as seen in pro games lets a path set up properly for a gank or to get ahead, and to catch up from behind/bad start. So Riot don&#039;t change the Exp gained, please this will ensure some Champs are still played and Jungle doesn&#039;t become a slow and low populated role.","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-02T00:19:56.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"invades and lvl 2 ganks have been mainstay since season 2 2012 this isnt new","replies":[]}]}
