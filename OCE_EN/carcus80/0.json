If you have the patience and optimism of a saint.\n2. You just play and get out of bronze after a while because you're better than the level, climb by inevitability, also can be called as grinding.\n3. If you play hard snowball fighter/assassin and snowball out of control to singlehandedly win games with it, also known as brute-forcing.\n4. Main a tank champion. And since bronze players are a bit aggressive when it comes to chases, skirmish and teamfight, and do so in true chaos fashion, being a tank provides great innate advantage for your side and elevate your chances of winning quite tangibly.\n\nChoose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Carcus80","date":"2017-03-04T10:03:20.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me give you a scenario that happened twice, I am 8/1/4 or something,\nrest of the team negative or neutral kda.

Ideally someone who can help you with the game (its always nice knowing you can count on at last one other person on your team), as well as someone you can have fun with. \nWhen I climbed from bronze to plat last season I hardly played alone and instead did most of my climbing with at least one other person and we were constantly in discord having a karaoke session and joking around. It definitely helps when the games are a bit tense or you need someone to vent to who was also in the game. \n\nThe other thing that makes it a bit more bearable is to think of it not as climbing/grinding out of x division, but as improving. It's a trick I was told by my OCS/OPL friends last year, and if its the same thing coming from a lot of our regions top players there has got to be some truth to it. \nI'm finding it useful right now as I try to get my twisted treeline rank (bronze) in line with my other two (gold). If I were to think of it as \"I must get x division, must grind arghhh\" i'd be getting pretty disheartened every time I lost a game (especially when the loss was for a silly reason and I had a glowing KDA). \nGoing up and down in rank is part of the journey, but as long as you are *focused on improving*, these small obstacles here and there won't tilt you as much because you know you will rise above this. \n\nYou can always track improvements you are making, which can put everything into perspective. \n\n* You can do it off of raw stats - number of wards placed, gold per min, cs per min, objective control (**here** is a good website for that when you have played a few more ranked games)\n* You can also do it off of how you feel - are you more confident in a particular match up, are you predicting more ganks from looking that the map, are you beginning to read team comps better, etc\n\nGL with the climb ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-02T21:27:40.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"advice*\n\nJust grind friend. If you are good enough you will climb.\n\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=carcus80\n\nJudging by your cs and stuff, you seem to be better than the average bronze so should be fine for you to climb.\n\nI mean, you have 8 more months of this season. It isn't a race. The LP grind is what this game is all about.\n\nsome tips:\n\n**focus on yourself.**\nEven if you are 10-0 and your team are 0-10, try to focus on how you can improve.\n\nMaybe you should have killed a tower instead of chasing that extra kill? Maybe you should have roamed mid to help the struggling mid laner instead of killing your opponent who sin't worth that much gold anymore? lots of things you can improve on even if your kda is good.\n\n**dont rage**.\nRaging helps no one. it just makes you angrier and more annoyed then you play as badly as the people your getting mad at.\n\n**losses happen**.\ndont dwell on losses. you will legitimately lose roughly half your games. theres no need to dwell on them.

Do keep in mind that win rate wise off of what you have said you are doing an amazing job so far, keep it up and you will climb. \n\n---\n\n# Runes\n\nFrom having a look at your stats and runes that you run I noticed that you do play a decent amount of AP champions in your champion pool, yet you don't seem to have an AP rune page. Rune pages can be expensive but I would advise heavily looking into getting a second rune page that way you can use both an AD rune page and an AP rune page depending on what champion you are playing. \n\n**The specifics of a budget AP rune page that I would advise getting is:**\n\n* Ability Power Quintessences\n* Magic Penetration Marks\n* Armor Seals (You can re-use these from your AD Page)\n* Magic Resist Glyphs (You can re-use these from your AD Page)\n\n---\n\n# Mechanics\n\nWhile you're climbing focus on improving your mechanics, this is from trading, csing, decision making, rotating around the map, every game has so many situations you can learn from to better your \"tool belt\" of references from previous situations to know what to do in your current situation. \n\nI would advise picking **1-2** mechanics at a time that you feel like you need to work on the most, then over the next 10 games or so put a heavy focus mentally on making sure you are aware of what is happening with them and look for ways to improve at them.\n\n---\n\n# Stay Consistent\n\nYou're already doing a brilliant job at climbing the ladder win rate wise and what you need to do now is just keep doing what you are doing win rate wise. Stay consistent in your gameplay and you will find that you will climb, while it may take a while it will be worth it. **Keep a positive mentality, a mind that is willing to take advice and learn, and you will climb.**\n\nA few small tips about staying consistent is making sure you always have enough sleep while you play, take breaks from time to time, and make sure you've had enough food and water as these can effect your thinking process while playing.\n\n---\n\n# Final notes\n\nThose are the main pieces of advice that I have for helping you climb the ladder, if there is a specific area you would like advice on let me know, and if there is anything you would like further clarification on let me know as well. Good luck in your climb and I'll see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
