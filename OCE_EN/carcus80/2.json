Protecting new players from experienced players.\r\n2. Maintaining fairness and creating competitive matches.\r\n3. Finding a match at all Â– the longer the wait, the lower the priority given to #1 and #2 becomes.\r\n\r\nThis isnt a case of number 3. These matches take no time at all to start..\r\n\r\nOne team has 3 people with a full set of runes and mastery&#039;s, that&#039;s a 1500g advantage..\r\n\r\n1 &amp; 2 Just arn&#039;t happening!

Just think about it; how many times are you going to be a new player in the course of you playing the game? Once. Even if you go and make a new account, you'll still have the experience and knowledge of your previous endeavours. The best that Riot can do in this situation is to match players of equal skill, so that the new players are matched with less skilled experienced players.\n\nIn addition to that, you're implying that experience automatically makes a player better. Although experience is the best way to learn, some people have different ways of learning to others. For instance, many people have no idea how to efficiently use their wards unless someone sits down and talks to them about it, or they read a guide.\n\nNevertheless, this isn't the appropriate board for such discussion.

Masteries and runes should have never been implemented.\n\nI whole-heartedly agree with you on that. I just thought you were asking for the impossible; to have new players only verse other new players. It's still desirable, but only a dream.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
