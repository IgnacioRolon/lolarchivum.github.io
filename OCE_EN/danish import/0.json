They're totally not over powered and can build damage and still be able to not die! This is a misconception...We need to remove Vayne from the game, she's just too strong tanks and outs them in a terrible position!

Champions such as Maoki, Sion and Malphite are true fun champions. I believe they should be buffed, if i have a thornmail + sunfire + warmogs why do i take damage?????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-02T12:44:09.361+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that right now tanks feel a little bit lacking when it comes to functioning as a meatshield.\nMost of them have far more damage and less survivability than they should.  There aren't many true tanks left in the game, only a small handful like Leona and Braum have kept true to the role of being a shield.  All the rest have had to take up the bruiser role in order to stay relevant.\n\nI have no love for this current meta, nor many of the champs that thrive in it.\nHowever, those of us who where around during the tank meta, will always remain wary of giving tanks too much. League is not in a fun spot right now _(in my opinion)_, but I would kneel and kiss Yasuo's feet before ever going back to that hell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2019-06-02T10:43:25.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not seeing a downside here tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"GeePee","date":"2019-06-02T10:03:10.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also if i get ganked and I am playing a tank, if i die the killer should be rewarded half gold and less EXP for 10 mins since he cannot 1v1 me, tanks should not be punished for anything ever.
