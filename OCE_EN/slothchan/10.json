BestSodiumNA just found out he had a 14 day ban from league after finding this out he proceeded to support and found out it was for boosting. Now here&#039;s my problem HE HAS NEVER EVER BOOSTED SOMEONE he only just got to gold in season 7 and only got silver in season 6. As well as this he ALMOST ALWAYS ONLY DUO QUEUES and almost never plays with anyone else. Now the only reason I see at this point he would be banned for this is the fact that he regularly plays with Me (Silver) and 3 of my friends who are all in the Bronze 3 - 5 range not to boost or help them but because HE IS FRIENDS WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYS PLAYING WITH THEM. So please riot unban my friend as he was falsely banned for something he did not do he was simply playing with friends and trying to get S ranks and mastery 7 on EVERY champion which he was doing at a good pace as he was already through maybe 15.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-09T10:05:13.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless it was said so by support (and in which case they would have proof of him boosting other players) the ban is more likely for him *being* boosted than boosting others. He can ask support to take a second look and double check if he believes this to be a false positive.","replies":[]}]}
