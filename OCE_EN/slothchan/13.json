Please Riot Bronze would be a much better place without these trolls imagine how immensely popular the game would become i know people who wont play the Oceania Region just because of the ranked, Compared to the other region's , Oce has the worst ELO trolls around A.K.A The people who would rather feed/troll in bronze 5 then actually get to somewhere like gold That is the soul reason i'm still in bronze 5, So please riot support the Oceania region and {{summoner:4}} away from Trolls using the tribunal system run by Riot games Oce staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso Please Remove Satan from the game ({{champion:17}}  :)\r\n\r\nBump/Like this post to put my message our message out to riot.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T23:54:42.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">That is the soul reason i'm still in bronze 5\n\nYou can't blame trolls for that in ranked. Because of the way it's designed, they will appear on both teams. If you were truly better skilled than that, then the amount of games you win compared to the games you lose will *eventually* get you to a higher division. If you find that you're stuck there, well...\n\nAnd many people like playing Teemo. You shouldn't just get rid of him just because *you* don't like him. That's rather selfish.\n\nI do agree with the Tribunal idea, if only we didn't have one yet. We do, but it's just in recess.","replies":[{"poster":"SlothChan","date":"2015-01-25T05:46:26.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's run by bots currently {{champion:53}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SlothChan","date":"2015-01-24T12:09:31.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trolls are a Nightmare {{champion:56}}","replies":[]}]}
