He had a special souvenir for them; an intricate carving inscribed upon cold flesh.\n---\nThe fresh corpse, encrusted with drying clusters of blood, formed the perfect backdrop for Spring's performance. The frozen horror still visible on the pallid face was carved into a grin; forced into two sharp points, stretching between the cheekbones. The glassy eyes of the victim, once bluer than the ocean itself, were now staring up into the sky and oozed thick pus that ran down the sides of the face. The hapless girl&rsquo;s delicate hands were torn off and the remaining strips of skin has been meticulously sewn together with etwahl string, though it did nothing to stop the stumps from bleeding profusely as they protested against the torture they had to withstand. As a finishing touch for the killing, the wind hummed a tune as it danced through the ambrosial apsen meadow, bringing with it the fragrant of scarlet roses and periwinkle lilacs, as if the aroma could remove the stench of blood that lingered in the air long after the murderer has disappeared.\n\nNeedless to say, there was a throng of people surrounding the body as soon as news spread of an old woman stumbling across it in the early hours of the morning, who ran back screeching and crying of omens and curses. \n\nThough the unkempt wretches in the crowd wore masks of indifference, their eyes shined with bloodlust as the sweet aroma of coppery crimson knocked them back into their nostalgia; mouths sneered in approval, then furtive glances, a passing blur. \nLurking nearby  just as the crowd dispersed, a small girl eyed the luscious hair of the corpse enviously before hastily snipping a portion of the cerulean hair. Again, she looked around warily, as if afraid of being caught, and promptly left the scene gripping her new prize in her tiny left fist.\n---\nHidden deliberately between the wild tufts of blossoming flowers and labyrinthine vines, the corpse began to decay in the humid air, and the creatures of the earth tore off pieces of flesh (a layer from here, a clump from there) until the mottled skin was left colourful with infection, glistening with blue and black.\n\nAbove, the inky canopy sluggishly metastasized, its vein-like tendrils reaching out and constricting the city with darkness. The dead night was the perfect sanctuary for the self-proclaimed Peacekeepers who prowled the rooftops of civilians - baring their teeth and claws at those who dared to approach - stalking prey with unblinking eyes. But even their sharp eyes are covered with a film of negligence; twisting their perception of reality into something unfathomable. Perhaps that unfortunate evening, the Peacekeeper watcher was weary from hunger and fear, and so she missed the lone figure standing in an alleyway, hands on wiry hips as if he was posing. \nThe sinister alabaster orbs of his, pooling with amusement, observed her in stealth as he casually stretched his back and yawned, his tongue carelessly flopping out of his jaws.\n\nHe yearned for the satisfying screams of his victims as he cruelly butchered them. How did he learn it, the talent for insatiability? It was thrashing in his mind; beckoning, gesturing, _begging_, and it would not cease until he murdered the girl. \n\nShe was imperfect, he could tell. Her tanned face was creased with worry, and her chapped lips were set in a fine straight line. Around her neck, she wore a dull locket filled with azure strands tipped in red, and her eyes darted about like a _pathetic lab rat_.\n\nHe snickered* as his eyes wandered for a moment.\n\nThe luminescent moonlight in the reflection of his gleaming eyes betrayed the thirst for spreading corruption in his wake. He hungered for the feel of lukewarm skin, the sounds of agony, the fearful expression. Above all, he longed for the death of the girl he had his eye on.\n\nBarely audible in the deafening silence of the witching hour, his guttural voice whispered huskily into the dark. \"A glass of white man's poison should go well with her succulent flesh.\"\n\n---\n***Author's note:** _S%%%%%%ed_ was changed to _snickered_ because the original word was censored for reasons only Riot knows.\n\nAdditional note: I am unable to add the word \"s n i g g e r e d\" as it is censored by %'s.
