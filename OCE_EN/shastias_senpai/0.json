As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oliviu","date":"2015-12-09T12:46:17.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick cast dose't working on R \n\nIf you cast with R button, the ultimate will auto cast 2 times.","replies":[]}]}
