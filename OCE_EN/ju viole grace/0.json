I'm currently using a HP Pavilion dm4 2011 model with  windows 7 and an i3 core processor.  I can log into the game fine and start up champ select but when it's time to enter the game it would give me the firewall error. This put me into low priority queue on my main account and costed me a couple losses. I would work fine for a game or 2 in custom but when i go into rank will not allow me in. I tried to use my smurf account DeathGodz021 to see if could use it and was able to play a bot game and then one rank before the error popped up on my screen and cost me to lose my next placement for rank. I tried repairing it and I cant run the diagnostics to see if their is a error in the files. Please help me as I have put alot of time and money into the game and its making me really angry that I cant play it for the enjoyment.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-17T00:26:34.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nWhat ISP are you with?\n\nAlso - check out [this thread](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/WlGElu7g-update-firewall-error-after-champion-select) and follow the steps there if you can.\n\nThanks!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
