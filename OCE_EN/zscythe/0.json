{"poster":"ZScythe","date":"2015-11-29T16:34:54.565+0000","title":"Boring Leona","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love {{champion:89}}  Shes one of my all-time fav champs, and my current main down in bot. The moment I Dumped the IP and bought her, she instantly &quot;clicked&quot; and only took a match or 2 before I was winning games with her. I Instantly fell in love with this champ; her design, her lore, her play style. I began hording as much fan-art as I could, and I was devastated when she wasn&#039;t in the PROJECT OVERDRIVE cinematic for her newest skin set. My next champ buy was {{champion:131}} , just so I could still be connected to my beloved champ and her world when forced out of my main role of support, contemplating their alluded-to love-hate relationship. \n\nI tell you this so you understand how much I like this champion. And how much this next bit hurts, because today, during a match, I made an incredibly depressing realisation....\n\n\n**LEONA IS BORING AS FUCK!**\n\n\nNow, I don&#039;t mean gameplay-wise like, say, {{champion:27}}  or {{champion:74}}  who have their niche audience and see little play outside of them, but in the sense that outside of her lore page there is absolutely NO kind of characterization. She has absolutely no kind of interaction with other champs or items, despite one being quite obviously connected to her very order ({{item:3190}} ). Even with the release of Diana, we didn&#039;t get any kind of interaction or banter between them, despite how intertwined their story is. We learnt nothing more about who this character is; whether she has the blind faith of her elders, or if she makes a different choice and listens to Diana&#039;s claims.\n\nAnd while the same could be said for many, if not most champion interactions, her emotes are very lackluster too. Despite one joke about not staring at her for too long, most of her emotes would suit any other strong female champs such as {{champion:102}} or {{champion:113}} and has nothing thats uniquely her. To bring up Diana again as a contrast, if you were to ever use her taunt, you would hear her grim predictions, or threat, about the moons rise and eternal night, clearly showing and reinforcing her as Diana&#039;s rival. But then if you were to use her joke emote, you would suddenly find that despite being a hard and dangerous assassin, Diana has the humanising aspect of being very bad at telling jokes, a quality unique to her character.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \n\nLeona has none of this. She doesn&#039;t even have a funny reference for a joke or dance. Even {{champion:44}}  can make you giggle with his truly _outrageous_ recital of the theme from the old cartoon, Jem. Or {{champion:72}} with his pokemon easter egg if you&#039;re willing to sit in a bush for 12 seconds. And don&#039;t forget the PLETHORA of amusing dances many champs have, like Infernal {{champion:75}}&#039;s snoop impression. There is so much potential for Leona, though. I don&#039;t know a single person who hasn&#039;t, at one point, played Leo, pulled off a clutch play, then proceeded to scream **&quot;PRAISE THE SUN!&quot;**, the popular reference to the game Dark Souls. Yet even as her last skin came out, a perfect opportunity to give her a little character, it was completely passed up on to focus on {{champion:11}}, leaving her with just some pretty new ability particles and a synthesised voice.\n\nMany people don&#039;t care about this kind of stuff, and thats perfectly okay, but for me its the little things that make a good game or story, and realising how _bland_ Leo is in regards to this is just saddening. And if any rioters see this, please do not mistake it for complaining. I absolutely LOVE her new PROJECT skin, use it every match. I also love they way all of your new champs have these little characterising interactions, telling us more about the relationships between characters and their lore. I just hope that at some point you might take some time, go back, and polish up some of the champs lacking in this area, because the smallest things can make the biggest impact.\n\nAm I alone in this? Or have some others made this realisation about their fav champs?\n\nTL;DR NO INTERACTIOOOOOOOONS!","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-12-01T17:59:03.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your point here. The default Janna skin is also very bland in terms of her jokes and taunts, and her dance is pathetic. The News Reporter skin is somewhat better designed, even if she acts like a total retard. After a couple of minutes listening to that dumbarse yank valley girl, I can't stand it, so I continue with the boring default or Hextech skin.\n\n\"Praise the sun!\" would be a good one they could add to Leona for sure.","replies":[]}]}
