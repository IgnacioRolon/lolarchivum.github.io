Not someone who paste in a few korean phrases. \r\n\r\nI was just wondering are these players in the wrong? Can anything be done about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Icy lock","date":"2015-10-20T09:07:59.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure it can be annoying that they can't communicate with you and it can be really frustrating sometimes, but honestly, it doesn't matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-10-19T17:11:17.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah for us who had come back from the NA, we have a fair bit amount of experiences in dealing with multi-languages in 1 game considering in every game on NA back then it would have at least 1 full Spanish and/or Portuguese speaker, being on our side or theirs.\n\nWhile Taiwanese have their local native languages, they all type using Mandarin (their official language) online like the Chinese (who has a shiet ton of different local native languages within their region), because pinyin only supports it as you can't really use any other input language in-game besides English.\n\nAnyway, it's not wrong to use an entirely different language, it's only bad when they do something bad with it.\n\nThe only problem here is the players playing from across the sea for no good reason, they should stick with their region unless they really don't have one, otherwise as long as there is no bad behaviour then it's not wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-19T16:40:17.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're in the void.

I just had a bad experience. I'll tell you now that it's alright only if they at least try to communicate at an acceptable level to the team. \"ADC/Mid/Top/Support/Jungle is weakness\", \"I ADC/Mid/Top because I select first\" \"Bad you doing the game, feed the stopping\" \"Premade invite no anymore do\" \"You not good feeding a enemy hard it makes for us\" is not acceptable, even if they do manage to say it correctly. The only time I'd accept it is if they said something like \"My enemy top disappear from line\"\n\nWhat annoys me is the fact I've had a non native speaker be like \"I no talk an English goodly, but I first select (insta lock) so role is gotten\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-19T11:54:40.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A language barrier isn't a reportable offence.
