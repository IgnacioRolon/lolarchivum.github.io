Basically skills have a point past which they are officially cast and cannot be stopped.\n\nTravel time is the time it takes a skill to travel the distance between its cast point and it's end point (e.g Nami bubble, Viktor Laser etc). Actions performed/cc taken during travel time WON'T cancel the skill.\n\nWindup is the cast animation that cannot be cancelled (e.g Thresh hook, Lux laser). Actions performed/cc taken during a windup WON'T cancel the skill but will usually be delayed or unable to be cast until the windup is completed (I think Zhonya's is the exception here in that it won't cancel the skill but also won't be delayed).\n\nChannel is the cast animation that can be cancelled (e.g Karthus ulti, Fiddle ulti). Actions performed/cc taken during a channel WILL cancel the skill.\n\nIn your specific example the Thresh hook has a windup then a travel time, so flashing won't cancel the hook. In the case of the Kennen ulti, it has a very short (like .2 second) channel, which seems like nothing, but since Zhonya's is a very good example of a true instant cast, if you press them at the same time Zhonya's will activate first and cancel the ulti.\n\nI couldn't tell you why certain skills like Kennen R have that tiny channel, but it is how they interact at present.","replies":[]}]}
