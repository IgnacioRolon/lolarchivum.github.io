None of what you circled seemed to connect, nor was any of it concerning or unusual. \n\nA 25% WR on a champ doesn't mean much if they only played 12 games with them. A 36% WR doesn't mean much over 25 games. Both of these players weren't even on your team??\n\nA 1 KDA means nothing over 1 game of data, and not having played a champion in ranked doesn't mean they don't play the champion at all. Unranked means literally nothing if the stats haven't been updated in 3 days. Nor does 3 bad scores in a row, particularly as an ADC versing a winning hyper carry team (Yi, Yasuo, Kai'Sa).\n\nThe Yasuo you linked had a 57% KP, so he was hardly doing nothing. I would imagine his score looks bad because he was ultimately on the losing team, much as yours did. Silver 1 isn't very far away from Gold 3, and given that MMR is hidden such a small rank difference is all but irrelevant. I'm versing and playing with plats on my S1 account because my MMR is Plat and my rank just hasn't risen to match it. That happens with smurfs, you're matched with them for a reason.\n\nThe Gnar you linked is all over the show. WR over his last 20 games is meaningless if you don't filter to ranked games. He has a 53% WR in ranked, and that's over 15 games so the last 20 was definitely including normals.","replies":[{"poster":"uNhoLeee","date":"2019-04-28T07:10:10.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't make excuses for this garbage matchmaking algorithm, i've played in enough servers and games to know (na / oce / kr / cn / oce). next game i had a 0/8 toplaner, lucky the other team was even worse, with them having 2 unranked, and you can see the result of them having 2 unranked.
