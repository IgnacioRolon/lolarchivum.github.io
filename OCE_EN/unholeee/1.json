Such is the nature of an online game catering to a staggering number of setup combinations. That does not mean those issues are not local client side, nor does it mean the common fixes won't help.\n\nThe scenario you experienced isn't exactly hard to come by, and yet there is nothing on the report a bug board or on reddit about such a bug. The most likely case then being that something somewhere isn't playing nice with your local client.\n\nEven if it's not, instead of trying the common fixes to see if they help, you are outright refusing to based on...what exactly? What harm do those fixes do you? You appear to be treating this as if a client error is somehow a personal attack against you?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-23T01:49:22.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it sounds like either your client or your connection (or both) are majorly f'ed up.\n\nIf you haven't done a clean reinstall, I would *strongly* recommend doing so with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).
