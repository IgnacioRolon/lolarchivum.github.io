I have a year away from LOL and come back to find everything has changed with runes etc. Thats fine no Problem. The thing that really p__ses me off is the huge amount of money i spent on ip boosts to then in turn get runes. I HAD EVERY RUNE ,EVERY RUNE PAGE, I HAVE 586 SKINS AND I WOULD OF SPENT WELL OVER $10 000 ON THIS GAME. I also had enough champion shards to get me the next 40 champions WHICH I PAID FOR IN HEXTECH BOXES. I also already had 80 000 blue essence which i also paid for. Then the compensation you think is fair is another 100 000 blue essence. WTF am i going to do with another 100k blue essence . That is just a p_ss take. What about 100k orange essence or 50 masterwork chests. Something that is actually worth something. I am 100% totally disappointed in this decision. To me that is basically a big f__k u to me from riot even though i supported their game with huge amounts of money. Well that shows no loyalty from riot. SO I WILL NOT BE SPENDING ANOTHER CENT ON THIS GAME. Thanks for nothing. If you appreciate your money paying customers you will investigate this and compensate me accordingly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-27T10:09:32.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were compensated with BE (formerly IP) because that was the resource used for runes. While you had the option to purchase them with RP, IP was their central currency. The RP option was for those willing to pay money to get there faster (same principle as champions). I'm sure there's plenty of more in depth explanations from around the time the change was made, but that's the gist of it.\n\nAs for what you are meant to do with the extra BE, the Essence Emporium will be coming around twice a year and will give you the opportunity to use your BE to purchase limited content, some exclusive to the Emporium, some RP content like ward skins, up to three gemstones and a whole bunch of other stuff.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014872088-The-Essence-Emporium-FAQ\n\nIf you're still not satisfied and don't want to spend anymore money on the game, that's your choice, noone is going to judge you for that. If you wish to discuss your case with someone from Riot then Player Support is your best bet, but I wouldn't get your hopes up for the answer you want.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"MONKEYWRENCH","date":"2018-08-27T10:55:55.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats exactly what i thought the response would be. Yes after the countless monies i spent on ip boosts to get the runes . Yes exactly i know how it all works thanks very much. A whole twice a year gee way to generous. So basically what you are saying is you do not care that people spent extra.. How about you take back your blue essence and instead refund me all the money i spent on ip boosts? That would be fair because i already had over 200k of my own blue essence which i had PAID for from chests.  So how about that you keep your 100k blue essence and just refund me the money i spent on boosts. Oh and yes i tried customer support who sent me here. And this is exactly the response i thought i would get. I dont do normals so i dont care about pretty much all of those things in the BE shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-27T11:30:13.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify something you seem to have misunderstood, I'm not a Rioter, and have no power over refunds or anything like that. I'm only a volunteer here on boards, just a player.\n\nThose IP boosts haven't gone anywhere, you still used them and received the value for them, it's just under a different name now, so I'm unsure what the issue is there. If your issue is simply that you used those IP boosts specifically for runes, you have been compensated that value back *and* given a means to spend it on *RP* content. The value is reduced because of the time factor. Giving a full return would be like buying a game then when you're done using it expecting to be able to get a full refund for it a year later, that's just not how it works.\n\nWas it a perfect system? No. Was everyone satisfied? Also no, that's impossible.\n\nIt sounds harsh but you were obviously willing to spend real money to get free content faster, so what's changed so drastically? You spent so much money on Blue Essence and IP at the time, and are now mad that it's what you have? I admit I'm a little confused.\n\nI'm also not sure what any of the things I listed in the BE shop have anything to do with normals, since you can use all of that content in any mode (except the ward skins in ARAM I suppose).\n\nIf support sent you here then that's your answer.","replies":[{"poster":"MONKEYWRENCH","date":"2018-08-27T12:04:57.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My whole point is the BE is useless to me right? The BE i had before the change i paid for. Understand? The boosts i paid for. If i wanted more BE i would just go buy more chests. I dont understand your comparison with BE and ip. Runes are now free and the only thing BE is useful for is champs. I already have many icons and emotes i can use orange essence on but they do not interest me at all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
