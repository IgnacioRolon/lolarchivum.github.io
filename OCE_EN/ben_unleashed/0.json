said Heizen &quot;very well then we shall kill lissandra and i will have avenged you.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbility&#039;s:\r\n\r\n-Passive-Vengeful Hunt-Heizen seeks down enemy&#039;s when within 2000 range of them he gains 30 movement speed at all ranks and applies a slow of (10, 15, 20, 25, 30)% and scaling (0.7ap) on his next basic attack No cool down.\r\n\r\n-Q-Iceborn-Heizen saps the area around him of all moisture 500 bits circular dealing (80, 90, 100, 120, 150)magical damage scaling (1.7ap) and heals him by (20, 40, 50, 60, 65) health scaling (0.7ap) 50 mana and 4 second cool down.\r\n\r\n-W-Ice Shield-Heizen coats himself in a shield of armor protecting him by (50, 60, 70, 80, 120) scaling (1.50ap)  and slowing anyone who basic attacks him by (10%ms) and stacking up to 6 times 70 mana and 10 second  cool down. \r\n\r\n-E-Piercing shard-Heizen sends out a shard of ice in the target direction in front of him 800 bits dealing (10%) of its targets max health 20% less to subsequent targets and scaling (1.50ap) 40 mana and 5 second cool down.\r\n\r\n-R-Iceborns power-Heizen grants all allies within 2000 range of him 20% ms at all ranks and allows them to freeze the target they basic attack next within 10 seconds to stun them for  (0.25) seconds at all ranks 100 mana and 60 second cool down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI recommend playing Heizen in the jungle seeing he has good sustain and cc plus some ms.\r\nI would also build him ap with  rylais spirit visage and swift boots plus ap jungle item he is also very good with cool down reduction for maximum Q dmg and mana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe starts with:\r\n\r\n-600 health +50 per level \r\n-400 mana +40 per level\r\n -330 movement speed \r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you like my character idea and i know i would like to play him hope you guys would too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ben Unleashed","date":"2016-05-31T06:01:15.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was mainly leaving this as a concept and i do realize that a lot of him needs fixing i was just hoping people would like it's concept of gameplay but still thanks a lot for the advice and i will use that advice in the future when i make more concepts and design ideas so thanks a lot   :).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2016-05-30T15:28:02.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting champion concept, the numbers need a little tuning with those Ap ratios, but a nice attention to detail in the lore a few suggestions though.\n\nHis passive Vengeful hunt has very little counterplay other than dont be within 2000 units. perhaps gating this passive with some requirements would make it more engaging, like warwicks blood scent aunit has to be under 40 % health. perhaps after hitting a enemy champion they are briefly slowed and Heizen gains a short burst of movement or attack speed. \n\nIceborn, has an interesting theme, i think however that it could be better implemented 1 on a longer cooldown so one cannot spam heals (because constant healing is generally a negative play experience unless there is a meaningful trade off (swains increased mana cost, Soraka sacrificing her health, Fiddles Immobility).  2. perhaps making a meaningful choice about when the ability is cast perhaps it could also create a frozen terrain that heals him over time while he is within it. Presenting the problem of mobility vs healing, and where and when is the ability best used underneath tower where it is safe or in the fray where the heal is meaningful. \n\nThe shield is a cool concept punishing auto attack heavy champions, although it does present unhealthy design when no counter play is present, Perhaps sacrificing mobility, (slowing Heizan) or creating a greater moment of vulnerability (longer cooldown with a negative effect while the ability is on cd)\n\nIce Shard is a nice ability being the bread and butter straight line skillshot, (max health is a bit much though) \n\nIceborn's Power is a neat concept empowering your allies so that they all have a bonus effect on their next auto attack (im assuming its only their next auto attack otherwise a 0.25 second stun on auto attacks would be broken) \n\nCool concept overall a strong theme and an interesting set of abilities.\n a good strategy when making a champion concept is to think about how the champion would feel to play, and how it would feel to play against. \n\nGood luck creating more \nDark","replies":[]}]}
