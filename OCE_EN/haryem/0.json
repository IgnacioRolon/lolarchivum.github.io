Onslaught really requires team work and players to know how to work together in an overwhelming environment, but I guess challenges for PVE game modes are somewhat limited (only a few stages with the same AIs, and will eventually be unchallenging with strategies.), so it is reasonable to remove it after a period of time.I&#039;m still a new player so I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s been any other great temporary game modes before this one, but anyone feel the same way?\r\n\r\nWas there a game mode for the burning bright release? and what do you guys think about these game modes in general?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-09-26T06:46:38.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.

As a beginner League player, I feel like the game isn't beginner friendly at all, but this mode is definitely much friendlier.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-09-26T04:35:55.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it was about as good as nexus siege, good riddance","replies":[]}]}
