JG mid and top all can dominate the game if they just get a 2 kill lead at start.\n\nThen we get to support. 2 kills on them is nothing. They barely get any stronger and they dont have much impact on the game. Yeah i get they are there to help adc get kills, but if team falls behind, support can only really do CC or try make plays, but cant carry.\n\nThey are forced to try get their adc kills, which makes there adc strong and then the adc can carry. but no love for support.\nAnd if support is the best player on the team, then that makes it a lot harder.\n\nI have seen a top carry, mid carry, jg carrry, adc carry. \nSupport carry is rare.\n\nand yes i get the whole, dont play support, but Im just thinking here about a clear issue with support characters.\n\nFrom\n-was a support main","replies":[{"poster":"4 02 2017","date":"2017-06-06T12:23:42.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes you can, if you think that then you're probably not playing support efficiently then. I'm also laughing hard at the statement 'They are forced to try get their adc kills' that is the stupidest thing to do unless you're super high ELO where people can effectively use advantages consistently.\n\nWhy else do you think blitz incurs such high ban rates L0L \n\nyour definition of 'carrying' is so distorted that it's delusional.","replies":[{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-06-06T17:32:24.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if you do play your fullest potential and still cant carry? I've had countless games where i wardrd everything, cc-ed and peel to the best i could and still lose because hey we're humans and my team decide lets throw the game by doing stupid stuff aka aim the tank or 1v5.

Is arguably a bigger asset to the team than the fed Kat.\n\nA god Thresh can look out for the whole team and make up for shitty players, but a god mid laner or ADC can only look out for themselves, so if their team is bad and there is no one to follow up on their plays, they have less of an impact.\n\nA fed Thresh cant 1v1 an enemy Fiora. But he can hold Fiora off long enough for a crappy Lucian to kill her.\n\nA fed carry brings 1 good player up above the level of the enemy players.\nA fed support brings 4 bad players up to the same level as the enemy players.\n\nSo they have different purposes.\n\nBut to be fair, some supports are prone to carrying, others... less so.\nThresh/Blitz/Lulu/Raka etc can carry pretty easily.\nWhile Bard or Janna might find it a bit harder.\nWhich is the same in other lanes too, for example a Riven or Trynd is more likely to carry than a Gnar or Mundo.","replies":[{"poster":"ZephyrWind","date":"2019-02-04T05:51:36.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing now in lower elo is that u can get feeders and throwers almost everyday.Yes they can hold them there for as long as they want. but what if ur adc just nv come? he just run to 1v4 and die there? i feel the word carring here is more like who can actually 1v5 cause in low elo like bronze(like me xd)your teammate dont listen they dont help when they play bad they either just go fed the opponent or afk and toxic talk.I feel its more of a bigger problem in lower elo and its farely a big one.sup is not really useful in low elos.trust me xd, U dont know what bronze&amp;Iron 2019 is like","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-06-06T09:06:49.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree with you, but a few points, 1, fiora would kill shitty lucian anyway\n2, bard support, i have had way easier times carrying than with raka","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-06-15T16:39:28.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankfully, the rareness of support mains in low ranked games means you usually have the luxury of being up against an annoyed autofill victim, with no idea about how to play the role.  This certainly makes carrying easier.  I had an account that started b5, and after trying all sorts of positions on it, I actually was doing better at support (not my main role on my main acct by any means) than at anything else.\n\nSupports are the people who normally win bot lane, they just don't get the kill, they land the cc and wait for the damage to right click somewhere in the vicinity of the immobilized enemy.  Watch some high level support streams for examples.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-06-07T05:01:03.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen Brand supports who carry games just by landing their combos or even a few spells. \n\nOnce they get a good lead in lane they usually can one shot squishes on the enemy team.\n\nGood Thresh players who can curve their hooks are a nightmare to lane against so I must say if you're good at Thresh or landing hooks pick Thresh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-06-06T22:32:51.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh, supp, i can carry a 3v5 if i need to, reason being (aside from the fact that i play him way too much) an ignite, with ad scaling runes and the right masteries, can easily secure kills if need be, and should your adc be complete garbage you can just go AD thresh and carry from that, i believe this also works for leo (ad or ap) and critzcrank\n\nBut other than the tanks, i don't think the squishy healer supports can do anything\n\nand the mage supports just play them as if you were playing them mid = carry","replies":[]},{"poster":"davejones","date":"2017-06-06T01:53:28.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i wanted to compare a fed support to a fed any other role in the poll, but ran out of space.\n\n\nI mean if you could have a pro in your team to play any role, and you wanted to climb really fast, would you put him as support?\n\nor if a friend asked, what role should I get really good at to climb solo q, would you say, yeah support is good for climbing?\n\nI mean play the role that makes it most fun.
