Her sigils suspended within the hook atop the staff lit a trail of ghostly purple light, offsetting the twist of darkness and midnight blue spun within the glassy walls of the Black Rose. \r\n\r\nThe chatter of her disciples faded when she melted out of the shadows and stepped into the light of the meeting hall. Every step was silent leading up to the altar. Every movement was slight and calculating. \r\n\r\n_Patience._\r\n\r\nWhen Leblanc, Lady of the Black Rose, the eldest sorcerer of Noxus claimed her seat on the risen platform, the entirety of Noxian aristocrats as well as intellects from foreign lands bowed at her pale feet. Amethyst eyes scanned the ocean of bent backs, and she laughed. \r\n\r\nIt was a wicked laughter. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;There is a traitor amongst you,&rdquo; she announced, her smoky voice carried around the vast space. She need not raise her voice. This was her domain, a place where she controls all that mortal eyes can see, and much, much more. Her followers flinched, the sea of bodies twitched uncomfortably the way a disorganised colony of ants behave when their home was blocked off. \r\nSuch weak creatures they were. Such a weak creature she herself once was! Without a clear leader, humans all scramble madly for power, for any self-assurance that their legacy was not to be lost. \r\n\r\nLeblanc&rsquo;s lips twisted, savouring the way her infinite magic began to gather. Every other Leblanc, matron of the Black Rose that came before all had their own irrefutable way to obtain and retain the blind faith of these people. She can too. \r\n\r\nShe released her magic with an exhale, and her followers watched in horror as wisps of imperial purple as bright as the sunlight which had cast a spotlight on the throne snaked around, curling and disentangling until they found a source of interest. \r\n\r\nLeblanc snapped her fingers. The wisps entered the chosen victim, branding them with a sigil similar to the ones in her staff. They flailed, screamed, cried out for mercy, pity as distraught onlookers watched, frozen in fear. \r\n\r\nFamilies that had ancestry roots tracing back to the founding of the Black Rose recognised this symbol. This ghostly caricature of a rose seared scenes of unspeakable horror inflicted by Leblanc as punishment into followers. The pale ones have always favoured using fear as the ultimate tool to ensure faith and balance, just as any deity would. \r\n\r\nLeblanc stood from her throne, and for a moment she wavered: the very image of her being shimmered like a hologram from the best in Piltover, but it was impossible. No magician in Valoran is able to cast such powerful and horrifying spells with some sort of clone, right? \r\n\r\nThe sigils snapped, the soft crunch of a petal being crushed was soon echoed with bones snapping and cracking as the magic began to distort the flesh prison of infected personnel. Wailings of the damned continued long after the image of Leblanc faded from the altar. \r\n\r\nThe lucky survivors grovelled and kissed the floor she had threaded on. Or maybe it was really only just a clone that had graced them with its meaningless presence. \r\n\r\nTwo stood out from the crowd. It was a handsome young man with strong shoulders, broad and capable holding a petite young woman with dark locks against his chest. She was heaving, hysterical cries drowned out by the praises of Leblanc&rsquo;s disciples. The man&rsquo;s eyes shone with defiance towards the altar, a turmoil of mortal rage and vengeance shifting in his eyes. \r\n\r\nLeblanc chuckled darkly. \r\n\r\n_Here you are._\r\n\r\nThe girl eventually calmed down, and the man kissed her tears away. \r\n&ldquo;Will you seek revenge for your father?&rdquo; she asked, holding her breath. He glanced around the cavern before making a small, determined nod. \r\n\r\nThe girl stilled before leaning back into the man&rsquo;s chest. She blinked, and for a split second her eyes were amethyst, decorated with black streaks from her eyelid downwards. \r\n\r\nLeblanc sneered. Perhaps this young man, however great his potential, wasn&rsquo;t fully worth the faithful old aristocrats she chose at will. \r\n\r\n_Shame. _","replies":[]}
