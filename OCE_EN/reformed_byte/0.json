If you're not satisfied with their response, reply to me here and I may review it, but regular PS should be your first point of contact for any issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Reformed Byte","date":"2017-10-24T04:16:36.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I've been trying to make a support ticket for about 1 hour now.\nEvery time I press submit I'm redirected but no new ticket is made?\nI tried on Chrome and Edge.\n\nIs there an issue with Ticket creation right now?\n\nEDIT: On second thought, don't worry. I will try to resolve the issue on my own.

There were no tickets coming in during the hour that you attempted to make one.
