People can duo in norms with very different ELO's, plats can play with bronze if a bronze has a plat friend. I think there's measures that stop it in ranked, or at the least there's a hefty loss of LP if the plat happens to lose and not much LP gained if he wins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-10-04T04:39:33.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a norm. You play with every type of player. High elo players usually have bronze-silver normal MMR because they don't play normals as much, hence they get matched with bronze and silver players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-03T15:53:17.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it should because its normals and all of them are a shit elo.\nYes I know I'm Silver, so yes I'm calling myself shit.","replies":[]}]}
