To hit her q she has to either be running from being chased or position herself so risky to get a minor bit of health to heal her squishy ass.\n2. Learn how to play versing her. Don't just say op. There is most probably a strategic route. Sayyyy make sure your adc is well and safe and roam while soraka is now useless because she can't kill your adc under turret. All she can do is heal.","replies":[]}]}
