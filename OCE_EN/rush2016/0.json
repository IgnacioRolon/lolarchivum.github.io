Currently Level 21 and learning. After the new season started, I am unable to watch any Ranked games on the client in the OCE server. All the games are normal games with low ELO players and noobs. When I contacted RIOT support, they asked me to start the discussion here so that they can look into this matter. Any thoughts fellow summoners?","replies":[]}
