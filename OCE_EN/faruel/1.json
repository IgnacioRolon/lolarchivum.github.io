At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League's first summoners.\" and this person existed in there world.

They just aren't magically wired that way, it would be like having one guy whose only impactful power is to bring (or summon) another guy unto the field while the first guy (ie the summoner) is in direct danger of dying himself, and god knows what would happen if the summoner would die and then the guy he summoned died as well, so then he cant summon him back to life.\nIt makes my head spin but you get the point im sure","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Strawberry","date":"2015-01-18T06:18:54.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very cool concept, just a bit of confusion on my part - what do you mean by her passive allowing 3 uses of the gate? In fact, if you could generally explain her passive a bit more to me that'd be great, as I'm feeling dumb and don't get it.\n\nQ - Very cool and different idea, would be like Leblanc passive but flashier, though wouldn't it be a bit obvious to anyone currently looking at the target? (or perhaps thats part of the nature of the ability, I'm not sure :) )\n\nW - Nice ability, the instant mana burn is interesting and it seems like a good idea that you didn't make it entirely mana-burn based with the HP damage\n\nE - Fairly basic ability, targeted damage with a somewhat predictable version of a fear, which makes it interesting for followup. I'm guessing they can't cast spells etc. while affected?\n\nR - A nice ultimate - like Reksai tunnels for everyone - a couple of questions:\n\nWhen the spell ends, does the new gate stick around? And does it get rid of the gate created off passive?\nThe max HP damage seems a bit low - DFG deals 15% max hp damage for reference - don't be afraid of ramping it up a bit to make your enemies think twice about using it.\nDoes the gate(s) block movement?","replies":[{"poster":"Faruel","date":"2015-01-18T12:08:50.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK lets start with the \"R\" since that works with the passive.\nthe gate u begin play with is so u can get an anchor or midpoint for the ability. the gate itself cannot be harmed however dose not prevent movement (similar to a thresh lantern) and produces no sight (so no permanent wards) when the \"R\" is off cooldown u can place a new gate so long as it is not more the x distance from the old gate, when placed both the old and the new gate have effects so people know it is active an when walked to and clicked they get warped to the other gate. so champion \"A\" is on your team they warp and get a debuff so they cant turn around and use it again during this cast, champion \"B\" an enemy uses the gate with the same effect and same debuff as well as damage because enemy, and \"C\" Eris uses the gate she can warp there turn around and go back through it and come back again (3 uses) before receiving the debuff. after the spell ends the old gate disappears and the new gate becomes the new center point of the spell, i held back the damage because of the powerful utility of the spell but as with everything in a work in progress it could be tweaked to make it more risky. \n\nso Q, it would depend on the animation i perceived a smoke like effect to obscure the champion so u don't know however making it realizable to those who are observant might not be a bad thing either\n\nE, yep similar to fiddlesticks fear all u can do is watch and laugh or cry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2015-01-18T01:21:36.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting concept...
