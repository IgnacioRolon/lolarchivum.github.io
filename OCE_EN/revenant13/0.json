Before each player picks they ban 1 champion eg.: 1st pick would ban 1 champ then pick their champ. The next two picks on the enemy team would ban at the same time, 1 each, and then simultaneously pick their champions. This continues until everyone has picked a champ and banned a champ. This gets everyone involved in the banning process and makes this process more interactive. Rather than simply banning what is strong you can see what team comp the enemy are building and ban against their comp eg you see them picking a couple of knock-up champs so you ban Yasuo. This would not increase the length of champion select significantly and would get everyone involved in the ban phase. Let me know what you think and any improvements you would make to this system and, if you think its a good idea, help Riot see this post for some ideas as they recently mentioned they would like to make changes to the ban phase of champion select.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Revenant13","date":"2016-11-26T21:30:46.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback, I havn't been on the sub for ages so its great to know someone already had this idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-26T12:18:27.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea of ten bans... but with the system your recommending you might as well make it 9 bans, because wtf is the last guy gonna do? Everyone has already picked, his ban is literally useless.\n\nA better system would be, two players from each team ban then pick, and then the next three players ban and pick. This means that everyone's ban is somewhat useful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-11-26T11:13:19.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both teams would have to have a ban before first pick otherwise one champ would get an op and ban the next best....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-11-26T07:54:48.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already said they would implement a 5ban system","replies":[{"poster":"Revenant13","date":"2016-11-26T09:49:24.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but they didn't say how they were going to do it. 5 bans at the start of the pick/ban phase as happens now with the three ban system would just mean that the next 4 op champs would be gone, and it wouldn't make any difference to the strategy of banning.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-11-26T10:28:46.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True but Ive seen this exact or similar idea posted on the sub and it seemed pretty popular, a couple rioters even commented on it","replies":[]}]}]}]}
