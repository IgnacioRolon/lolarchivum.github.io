Implement a feature where, once you get 100k mastery points you can choose a free 1350rp or less skin that is available at the time. This would encourage people to play the game a lot to get the free skins, because skins are really expensive, especially for a lot of league players who are young and are studying (ergo don&#039;t have a lot of money) but still want to express their love for their favourite champs. It would be another form of progression (maybe Riot could design a special 100k mastery skin for every champ, only available through reaching 100k that would be 1350rp quality instead of players choosing a skin).","replies":[]}
