It is something the community has asked for for as long as league has been around, and you guys are finally delivering it. The format is very similar to that of spectator mode, which aids in its intuitiveness. I have but two insignificant gripes with it. There is no option to remove fog of war completely. The second is even less important. As a long time civ player I am used to being able to click and drag across the screen to move the camera, it feels intuitive to me. I am sure that many out there feel the same way. I am certain this feature would not be difficult to implement and would greatly improve how intuitive and natural the replays system works. Thank you to the development team for listening to the community. It seems as though League of Legends is turning a new leaf (or plant). Bringing back solo queue, replays, the announced sandbox mode, satan teemo, baker pantheon. I have the feeling that season 7 will the best year for League of Legends ever.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}
