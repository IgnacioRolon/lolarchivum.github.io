Without more details, such as the chat logs relevant to the ban, no one here will be able to provide detailed context on that.\n\nIf you believe you've been falsely punished, you can appeal the ban by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option), and the case will be manually reviewed.","replies":[]}]}
