The reason that supports are there are to protect the adc and to decide when to initiate fights in botlane (unless you are an adc with a strong initiate {{champion:22}} ). Heaps of people don't realise this. They also don't realise that even if they are an adc they will have to spend a little bit of gold to place some wards or at the very least use their trinkets. \n\nIts hilarious that in bronze, many of the adc 'mains' that I have laned with know almost nothing about the support abilities.\nI recently had a caitlyn tell me to give her mana (and then get really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me) as a sona. \nI had my adc get really pissy at me because I wouldn't heal him as karma.\n Had another adc and jungler annoyed at me because my ult (as lulu) was on too long of a cool down, even with 40% CDR\n\nOccasionally you will find a true adc main who knows about these things, so keep trying to find the one with a higher IQ :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-12-30T13:21:55.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I spent half of Season 4 being a Supp main and the other half being an ADC main and all I can say now is, don't bother SoloQing a botlane role unless you have God tier patience to deal with the amount of arrogant %%%%ters that play ADC and the amount of sooky %%%%ters that play Supp. Don't forget that it's very likely that the person laning with you was forced into Supp by being last pick or took ADC simply because they don't wanna Supp. /vomit","replies":[]}]}
