I notice that though it freezes up, when I am alt tabbed out from the game, I can hear the noises of the game (abilities, pinging, kill announcements etc) as if it was running normally. When I alt tab back in it says attempting to reconnect once more, everyone freezes and all sound stops. Given I can buffer 720p+ videos very reasonably, it is definitely clear that there is nothing wrong with my internet.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-05-02T09:20:07.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having some crazy experiences with my internet.\n\nFor the last 2 weeks or so, every few minutes from the moment I enter the Rift, my game will randomly start to \"Attempting to Reconnect\". I'll be walking to lane right into my enemy when my game \"attempts to reconnect\" and I get killed because I couldn't move my champ. What's funnier is that some of the time my MS/ping stays at 59 (my average) while disconnected.\n\nI later found out though, that it was something with my internet, because at the exact same time, my brothers would have the same problem while in a game, so there's something wrong with my internet that keeps making it disconnect\n\nAll I'm saying is that you're not alone {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedPandaFox","date":"2016-05-01T05:11:57.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nYou may have too Contact Riot Support on this, \nGiven as There is a issue going on somewhere.\n\nHave you tried Going on a different computer too see if the issue stays?\nContacting your service provider too ask if there connection issues / delays\nRun a Internet test?\nOr Just contacted Riot as there may be something wrong.\n\nHope your issue gets fixed! :)\n\n-RedPandaFox","replies":[]}]}
