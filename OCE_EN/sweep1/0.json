No biggie in itself, but what does annoy me a little bit is the locked honour level right at the end of the season. No rewards for me, I guess. \r\nHere's the chat logs:\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\n**Pre-Game**\r\nsWeep1: uhh\r\nsWeep1: dont die\r\n     (context: Darius asked for tips on how to play Darius bc it's his first time)\r\n**In-Game**\r\nsWeep1: tryndamere WITH teleport\r\nsWeep1: *insecurity intensifies*\r\nsWeep1: pantheon you lovely man\r\nsWeep1: panth take scuttle\r\nsWeep1: or dont\r\nsWeep1: listen now no need to be toxic\r\nsWeep1: im trolling \r\n     (Context: I'm playing Trundle. That's what I mean by trolling, I was going 6/1 at one point, so not really \"trolling\" by definition)\r\nsWeep1: shes playing kayle jg\r\nsWeep1: obv not\r\nsWeep1: ill clear my redside then i back then i hit top\r\nsWeep1: shouldnt it refund if the ult doesnt come through\r\nsWeep1: shouldve let him push\r\nsWeep1: i have no gap closers\r\nsWeep1: he was there\r\nsWeep1: wtf is he doing\r\nsWeep1: guess we're not fighting him\r\nsWeep1: lil bitch\r\n     (Bit rude, I know. But I was jokingly referring to the enemy Tryndamere that kept running away from me in team chat. No hard feelings.. just yet at least)\r\nsWeep1: ??????\r\nsWeep1: darius: \"first time darius help is appreciated\"\r\nsWeep1: darius now: get ks'd enjoy the win\r\nsWeep1: ok thanks\r\n     (Our mid laner Pantheon ks'd the Darius once or twice, which triggered him a lot, Darius is now threatening to throw the game)\r\nsWeep1: is she ok\r\nsWeep1: for what\r\nsWeep1: thats not reportable\r\nsWeep1: its not\r\nsWeep1: ks'ing isnt the same as griefing\r\n(Is it? I wasn't 100% sure but as far as I'm concerned ks'ing someone 2-3 times isn't a reportable offence)\r\nsWeep1: not trolling btw\r\nsWeep1: im trolling\r\n     (Again, Trundle. Not actually trolling.\r\nsWeep1: see she gets it\r\nsWeep1: nah thats panth\r\nsWeep1: hes managing to tilt darius by winning\r\nsWeep1: i thought your invulnerability turned off after the swords fall\r\nsWeep1: apparently not\r\nsWeep1: how did you feed him this much\r\n(Darius was going around the 0/7/3 mark at this point)\r\nsWeep1: ??????\r\nsWeep1: hes not the reason you died\r\nsWeep1: how so\r\nsWeep1: how does that make you die\r\n(Darius blaming the Pantheon's ks for him losing lane, not the fact that he kept fighting a Tryndamere alone rather than waiting the extra minute for me to come up so we can collapse)\r\nsWeep1: PANTH\r\nsWeep1: you saw her\r\nsWeep1: being a sulky little bitch thats what'\r\n(Alright, fair enough. Maybe this was a little bit out of place here, but Darius was whining and flaming all game and I just wanted him to shut up. In hindsight, should've muted him, my bad. Still don't think this is as bad as what could've been said.)\r\nsWeep1: sivir come with\r\nsWeep1: you cant even blame that on being a first time darius\r\nsWeep1: youre legit inting now\r\nsWeep1: that item build\r\n(He was building Statikk Shiv into Phantom Dancer against a Tryndamere, not exactly a reasonable item build. I could've probably pointed this out to him before he got 2 items in, but I wasn't paying much attention to his build. I was busy trying to get my bot lane ahead as soon as possible.)\r\nsWeep1: WE NEED A TANK IN TOP LANE\r\n(We didn't really have much of a tank beside me, a Trundle with just over 2k HP)\r\nsWeep1: A DRAIN TANK\r\n(Referring to myself. Turns out Trundle isn't really a drain tank either. That's that.)\r\nsWeep1: id rather be toxic than useless all game\r\n\r\nThat's the whole context for this. Now, is this justified? This isn't ranked, this was draft pick norms, if that makes any difference. \r\nAlso yes, I know I type a lot. I'm a very chatty person ingame because I just enjoy communicating with people, whether they are feeding or not. At least in unranked games, this is the case.\r\nIf you say this is justified, feel free to leave your reasoning in the replies. I'll read through them and see what I can do better in the future.\r\nThanks for the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"Veximus Maximus","date":"2019-11-18T03:36:46.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone on a 10 game chat restriction, just dont talk to your teammates, at all. \nJust mute the entire lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"sWeep1","date":"2019-11-18T03:51:34.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Veximus Maximus,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=anyfoJjU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-11-18T03:36:46.181+0000)\n>\n> As someone on a 10 game chat restriction, just dont talk to your teammates, at all. \n> Just mute the entire lobby.\n\nfair enough, guess ill do that from now on.","replies":[]}]}]}
