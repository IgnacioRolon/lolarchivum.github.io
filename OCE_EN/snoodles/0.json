Tactical Gaming is currently recruiting members!\r\n\r\nTactical Gaming (TG) was created in November 2004 to bring together like-minded gamers from around the globe and from multiple platforms (Consoles, PC &amp; Mobile), to provide them Head Quarters (web site) where they can share their backgrounds, experience, and interests in teamwork and tactics, as well as providing them with an environment that allows a &ldquo;friends-first&rdquo; experience in the online community.\r\n\r\nWhat we believe\r\nWe believe that regardless of origin, nationality, age, gender, race, religious beliefs or creed, disrespectful behavior towards one another is unacceptable. The same belief is applied to gaming. With the notion that so many people share the common passion for video games, the vision and mission is to bring together like-minded gamers from around the globe and from multiple platforms, to provide them head quarters (web site) where they could share their backgrounds, experience, and interests in teamwork and tactics, as well as providing them with an environment that allows a &ldquo;friends-first&rdquo; experience.\r\n\r\nSquads\r\nTactical Gaming is different from other communities because we offer Squads! Instead of finding people, you will be placed with people of your skill level. You will be placed with 4+ other members (including a leader) getting better at mechanics, teamwork, call outs, etc.\r\nIn these squads, you will have 2 mandatory practices. These practices will be held at 6pm on Sundays and Wednesdays (will vary depending on state or if from NZ). If you feel like the team needs more practice then ask the leader for some optionals.\r\n\r\nLeaders of TG know that we all have lives outside of League so please keep in mind to tell your leaders that you can&#039;t attend a practice. 6 AWOLS or 3 consecutive AWOLS will result in an automatic discharge. AWOLS are also permanent.\r\nWhat we offer\r\nTeamspeak Server\r\nSquad with people around your skill level/tier\r\nForum\r\nRanking system\r\nMultiple gaming divisions\r\nPractices will be at 6pm (may vary) every Wednesday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nHow to Join:\r\nSimply click the following link to register\r\nhttp://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/index.php?app=core&amp;module=global&amp;section=register \r\nYou should receive an email within 2 days if you have been approved, then follow instructions to complete your boot camp. After that you will be assigned to a squad and will be ready to start playing! By the way for LoL OCE put down 1st battalion, not 2nd. Also if you have registered please reply here stating that you have done so.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters: http://www.TacticalGaming.net \r\nAbout us: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/news/tactical-gaming-history \r\nWhy TG?: http://www.tacticalgaming.net/hq/news/about-tactical-gaming","replies":[{"poster":"JGambit","date":"2016-01-10T12:57:08.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"done but accidentally hit 2nd battalion","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brother Zapha","date":"2016-01-08T11:24:38.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"done","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master DuSt","date":"2016-01-07T01:41:08.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all done and....DuSt-ed AHHH","replies":[]},{"poster":"deathbadgar","date":"2016-01-05T05:58:43.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Applied","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jax the Ripper","date":"2016-01-03T10:16:06.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Applied.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moit Senpai","date":"2016-01-02T03:38:12.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Registered :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Woozi","date":"2015-12-27T08:05:11.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just registered but I made a slight error and put 2nd battalion instead of 1st so hopefully it works out D:","replies":[{"poster":"Snoodles","date":"2015-12-28T00:18:29.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"np mate we're sorting it out for you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Love yourself","date":"2015-12-27T05:00:31.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive registered just then","replies":[]},{"poster":"yrtqfgwe27rtfyiq","date":"2015-12-24T03:42:35.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ummm i changed my name from shacode to darkesis so do i need to make a new forum?","replies":[{"poster":"Snoodles","date":"2015-12-27T00:41:01.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no mate it'll be fine :) have you been accepted yet? if not add me on league and i'll sort you out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ivy Valentine","date":"2015-12-23T13:49:59.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oodles and oodles of snoodles","replies":[]}]}
