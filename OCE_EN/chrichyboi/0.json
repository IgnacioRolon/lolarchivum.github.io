There are AFK&#039;s, trolls, babyragers and many more annoying things that make it impossible to win and get out of low elo hell? So I am asking RIOT, what is the trick to get out of bronze? How do you &quot;climb&quot; out of elo hell? I sometimes start the game off 4-0, but somehow we still lose. I&#039;m not sure if it is broken champs in the opposition or anything but I&#039;m not sure. All i know is that there some champions that need some serious nurfs. You guys at riot need to look at that because I&#039;m becoming sick of the game putting me in a bad mood. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Chaos","date":"2016-07-02T22:06:17.605+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Afks, trolls, ragers are not just limited to bronze. I've had gold and plat players troll because someome said something that \"upset\" them. Here are some tips that might be useful on helping you start to climb.\n\n1. Don't die so much. KDA doesn't make or break games, but if you die alot then your creating a numbers advantage for the enemy. Every death after 20 minutes could result in easy baron for the enemy or multiple objectives,\n\n2. With the new champion select you really only need to know 2 roles, (i know autofill but that is minimal at moment) so know a couple of champs for your 2 roles and know what they can do and there limits. Don't pick a champ that you've never played simply becasue it's a counter just play what you know and are good at.\n\n3. If you blow your opponents summoner spells let your team know. Say mid flash down, or they tp back to lane. IF you use tp let your team know that enemy has tp advantage and you can't join the fight in bot lane as quick.\n\n4. Practice your cs'ing in normals or bot games try to aim for 100 by the 20 minute mark when you can consistently do that try aim higher.\n\n5. Ward, buy a pink it's only 75gold and place where you think it will give you the most value for its money.\n\n6. If players are raging mute them, never use all chat it's not going to give you any advantages. Use pings when your enemy laner is missing, check the minimap, if other laners opponents are missing then ping mia from there lane. Don't rely on people to always ping mia.\n\n7. Take responsibility. If you lose think what could I have done differently that could've provided a different outcome. Sure some games it's completely out of your control but alot of the time there will have been something you could've done differently that would've altered the out come.\n\n8. It's not over until it's over. The enemy is just as likely to throw and create an opening for you to come back in and get the win.\n\n9. It;s just a game, if it's putting you in a bad mood stop playing. Play some normals or aram or another game. If you're in a bad mindset you are more likely to make mistakes. \n\n10. Just enjoy it, the more experience you get the better you will eventually become.\n\nHope some of that is useful to you\n\nEdit. I just checked your profile in the client. Stop playing ranked until you have both your rune pages full. You're missing 7blues from 1 page and 8blues from the other. You are putting yourself at a huge disadvantage by not having a completed rune set up. When  you get the ip to complete them then go back to rank but until then i'd suggest normals or bots or aram just to get the ip to finish them off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-04T02:04:09.646+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWelcome to the Ranked climb!\n\nIts great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!\n\ntaken from earlier comment - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/zVgleF4L-im-loosing-rank-even-more?comment=0000","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-07-02T13:34:43.083+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a fellow bronzy, you have to just improve your own game play, ignore all the trolls and mute if necessary. Warding, trading and CSING. Focus on improving not climbing. Also at B5 3LP you should probably just try and get to B4 before you are thinking silver","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-07-05T06:35:28.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play ADC personally to climb, mostly because you have a higher chance of carrying the game purely because of the second person in your lane who you can carry easily.\n\nMy reasons that ADC is the best role to climb with:\n1. CS'ing - You literally have someone there to protect you whilst you CS and allow you to focus on it almost completely if you so desire.\n\n2. If you should be climbing, you will leave laning phase with a stronger support and adc, which is a bigger impact than any other lane can provide leaving laning phase.\n\n3. Snowballing, if you can get ahead in lane you can snowball much easier with two opponents to get kills off and extend your gold lead that way.\n\n4. Ganking, you as two people have a much higher kill potential when ganking than just one person and can gain your team the advantage that way.\n\n5. Dragon control, your lane is crucial to maintaining neutral objective control and if you do deserve to climb you will make the right calls of when to take this and extend your lead that way.\n\n6. Enemy blue/red side jungle control, botlane should be warding alot more than any other lane in the game and this gives you control over your side of the jungle and once you take outer tower you can extend into their jungle and control that.\n\n7. Late game, as ADC your job is to be strong late game and often in low elo this is the deciding factor, who has the stronger late game comp. Just having better positioning than them is enough to carry a fight yourself.\n\nThat is why I believe mastering ADC is the best way to get out of bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-07-03T07:48:31.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing to do with trolls, ragers, et cetera. Yes, they will cause you to drop the odd game, but there's not enough of them to bring your win rate down below 50%. Basically, if your overall win rate is even 51%, you will climb, albeit slowly. \n\nFor us mortals, there is but one secret.\n\nAs boring yet effective as hack-a-Shaq in the NBA, spam-a-champ works. Just find one champ that you find easy and just spam it. Not only are you good with it to start with, you'll get better as you face different match-ups and better players.\n\nI personally refuse to do it because it's not fun. I did it when I dropped from S1 to S3 and was really pissed and just spammed. It worked, but that got really lame really fast.\n\nI used to blame trolls and whatnot as well. Sorry to break it to you, but it's not trolls and afkers - as fuckin' annoying as they are - it's you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"≈Åeader","date":"2016-07-03T02:16:49.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never think that you should be in a high rank.
