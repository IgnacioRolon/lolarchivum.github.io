My Social tab keeps reconnecting and disconnecting.. Currently Disconnecting Reconnecting to Chat for the exact same amount of time...Also cant connect to pregame lobby chat at all.. Its not an Internet issue ive tried on multiple locations and different systems and have the same issue when i log into my account... it works fine when i log in to another account... I feel like this has something to do when we transferred/migrated to riot games account as its only happened since then.. Any chance it didnt sync up or something when accounts got migrated over?\r\n\r\nThis is massive bummer as ive used this account for 6 years and all the money ive spent on it... also as a streamer and have made so many friends and contacts through this account, now cant even send a message to anyone on the client..\r\n\r\nRIOT pls Help..\r\n\r\nOzzyKent","replies":[{"poster":"FloopMaster","date":"2019-11-29T09:59:00.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yooo I tried playing this morning and i couldn't login.
