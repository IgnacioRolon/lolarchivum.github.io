Here is the information for optimum recreation of this bug\n\nThe game was ranked and i had the frosted ezreal skin on. Only the Q did not recieve the 1.5 second cooldown bonus. Other abilities such as R did.\nThis only hapoened when using Q on monsters i particularly noticed on wolves. Using Q on minions or champions had the Q reduce its own cooldown as per normal. The Q text states that if it hits a target the cooldown is reduced not if it hits a non monster. Also it only does not reduxe the Q cooldown whilst decreasing the cooldown of all other abilities by 1.5\n\nEdit: Just tested this yesterday and this is still an issue. Note this was in a normal game i had no sheen item and it only happened on the wolf camp\n","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-02T07:35:43.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I tried to recreate this in a custom game and everything appeared to be working as normal. On one occasion I was able to stand on top of a wolf before using the Q and it looked like the cooldown reduction didn't apply but it did. Have you tried in a custom game to see if it's still happening?","replies":[]}]}
