(we can all agree I think it was terrible, yes?)\n\nI was wondering if maybe Riot could contact me somehow or somewhere through my email and there could be some way of recovering my account. I can still play the game on a fresh account but having spent so much money, partly makes me feel like ive been robbed. and in no way promotes players to curb their flaming. fresh accounts with nothing to lose allows players to become tyler1 version two. I also believe the ban system is slightly cooked in the sense that it punishes verbal and social offenses tremendously moreso than actual in game offenses such as griefing and and hacking/scripting, and a robotic banning bot having set keywords to search for does not help. some machine searching through your chat history for naughty words has no insight to the issue at all. I can watch a player run it down in high elo ranked for 3 weeks straight without a single punishment, but if i type something in chat a little offensive your instantly done.\n\nOverall im asking for another chance, coming into season 10.\n\nEDIT: this was the text from the game i was banned in btw. let the players judge me.\n\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: i was given the role of jungle\nPermaBannedLoL: in champion select\nPermaBannedLoL: was i not?\nPermaBannedLoL: i had jungle\nPermaBannedLoL: lee sin was support\nPermaBannedLoL: LEE SIN WAS SUPPORT\nPermaBannedLoL: LOL\nPermaBannedLoL: sej was mid\nPermaBannedLoL: you guys dont look\nPermaBannedLoL: you just lock in\nPermaBannedLoL: you were mid autofilled and lee was autofilled support\nPermaBannedLoL: thats why i said\nPermaBannedLoL: \"eve support? are you joking?:\nPermaBannedLoL: yes\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: and lee is support\nPermaBannedLoL: XD\nPermaBannedLoL: dude\nPermaBannedLoL: you were support lee honest\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: i have it on shadow\nPermaBannedLoL: i record all my games\nPermaBannedLoL: guess im top\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: idgaf\nPermaBannedLoL: ill top\nPermaBannedLoL: ffs\nPermaBannedLoL: mid\nPermaBannedLoL: lee\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: report these idiits\nPermaBannedLoL: sej is was top and lee was support\nPermaBannedLoL: they just autolock and troll\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: you both just inted to me teemo\nPermaBannedLoL: you actually?\nPermaBannedLoL: im muting all\nPermaBannedLoL: 2 of them took my role, then blame me like im the idiot, then they are intentionally feeding to make things worse\nPermaBannedLoL: ff 15\nPermaBannedLoL: gg\nPermaBannedLoL: nah nah\nPermaBannedLoL: 1 more word i run it down\nPermaBannedLoL: nah\nPermaBannedLoL: sej and lee\nPermaBannedLoL: are so dumb\nPermaBannedLoL: they dont deserve any lp\nPermaBannedLoL: hahaha\nPermaBannedLoL: guess i wont have to run it down\nPermaBannedLoL: next time your in champ select\nPermaBannedLoL: have a look\nPermaBannedLoL: at ur role\nPermaBannedLoL: you might see something\nPermaBannedLoL: ez\nPermaBannedLoL: seems balanced\nPermaBannedLoL: oh go\nPermaBannedLoL: lol\nPermaBannedLoL: get me out\nPermaBannedLoL: please.\nPermaBannedLoL: nice\nPermaBannedLoL: good jungle skills\nPermaBannedLoL: sure you could have done a great job!\nPermaBannedLoL: &lt;3\nPermaBannedLoL: FF\nPermaBannedLoL: ty\n","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-14T04:57:27.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you believe you've been falsely punished, you can appeal the ban by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option), and they will review the case and determine if there's cause for a removal or reduction. You can also feel free to discuss the punishment further with the support agents through that ticket.\n\nSo far as the chat logs go, it seems largely negative. Behaviours like insulting/berating other players, consistent negative attitude, passive-aggressive chat use, are all things that can contribute to a punishment. What that punishment will be depends on your account's standing, and usually follows a standard progression of chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game) followed by suspensions (14-day then permanent). If you haven't followed that progression, you may have a case for a reduction, but (in my opinion) the kinds of behaviour shown would probably be enough to trigger a punishment, particularly if it's consistent across multiple games.\n\nKeep in mind that the amount of money you spent on the account wont have an effect on how you are treated by the punishment systems in place, after all you're not paying for preferential treatment. It's also important to note that someone else breaking the rules doesn't give you leeway to do so as well; all players are judged on the merit (or lack thereof) of their own behaviour.\n\nOne reason that it may *appear* that chat-offences are dealt with with significantly more prejudice, when compared to gameplay offences, is because they are much easier to confirm (it's a lot easier to see someone calling someone else an idiot than it is to figure out if someone is intentionally feeding or just having a bad game, for example). That said, you wont find many who think the systems targeting gameplay offences couldn't be improved.\n\nIt's also important to note that, while certain terms/phrases are treated with more prejudice (i.e. \"zero-tolerance language\") the systems in place don't work by \"having set keywords\" either.

That is, basically everyone who earned their account back went right back to the behaviours that got them banned in the first place or other negative behaviours.\n\nIn the end, instead of offering players a final chance to get their behaviour on the right track, it only served to cheapen the meaning of 'permanent' for those players, reducing the impact of that final punishment. In short, it had the opposite effect of what was hoped and so was permanently scrapped, with efforts instead going to encouraging positive behaviour through systems like Honour and Hextech Crafting.","replies":[{"poster":"PermaBannedLoL","date":"2020-01-14T05:57:07.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they need to rework what actually merits a permanent ban from a chat offense. racism and homophobia as well as reference to suicide is a no brainer, but name calling and cursing, is that really needed? a study from the US schools department said that over 89% of all boys from ages 8 above had seen large ammounts of pornography. and meanwhile league is giving people timeouts for naughty words. oof.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-14T08:09:02.201+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot puts a big emphasis on reform, but at a point, they have to protect their community, their majority of positive/neutral players, over the small percentage of players who don't reform after multiple punishments.
