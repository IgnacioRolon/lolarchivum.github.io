The game is in a really, really bad state of balance, mainly due to these reworked champions who just have better abilities then the older champions.\n\nThis didn't use to be much of a problem in previous seasons (it was a bit of a problem in s4 and 5 and was creeping up) but every champion is just being released with so many abilities/utlity/damage all loaded into their kit then you've got older champions like Xin Zhao who are wondering what happened to the days where a short ranged dash and a 3 hit knock up was god tier, or amumu wondering what happened to the days where is ultimate was the BEST teamfight ultimate in the game, now you just have champions like reksai, like fiora, like tahm kench who just have such overloaded rediculous kits, percent max health true dmg, 3 second dashes, aoe heal, ability to block all cc, tahm 2 hp bars essentially, scaling dmg with tankiness, ability to eat his own team or enemy team, as well as a stun on top of that, a 2 man tf ultimate.

I brought up valid points of when league was extremely unbalanced, but you chose to ignore them. There has been a few champs who outperform others recently, but not like the old days.","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-13T09:38:46.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You quoted Kassadin, yes, S3 Kassadin was ridiculously broken, however he was a stand alone thing, where as now Riot have a host of about 5 - 10 champions that just do everything better then the rest, e.g Rek sai, Tahm, Fiora, Graves, etc. I don't really remember TF being that OP, he get nerfed at some point what was never massively broken tier. Just OP. However now you have a host of champions not necessarily stand out OP champions like Kassadin but champions that make a massive host of champions obsolete, you have two versions of League of Legends, you have old league of legends and new league of legends, new league of legends are champs like, Fiora, Tahm, Reksai, Graves, Blue Ezreal, Corki, all these champions just do everything so many champions do and so much more, making a host of champions completely obsolete, I feel like these champions aren't being made for the same game, for example, Fiora has percent max health true damage, can go invulnerable, has a dash on a 3 second cd, a massive aoe heal, that if procced you have basically won the fight, and just completely unrivaled split pushing power, there is NOTHING that compare to Fiora, Blue Ez can match most adc's damage output if not more while having a ridiculous amount of utility with the slow, armour, and inherent mobility, Graves, he's a tank, ad assassin, mage, range, melee, bruiser, jungler, top laner. That's basically that. Now I already know what you're going to say \" there's always been op champions\" yes, there have, generally they become OP because the current meta holds on heavy emphasis on something that champion is good at, e.g, When Dragon was actually worth the real estate it took up on the map, rumble was a very strong pick due to his ridiculous power within a dragon teamfight. \n\nAnother reason the game has become so stale and imbalanced is because of how linear it has become, for example, dragon isn't worth anything, so there's no reason to leave your lanes and contest it every game the pros are going to trade turrets, in 95% of games they will trade top for bot turrets, and then it's just a battle of farm, farm, farm, farm while trying to take turrets, this causes every game to be very similar and demand a very similar set of requirements from the champions in them meaning champions that are good at this farm up and then end it in one big mid game team fight are just good every single game. There are no strats in league, every single game is exactly the same. I'm not gonna go on anymore because I'm probably already going over your head. You also probably don't entirely understand the concept of an \"op champion\".","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-13T19:29:07.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Original TF was beyond OP, but it was probably before your time.\n\n2) Lets list why these champs are strong:\nRek sai - due to limited vision the tremor sense has become invaluable, overall the kit is very good but in late game does more or less become a meat shield.\nTahm - fairly weak early, has no gap close/escape and can be punished early on. Recently nerfed ( do you even read patch notes ).\nFiora - all round strong kit, but she does have weak points and can be blown up if riposte is mis timed. She fits almost every composition.\nGraves - Great burst, great jungle sustain, but has recently been nerfed so I feel has fallen off slightly.\nBlue EZ - Amazing 2 item power spike, weak as fk in lane before these items are reached.\nCorki - Great burst dmg, has an escape, has a BIG package. But his package only lasts for 60s. Also he was recently nerfed?\n\nYou make no mention of Poppy, Nidalee, Gangplank, Elise, Udyr ( in a soloque sense ).\n\n3) Dragon was recently buffed, with the increased tower dmg on #2 and the value of snowballing tower gold this will become a highly contested buff. Prepare for siege comps.\n4) Lane swapping albeit a \"boring\" part of the game, comes down to protecting weak champs/lane matchups. Why send the EZ&Thresh into a Luc/Braum lane to be destroyed? It comes down to tactics and with shorter prep time it is more difficult for teams to find the matchups they want.\n\nSo don't sit there and belittle me like I have no idea about the state of the game. You will point out others rank, well you haven't played ranked in over 2 weeks. Theres a new patch, meta slightly changes, but its easier for you to make posts and complain about \"OP\" champs and boring strategy then belittle anyone with a lower rank, why dont you try to actually figure out counterplay yourself. People have played the all mighty donger to challenger ranks, how in any form is donger OP and meta?\n\nYour opinion, like mine, isn't really that valuable, only D1+ and professional level players/analysts really know whats going on with the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ScottyMcDavern","date":"2016-02-11T12:43:00.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love how everyone is crying about the new item.. the only counter to it is 'armor'....","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-11T21:13:37.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not crying about it, it's the least of leagues problems right now.
