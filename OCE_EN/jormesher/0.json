You have more than 10 deaths in most of your games... there are multiple games where you have a death every 2 minutes... you legit must have spent more time dead than alive in those games.\n\nI really don't know how to fix that. You're either intentionally feeding or have 0 clue on how to play, in which case, you need to watch streams/youtube vids and just look at \"proper\" gameplay.\n\nYou never buy control wards or change your trinket. both are necessary.","replies":[{"poster":"JOrmesher","date":"2018-03-09T07:46:20.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for the comment I find that rather helpful.
