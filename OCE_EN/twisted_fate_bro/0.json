I never blame my team nor flame them, that&#039;s sort of the reason why i&#039;ve never really been banned.\r\n\r\nBut anyways, my question is, why did my mmr drop from 1700~ to 1500~ in like 6 losses? I lost ALOT of LP aswell I got demoted to gold 4 almost 5, until I played with my duo and got teamed with half decent people.. And even at 1500 why did I get teamed with people that just reached level 30 without runes or anything? This was truly a nightmare and I do NOT wanna experience it again. So I wanna know how I can prevent it?\r\n\r\nInb4 &quot;Just carry them&quot; - well it&#039;s pretty hard to carry against a 20-0 kha zix etc, and even then I&#039;m not good enough to 1v5 people every single game because this didnt happen just once it happened almost every game until I started playing duoq.\r\n\r\nCan someone in riot perhaps check my account and see if my mmr is correct?\r\n\r\nthanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-07T14:20:45.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are experiencing losing streak, you can lose up to something like 30LP or so every loss so it's possible to drop roughly 150~200LP after 6 losses.\n\nIf you duo with someone, you will be matched with opponents with MMR that is you two's average plus 30 (supposedly to compensate the duo advantage). And idk, maybe if there aren't enough players queuing around that level atm, perhaps the matchmaking just match your teammates down instead who knows.\n\nBut I really don't know, someone else might give a better explanation.\n\nEDIT: yeah it would seem you were having quite a couple lose streaks and semi lose streaks recently, that may be why the matchmaking is dropping your LP hard after loss. Though I am not sure how to explain your teammate problems if it indeed did happen (can't be bothered to go check up your every teammates in the past few days soz...).","replies":[{"poster":"Twisted Fate Bro","date":"2017-03-07T17:12:17.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got like 80% winstreak with my friend lul and second I que alone I get with silver 4-5's.. unbelievable.","replies":[]}]}]}
