Winning games will make the number go higher and losing games will make the number go lower. There is no way to find out what your MMR is but it is there to make sure you are matched up with people that are even skill level with you. So what has happened in this case is that you have won enough games to the point where you have a close enough MMR to people who are level 30 to get matched with/against them. If it is the case that you have been playing with your friend, you will have been vsing people from their MMR, hence your MMR would rise higher because you are playing with people of that level or even beating them.\n\nThis can be a good thing as it gives you experience playing vs people who have been playing the game longer than you have. This will let you gain valueable knowledge and learn from what they do. But as mentioned this can also be a bad thing in that at the level you are you will be vsing people that have full rune pages and keystone masteries.\n\nWhat I recommend you do is keep playing, keep in mind this is the start of your journey into league and ultimately these few games of frustration of not having runes or a keystone you wont remember down the track. What I would recommend if you want to make it so that your MMR is where your skill level is, you could queue up by yourself to make sure your wins and loses are your own and match making isn't effected by the people you queue with.\n\nAlso while you do play keep in mind that all keystones have their pros and cons and some of them have cooldowns. You can left click on a target for example to see if their thunderlords is on cooldown for example and fight them when they don't have it. Use it as a learning experience for when you play to watch how your opponents use their keystones and play with them and then use what you have learnt in your own games.\n\nIf you have any questions about what I said or in general let me know always happy to help! Hope this helped clarify things and will help you on your journey.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-11-04T01:10:41.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's also because oce server population is relatively small. the number of pre-30 players queuing up at the same time as op is, is bound to be tiny. \n\nOn top of this, a lot of them will be paired up with their higher level buddies, leading to a very small matchmaking pool (at times practically non-existent). The system will try match lower players up with each other first, but when it can't be done within a reasonable amount of time, it will just boop them in with the level 30s. Like I said, our server is very small, so majority of the time you will be put into level 30 games, especially once you get above level ~10 (it seems the lower level gets more priority for lower level queues).\n\nAs Elam said, just embrace it. It sucks being stomped game after game, but eventually you will rise to the challenge, and be a better player for it. Its just like the jump from bots to norms. Hard at first, but then you get used to it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-11-05T13:15:22.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GET GUD BRO AHAHA okay its probably means that you are better than the level you are right now so dw and also league community is like this , toxic and stuff. i usually try to communicate with the team and stay positive{{champion:99}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-03T11:01:22.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"paly co op vs ai till lvl required for a keystone or lvl 30","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-11-04T01:49:35.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's what i did, i played something like 300-400 coop vs ai. \n\ni remember being made fun of for having so few normal's wins even though my account was level 30 now i have like 1930 wins who's laughing now","replies":[]}]}]}
