His q damage mostly comes from hitting the enemy with the shaft, but with the charge up it's obvious for anyone with a brain to move away unless you are right in front of him.  His passive is kinda useless against smart players that know not to do long trades with him. To sum it up Darius stomps anyone that doesn't understand his abilities and vice versa.","replies":[{"poster":"IgutUlikeAfisH","date":"2015-08-25T08:12:31.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL thats 100 PERCENT HOW I FEEL BRO  HIS PASSIVE IS FUCKEN USELESS/STUPID YOULL NEVER GET IT OFF LOL THEYLL ITS SO HARD TO GET 5 STACKS JESUS *^$%*%^&#$&^#%$(&^% ITS JUST FUCKED .

Dead Man's Plate lets you catch people quite quickly.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-25T07:55:19.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are buffing his damage on Q to make up for the fact that its harder to hit. Doubled the base Damage level 1 on PBE. He also has his attack speed growth per level doubled.\n\nYou are right in the fact he doesn't feel like Darius. The guy that used to Q+E+W+Q+R and insta someone. Riot changed him so that if you don't build almost full-tank he dies before getting his damage off.\n\nHe is no longer the awesome lane bully level 2 all-inner that only Tryndamere/Riven can match. He's more of a sustain laner now (with the Q heal) and the potential to burst once you are low.\n\nI think people just have to find a nice build for him and he needs a minor buffs to get him to a good place.","replies":[]}]}
