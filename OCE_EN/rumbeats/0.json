(like in mmos and games like that)\r\nI've always wanted to see in full sized view the top-side HUD section, so I can keep an easy eye on my teams HP and who I select, to see what their HP is, etc.\r\nYet I've always had it to its minimum because I do not want to have the bottom section of the HUD to take up most of my vision.\r\nI'm sure this is something Riot could do, and it would help a lot being able to read more information given while also having vision with the bottom section of the screen.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else agrees or disagrees, comment below with your opinions!\r\nWill update with more soon\r\n\r\n==moved this thread from another board to here==\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nRum\r\n{{item:3174}}","replies":[{"poster":"WhisperPan","date":"2015-03-19T04:27:54.293+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't use it, but it still would be a nice feature to implement.
