I then let combat resolve.\n\nThe other three units in combat gained ethereal (as they were supposed to) and died, but my Levelled up Lux did not. She survived the turn (and the rest of the game). It would appear that Lux's levelling up due to a burst spell broke the targeting of Shadow Flare, which I don't believe should have happened. (She should have levelled up, given me my Final Spark, and then gained ethereal and died when she struck the enemy nexus.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eleoh","date":"2020-02-06T01:20:39.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played Rush on my defending Shadow Assassin blocking a Yasuo.
