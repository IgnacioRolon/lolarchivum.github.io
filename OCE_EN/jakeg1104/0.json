Or can I just get a friend to login to my account without having to play a game and still be able to redeem my awards?","replies":[{"poster":"Heresleo","date":"2019-10-17T06:21:17.813+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I played a couple of games today and still don't have access to the rewards.

So, for example, you couldn't just give someone else, such as a friend or family member, your login details and let them play on the account, as that can very realistically result in a permanent ban. It's also important to note that account sharing can also make it much more difficult to resolve a compromised account.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-17T04:18:51.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok yeah that makes sense.
