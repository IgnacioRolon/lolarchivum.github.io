New support champion ideas?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey everyone\r\nI main supp and I&#039;ve been wondering what champ to unlock next? I love playing Tahm Kench, Bard and Blitzcrank. I own a fair few supps and I was tossing up between Lulu and Nautilus as I want a supp that can handle their own in a 1v1 just like Tahm.\r\nAny suggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2015-10-06T04:59:42.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nami is incredibly strong as long as you're not playing into a super tank heavy team. And even then, she's still very useful. With targeted poke that is also a heal, 2 aoe knock ups that don't require her to get in melee range and a dmg buff she's one of my favourite support champs. plus she doesn't really get countered by anyone and always has outplay potential. You shouldn't outheal a good raka, but you can/should outheal a sona.\n\nKarma would be my other go to in terms of supports that can really hold their own. She has really high base values on her abilites, can provide shields, sivir ult, snares (that can self heal), and aoe slows. She's a great pick in poke comps or tanky comps or even if your comp is just lacking ap dmg. \n\nLulu is great into almost any comp as she just becomes this instant roid for your adc. Her biggest downside is that because she scales reasonably well, playing her in the support role does nerf her shields and dmg output which is why most people play her top/mid as a support role from there.\n\nNaut is also great as he brings more cc than any other champion in the game atm. His hook is a little slower than blitz's and will move you to your target instead of pulling them in, but the fact that his first auto on a target stuns them is op as hell. Targeted knock up for an ult is also really handy against champs like vayne. His peel is ok, but building as a support does make him a little squishier than going jg/top with him but that's just something you learn to work around. Like leo though, he gets majorly screwed over by champions with strong disengage like janna or if your opponent picks morg. \n\nJust my 2cents. Good luck with the #supplife!","replies":[]}]}
