That doesn&#039;t even do aoe? And his e is a trap, so in terms of activated abilities he has a sniping ultimate and a W that is on a huge cool-down. Seems kind of like a flavor fail for someone teased as a expert gun user, it seems like he has a grenade out of nowhere.\n\nI think it would be much more on theme if his Q was renamed and redone to be a dancing bullet that has the exact same effect but is a bullet that dances through 4 targets, have it have a similar flashy jump effect and speed to his current Q but be a bullet.\n\nIts more on theme with his identity as both a gunner AND as an artist; his bullets dance on his command.","replies":[]}
