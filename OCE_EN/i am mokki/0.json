I am willing to coach anybody willing to coach me. Please HMU if this at all interests you. I'm free from 6pm-9pm","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-04-29T09:07:50.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I am willing to coach anybody willing to coach me\n\nUnless you'll further explain what it mean.
