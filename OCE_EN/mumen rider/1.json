Level 1-6= 6 months immunity and after that you add one month onto the immunity for each level above level 6. I am trying to get a name that isn&#039;t being used by an inactive account but Riot won&#039;t grant me this name. Apparently they can&#039;t just give me the name because there is an automated system for clean up. \nIs it really fair to deny someone who has provided proof that the account hasn&#039;t been played and not be granted the name? It is obvious the person isn&#039;t going to play on the account because of the prolonged inactivity and it isn&#039;t fair to deny someone who meets the specifications the name.\nI would like to propose a new system of immunity application, such as applying for immunity on an account. Because if you really gave one single crap about your account and you aren&#039;t able to play on the account for a prolonged time then you should apply for immunity. Because it would thin out the people who give a crap and people who play the game once for a week then give up because they don&#039;t want to play it while other people are going to play it. \n\nP.S {{champion:13}} <---- nerf plz","replies":[]}
