You can be rank 5 (or now even 6 or 7) with a character and still be terrible, it just shows that you&#039;ve played the character a lot.\r\n\r\nSo what I propose, and I&#039;d love feedback etc, is that there is a separate mastery rank available that you can only acquire through achieving S grades in games. Then that rank would mean something and you would have something to strive for with your favourite characters.\r\n\r\nAlso happy to consider the possibility of skins that cost RP, but that are only available to players who have achieved certain S grade mastery ranks with characters. \r\n\r\nWhat does everyone think of these ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-05-20T02:43:42.549+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rank 6 and 7 can only be achieved by getting S ranks.
