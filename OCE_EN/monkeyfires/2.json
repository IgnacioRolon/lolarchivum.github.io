They gave it a 0.25 second cast time when used in mid-air (feels a lot more than that though). It didn&#039;t seem like much, but it makes it near impossible to aim accurately. Most of the time when you cast it mid air, land on them and they double back towards where you jumped from, it misses them completely. I&#039;m trying to cast it earlier and there is a niche spot, but it is very small and near the start of your jump. 50% of the time I fail because I E too early, don&#039;t jump and look like a retard.\r\n\r\nWhy make this skillshot ridiculously hard to aim? You may as well save yourself the trouble and not use it mid-air with the inaccuracy it is atm. If your opponent is running in a straight line, it&#039;s fine and you can land it with ease, but that isn&#039;t really a practical assumption especially since they also made the warning appear much earlier.\r\n\r\nThere is some reprieve. With the new change to the Q the attack buff boosts your E damage so it does a lot more, but if you&#039;re using your E mid jump, you&#039;re likely using it for the snare and won&#039;t be able to get the benefit of the empowered Q. This change makes it so Rengar really only has one combo with his empowered Q, since going without that damage buff is not worth it anymore. I am tentative to say this since I like Rengar so much, but the &#039;nerf&#039; to the Q wasn&#039;t really a nerf. Sure he loses a bit of burst, but now he&#039;s so much more dangerous after his empowered Q. Tiamat does a tonne of damage along with his E and if your get crits the damage is insane. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the changes to Q were a step in the right direction and whilst it means you can&#039;t instagib people as easily before, you&#039;re not a sitting duck either while your abilities are on CD, which is good, but he still needs work though. \r\n\r\nIf you want to change Rengar and make him more balance, I think they need to target his power spikes. I just had a game where I did really poorly in the beginning (0/3/1) before lvl 6, had one team fight that gave me two kills and it was like I never fell behind. Instead of making his Bola harder to land mid-air why not just reduce the scaling on it? If it&#039;s the slow that&#039;s the problem then reduce that a bit. Making the skillshot unnecessarily harder to land is just frustrating and pointless. I like the Q changes, but maybe 20% was too much. 15% could be the sweet spot and he wouldn&#039;t scale so hard.\r\n\r\nIn short, Empowered bola in mid-air is too unreliable and not worth it anymore, lest you absolutely need it. \r\n\r\n\r\n_**SOMETHING SORT OF OFF TOPIC**_\r\n\r\nBack in the day I used to play tank rengar and I&#039;ve always tried to make him work. I feel like he is close to being a hard engage tank champion that threatens the back line, but he isn&#039;t quite there. Don&#039;t know what it is he needs, but making this a viable option would make him a less toxic champion to play against. His W is a very negligible ability, used only to get fury and save you in desperate escape attempts. Making it a viable option to level without impacting current Rengar I know is hard. But if you were to nerf his damage a bit more and upgrade his sustain and team fighting potential, it would turn him into a bruiser that can build as an assassin or a tank, giving more options to builds and a healthier Rengar to play with and against.\r\n\r\nA lot has been said in this post.

There is counter play already there. If the snare duration is the problem then they could shrink that, not how hard it is to hit. \n\nAccording to you it's not a problem to hit anyway so you're contradicting your own arguments here. If you can snare them without a problem either way, how is that introducing counter play? Even if they made it so only the most skilled rengar players could land the E reliably, that still is not introducing counter play - it's simply how good a person is with a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-01T16:16:15.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Clearly you don't understand what counter play is.\n\nBut first, i said i have no problems with hitting it, that doesn't mean that's the case for everyone else.\n\nNow for the counterplay, the .25 second cast time means that they have .25 seconds longer to be able to dodge your E, rather then having 0.01 seconds to dodge it (because you could E right on top of them)\n\nNow fact is if you hit it they are rooted for 1.75 seconds, if you can't manage to 1-shot someone within that time, that's your problem, but it comes with very little counterplay.\n\nNow it requires some skill to actually land, and has a lot more counterplay to it, but again i urge you to watch NB3 while he is playing rengar, he's already used the new rengar to plenty of success .","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2016-02-02T18:24:34.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"....\n\nClearly **you** don't understand what counter play is.\n\nIt having 'skill' to land, to which you are claiming I have none, has nothing to do with counter play, that's just raising the skill ceiling for the champ. Your argument regarding more time to react is counter play so you have a point there. However I didn't think it was also necessary to increase the warning range on top of this.\n\nI've already checked out Nightblue stream and videos and he hasn't mentioned it at all. However him being a big Rengar main, I'm sure he has adapted without problem and from your boastful comments, so have you.\n\nI don't play league as much as I used to and I am struggling a bit to land the E, but that doesn't make it counter play. They can add a 0.25 second delay to every skillshot in the game if they wished in the name of 'counter play', but that doesn't mean that's healthier for the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LeBlonc","date":"2016-02-01T21:43:10.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On behalf of /r/rengarmains, fuck off","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-01T11:07:45.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is like renekton, either too strong or too weak, you cant balance his kit properly","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2016-02-01T11:22:48.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say he is close, but I think he is still able to be saved.
