I snared him, but he was still able to use his ultimate, even though that&#039;s a movement ability. I know it&#039;s technically a self-knockback, but it&#039;s still a movement ability and shouldn&#039;t happen. It&#039;s either a bug or it&#039;s supposed to happen and I&#039;d like to know which it is and why?\n\nCaitlyn's net is another example of a self knock back, but I don&#039;t remember an example of where she used it while in a snare.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-02T11:15:32.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sums it up pretty well\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2f5vVbZsdp0?t=26s","replies":[]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-02-01T09:56:39.869+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it shouldn't let him ulti when reng snared","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-01T10:36:49.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's a recently changed ability, i'm not sure if it's meant to happen or not.\n\nThat said, if it's meant to happen, it would have to do with the fact that it's a rather mild self-knockback, and it's an ult.","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2016-02-01T10:41:52.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the fact it's an ult has no bearing on it, as seen with Yasou wind walls that can block over half the ults in the game without discrimination between normal abilities... #nosaltynesshere\n\nPerhaps it's not meant to happen, I hope that's the case. Graves is insane at the moment and being resistant to snares as well is not what I like to hear :z","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-01T11:22:46.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo w blocks spells and attacks that disconnect (no attachment to) from the caster... not hard for people to understand that, thats the reason things like vel w is blocked (stupid no block e bug) and why his r goes through, if his r was loads of short rapid fire beams they would get blocked, but they arent, they connect to vel'koz, so they get counted as champ.\n\nand as for graves, im sure he could go without an ult. He is already freaking bursty enough, he doesn't even need to have ult, 95% of the time i dont even need it, so it gets used as a wall jump, 80% of the time people ult, the person died from the q aa before r even cast, so dont even need his r, snare is a snare, so it should stop him moving, cait cant e, why can he use a similar spell","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2016-02-01T11:34:20.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand. I mentioned yasou as an example. Abilities given the status of 'ultimate' don't impact how it interacts with rules in the game when compared to basic abilities. Velkoz ultimate is an exception, but it's not really a projectile, but a beam that passes through everything.\n\nCompletely agree with Graves.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-02T07:09:31.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just explaining yasuo, if the spell is attached to the champ it goes through because its counted as apart of the champ, blitz pull is the hand, and that disconnect from the champ so it blocks, but vel ult is connected to him so it passes, so does lux's r, anything that's fully connected to the champ passes, anything that isnt is blocked, just trying to explain, because im sick of people complaining about his w blocking braum r and vel w and other \"rift\" things, its because they aren't connected to champs.\n\nAlso, contrary to popular belief, yasuo can wind wall naut's r if his precision accuracy and timing is spot on, as it is disconnected from naut, it can be blocked, its just very touchy about positioning because of the way it moves, because of its erratic jumping movement it usually registers as not being there as it jumps, but if you land the wall exactly in the centre of the larger eruption on w cast as the ult is blocked.","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2016-02-02T18:09:28.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got it dude...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-03T09:39:00.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and as for further explanation on yasuo...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-02T03:37:01.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not supposed to be able to cast any movement command while snared, which includes his Ult.
