Rengar&#039;s win rate is at it&#039;s highest it&#039;s ever been at 51.3% and the recent changes have made him a strong and consistent pick. However, it&#039;s worth mentioning there are a whole hoard of champions that have better win rates than that, so it&#039;s not particularly crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nerfs that I&#039;ve read they are planning to do are as follows:\r\n - Reduce Q range by 50\r\n - Remove the persistent CC immunity effect\r\n - Lower Rengar&#039;s ultimate duration\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sake of argument and the removal of my opinion, lets say Rengar is a problem at the moment. Do these changes really address his problems? To me, if anything is out of line, Rengar&#039;s snowball potential and base damage both need to be targeted. Rengar was always intended to be a snowball champion, but Tankgar is really strong right now. Snowballing tanky, bruisers are extremely hard to deal with. Most snowballers are designed to be squishy, so their lead is hinged on them not making fatal mistakes and they are able to be focused down and bursted out before they cause too much trouble. You can&#039;t do that against tanks and rengar has a lot of anti burst in his new reworked W, so I can see how he can be frustrating to play against.\r\n\r\nThe rework of Rengar has left him in a difficult spot, because assassins rely on 2 strengths. They either have insane burst damage or they have a bit less in exchange for mobility or stealth to surprise their enemy. Now that everyone can see Rengar coming, he&#039;s lost a lot of his element of surprise, so Riot has had to bump up his damage to compensate for that, which leads him into the spot he is in now.\r\n\r\nMy guess is, these nerfs are simply to appease the people who voice their frustrations playing against Rengar. The only change that will have a measurable impact on Rengar is the removal of his persistent CC immunity, but if Tankgar is the most popular build that won&#039;t affect his win rate very much. The only thing these changes do is annoy Rengar players. We have to learn that our Q and ultimate is not as long as it used to be and be less reliant on the CC immunity. These changes are in line with previous nerfs to his Bola strike with the delay on cast. _These are all indirect nerfs that don&#039;t deal with the actual problem, but seek to make the champion more clunky to use, to justify keeping Rengar&#039;s damage where it&#039;s at._ \r\n\r\nAs pointed out before, Rengar&#039;s loss in his ability to surprise people makes him have the need to have the damage to compensate for that. So what can be done? I believe the only thing he needs is a small reduction in his base damage across the board. This will affect primarily Tankgar, meaning he won&#039;t have the damage if he chooses to go tanky and it also targets Rengar&#039;s early game, which is where the snowballing starts making it harder for him to lift off. If you want to target his snowball potential more, then his passive can be targeted. \r\n\r\nWhy am I speaking up about all of this? Because I would prefer to play a smoother champion rather than a clunky mess that he will soon become. Lowering utility instead of raw stats promotes brain dead raw power. The utility of a champion promotes strategic thinking and skill, both of which I really value. Stop taking that away and deal with the real problem (if there is one).\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. - I really did enjoy the rework, even if it did have some time getting used to. For the first time his empowered W is as impactful as his other abilities and a serious consideration in fights other than &#039;I&#039;m dying&#039;. I just don&#039;t want to see Rengar being pushed in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-02-04T07:14:58.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his Ult duration change is whatever. I think running around for 30s was a bit dumb anyway. Most Rengars dont need that duration if using ult properly.\n\nHis Q and W nerfs are targeting the \"WTF am I supposed to do\" portion when playing against Rengar. The answer used to always be, bunch together and CC him when he shows.\n\nCC immunity changed that.\n\nHonestly I think the only thing that needed to be changed was the W. Giving an assassin CC immunity is nuts. Olaf is enough of a pain in the ass but atleast thats his ult and not on a 12s cd (with cdr).\n\nI honestly believe these nerfs will move Rengar from, \"pick ban OP, any idiot can play him\", back to the old, \"our rengar vs their rengar\".\n\nhttp://st.elohell.net/public/chill/0f860220aa2dc4c035b760ac30abbf6a.jpg\n\nI find it very interesting they didn't touch his damage, just his utility, so should be good to see how it works out.","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2017-02-06T02:09:30.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, being patient and waiting for the right moment with your ult can be key to winning a fight. Waiting in your ult is huge in team fights. The enemy has to be constantly worried when you're going to jump in and it can cause them to hold onto their big spells while your team pummels them and if they use them you go in and you can clean up. That's strategy and skill, part of which they are taking away.\n\nIf a Rengar chooses CC immunity over empowered Q, he's probably running away. It's rare that it is optimal to use that to secure a kill with 1 or 2 auto's, when your empowered Q does so much damage. You lose all your damage if you go for empowered W and everyone fails to realise that. Because Rengar is so snowbally though, you don't need that much damage when you're fed out of your ass to kill squishies and that's where you might see CC immunity as OP, but it's really just icing on the cake. CC immunity is fine to have as long as you are able to be bursted down. It's when you combine huge damage with CC immunity in a tanky build that it becomes a problem - they are targeting the wrong things here, believe me.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-06T03:15:21.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some of us don't like that icing on the cake. No matter fed you are, there should be a way for a team as a whole to be able to protect a member in a 1v5 and at least come out even. With CC immunity, if he gets ahead enough he can run in, 1shot your adc and run out with cc immunity with no repercussions. This feels bad and makes rengar very capable of solo carrying to degrees that other champions are not capable of and in a team game, that isn't very fair nor balanced.\n\nAssassins building tanky and still being able to swiftly assassinate someone is something I've always disliked, though I must admit I've experimented a bit with this myself, and as bad as this is for the game, if an assassin wants some cc immunity, they should pay for it, with items like mercurial scimitar or edge of night.\n\nRengar currently has too much innate value in his kit (kinda like if a utility support like bard or janna ended up doing as much damage as a mage like ryze) and so riot is currently trying to tone it down, and I think removing cc immunity is the best way to bring everything back down when he gets fed without nerfing him too much when he isn't fed. The q nerf seems harsh though and the ult nerf feels unnecessary.","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2017-02-06T12:34:52.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not fair when a Syndra presses R and you get one shot, it's not fair when Nasus stacks all day and one shots you with Q and it's not fair how tanky poppy is in the late game. Every champion has a late game goal and dream. \n\nUnless Rengar is ridiculously fed, that one shotting enemy adc and getting out with empowered W under everybody's nose without repercussions just doesn't happen. To one shot he'd need to get his empowered Q off and every one knows when you are coming. If you truly do have enough damage to do that, then that rengar has no tankiness and can easily get bursted out.\n\nYou are looking at all the empowered abilities collectively and not taking into account that you sacrifice 2 when you choose.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-06T16:09:54.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fed nasus isn't really as scary as people think he is though, cc him down and have your adc kill him, easy done. Fed syndra hurts like hell but i mean, banshee's veil/edge of night is worth picking up on any champion if the enemy syndra is fed enough and done she's alot less scary. CC immune fed rengar? nope, either get some tank items or a zhonias. \n\nI mean look at it this way, coming out of stealth with the crit+heaps of ad from just a few ad items and his passive bonus ad and just enough armour pen to give him almost true damage to anyone relying on base armour (adcs that's you, you poor, poor souls), add 100 physical damage from his tanky deadmans plate, and you're looking at one dead adc.\n\n---\nBut if you don't agree with this, let's look at the math in a fairly average fed rengar scenario (and also why I tend to think adcs should invest in some early components of the GA, despite this kinda lowering your early-midgame damage to levels where support mains like me have higher dps than our adc buddies):\n\nLets consider lvl13 rengar, got fed early and is snowballing pretty hard, has a warrior enchant redsmite, ghostblade, infinity edge and a deadmans and of course some boots. Not exactly too preposterous. Lets say he has 4stacks because that thornmail rammus isn't taking any funny business and is playing safe. Here we have a champion with 90 base ad (78 from champion base, around 13 from passive) now bonus ad we have 232AD. 60 from warrior, 60 from ghostblade, 70 from IE and 15 ad from runes and then 13% bonus ad extra from 4stacks. Now that's a total of 322AD which is now critting with IE's crit modifier, so 805 physical damage plus 100 extra physical damage from deadmans, that's around 900 physical damage from his ult jump alone, with around 15 armour pen, so assumming the average lvl12 adc with around 60 (51 from scaling armour and 9 from 9 armour seals), that brings us to around 30% physical damage reduction. So that's 630 damage out of a healthpool of around 1300 before we even consider that a good rengar combo we need to throw some other abilities in there. \n\nLets add an empowered w in there for base 180 magic damage (the base damage scales with rengars total level, and not the level in w) which going through around 40mr (30 from base mr for adcs which doesn't scale, and 12 from 9mr glyphs if they take those) ends up being around 30% magic damage reduction, which means the empowered w does 126 damage, none too shabby huh. Also we have to consider a pointblank E, now going by the regular skill order he has 1 point in this by lvl13, though I could be biased and have him max w last since when empowered w's damage doesn't scale by skill rank, that's 50+161=211 physical damage, applying resistance again 147 damage. So we've now added 273 damage on top of our 630, so we've now hit 903/1300.\n\nNow the other chunks of damage, no good rengar combo without the Q in there with the auto reset, not an empowered Q, just a regular Q rank5 Q, so lets add 115+161=276 physical damage from that plus 322 from the auto assuming it doesn't crit on it's own with the 20% crit chance (but that's not reliable so let's leave that out) and applying resistances, that's another 419 damage. So we now hit 1322/1300 damage, from a rengar that isn't exactly squishy.\n\n Oh and let's not forget extra damage from masteries, assuming the adc, has taken adc masteries, these shouldn't interfere with damage calculations. Now I can't really be bothered calculating all the bonuses from masteries so I'll only include a few common rengar mastery choices, Sorcery, gives +2% damage from abilities, so that's an extra about 10 damage, +6% damage from Bounty Hunter so we get an extra 90 damage, I can't be fucked doing the calculations for merciless so let's just pretend the rengar took meditation, the Precision penetration bonuses rack up to around 30 damage. We are also torn between thunderlords which gives us a glorious extra 227 magic damage which ends up being around 182 dmg after precision, or we could go stormraiders, which even though it isn't popular, I'll take for arguements sake. Oh and I almost forgot the autos from rengars leap would have applied challenging smite, for 138 true damage and also make rengar just a little harder to kill with the 20% damage reduction in case you tried to ult him in the face. \n\nSo in total, with this stormraiders cleanse combo we've done slightly more than 1590 burst damage in a blink of an eye, and we still get a cleanse, and maybe a few autos, though I don't really know since I don't main rengar, and the rengar is kinda tanky, especially if the cleanse is timed right since his w also heals him for 50% of the damage taken. We have 1shotted an adc from full hp and then some, with a decently fed rengar. This isn't a super fed full build rengar, this isn't a glass cannon rengar, this isn't even a 5stacks necklace rengar and heck we don't even have thunderlords or merciless damage in there.\n\nThis was a fed midgame lvl13 rengar with {{item:1412}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3158}} being able to 1shot an adc with a combo, still getting cc immunity and stormraiders to run away safely. \n\n.\n\nThat is a little too much icing.\n\nAlso I've run the numbers again, at 3am in the morning because I'm a moron and you could replace IE for a {{item:3155}} and {{item:1038}} to save 1000g and get some extra magic resist whilst only losing 145 damage to the adc. Given the 300 health safety margin, you could safely get away with this, so long as you are sure the enemy adc won't have a locket or face of the mountain or janna shield. Though if you can get the 5th stack on your bonetooth necklace, you'll have an even bigger margin to allow itemisation to make you tankier.\n\n.\n\n\nI've also run calculations for very very fed earlygame rengar, and with the right itemisation, he can still be somewhat tanky and be able to burst an adc and get his cleanse, albeit requiring 5stacks and the extra risky auto after the q auto reset to get the job done. \nThe build is more like this lvl9 rengar {{item:1412}} {{item:3077}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3044}} {{item:1001}}, with 186 bonus AD and 70base ad +20 from passive. Giving him 276 total AD, which ends up being enough damage with the empowered w, if you can manage the ult crit(552physical), empowered w(130magic), q(245physical), thunderlords(145magic), auto(276physical), tiamat(276physical) and then run away. After resistances of an average lvl9 Adc, minus lethality armour pen and precision, that's around a 23% damage reduction for physical damage and around the same for magic damage, that ends up being 1118 damage taken factoring in masteries. Which is again slightly above the healthpool of a lvl9 adc of around 1000-1100 hp.\n\n.\n\nAlso this type of theorycrafting is what I do for most of my champion builds, especially the main ones. Just enough damage to be able to do the job, but also as much defense as can be squeezed in there without sacrificing too much damage.\n----","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-06T16:12:09.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sorry this was so long, but simply, if you can get fed as rengar, and itemise correctly, the cleanse is ridiculous. And also I need to find something better to do in my spare time than theorycraft and calculate stuff for league because it sure isn't showing in my league rank.\n\nAlso you might be platinum and I might be bronze(or silver which is basically bronze), but I don't think I messed up with my math anywhere, and if I wasn't doing this at 3am in the morning, I could probably cut the margin even smaller and come up with a cheaper build that was also tankier and still did the 1shot. This is the first time I've theorycrafted for rengar and I've only spent like 4min on it and I don't even know if I've missed an auto reset or something in the combo, but this is as best I understand it, and the maths tells me that rengar can still 1shot if he chooses empowered W instead of empowered Q, and this isn't with some glass cannon build.\n\n\nAlso I didn't ignore his other empowered options, his empowered e is great cc and his empowered q gives him really high burst.
