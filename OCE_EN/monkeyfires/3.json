Combo-ing this with boots of swiftness was always a lot of fun and the only way to maximise slow resist and tenacity. Now it has gone and they sort of alluded to the fact their eyes are turning towards Ohmwrecker&#039;s extinction order 66. THIS. MUST NOT HAPPEN.\r\n\r\nOhmwrecker is another favourite item of mine and a unique item unlike any other at the moment. Again not many people use it and this fact I liked because I believe it to be a hidden op. Silent I am no more however. Deadman&#039;s plate and Ohmwrecker give huge amounts of movement speed (especially around towers). This is invaluable to any tank that is prone to being kited. In more than one case I&#039;ve saved helpless allies getting tower aggro with the active. In a more aggressive build it also works a treat. Ohmwrecker allows you to build damage, but still be more than decent at tower diving. Bruiser builds really benefit from this item. Another point I might add is that Ohmwrecker is currently the only item in the game that gives a combination of health, armour AND cdr. A tank could not ask for more.\r\n\r\nBrethren, I am gathering support here today to save a future execution of this item. Use this item and try it out, is all I ask and with a bit of luck this will gain popularity. You will not be disappointed.\r\n\r\n{{item:3056}} {{item:3056}} {{item:3056}}","replies":[{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-11-13T07:32:03.672+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could argue that ohm wrecker saves you from a few tower hits, arguably buying a warmogs giving you a fat chunk of health would also save you for a few turret hits and is far less situational. I think the game should give this niche back to poppy though... Or maybe give an item that has a passive like *Sturdy Defence* - Turret hits do not amplify with subsequent hits. Lazers do not slow you. (Or something of that nature), because I don't know about you but I'm constantly running around with 2-3 items with actives on them and I think every item is turning into an active nowadays. Let items be items.","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2015-11-13T12:56:03.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you on the too many actives thing. Two I can handle alright, but 3 starts to get a bit much xD\nOhmwrecker active is not something you use constantly in fights unless you're sieging a lot though so I think it's ok.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-11-13T07:31:57.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe throw that as an additional effect onto randuins so it's more than just an anti crit item piece and yeah has some sort of dual functionality.","replies":[]}]}
