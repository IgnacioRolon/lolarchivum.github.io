Or am I just blind??\n\nE.g. in the Store -&gt; Skins, there is a tick-box option to see only skins which you don&#039;t own, why is there not one to see only the skins that you do own so you don&#039;t have to scroll through each skin individually to see which ones you have?\n\nThis would be a very convenient feature to add and it'd be insanely easy to implement (at least I'm 90% sure it would be).","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-25T20:47:37.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great idea, a while ago when I played I was forced mid and I didn't know I had a fizz skin or a Leblanc skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-25T07:45:07.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's so you can't realise how much money you've spent on the game :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-10-24T21:05:09.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great idea man. Another simple and great feature that Riot should have added years ago.\nMaybe they should add Edit Runes in Champ Select and make masteries easier to actually select, the amount of times I've been editing and click saved the last second and it doesn't work is stupid.\n\nPlz Riot, collecting skins is an actual hobby for some. Why isn't there a trophy cabinet for us to see them!?","replies":[]}]}
