I keep making new accounts because I feel like I won&#039;t stand a chance against higher level players, which I assume will be more experienced. But I plan on just sticking it out on one account now and eventually getting it to ranked games, but not until I know I won&#039;t be ruining anyone else games. Also if anyone else new is reading this add me and we can improve together.\r\nCheers for taking a look lads.\r\nIGN Gandalf Sax Guy","replies":[{"poster":"TRISS22","date":"2017-06-09T06:37:50.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \nI would be interested in playing with you if possible.\nadd me TRISS22","replies":[]},{"poster":"Limit Testing","date":"2017-06-09T04:03:37.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Gandalf Sax Guy!\n\nI represent a discord based gaming community with over 500+ members ranging from the depths of Bronze to the top 20 on the server, I saw your post and thought that you might be interested in what we have to offer.
