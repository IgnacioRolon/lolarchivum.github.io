I decided I actively wanted to improve myself at the game.\r\nI review bot lane vods by myself and thought it would be helpful + beneficial to have an adc to review them with. I am constantly working on my own play and trying to improve. \r\n\r\nUltimately I would like to find someone who is on the same page as me, and we can get along as I believe this builds the best synergy. Keen to try all types of lanes (passive supports + scaling adc&#039;s, early aggressive sup + agro adc etc)\r\n\r\nI have a couple of analysts that I work with to review my games, so I think this is a good opportunity for an adc who wanted to improve!\r\nAdd me for further info / if you&#039;re interested\r\n\r\nIGN:\r\neLy bluz0r","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2016-08-16T06:01:28.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye bluz0r nice work, i remember duo'ing with you when you were D5, solid effort","replies":[{"poster":"bluz0r","date":"2016-08-17T11:16:10.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty Crowd :D Yeah haha I rmember duoing with you too!
