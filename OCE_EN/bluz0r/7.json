I am looking for potentially a group of people to practice mechanics with in custom games. 2v2 bot lane (effective trades/champion spacing), 1v1 solo lane, hook predictions/juking are just a few of the exercises I would like to try. \r\n\r\nIf possible I would like this to be a regular thing to keep mechanics fresh. I have done this in the past and have found it incredibly beneficial. \r\n\r\nAdd me in game for further info/if you&#039;re interested.\r\n\r\nIGN: bluz0r","replies":[{"poster":"bumdyamum","date":"2017-02-15T05:57:49.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pick me pick me! plat adc main","replies":[]}]}
