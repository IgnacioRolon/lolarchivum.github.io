The account was created in season 1 (6/7 YEARS ago) and so, understandably, he doesn&#039;t have much recollection about the 1st few champions hes purchased or the exact date the account was created. He lost access to his original sign up email and also the current email that a password reset link would go to.\r\nWe&#039;ve also spent a LOT of money on this account, but our credit card details apparently don&#039;t match up or do match up but is insufficient. Most of it would have been gifts from myself or my roommate.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure what more evidence is required to prove it is his account? He doesn&#039;t want to risk playing ranked games, and is worried about potentially having his entire account stolen and sold.\r\n\r\nThe person using the account hadn&#039;t played any games but then last night, they logged in and spent around 10,000 IP on champions before logging out. This was not my partner purchasing, and he&#039;s mad that ARAMs will be even worse now (lol)\r\n\r\nHe can send his photo ID and evidence of being able to access the account if that helps?\r\nAny information about what else we could do is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks heaps!\r\nSinly ~","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-19T10:37:45.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCan you provide me the currently open ticket number so I can have someone take another look into this.","replies":[]}]}
