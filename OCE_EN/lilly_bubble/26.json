Normal MMR is completely separate from Ranked, so their rank doesn't affect how they are matched in Normals.\n\nHowever, that Garen was Bronze 2. If he told you he was Plat 4 he was either lying, or talking about another account (or both).\n\nLet me know if this wasn't the correct match, and link it from your match history.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Lilly Bubble","date":"2016-02-17T20:09:57.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha  that wasnt the right one if this helps his name was \"TOXIC\" and the thing u mite be running into is coz for some resome there r 2 ppl with the same name on my server when there shouldnt be and when i click on the garen it'll somtimes switch between there profiles there one TOXIC that is bronze 2 and then a TOXIC that is plat 4 in his promos and he also told me he was plat 4","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-17T20:49:30.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that was the right match. It was a Normal game, not Ranked. The TOXIC in your game was spelled with an L not an i, which makes it look the same if you spell it in all caps.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lilly Bubble","date":"2016-02-17T14:10:43.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and just my luck to he was in his promo's","replies":[]}]}
