However neither my mouse nor keyboard can actually function. So i can&#039;t move, use my abilities or even type to my team that im having an issue (resulting most likely in 9x reports). I&#039;ve noticed that the cursor itself turns back to the regular windows cursor, and i can move it around but its as if the game is some video that i cant actually interact with. The mouse and keyboard work completely fine as if i alt+tab, i can still use my computer properly, its just an in game issue. The only way I could fix it was with restarting the entire computer.\r\n\r\nNot sure if anyone else has had this problem, however it is a fairly tilting one and makes me nervous to play soloq again.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nNitroGoat","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T07:03:12.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This usually happens when there's an overlay conflicting with League (you're basically trying to interact with a non functioning overlay instead of League itself).\n\nDiscord overlay is the one causing this issue at the moment, so turn it off and it should all be g.","replies":[]}]}
