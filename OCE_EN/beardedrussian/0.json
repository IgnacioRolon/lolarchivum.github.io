I know he says in the video that you can't be banned for editing the game files, but that's not true. People have been known to have been punished for changing resolutions in order to gain an unfair advantage. In fact [**Riot Keyru**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/XhXwwb0f-permabanned-for-changing-gamecfg-even-though-riot-has-said-its-allowed?comment=0008) recommends you do not touch the game files at all. \n\nWhat you are doing here is essentially editing game files to gain an unfair advantage with a larger minimap. So yeah... don't do it! :D","replies":[]}]}
