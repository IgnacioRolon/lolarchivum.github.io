Thanks Riot. :)\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nA fellow League of Legends player.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-11-30T20:37:56.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the new client, except for computers like mine, the champion select lags so much it's actually just obnoxious. I've accidentally dodged two or three ranked games by accident because when it was my turn to ban, it just glitched for the first 20 seconds and the rest lagged so much i couldn't lock in my ban. And in blind pick it's annoying cause i always end up as support or whatever is left. I hope Riot fixes these glitches before the update becomes mandatory.","replies":[{"poster":"Archanjewl","date":"2016-12-01T02:31:50.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too, stick with the legacy client for now, even calling for a role is slow which I kinda find annoying too. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
