Ranked should have harsher penalties. If it must enter a tiered system, normals should come next and as ARAM is a very casual queue, consequences should be less severe, but still tangible to prevent trolling. Bots however should not count. It should be the queue people can enter if they are not sure how much time they have. After all, a player leaving also means a bot leaving.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-07T22:21:58.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots leave to a degree, until there are only 3 left (I think). Maybe you should be able to afk in a bot game (but seriously, why not just play a custom against bots). The problem being with newer players playing against bots will have a lot of trouble killing them even when the entire team is there.
