Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff (soon™).\n>\n>2. **Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze v vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank).\n>\n>3.** Get super good at two roles** (especially for you, you play so many champs/roles).\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand.\n>\n>**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n>\n>Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be.\n>\n>5.** Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game.\n\nAfter looking through your stats it isn't really clear to me what your main roles are, so I am going to give you a basic starter pool for each role and I want you to choose the two roles you think you enjoy the most.\n\n**Top**\n{{champion:39}} Takes a while to master, but really strong once you do. Can solo carry games.\n{{champion:24}} Same as Irelia (bit easier), more likely to be banned in bronze/silver though.\n{{champion:111}} Much CC, very tank, so annoying, can make/break a team fight by ulting the backline. Very good choice IMO. can also go support or jg no problemo. \n\n**Mid**\n{{champion:103}} I see you have played a bit of ahri, she is really strong with good burst and mobility. You will just need to work on landing skill shots.\n{{champion:1}} Once again, tonnes of damage, a lot of cc, targeted cc, smurfs mage of choice. \n\n**Jungle**\n{{champion:32}} Cheap, relatively easy, tanky but can still build a lil damage. \n{{champion:11}} Can easily get out of control fed, most low players don't know how to counter him once sated, cheap and very easy.\n\n**ADC**\n{{champion:236}} Strong, good burst, great potential. Mobility for self-peel.\n{{champion:222}} / {{champion:18}} Hypercarries, fun and easy to play, mobility (esp on trist) for the self-peel. Jinx works well with blitz in lane with the hook+chompers. Jinx CC is pretty good.\n\n\n**Support**\n{{champion:89}}  for times you need tank and a lot of CC. \n{{champion:1}}  for times where your team could use some ap. Very basic, minimal skill shots, likely bronze players know what she does and can work around it (many low bronze players don't know what some of the champs do)\n\nUltimately, you are the only one who knows what you are going to enjoy playing, and who you enjoy playing will end up helping you climb. \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-03-21T11:18:36.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Most of my improvement comes from my ranked diary.
