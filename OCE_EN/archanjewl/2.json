Why do I want $35 skin with icons and a ward? Why did Riot and friends make me want to get her? WHY U DO THIS RIOT?! It&#039;s such a nice, beautiful skin, I&#039;m jealous of everyone who has it, especially those who have the Master Elementalist Edition. Nvm I'm told it's not that great but... I still like it and yes, I'm obsessing over a new popular skin. Had to get my thoughts out there. :3\n\nEdit: I finally got it! I think it's sorta kind of worth getting the Master Elementalist Edition if you like it a lot, you get 10 icons (I mean 11 icons) caus they would be 250 RP each which would mean in total of 2500 RP, 10 skins in one and a ward adding up to 1450 RP instead of just getting only the skin (2000 RP) and 5 icons (1,250 RP) aahhhh XD","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-30T21:36:33.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me it's the most beautiful 'fantasy' skin out there, especially since it's an ultimate skin.\nFor example, DJ Sona is modern, Pulsefire is futuristic, I guess SGU is fantasy but it's not as 'magic themed'.\n\nI'd totally get Elementalist Lux myself if I would use Lux more but I'm currently obsessing over Talon :P\n\nBut yeah definitely, Elementalist Lux is absolutely beautiful, definitely my favorite ultimate skin so far.\n\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Archanjewl","date":"2016-12-01T02:21:25.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talon's rework is great, I had a go of playing him myself.
