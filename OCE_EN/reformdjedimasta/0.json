I had some thoughts I wanted to share to get some feedback on. Basically I was permabanned for toxicity over 3 years ago and I've just picked up league again. I was wondering what everyone thought about having some sort of reformation system for permabanned players in order for them to get their account's back.\r\n\r\nI'll start from the beginning. So I started playing league in school when I was 14, at the end of season 2 I think, and played it soooooo much during most of highschool. I'd look forward to every weekend just to smash some league with the boys. Near the end of highschool however I started playing it less and less though, I was partying and focusing on school, I'd play it sometimes but I'd just do it to fill the time. \r\n\r\nThis was when I started being toxic, and in the space of a month or two I got banned multiple times which resulted in a permaban. I really didn't think anything of it at the time because I didn't play league much anymore so I just moved on with life. Anyway, since about October last year I started playing league again (my old mate who still plays told me old urf was coming back out) and I'm pretty much hooked. \r\n\r\nI've made a new account and got it up to level 36 now and although the game is as fun if not more fun than when I left it does suck having to start from scratch. I probably invested about 3.5k hours and heaps amount of money on my old account, I didn't even care about it as a kid but now I'm older I realize how much I had actually lost.\r\n\r\nSo anyway I did some research and found out they did an experiment a couple of times where they unbanned permabanned accounts and tested to see whether players had reformed or not. This supposedly had a 5-10% success rate (the toxic players kept being toxic) so they abandoned it ever since.\r\n\r\nBut say for instance Riot did unban some permabanned accounts for people who genuinely showed interest in reforming, if they continued to be toxic couldn't they just ban them again indefinitely with very little effort? Then the people who did reform, even if they are the minority, get to keep their accounts? I'm sure that 5-10% would never look back.\r\n\r\nI'm just throwing thoughts around but could there be some sort of system where if you get an account permabanned, the only way to get it back would be to level up an account to 30, get honour level 3, get no bans and have it linked to your email so its proven to be your account. Then make it so there has to be a certain period of time passed (6 months or something like that) before the account is even elegible to be unbanned? And if they get their account gets banned again then its gone for good. Thats a pretty crappy explanation but you get the idea. Does a system like that just require too much effort?\r\n\r\nI've talked to a couple of people in Riot's support team and they thought a new system could be a good idea so I'm curious as to what other people think. I do believe some sort of permaban system is necessary for league but I also think having some sort of reformation system could be beneficial and encourage alot of positive behaviour. I'm sure there are many other players out there like me that would love another chance to play on their old account.\r\n\r\nSo yeah what does everyone think about a system like this? If anyone from the Riot development team sees this I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on this topic. Also I've seen a few similar posts which seem to get a fair bit of negativity so please no hate! &lt;3 Btw I've been up all night so I'm sorry if this is a bit incoherent.

It's annoying that those people ruin it for people that have genuinely reformed and would love their accounts back.\n\nI talked with Riot support a few weeks back about my ban. First I got a bot, then it put me through to someone from Riot support who sent me what looked like mostly scripted messages, then they put me onto someone else, then someone else again. All of them were very nice to me except for the first guy but he wasn't that bad anyway. To be honest I kind of feel for them, I asked if they get messages from salty people and they told me some of the people they've talked to are \"downright scary\" xD\n\nThe last support person I talked to couldn't unban me because that's just the general rule at the moment, but she agreed that a new system could be really good and was actually the one who encouraged me to write something about it on these boards.\n\nThanks for commenting too man really good to hear what other people have to say! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-19T16:01:18.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can confirm all of these. \n\nOn top of that, the \"support\" employees don't even read the tickets and get so insanely salty when called out for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Synct","date":"2020-02-04T01:18:16.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just had an account permabanned without warning. My teen was angry that i removed her internet access so while i was asleep in bed she got up and int'd matches and flamed everyone for i dunno how many games. She now has no internet OR phone. But anyway it listed 2 matches for the 'ban reasoning' and just permabanned the account. I know it doesn't matter who's using the account idc about that, but to just permaban the account without warning kind of annoys me. I actually spent money on that account so some way to get it back would be very attractive to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-04T04:05:20.782+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think OPs suggestion particularly applies to your situation, but regardless there are a few things I can clarify here.\n\nUnless the ban is for something like cheating, an account will *always* receive a 14-day ban prior to a permanent one. That 14-day ban *is* the final warning and explicitly states in the reform card that any further violations can result in permanent suspension. If you believe your account did not receive this, you can appeal player support for a reduction: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAs far as your particular circumstance, it seems you already understand this but you and you alone are responsible for the *physical* security of the account. While Riot can protect you somewhat in the digital space, within the same household is a different matter.\n\nTo be clear, if for some reason the account did not receive that 14-day then the permanent suspension will be revoked, however, given that the punishment itself was not issued in error (just potentially the severity of the punishment was inappropriate), a 14-day ban would still stand on the account.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LordMegatron","date":"2020-02-04T09:20:13.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They tried this awhile ago turns out they became toxic again so no if you are perma banned you have been given lots of chances to change your attitude you don't realize till you are perma banned (for most people)","replies":[]}]}
