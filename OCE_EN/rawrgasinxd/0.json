Additionally, once any potential malware is removed, you'll want to change any passwords for any accounts that you believe may have been compromised. Regarding the ticket, so long as you sent in as much information as you could provide, you should be fine. Make sure that your sister stays on top of any updates with that ticket. Good luck!","replies":[]}]}
