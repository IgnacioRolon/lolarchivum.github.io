But here goes...\r\n\r\nI was wanting to suggest something to Riot about the Summoner Icons we can choose. And couldn't find anywhere to do it so I'm just doing it here. \r\n\r\nNow I have been playing League for a fair few years now (3 or 4), and I have gathered a nice amount of icons to choose from. I've had many people ask me 'when/how/what I did' to get certain icons that I've had on and people have seen in games or just my list. And I honestly don't know - sure some are self-explanatory like the Christmas Baron, I got it during a Christmas period.* But what year? How did I get it? Did I do anything special or did I just have to log in to get it?*\r\n\r\nI had a little look through my icons after buying the DJ Sona skin (at the 3 icons you get with it), now I bought it on release day (yesterday 26/02, and only had those Sona icons as new ones), but I looked before starting this post - **AND THERE WAS ANOTHER ICON!**\r\nIt has Ziggs with his head up and his hand reaching in the front (and middle) of the icon. Now where the hell did that come from? Sure as hell wasn't there yesterday. Now, I'm not complaining about getting it, but I want to know what it's from.\r\n\r\nSo, after all this rambling about the real struggles of the League Summoner Icon World. I'm going to tell you my suggestion (if you haven't given up reading by now, Yay for you ^-^).\r\n\r\n**Suggestion:** When you first open your icons you see the typical *\"A Summoner Icon is a picture that represents you in chat rooms and on your Friends List...\"* etc etc.. Keep that for the anyone who is new so they know (even though it's pretty obvious).\r\n**BUT!** When you click on one of the icons you have gained through whatever way, it will give you a little run-down/blurb of what it's from.\r\n**Example of most recent, that I can remember fresh in my mind:** *\"This Summoner Icon was (or is) gained by buying the DJ Sona Ultimate skin. (etc) This Summoner Icon was (or is) from Feburary 2015.\"*\r\n\r\nI would find it quite nice to be able to look at the icons and know what they are, and I think it would be a nice touch to the game. Some may like 'my' idea, which has probably already been said/asked of - but I've never seen it because I don't look through forums and I can't be the *only* person to have thought of this.. But, some may not like it because it means they get to see how much/long they have played this wonderful*(ly toxic)* game :)\r\n\r\nSo, thanks for making it to the end, I guess? Probably won't be seen by or get to Riot, but you know. I couldn't find another way. If you have any thoughts (which of course you do, you have a brain.. Or do you...?), I would love to see them. Even if they are 'mean', because you always get *those* people who can't hold their fingers (tounge).","replies":[{"poster":"MlkyIceCrmyShk","date":"2015-02-27T13:20:34.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Olikins","date":"2015-02-27T13:46:34.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that they do post that you will get it and things like that.
