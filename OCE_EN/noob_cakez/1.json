I know, I know im a little shit who deserves it and is toxic, and deal with it. Ok, I know i deserve the ban, and I have been warned several times. But I have a very volatile personality. I have a history of toxicity, but I also have (had?) a teamwork banner, the little green one. This is proof of how I swing from time to time. I read that a few years ago they had a system to level a new account to level 20 without any toxicity. If anyone from support could give me the chance that I dont deserve, I appreciate it. If not, and you truly want me out of your game, I understand and thank you for providing years of fun with friends.\r\n\r\nIf you are commenting just to say i&#039;m toxic and a terrible person, or anything along those lines, skip it, i&#039;m here for genuine help.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-30T07:32:03.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I read that a few years ago they had a system to level a new account to level 20 without any toxicity.\n\nUnfortunately this was a good while ago, and they no longer do this. Since there are more warnings and more chances to reform now, and since the old method didn't really do much good in most cases (as there was no real incentive to reform, just to keep your mouth shut for 20 levels then go right back to what you were doing), it is no longer an appropriate system to have. Unfortunately you have payed the price for your negative behaviour and will not be getting your account back.\n\nWith that said, you are completely free to create a new account, just be aware that if you can't keep your negative behaviour in check, any new account you make will end the same way.\n\nGood luck to you whether you choose to make a new account or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-10-30T12:43:33.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=GRuvUpA6,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-10-30T07:32:03.121+0000)\n>\n> Unfortunately this was a good while ago, and they no longer do this.
