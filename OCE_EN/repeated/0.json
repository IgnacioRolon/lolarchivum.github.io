You would have received the logs in the reform card (in-client) and via the registered email. The logs will show only what you have said, as it is Riot's policy to judge players based on their own actions, not the actions of others. If you are unable to find the logs on your end, you can request them from Support.\n\nIf you believe the ban was made in error, you can feel free to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to appeal the ban (choose the \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\" option). Keep in mind that, unless you ask for specific information, you may only get simple, generic responses and that the decision made by the Support staff is final.","replies":[]}]}
