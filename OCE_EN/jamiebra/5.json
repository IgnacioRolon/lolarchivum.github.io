We can't control or verify the actions or intentions of players so we advise against using the gifting system for trading.\n\nI'd advise against gift trading in future as we cannot reverse the transactions in situations like this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamiebra","date":"2015-10-19T07:17:50.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thier is evidence to and ignored yeah ok cheers & thank you for the help. letting a summoner get away with being a scumbag good one BYE!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jamiebra","date":"2015-10-18T11:27:21.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have screenshots of the whole convo if needed","replies":[]}]}
