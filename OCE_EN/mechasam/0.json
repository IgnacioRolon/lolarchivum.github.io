You want it to be a warm and fun place where you feel welcome. You may as well think of it as a second family to enjoy a past time with.\r\n\r\nTAW (The Art of Warfare) is broken up into several divisions in which their members participate in weekly scheduled training/practice matches and internal tournaments. We also frequently play against other clans/gaming groups when the interest arises. Each game we play hosts its own mini-clan that operates within the whole of TAW making us the large community we are. From FPS games to MMORPGs - you name it - we have it all.\r\n\r\nHere in the League of Legends division we welcome all players from the casual to the competitive. TAW holds League of Legends practices twice a week over TeamSpeak. \r\n\r\nThe League of Legends Division of TAW is broken into 4 Battalions. Europe Nordic and East, Europe West, North America and of course Oceania, each using their respective servers. The practice times are:\r\n\r\nBattalion 1 North America East:\r\nMon &amp; Wed 21:00 EST\r\n\r\nBattalion 2/3 Europe Nordic-East/West:\r\nSun &amp; Wed 20:00 CET\r\n\r\nBattalion 5 Oceania:\r\nTues &amp; Fri 19:30 AEST\r\n\r\nWhat sets us aside from other gaming communities?\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s our Code of Ethics and our Chain of Command (CoC). Every member in TAW (just as a fun tip &ndash; we are now 2600+ members out of which around 100 members are just in the LoL Division) abides by our Code of Ethics.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in becoming a member of our growing organization which has been around for 10+ years, you will find TAW to be a welcoming and accepting group of good folks who just want to enjoy the gaming experience.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the following:\r\nA Working Mic\r\nTeamSpeak 3\r\nProficient in the English Language\r\n\r\nTo apply go to [www.taw.net](http://www.taw.net) and click on Apply in the top right corner.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check your e-mail regularly for updates on your application.
