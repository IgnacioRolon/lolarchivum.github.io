I hover over Syndra and it shows a window or box which contains information regarding the champ being mastery 4. \r\nI hover over Vi and it shows that I&#039;m mastery 6 with one S token.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is customisable tabs.\r\nEach tab above the champion select screen says Top, Mid, Jgl, Adc, Supp.\r\nEither in the champ select screen, when I select a champ, or on my profile screen; next to item sets, masteries, or champions, there&#039;s an extra tab.\r\nThis extra tab could be called champion sets, or lane sets.\r\nWhere I can drag champions, for example, I drag Vi into the Jgl and Top tab, so that when I enter into a game, and I am maybe forced to go Jgl or Top, it specifies the corresponding champs I can comfortably play in that lane or Jgl meta OR the champs that I selected in the lane set tabs on my profile screen.\r\nE.g. I enter into a solo queue normal game and have to Top lane, where I have previously set champs to, like Mundo, Jayce, or Gnar, etc.\r\nMaking it quick and easy to select the champs that I like to or have previously played or set that they are a viable Top lane meta.\r\n\r\nA little GUI goes a long way to making us choose a good champ, or choosing a champ we know goes there.\r\n- as I find when you have 50+ champs it is quite annoying being told to Top lane and only having a few seconds to choose; when I could just press the &quot;Top&quot; tab and have a set of champions I like to top lane with.\r\n\r\nLove, iPwntz V","replies":[]}
