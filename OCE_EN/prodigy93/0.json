To be honest, ARAM and Normals (ranked, Twist Treeline, Summoner's Rift) get boring after a while. There's only so much you can do, and the more you play the less fun they are.\n\nURF, even when it's AR, is fun regardless of how much you play. Even if they don't bring it out permanently as a game mode aside from ARAM/Normals, they should at least introduce it to Custom Mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EU Monkeys","date":"2017-05-31T09:37:49.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i like the idea a lot!!
