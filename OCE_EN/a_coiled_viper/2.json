Just looking for anyone who is interested in playing some 1v1&#039;s on either summoners or howling abyss. The idea being just being able to play the champs you want to practice without having to fight it out in team select with the focus on just getting better being able to consistently play the champs you want. I have tried making customs and titling them 1v1 practice but it tends to bring out the more trolly people rather then people who just wanna have fun and get better at the same time. \r\n\r\nSo If you just wanna chill and practice your 1v1 add me in game. (Obviously with the focus on top and mid lane) \r\n\r\nOnly chilled non trolls need add me. Skill level doesn&#039;t matter as if i happen to be better i&#039;d be happy to give any tips and if you are better i&#039;d love to learn from you especially if theres any diamonds or higher reading this.... :D\r\n\r\nSee you on the rift!","replies":[{"poster":"FireIce","date":"2015-06-21T02:43:59.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have requested YOUR friendship","replies":[]}]}
