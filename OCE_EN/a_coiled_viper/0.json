(looking at you teemo and quinn.) (but specifically teemo for reasons i will discuss)\r\n\r\nIn recent times Riot has been all about having counterplay for example talons silence being removed and veigars stun having a cast time etc etc.\r\n\r\nRecently i&#039;ve been seeing alot of teemo around and while he does fall of end game ive found it exceedingly hard to play around his blinding dart during lane. (Unless you are an ap caster)\r\n\r\nQuinn on the other hand i find is perfectly ok as her blind is a skill shot and she doesnt have the move speed of a teemo.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering what the community thinks as a whole. \r\n\r\nIs blind worthy of being removed due to the lack of counterplay against it?\r\n\r\nIs there meaningful counterplay against it that makes it fine?\r\n\r\nDo i just accept a lane loss if i am an auto attack based champ against a teemo and make it up late game?\r\n\r\nIs there any tweaks to either blind or the champs that use it that could make it better?\r\n\r\nLook forward to your opinions and advice for and against the idea and please bear in mind this is not a teemo hate thread :D","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-05T03:43:56.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure tenacity, spellshields and qss/cleanse all counter blind. but if you are talking about in a 1v1 situation always travel with ur sup. also im pretty use that getting stunned for 2 seconds by cass or irelia is going to be far more devastating to an adc. than a 2.5 second blind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-04T11:30:25.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teemo = 1 shotted by support (counterplay LOL)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-04T08:42:41.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have any problem with blind as a mechanic. I do however have a problem with Teemo's blind (and sorry but I'm probably going to turn this into a Teemo hate thread). Quinn's blind isn't really a problem, it's a skillshot most of the time and the rest of the time it's melee AOE, it can be dodged relatively easily (not to mention she is rarely played properly, if at all). Teemo's blind on the other hand is targeted, it can only be dodged using certain items/abilities (Zhonya's Hourglass, Vladimir's Sanguine Pool, Kayle's Intervention etc). Naturally you'll get the people who would say \"just use Quick Silver Sash\" but QSS isn't something people would willingly use for a blind rather than hard CC (a stun or snare for example). Perhaps Teemo's blind could be changed to a skillshot rather than being targeted or maybe it could have reduced duration/damage/AP ratio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quayer5","date":"2015-05-04T08:21:00.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is cc not counterplay not, while blinded then beat them up when no longer blind eg jax stun then aa","replies":[]}]}
