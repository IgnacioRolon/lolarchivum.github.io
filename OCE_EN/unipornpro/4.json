TOP lane easily has my biggest champ pool and sup because it feels like i have the least pressure on me in that roll, unlike with jng i feel like if i slip up ive just lost us the game","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-12T00:37:12.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i guess if you don't mind taking suggestion from another newbie (me...\ni used to die alot too, but at the moment my over all win rate is about 56%? \nwell it's not great... but i've been dying alot lately\n\nfrom that list u gave, seems like you mostly use melee (or semi-melee like Kayle)chars?\ni guess since melee is always up and close, chance of dying is very high\nsuppose u just need to know when to back off?\ni only play ADC and support, with ADC i used to try and chase\nor stick around not rtb when low hp, and got ganked or what ever\n\nalso knowing your enemy's skill helps i guess? \nlike against Blitz, took me a while to remember his grabing range and speed and such\nso now when i face him, or similar grabing hero (like treash) i die a lot less\nsame with other champs, if you know their skill, you will have a rough idea on how to deal with them\n\nsomeone once told me that\n\"for one game, don't worry about killing, try just not to die\"\nthe way he discribe to me is that, \n\"everytime u die, that another 20% income toward another major item for the enemy\nit does not help your team in anyway what so ever, \nand, it's worse then you not lv up enough or don't have enough income\nso, just don't die\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T03:39:20.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine to help people who want it.

You'll get better either way, just keep if you just keep playing.\n\nMy best suggestions is decide what aspect of the game you think you're lacking skill in:\n\n- Objective understanding\n- General mechanics\n- Creed scoring\n- When to play safe and when to be aggressive\n- Team coordination\n- Specific champion mechanics\n\nThen just play a few games focussing on that aspect.\n\nIf you want me to watch or play with you and give you real-time tips, then just add me as a friend. \n\nSummoner name: Tweak","replies":[]}]}
