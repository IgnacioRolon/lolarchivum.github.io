I tried I think it was about 38% crit damage like 5% attack speed .. And played I the jg . Admittedly it was slow and painful but that 4th shot chunks so hard.   After I got Ie  I could 4th shot nasus at 1/3 hp or more ..  And his ult 4th shot crit scales with  crit damage from IE and runes I went well didn't die it was pretty fun tbh","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedFlames","date":"2016-02-13T07:58:37.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did that Nasus rush Bloodthirster and then sell his items and get two thornmails?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-02T03:16:04.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The maximum critical strike bonus you can get from runes is 45.51%. \n\nThis is good because **Jhin** has a reduction of 25% critical strike damage, meaning you'll make up for it, plus have some extra damage. The problem is, you can just buy an **Infinity Edge** for 50% bonus critical strike damage, and take normal runes.\n\nLooks like we'll need more time too see what's viable/optimal, but I theorise that full attack speed **Jhin** will be the preferred build.\n\n> Oh and btw what is his actual ad based of crit and as?\n\nThis is straight from the wiki:\n\n_\"Additionally, his attack damage is increased by 2% - 40% (based on level) (+ 4% per 10% critical chance) (+ 2.5% per 10% bonus attack speed).\"_\n\nRead more about that [here](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jhin), if you're interested.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KDAs","date":"2016-02-02T01:04:25.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For his Crit 100 % crit would give 40% bonus AD, and with his attack speed at 155% boost would give you 80% on the movement speed proc, and the attack speed bonus is 2.5 per 10% so with attack speed being 155% would mean that 2.5 * 15 = 37.5 bouns damage with you're autos \n\nin total 37.5 / 0.40 = 93.75 bonus damage for this example\n\nso crit dmg runes may not be a bad idea will try them out :)","replies":[]}]}
