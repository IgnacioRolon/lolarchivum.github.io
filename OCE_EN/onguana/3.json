Olaf and Trydamere are ok but I want someone with a heavy melee weapon that feels like a juggernaut. Makir is sort of a Darius/Olaf style of character who focuses on getting into a fight and remaining alive or dying. Let&rsquo;s get into his abilities:\r\n\r\nRelevant Information:\r\n- Low base hp and scaling\r\n- Moderate armor/mr values\r\n- Low health regen\r\n- Low movement speed\r\n\r\nPassive - Vampirism\r\nFor every 1% hp Makir is missing he gains .1/.3/.5% life steal\r\nCould make it that he does not regenerate health passively instead and buff these numbers significantly.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nMakir&#039;s kit focuses on soaking damage. He has no disengage and is a melee champion so he really can&#039;t do much against ranged carries or mages once he has expended his gap closing potential. \r\n\r\nQ - Downward Bound\r\nMakir lifts leaps into the air and strikes his target from above with his axe (Darius Style) dealing physical damage and applying on hit affects. The cooldown resets whenever he kills an enemy with Downward Bound.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nThis ability is really a rip off of Darius ultimate. I hope that the fact that it doesn&#039;t deal true damage is enough to make it feel more like a basic ability. I was also thinking that it could have another penalising affect such as it costing health or acting like a Jayce leap that can be dodged via flash or a dash ability. I want it to critical strike as well so that people would have to build damage on him rather than rushing warmogs or other tanky items. Due to the large amount of tank friendly on hit affects however it does seem pretty strong to give him the ability to proc them all with his gap closer. Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nW - Crushing Stroke\r\nMakir&#039;s next basic attack deals bonus damage based on the targets maximum health (increased against minions and can also affect structures) as well as sweeping dealing the same amount of damage to targets in a significantly small area around Makir. \r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nBasic attack steroid, most bruisers have one. The area of affect is smaller than ravenous Hydra so Makir really has to be in the thick of it to make the most of this ability.\r\n\r\nE- Raise Morale\r\nMakir shouts a battle cry, giving allies around him (including minions) bonus movement speed for a few seconds and restoring a portion of their mana.\r\n\r\nR- Force of the Hellbound\r\nMakir starts swinging his axe wildy around him, dealing damage and applying on hit affects to targets around him. Deals damage in ticks. Makir can move, but not very fast, while the ability is active. Targets who remain inside the AoE for more than 2 ticks (roughly 1 second) take significantly reduced damage but still take the on hit effects that would otherwise proc as well as shredding their armor for the next 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nThis is Makir&#039;s bread and butter. It&rsquo;s his I want to fight and I want to win move. Hitting a whole team inside this ultimate with a couple of on hit items can deal significant damage to the enemy team either killing them outright if they are squishy or leaving them exposed to your ad carries and your other abilities. It&rsquo;s a move that you don&#039;t want to be caught in.\r\n\r\nLore Concepts -\r\nA) Noxian Background - \r\nHardened Noxian War Veteran who rivals the reputations of Darius and Sion. His excellence on the battlefield has earned him the rank of Noxian High Guard Commander, responsible for guarding the most important members of the Noxian Government/Noblemen. He has also been dispatched with Noxian corps and played a major role in the aftermath of the battle that resulted in the death of Jarven the 3rd, specifically rallying the Noxian troops to allow Sion to kill the king and later ensuring that the Noxian troops were able to retreat by taking on a whole platoon of soldiers single handidly. Is friends with Sion, Darius and Swain who are all thankful for his service to Noxus.\r\n\r\nAppearance - Wears heavy Knight Armor, similar to that of Mordakasier but with slightly thinner with more exposed flesh in joint areas to provide the movement required to wield his battle axe.  Warden sort of feel, He wields a two handed battle axe.\r\n\r\nConcept pictures:\r\nHelmet- http://gdfb.co.uk/ekmps/shops/11b299/images/great-helmet-of-rieter-von-kornburg-nuremberg-[3]-685-p.jpg\r\nMatches my warden vision\r\nAxe - http://store.larprealm.com/image/cache/data/Product%20Images/Epic%20Armoury/Axes/Double%20Headed%20Battle%20Axe%20IF-402402-600x600.png\r\nArmor - https://sharpenyourgame.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/armortime.jpg\r\nBasically what he would look like minus helmet and axe. Armor would have redder and less shoulder padding. This could make for a cool release skin similar to Darius&#039;.\r\n\r\n(None of these images belong to me)\r\n\r\nB) Shadow Isles Warden/Champion\r\nA descendant of the ruined king who watches over the isles and protecting the castle that belonged to his ancestors. The castle contains treasures beyond the imagination of man. Even the likes of the most ruthless murderers across Runeterra shudder at the shear brutality and finesse with which he is said to dispatch of his victims. Many of the Isles champions know of him and are not hostile towards him. Some even friendly such as Elise and Kalista.\r\n\r\nAppearance - Pretty much the same with the warden look. More skeletal type of armor with green highlights/glow to get the shadow isles feel. Could replace axe with a scythe to make him even more shadow islesy.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, please let me know your thoughts, this is the first champion I have created.","replies":[]}
