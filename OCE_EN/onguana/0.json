Once you get used to playing at a higher level of play, it should be easy to get your main out from B5. \n\n> [Part of the problem is, you've played so many games where you are, that even if “you are better than everyone else where you are”, you have no means to improve. By far the fastest way to improve is to play with/against and then catch up to people of greater skill than you. If you are already top rung where you are, then you aren't going to be able to climb the metaphorical ladder of improvement, you need to find a taller ladder.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/uuXKhEmk-ok-legit-im-pissed-off-again?comment=0002000000000000000000000000000000000000)","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-21T11:15:26.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"^ Hasn't worked for me.

I mean you are B5 and playing your main sure as hell isn't going to get you anywhere. Or just abuse the system and go dynamic =L Seems to work for everyone. Also why did you play ranked if you weren't ready. That's like having sex at the age of 18 just because you can or just because you are old enough to. Patience is the key to victory :).
