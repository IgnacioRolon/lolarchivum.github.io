I will add Edits and progress on this post for updates etc. But i hope to host this with a Prize pool and if riot can sanction this event once it happens they can potentially earn themselves their triumphant skin. Location will be in Sydney CBD NSW. Anyone wishing to back me in this feel free to comment here on thoughts of schedules etc{{summoner:4}} .","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-08-08T04:14:25.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\nGreat idea to start a tournamen!
