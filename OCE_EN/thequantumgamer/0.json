Today i had a bugsplat error but managed to get back into the game and help my team win the match but yet i still get 20mins low prior ques. I rarely ever get the bug splat glitch and the last time i had low prior was about 3-4 months ago so i feel the system need to be re done as its not even helping people be toxic people don&#039;t care if they AFK or troll if they are going to be toxic having a 20min wait for a match is just going to delay them for 20mins its not going to stop them. We could at least have the system where if you play a certain amount of matches you low prior if you are to obtain it for any reason will be at a low punishment say after 25-50 games each lvl of punishment. I find it it just completely stupid that i have been fine for the last 3-4months and i get a bad match were my game crash and i have no control of it but i still get 20mins :|. I even got my green ribbon again.","replies":[{"poster":"TheQuantumGamer","date":"2015-04-15T11:11:34.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know people are saying no but i would like a reason like what is that you thing is good about this system that makes you want to keep it","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-04-15T17:39:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It works.

But there is about triple that amount in ways you get it for stupid reasons like bugs/crashes/comp crashes/ black outs/ your laptop power ran out/you can even get it by joining back in if you are out for more then 10-15mins.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-15T15:14:35.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what you don't understand:\n- Reports for AFK count for practically nothing if the system doesn't mark you as AFK/DC. Even with 9 reports it still probably wont do much, if anything at all.\n- Reasons like \"bugs/crashes/comp crashes/ black outs\" etc shouldn't be happening consistently enough to get you hit with LPQ. If it is then you need to stop playing a game that requires the time you obviously don't have, even though such things are out of your control.\n- Reason like \"your laptop power ran out/you can even get it by joining back in if you are out for more then 10-15mins.\"/unstable connection etc. are the result of you not ensuring you meet the connection/hardware requirements of the game which is actually breaking the TOU and EULA and, as a result, you are at least partially at fault.\n\nTLDR What you've said isn't reason for changes in the current leavebuster system.","replies":[{"poster":"TheQuantumGamer","date":"2015-04-17T09:18:53.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the thing is i only just had one random bug and it gave me 20min que it was the first time it had happened in over a month or so. Please explain to me how this is happens i have not left been toxic or even dced with in the time of that moth and you say that its cos my issues were consistent. I have the time for this game i do play it i will play out my 20min ques i just feel the whole system needs to be fixed because its just full of glitches and the who system has not been set out as good as it could be. I personally Don't want the system gone it just not very well done. I don't understand how it is my fault that a bug with the companies game stops me from playing, How am i at fault if someone has gone crazy on the road crashed into the power supply and shut the whole suburbs power out. Maybe its not all my fault if something was to go wrong. I admit at times some people would be to blame for there ques but its not always the player.\n\n\nIf this is not a reason for change then what is because so many people have had this problem","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-04-15T06:53:43.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed. Got ddosed 2 games straight. BOOM! leaver buster. It needs to decrease as you behave yourself. Otherwise, what's the point of punishing them? if there's no reward on the other side. Personally I'd want to earn back Zero leaver buster minutes, but if it keeps increasing and your unfortunate enough to have a bug, error, or power outage it only gets worse and You may as well make a new account.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-15T07:02:51.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LOKI3974,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BHLX0teg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-15T06:53:43.550+0000)\n>\n> Agreed.
