After I bought it and entered the pre-game lobby, I forgot to mention not to ban Ezreal and it got banned. He apologized and said I should&#039;ve said something, I replied back mentioning it was okay, and wished them gl before I dodged. After 5 minutes of waiting I enter another lobby to quickly mention - &quot;DONt ban ezreal&quot;, followed up by &quot;please :(&quot; after two jerks abused me, as they proceeded to ban it. Following up by a lot of abuse; I left the match in-game before it even started as they made me feel so god damn low... can seriously, anything be done to these players. Their names were Lemonlicker &amp; ITS FVCKING DAVE on Oceania :&#039;(","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-05T09:23:22.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCan you please remove the offending player's names from your post as the boards have a strict \"No naming and shaming rule\".\n\nI can understand your frustration with the players, however the boards are not the correct place to report toxicity, if you had no chance to report them (\"I left the match in-game\") in the end-game screen, which it sounds like you didn't, then your best bet would be to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support.","replies":[]}]}
