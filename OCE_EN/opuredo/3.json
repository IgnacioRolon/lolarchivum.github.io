Im disappointed they want to change her.\n\nTo me she embodies everything an assassin should:\nShe's tricksy, she has very high single target burst damage, if she succeeds she melts her target, if she fails, she dies.\n\nShe's all about making picks, counterplaying, and choosing her moments.\n\nThe thing is, assassin players are so used to the braindead 'jump on face and kill!' playstyle of so many popular picks, that they see LB as bad.\nIn reality, she isn't bad, she just requires effort, unlike the popular picks.\n\nA good leblanc player can outwit and outplay an opponent to the point where they are squinting at their grey screen and thinking _\"but... I thought?... what?\"_\n\nThe difference between popular picks, and LeBlanc, is that LeBlanc's combos are avoidable, but unpredictable. Where the combos of Zed/Fizz etc, are hilariously predictable, but unavoidable.\n\n______________\n\nSo its just a feel good thing.\nYou can win because you outplayed the opponent, or you can win because your champ carried you.\nTo some, winning is the only objective, to others, its all about self improvement and knowing you played well, whatever the outcome.\n\nYou have to ask yourself to which category you belong. _(theres nothing wrong with either, its just how you enjoy playing the game)_.\n\nI for example fit into the second category, one of the reasons I main champs like Azir, Aurelion Sol, and Taliyah, is because when I do well and do win, I know it was me that won, not the champs piggybacking me.\n\nIf all you care about is winning games, then maybe don't play LB, statistically you're less likely to make mistakes with someone with less things to think about, like Zed.  But if how you win, and knowing you won through your own skill an strategy is more important, then play LB! When you get outplayed and lose, you'll only have yourself to blame, when you outplay someone else, you know it was **you** that did it, and not the champ.","replies":[{"poster":"oPuredo","date":"2018-03-23T10:59:42.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For some reason, I agree with that you say.\n\nThe only issue is that I played the original LeBlanc... ;_;\n\nWith that said...
