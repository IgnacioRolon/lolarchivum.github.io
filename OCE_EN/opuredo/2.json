That explains it.\nHow do you suggest I get the boxes?

You can also duo que with people. If someone in your party gets an S- on a champion, and you own that champion, have a box available (as shown in your profile tab) as well as haven't unlocked a box with them, you will get a box too.\n\nBut yes, the best way is to simply play well on different champions. I'm not 100% on when the boxes reset, whether it is preseason or start of the next season, but you will be able to unlock another box for every champion again next season.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-11-03T08:23:48.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% provided you are playing a champion that YOU own, when either yourself or someone in your premade gets an S- or better in a game. \n\nLike _BarryButcher_ said, you can only get one chest per champ, per season (as indicated by the little gold boarder around the champ in the \"champions\" client tab).","replies":[]},{"poster":"which is me","date":"2016-11-03T07:48:22.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play a champion that you haven't got a box with and duo with a friend and hope your friend carries ;D","replies":[]}]}
