How much more supporty could one get?\nDo you think buying a sight stone 5 seconds before the game ends would make the rank go up?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-19T13:22:29.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you didn't buy a support gold item and a sightstone, you are the type of support that I hate most and I main support.\n\nAlso I think he means, the number of wards placed and wards destroyed might have something to do with your score (though I won't lie, if you want to get an S on a support, try to aim for around 80cs by 30min, depending on your champion, though don't steal it, just pick up waves your teammates aren't there for) Also that ezreal game it probably thought you were the adc.\n\nIf you want to get S's as a support, your checklist of things to do (some dodgy) include:\n\n- place at least 20 wards, 4 control wards and kill at least 5 enemy wards\n- get at least 60-70% kill participation\n- dying less than 3 times\n- getting at least 8 kills\n- getting at least 20 assists\n- pick up farm as much as possible to hit 3cs/min or more\n- buy a support gold item (sightstone helps you hit the ward targets too)\n- generally have flash+exhaust/ignite (sometimes the game will register you as the wrong role)\n- Manage to get the sneaky last hit on at least 2 towers\n- Try to manage to get a killstreak\n- It seems to help your score if you steal first blood\n- try to either have tanked a fair bit of damage without dying (you'll be registered as a tank) or instead provide alot of healing (register as a healer)\n\nAt least these seem to be requirements for an S on the supports or not supports I tested this with in the support role: \n{{champion:53}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:412}} these had high requirements to get S's that I listed\n{{champion:17}} {{champion:36}} these champions had requirements a considerable deal lower.\n\nThis is as far as I've worked out the champion mastery system, I'm pretty sure the score calculation is done similar to the way the LOLSUMO app does it, with just a few extra parameters.","replies":[{"poster":"oPuredo","date":"2017-02-20T11:56:30.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of your requirements are way too high for simple support champions, e.g. kills/cs/participation. \n\nI'm a support main and can easily get S on my first try on all my accounts for Blitz/Janna. S with Sona is much harder, and Thresh I only use at higher ELOs.\n\nAlso, I don't think last-hitting turrets makes a difference (not confirmed).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
