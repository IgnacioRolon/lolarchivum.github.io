She does. It's been like 2 years. Steel Legion didn't fit her at ALL. To be honest? Only sorceress and crownguard really do..\n\nI have an idea for a new lux skin idea. Astral Princess Lux.\nShe has platinum blonde hair with a silver, blue diamond and rose quartz encrusted tiara. Her hair is a large braid put to the left side with a sideswept fringe with a long strand of hair from the other side hanging out. She has white, silver glowing elbow length gloves. She wears a royal blue dress (LINK ABOVE : http://www.sammydress.cc/ball-gown-strapless-ruched-embroidery-satin-long-royal-blue-quinceanera-dress_945.html  minus the gloves.) With matching royal blue and silver heels. Her wand looks like: http://parlourtricks.deviantart.com/art/Golden-Star-s-Star-Wand-143279353 \nThis skin is Legendary, priced at 1820 RP.\nHer recall animation ideas are;\nShe walks into a beautiful grove, then stars and comets shoot across the skies. Lux basically fangirls over it.\nSecond idea: She walks into her room being shoved by her maids, they put her in front of a mirror to put makeup on her.\nThird Idea: Lux tries to cast a perfect spell with a spell book and wand. The spell backfires, with a supernova. \nDeath Animation:\nLux falls to the ground, an astral portal opens up and swallows her into the galaxy. \nHer auto attack animation is a blue star comet. With silvery light behind trailing it. It explodes on impact.\nHer passive animation is a a crescent moon outline. Then explodes with light on impact like normally.\nLight Binding:\nIt looks like a blue dashing ray of light with stars and moons. When it hits an enemy/enemies, it looks like morgana's prison. But on the bottom of the target, a moving star is there. Thin watery astral lines accompnay the prison.\nLucent SIngularity:\nShe throws a star levitating with small moons sorrounding it. It spins like a globe and then explodes. with light.\nPrismatic Barrier:\nLux throws her wand, the shield looks like a a giant star. An opaque giant star.\nFinal Spark:\nFinal Spark looks like a dozen crescent moons in a line with a silvery light dashing through each one. They all explode, with stars. \nWhen she casts it, she says: The stars align.\nDance: Lux dances with a prince. *Prince appears out of nowhere*\nLaugh: Lux Laughs.\nTaunt: MY POWER. WILL DOMINATE. \nEnergy of the moon, sun and stars! Is MORE than enough to defeat you!\nMy magic is stronger. How strong? Stronger than yours.\nWalking: There is always light in the darkness.\nAstral ENERGY! It's so fun!\nMy power is Awesome!\nJoke: Astral Power, is like the best! It's SO much fun!\nAstral is like, the new thing.\nMy magic failed?! *says while casting a spell* Uhh.. Haha? Oh look over there! *fades into the shadows*\nSailer moon? That thing was like inspired by me.\nAlso includes a chibi lux summoner icon\n{{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-02T00:54:57.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BoomItsAdrian,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=6EvrN0sA,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-01T09:01:21.558+0000)\n> non-princess related skin.","replies":[{"poster":"BoomItsAdrian","date":"2015-03-02T06:18:18.007+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?
