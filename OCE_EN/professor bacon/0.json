Just list your champs in \"Highest Mastery\" order and appreciate your topline of champs in silence, as only you can see them unless you share it. Which, unless asked you're only saying it for some indirect/pretense its to do with something else, but let me just slip my mastery list in here for you to compliment if you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Bacon","date":"2016-07-27T00:12:14.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah didn't at all want attention for that.
