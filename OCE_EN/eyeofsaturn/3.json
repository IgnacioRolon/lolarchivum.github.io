To be quite honest with you, I find this appalling. You might be wondering why I love these champions and I&#039;d respond that I find them to be too cute to pass up such an opportunity. These champions have carried me all the way to Bronze 2! I find it strange how the community always shuns me out for locking in Poppy mid lane while I&#039;m trying to win my promos. It makes me sad that people consider me a &#039;troll&#039; or &#039;not taking ranked seriously&#039; but I&#039;d always reply that it&#039;s just a game with some cute Yordle champions. Right? I think we could improve ranked by making some small adjustments which would improve the MOBA world (LoL) and make it an overall performing advantageous leading edge product for consumers alike.\n\nPlease note as these have been considered among my internet friends and we&#039;ve been discussing it in our Teamspeak server for quite awhile so credit also goes to them...\n- Make a Yordle badge!!! When I choose Gnar or Urgot I&#039;d like it to prove that I am good with that particular champion and provide me with some sort of badge. I know we have the champion mastery one but this one needs to stand out more. I&#039;m suggesting we make a badge at the top of the loading screen with goes as follows: \"HIGH YORDLE CARRY POTENTIAL - (Champion name)\" This would allow the enemy team to wet their pants and my team to get over their ranked anxiousness.\n- Provide more Yordle lore! Perhaps adding in books or things to buy with that extra gold at the start of a round right after I buy my AP items. If your curious I buy {{item:1052}} which really gives me that advantage against the enemy during laning phase. While waiting for minions to spawn (I find that they appear anywhere from 1 minute up to 2 minutes 30 seconds). I know Reddit agrees with me as they defiantly know what they are talking about and know game design back to front... I mean it&#039;s Reddit after all right? The smart people from other teenage social media have gathered among the Reddit boards. I have proof of this.\n- When I get abused and trolled in my ranked games I&#039;d like an option to include &#039;discrimination of champion&#039; within the report area post game. The abuse is uncanny and at times triggers my depression.\n\nThank you for reading my suggestions for making League of Legends more Yordle friendly. Let&#039;s hope for a Riot response (I&#039;m looking at you Brandon Beck and Mark Merrill). Any more suggestions leave below for me to respond to! I seriously believe that with these additions, League of Legends will become one of the most played games in the world with millions of players. But no Call of Duty or DOTA players as I find them to be trolls.\n\nPSS. Please don&#039;t add me in game as I only add people I know from real life that play Yordles and know their lore extensively. If you would like to add me please join my Teamspeak server and join the room called &#039;exam&#039; and I will question you on your League of Legends lore in regards to Yordles.
