This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will fix on itâ€™s own and usually lasts a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.\n\nAs for the LP, I'm afraid you won't receive it since the game never strictly ended so it can't calculate the lp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"donttochme","date":"2016-04-30T06:36:55.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]},{"poster":"HaXeL Shotz","date":"2016-04-29T23:11:09.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump for visibility","replies":[]},{"poster":"Asia","date":"2016-04-29T14:44:14.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[{"poster":"HaXeL Shotz","date":"2016-04-29T14:45:27.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"glad im not the only one.. {{champion:32}}","replies":[]}]}]}
