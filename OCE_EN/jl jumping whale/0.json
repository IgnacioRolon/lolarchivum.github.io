I called someone a retard and swore a few times (f, s,) and I got a 10 game chat ban. Then I stopped using those words and I called our jungler a retard because he was trolling and it was clear as he was stealing farm and running into enemy turrets and I get a 14 day suspension??? That&#039;s just dumb in my opinion, team started flaming me and provoking all the time for him stealing my cs had put me behind. It has been a very disappointing experience with Riot Games so far and I feel like quitting as there have been too many teams that brought me down with trolling and rage quitting, etc. I am brought down simply because 1 person decides to afk or troll. The other 4 play well but 1 person decides to troll and the whole team gets affected and loses.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\nA very disappointed player","replies":[{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-05-19T02:59:47.069+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah if i was you, i would just don't talk or play like a pro you wont get reported  take me for example from lvl 0 honor to lvl 1 and second checkpoint in 1  week just gotta not tilt let the haters hate and just be you","replies":[{"poster":"JL Jumping Whale","date":"2018-05-19T06:00:16.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok dude thanks, will try just not talking/typing.

I did the same thing and got banned again... i don't understand why.\n\nI mean it is very simple. Don't call people retards. Don't type unnecessary stuff at all. Not like people who troll actually care, more than likely you are giving them what they want by reacting.\n\nJust mute them, don't type and report. It's not too hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-19T01:05:30.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you called someone a retard and got punished for it, but stopped using that word, but then you called someone else a retard even though you stopped using that word, and you wonder why you got banned?\n\n~~#RitoLogic~~\n\nConsider this for a moment:\n> more than likely you are giving them what they want by reacting.\n\nIt's often the case that trolling is done to incite some kind of reaction, especially one that will be a detriment to the person who is reacting. Clearly all you have done is give the trolls the exact reaction they were hoping for and got yourself in a bad position because of it.\n\n*Normally* I might say something like \"don't be such an idiot\", but I honestly don't care if you get a perma. In fact, I hope you do. Had enough with players bringing up this kind of complete bullsh!t hoping to get away with sh!t. *YOU* did the wrong thing and *YOU* got punished for it, accept it or  \"go away\" (I think you can figure out what I *really* want to say here).","replies":[{"poster":"JL Jumping Whale","date":"2018-05-19T06:03:10.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He swore at me more than I did by like 10x.

Just because you didn't receive it, does *NOT* mean they weren't punished.\n\nLastly, you come here b!tching about this when you *clearly* did the wrong thing, saying it's \"unfair\" when the reality of it is that you've agreed to play Riot's game *under the condition* that you follow Riot's rules, which you have broken. For some f*cked up reason, you have the audacity to come here and complain because, oh, there's actual consequences to your actions, kind of like real life, right? And you shouldn't have to put up with that why? Because it's the internet? Or perhaps it's because you're a special snowflake who deserves preferential treatment? Or perhaps even both?\n\nGet over yourself, you got what was coming to you.\n\nNo regards necessary,\nA very annoyed, pissed off player who is sick of your sh!t.","replies":[{"poster":"JL Jumping Whale","date":"2018-05-19T10:36:17.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"holy why u so mad","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
