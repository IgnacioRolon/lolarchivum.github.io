If I don&#039;t want to play that champ, that means when I reroll, I want a different champ, not the same champ so for me to get Cassitopia 2 times in a row is just madding. \n\nI know Riot is less then likely to respond to this (or fix it) but I think it&#039;s worth pointing out this, glitch or not, I think we need some counter measures to stop people rerolling into the same champ even once with their two rerolls. What do you guys think about this?","replies":[{"poster":"Vhaegor","date":"2016-11-17T12:39:29.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha wow thats just stupid, why would they not add in that you can't get the same champion.","replies":[]}]}
