I don&#039;t spam, usually just type mid once or twice, haven&#039;t been banned for months and have never been chat banned. This happens almost every game to the point where if I want any position other than sup I  need to party with a friend and have them call it. Does anyone know a way around this or how to fix it?\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-02T01:14:27.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis definitely sounds like a connection issue to me, however let's rule out the possibility of a client issue first.\nCould you please [run a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) on your client to ensure there are no corrupt files.\n\nNow onto the potential connection issues;\nCould you [switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) and let me know if that helps, if not we can explore further potential fixes for this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Rastus22","date":"2016-03-02T06:26:55.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I already am using that.
