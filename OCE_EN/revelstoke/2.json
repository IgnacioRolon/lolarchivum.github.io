But I mainly queue for top and jg and from my memory, I have only been given something not those 2 for like 4 or 5 times out of my 20 something  (or 30 something) ranked games played.\n\nThat said, I think the chance is not equal for all players and that 1/20 is just an average from all players maybe. Because if you typically queue for high-demand positions like mid then obviously you are going to get autofilled more than say when you queue for top, which is the second least popular position afaik (and if you always queue for supp, you pretty much will never get autofilled into other positions).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-22T05:52:34.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a time when there's no Autofill, it was before its introduction though.\n\nBut understand that Autofill is necessary, because without it, queue times can literally be hours long even in Bronze and Silver and no one wants to deal with it.","replies":[]}]}
