Is it classed by the community as Unsportsmanlike or Inting??","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-25T11:09:13.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying out a champ you haven't playet a build that's odd or anything like that is not something you can report. Yes it sucks but really they are not doing anything wrong. They prefer to play ranked over normals and that's where they try the new things.\n\nOr, they got fill and ended up jg and didn't have a champ maybe his champ got ban who knows. \n\nSitting in base complaining though that you can report as negative attatude.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-23T06:43:25.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem isn't playing champs they've never touched in Ranked, the problem is performing so badly it almost feels intentional that's the hardspot in whether or not they should be reported. If the score isn't something as drastic as 0/20 there isn't that much concrete ground to report them as bad performance isn't innately a offence to the rule, but yeah trust me, I tilt too when I see my Ranked team goes 0/10 and doing just completely silly things like invading enemy blue/red when 2 of our 3 lanes are completely down.\n\nWith that guy who allegedly sitting at fountain and complain and does nothing else though, they can be reported for Negative Attitude I think. Not sure.\n\nIt's also a well known fact by this point that Ranked players, unless higher ranks, are significantly worse in most ways than the Normal game players as a whole. Mostly to do with Normal game players tend to have hundreds of games under their belt meanwhile a lot of Ranked players in low ranks are all relatively new or inexperienced. This is more or less the reason why I for the most part stick with Normal matches. But hey.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-23T06:29:40.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on how you see it.\nIf you personally consider it feeding and unsportsmanlike then report for such.\n\nAs for trying out a champion first time in ranked, that can be a grey area.\n\nI would do it myself at times, however I'm already highly familiar with every champion in the game, their capabilities and weaknesses etc.\nThen you also have champions that you just CLICK with. For me that's champs like Rek'Sai and Vi, my first time playing them was just an incredible fun experience and I naturally felt good with them.\nOften times if I \"first\" a champ, it's after weeks of looking at their kit, build paths and play styles, so when I get into playing the champ it's not like I've blindly picked them for shits and giggles.\n\n__________________________________\n\nOverwatch is quite a different game to League.\nFor one you aren't locked to a specific Hero for the match, especially since you're SUPPOSED to switch your character as the need arises.\nThis can at points mean you need to switch to a Hero you've no experience on in order to make a difference in the game.\n\nEven if you're inexperienced and it's your first time playing that Hero, it could very much mean the difference between a loss or win if you switch to them and at the least flail about to perform their role.","replies":[]}]}
