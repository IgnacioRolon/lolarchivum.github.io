I sewed most of it on the machine and used polar fleece as the main material.\r\n\r\nFor the cutting pattern, I looked at Thresh&#039;s in-game model and splash art features, then simplified the design down for a more &#039;cute&#039; or &#039;soft&#039; feel. I free handed the design from my head to A3 paper and set it onto the fabric for cutting. I turned each piece so that the fronts were facing each one another, machine sewed, and then turned them outside in. After this, I used fabric markers to freehand my details on, stuffed &#039;em and hand stitched them shut.  The bone links are joined by a length of silver ribbon that runs through their middles. \r\n\r\nThe plush lantern and sickle are both detachable from the main scarf, they affix with press studs. This is so I can throw the plush parts at my friends without having to unwrap the scarf, or so that I can just wear the bone links as a toasty winter warmer. \r\n\r\nIn the original design plan, all of the bone links were meant to be individually stuffed with hobby fill, however, this made the scarf too heavy and waaaay too warm to wear in the exhibition center for PAX. They were also meant to be individually detachable (also by press stud) so I could change the length at will. The problem with this design feature was that the plush lantern and sickle were too heavy once stuffed, and so some of the press studs couldn&#039;t support the weight. \r\n\r\nI did end up wearing it to all days of the convention, but regretted it. In hindsight, wearing a scarf in a stuffy expo-shed isn&#039;t the most comfortable experience. I have no idea how cosplayers can get around in some of the thick costumes they wear. \r\n\r\nHeads up, I got my scarf signed by Phreak, but gold Sharpie markers don&#039;t hold too well on black fleece. If you plan on having anything marked onto fleece, use a dark marker on a light part of the fabric. \r\n\r\nOverall, I&#039;m happy with the design and display the item hanging from the side of one of my living room bookshelves when it&#039;s not in use.\r\n\r\nHave a spooky harrowing {{champion:412}}","replies":[{"poster":"Elvelt6","date":"2015-10-29T09:46:02.252+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's amazing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-29T04:47:56.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice","replies":[]}]}
