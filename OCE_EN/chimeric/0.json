Queue for game, after game, after game, and maybe 1 in 10 I get to actually play. Here&#039;s how my League session goes:\n1. Queue for match\n2. Wait 1-4 mins for timer (usually takes 2 or 3 people not accepting before champ selection screen actually starts)\n3. Pre-select champion (team bickering usually starts here - note: LoL community is awful...so..so...awful)\n4. Ban champion\n* If you don&#039;t ban the way your team wants (even though they never said who to ban) they dodge (usually after many expletives)\n* If one of your team has their champ banned by the opposing team, they dodge\n\nResult: most of the time this game is just queuing and requeing because you rarely get to ever actually play.\n\nNew queue system is garbage. Going to play games you can actually play, rather than this boring, crappy match selection simulator that rarely offers actual gameplay.\n\nPlayed about 4hrs this session - 2 games. Absolute garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-24T10:46:07.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes thank god I'm not the only one experiencing this, the amount of dodges that are occurring now are insane. Penalties for dodging need to be harsher!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Chimeric","date":"2018-01-24T10:56:13.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I'd like to see them suffer rank penalties, personally. Either way, doesn't affect me - I've uninstalled. There's literally no point playing the game as it stands, it's a complete waste of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-24T12:36:40.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"play for fun instead of ranked play norms man the games good the players are trash","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-24T23:49:42.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don’t like it when people troll in champ select hence dodge, usually it’s to win I will dodge 3 or 4 times a day because I might get a crap team comp, enemy has too many broken champs, or straight up most of my team autofilled. -3 And -10 is much better than -20","replies":[]}]}
