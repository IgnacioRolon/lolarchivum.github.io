Don&#039;t get me wrong, playing the meta and doing well is fun because well...it&#039;s how they&#039;re played properly and it usually ends with succeeding. But I don&#039;t play this game competitively and I like playing champs differently to how they&#039;re usually played. For example; full AP Malphite. Probably one of my favourite builds in the game.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any strange builds that suit the champ a lot better than you&#039;d think?","replies":[{"poster":"Spidicus","date":"2015-04-09T22:56:38.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP Rek'Sai.
