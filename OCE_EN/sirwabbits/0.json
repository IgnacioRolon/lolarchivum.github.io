You are a joke!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"So for the past week literally not a single game has launched properly. Okay.. sure. People are complaining about it, no worries.\r\n\r\nBut today. I didnt launch and when i tried launching it, It opens up a brand new 'riot client.' Oh, sweet! I never heard about this. Thats cool.\r\n\r\nWell i think its a glitch, like i'm not meant to have it. It doesn't work at all and no where else online is talking about it being released yet.  I literally have to re download the whole game because this new client doesn't work. I have to get the old one again.\r\n\r\nAwwweeesome. Thanks game. And incase you wanted to know what the shitty client looks like, [here](https://imgur.com/a/8opgl3t)","replies":[{"poster":"PrincessSparkles","date":"2019-08-07T12:36:18.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"bean burrito #spaghetti pasta","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-16T09:18:56.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PrincessSparkles,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UA8cRB49,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-08-07T12:36:18.133+0000)\n>\n> bean burrito #spaghetti pasta\n\neh canned peaches in syrup with ice cubes in a bowl #springroll pastries with kumara and bean sprouts and a nice vinegar, garlic, and bit of soy sauce dip","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-08-08T00:20:53.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can get help for these issues if you [contact player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
