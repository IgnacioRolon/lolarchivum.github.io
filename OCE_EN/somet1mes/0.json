Which is the price of the border + icon. if you complete every quest every day and only complete quests for 1 side. \r\nSo, are they going to increase the tokens rewarded for later quests? or will you have to buy a pass thingy to obtain all three icons just for one side?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-17T14:14:44.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is enough to get 2 icons, or a boarder and icon for the people who bought the skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-17T09:54:40.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can buy just tokens on their own.\nI event checked the price.
