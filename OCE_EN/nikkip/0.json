That&#039;s fine, I&#039;m not the most diligent reader. So I&#039;ve been playing semi-regularly since the big changes and BE replacing IP, and I finally leveled up, and what I got was a capsule containing three champion shards. Now I did have a previous champion shard for Rakan, which I noticed was worth over a thousand Blue Essence when disenchanted, however I got shards for some older champions worth 90 Blue Essence. After about a week of playing the game I seemed to have earned an absolute pittance of several hundred Blue Essence. This seems incredulously low, so I am compelled to ask is disenchanting the champion shards we get from leveling up really the only steady source of Blue Essence we&#039;re suppose to be counting on?\r\n\r\nI understand that bonus rewards of Blue Essence are to come with level up milestones (I think), but do higher levels also require more Experience Points to reach? It took me a week to go from 30 to 31, if level up rewards are going to get farther and farther apart then some bonus allowance of Blue Essence when I reach 50 or such is bittersweet consolation.\r\n\r\nI am the kind of person that queues for &quot;fill&quot; in matches and tries to practice all roles, yet the new rune system only allows me to create 3 pages of my own, so if I am to create a minimum number of customized pages just to cover all 5 roles then I need to buy 2 more rune pages, yet when they cost 6300 Blue Essence each and I am earning several hundred Blue Essence in a week&#039;s time then **it could take me the greater part of a year to earn two pages alone**. It&#039;s worth noting that one rune page is the same price as one newer champion, so it&#039;s not like those pages are just really valuable in the scope of things. You could play for a whole year and have 4 new champions to show for it at the rate I&#039;ve observed, in a game with like 140 champions (and they add around 4 each year as well, I forget).\r\n\r\nWhat is going on with this, did the transition of IP to Blue Essence come with such a serious decline in a player&#039;s ability to earn things through playing the game? I&#039;ve spent hundreds of dollars on this game I can&#039;t keep spending real money on every new thing. The rate at which a player can earn Blue Essence seems widely unpredictable with such big differences in the value of champion shards, with some being worth less than ten times that of others. Am I missing something, or is this system just way way worse for the player?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m afraid I got a good laugh when I seen some of the essence emporium items, you can flush +50,000 of your Blue Essence down the toilet for special summoner icons and emotes. Just what the game needs and players want, more icons and emotes. I&#039;m not sure I could earn 50,000 Blue Essence in a whole year. Pulling out the calculator it seems if you only get the crap shards and level up once each week you would earn 14,040 BE in a year. That&#039;s obviously missing some factors like bonus rewards and assuming the worst possible luck, but still this is a crazy low earn rate.","replies":[]}
