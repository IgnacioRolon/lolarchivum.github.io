There is the option to ban &quot;None&quot;, if someone doesn&#039;t pick a champion to ban then it should just consider them to have banned None and move on to the next step. Having a ban or two missed isn&#039;t the end of the world, there&#039;s still going to be powerful and annoying champions left to pick regardless, and with all the reasons for lobbies to dodge this is one that could be done without. It would be mainly alt-tabbers and novice players that would be at risk of failing to pick a ban.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m on average going through 3-4 lobbies just to get into a game because of dodging. While many are I&#039;m sure intentional, and dodging on the ban phase is rare, I still like to see any steps towards removing unnecessary dodging. I am speaking of Non-ranked Draft pick, perhaps ranked should still be held to a higher standard.","replies":[]}
