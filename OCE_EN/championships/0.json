No you won't. Similarly, if you're triggered by a mere \"cao ni ma\", which is the Mandarin equivalent of the term, then you're probably just overreacting. Expecting the players who speak in the language you're not too familiar with to be absolute saints or else you'll report them or whatever is a bit extreme isn't it? That said, I'm all for universal chat filter, where it at least includes the general ****s in all languages supported by the league client, as currently it seems to only apply to English foul words which could definitely use some work.\n\nAlso, not speaking English is never a reason to report or ban, it's the refusal to communication that earns it, which has nothing to do with whatever language the person behind the monitor speaks. A person has to show that they are ignoring _most to all_ or even _actively_ sabotaging team communication (including pings) to be qualified as a case of refusing to communicate, otherwise the stance isn't really valid. And one shouldn't force the server's official language onto the playerbase either, as it just doesn't work that way.\n\nBut aye.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-04T18:05:21.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get your facts right mate!\n\ncao ni ma means fk your mum!\n\nthis should be INSTANT 14 DAY OR PERMA BAN!\n\nbut GUESS WHAT?

RIOT GIVES 0 F@#K$\n\nLiterally, yes it means \"fk your mum\", but contextually, it's no different from English's \"fk you\", hence why it's a \"Mandarin equivalent\". But even if we ignore context, I don't think it's instant 14 ban or perma ban on English servers considering it's not like it's really serious according to English-speaking countries' views (considering the prevalence of mummy insults and \"yo mama\" jokes); that's a bit of an overreacting claim tbh. Unless we're talking about South Korea/KR server though, where it's seen as a capital insult there, or so I heard anyway. At most, that level of insult around here gets a chat ban (or 1 level up from your current phase) if you spam it again and again and again or something like that really.\n\nThat said, again, Riot should update the profanity filter to cover insults from other languages and not just English, that would do it fine.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-05-07T02:49:39.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay first of all I am Asian, and secondly I've seen this same type of thread before.

There can be some individual Asian's who react in a humane way and resolves things in an orderly and calm method whilst others can act aggressively.\n\nDon't be sensitive over it - Even for me I don't understand most of the Chinese language (I was born in an country as English is the first language which I learned to took as my first language) as long as you don't understand then just block/mute or if you just can't then just ignore it. \n\nAnd to the other people who just are very sensitive about it - Oh..

That's what I get from NA threads anyway. So if that's anything to go by, I personally wouldn't call that \"so friendly\", but I won't know.\n\nStill really, there is no such thing as \"friendly\" when it comes to League servers as a whole, all of them, and by extension the massively popular online games in general too. It's kinda just a thing that competitive online genre tends to attract all sorts of misfits and trigger people's inner aggression for 1 reason or the other. So it's really not about whichever is more toxic or less, it's just more or less about what kind of poison you're cool with tbh.\n\nBut who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-05-05T08:32:21.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'd think EUW would be pretty passive considering the French surrendering all the damn time.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-05T08:38:21.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boom!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-05-09T15:16:13.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think they should be punished for not speaking English, but I think they're better off not typing and simply sticking to pings.

OR speak Chinese!\n\nBut what I found in China they have prizes for players who play and win certain points VIA the TGP login.  They have so many login processes when trying to play a game of LoL.\n\nOnce I had the Chinese military do spot checks at the cafe or \"Wangba\" where I was playing checking ID's\n\nI notice atleast 20 Chinese people got up and left when they were checking.\n\nJust keep in mind people that the game you are playing was helped and funded by the Chinese.
