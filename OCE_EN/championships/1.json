Your loss streak might be due to getting tilted or even just being a little unlucky.\n\nAs long as you keep playing well and not being a liability to your team, then you'll climb ranks. \n\nWe can't really tell if you're supposed to be in gold or not. [OP.GG](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Noltdip) says your estimate **MMR** is below average for your rank, but considering that you were Platinum 5 last season, I think you'll get higher.\n\nI hope this cleared things up a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-14T12:15:27.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"OP.GG means nothing, they are not officially Riot and therefore have no real say on what your MMR should be and whether it is higher or lower than normal, only what they THINK it should be and in comparison to everyone else on their own site.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-14T17:08:06.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rioters themselves link to OP.GG from time to time and even mention use of their MMR calculator.\n\nLikely because while it doesn't have the actual numbers use by Riot, it's calculations still are accurate to the form.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-19T14:07:03.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see why, they have their own calculations and should be showing us that information, what are they scared of?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-19T15:47:16.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most Rioters have no idea what the calcs are themselves.\nIt's only the people who actually work with the code that know it, and even then they don't see anyone's individual MMR.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Championships","date":"2016-04-14T08:38:04.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats the thing tho, this account was fresh made meaning i just got it to 30 like 2 weeks ago, so idk why it says i was plat 5 last season XD but cheers for the reply!
