In the first reply from they I get told to try the fixes on the \"recommended troubleshooting guide\" on the website, which I did already, \n\nbut the catch is, from the second reply I get told to attach DxDiag, game r3d logs, network analysis logs, but upon sending the information riot tells me to follow the FPS troubleshooting guide from the site again...\n\nWhich proves that their support staff is NOT REVIEWING what I wrote in the original ticket and not analysing the DXDIAG and game logs.\n\nHave anyone else also experienced this with riot?\n\nTL;DR- I get FPS problems, send riot a ticket, their reply system seems automated and generic and I feel they dont actually read the contents of my ticket before replying... Hence it isn't helping me get to a solution ","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-01T03:54:25.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep. They use robots :)\n\nI called them out on this and got this response: \"Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about that. The most likely solution to this problem is to reinstall League of Legends.\" Even though I had already done that, in fact that was how the ticket was started.\n\nSupport only ever tell you what you can find on the site itself. You're much better off reinstalling and then searching for the information yourself.\n\nOr... you know. Asking on the boards, though I'm not terribly experienced.\n\nAnyway, I'd like to help you with this. What's your rig?","replies":[]}]}
