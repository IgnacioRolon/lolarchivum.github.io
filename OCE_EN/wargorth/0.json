If i try, she combos all her attacks which are **long range** and **high damage**. \r\n\r\nAll i could do is:\r\n1) Watch and do nothing.\r\n2) Try to farm, while she combos everything and die every time. \r\n\r\nSomeone said i should not play Teemo mid lane.\r\nLet&#039;s say i played Teemo top and for some random reason LeBlanc shows up. \r\n\r\nIs their any way to counter? What conclusions can we draw?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-29T05:50:35.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wargorth,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=heTznAJA,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-10-29T05:37:33.312+0000)\n>\n> **long range**\n\nuhh... not really.\n\nAnd some matchups are just near impossible to win, Teemo into LB is one of them. If you end up laning against an lb, try to lane swap, or build a shittone of mr and a crap tonne of pots and just farm from as far back as u can","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-11-01T09:37:57.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O mate ik what to do. Play REAL SAFE until level 6\nUpon farming at 6, place shrooms close to you like under so when she tries to engage with the dash, she will get hit, and follow up with  Q and autos.\nIf she is already fed then ur fukt. I suggest you get {{item:3111}}  early on. Just for a bit of safety. Follow up with Lich bane to better combo her with Q and autos. If your re losing get {{item:3065}}  but ask for a lane switch too if you can. If not, get zhonyas next with follow up of Rabadons. Ur final build should be something like this:\n{{item:3111}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}}        {{item:3065}} OR{{item:3116}} \nHope this helps :) If you need more help on other stuff, i can help you. Like idk add me or something. Jokes u dont have to. Hope this helps","replies":[]}]}
