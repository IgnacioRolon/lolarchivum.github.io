We came to the point of stupidity and suggested &quot;Communist mode&quot; where all gold earned is split evenly among all members of your team. This could be extended to exp as well and could create a really fun mode with a meta of 2 or 3 &quot;power farmers&quot; and a few skirmishers in the mid lane/roaming. The fact that all players have the same amount of gold in a team means that everybody has equal power capabilities and nobody has to &quot;carry&quot; the team as such. The whole meta could be thrown on it&#039;s head for a week or however long the mode would last. I think it would be a super awesome mode to play with friends in the party mode rotation. \r\n\r\nTL:DR All gold is shared evenly among your team. Could be EXP too. Simple mode for the Party mode rotation\r\n\r\nAfterthought: TF would be super OP as a power farmer because he would gain extra gold for the whole team\r\n\r\n(Sorry for bad grammar or spelling, kinda tired while writing this, also it&#039;s my first time posting on the boards so not sure if I&#039;ve done everything right)","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-31T16:01:36.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean heroes of the storm? ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-31T11:18:24.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Castro can do the coding....\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
