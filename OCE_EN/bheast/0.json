I don&#039;t play too much nowadays, so there might be something I just haven&#039;t picked up on, but I feel as though if there was some reward system, not only for players that are honored, but players that honor other players. \r\nIn this day and age, unfortunately people don&#039;t seem to go out of their way for the benefit of others.\r\nAs someone who has been on OCE since day one, I do feel that it has significantly improved in terms of trolls, flamers, and just people you don&#039;t want in the community, so well done for that. But I feel like you could definitely do more on the other end to add something more for those that go the extra mile!","replies":[{"poster":"Tomphlosion","date":"2016-12-21T01:33:49.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it even working with the new client? I know my teamwork number has gone up for example, but I haven't seen any sort of notification after a game or anything? Can anyone confirm? Perhaps a rioter could comment of the future of the system?\nI love feeling so positive about a game that I want to honour someone, but it seems like a waste of time if the only way for them to notice is by closely tracking their numbers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-20T23:29:13.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree in the sense that there is a lot of punishment for bad behaviour and negativity.\nBut not really that much in terms of positive re-inforecenmt for upstanding players.\n\nI personally don't think people should be rewarded just for not being toxic _(thats kinda what you're expected to be like anyway)_\nBut it would be nice for those players who go above and beyond the call of duty, and who really help improve morale and behaviour in game. To be more appreciated. \n\nSome form of loading screen border maybe? something that is really earnt, and when you see it you go \"wow! that person is doing their best for this community!\"\n\nWhile the honour badges are nice, no one really knows what they mean. \nDoes \"honourable opponent\" mean that they were gracious in victory/defeat and fun to play with? Or does it mean that they played well and the game was won because of their skill?\n\nWhat does great mentor mean?\nHow do you get a leadership badge?\n\nBlue and Yellow badges are the only ones that really mean anything, red and green are just so common that it doesn't really distinguish you from everyone else as someone who has been positive. \n\ndont get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the honour system, but I do think it isn't quite performing as intended.","replies":[]}]}
