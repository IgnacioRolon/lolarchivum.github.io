I thought the issue might resolve itself by logging out and logging back in, to no avail. The issue has not been resolved with the 6.18 patch.\r\n\r\nPretty much the only reason I play LoL these days is to enjoy a game with friends, which is hard to do when I can't tell if anyone is online.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-11T03:52:52.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Mind Lord","date":"2016-09-11T08:21:57.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know. I sent in a support ticket with the same information as above, and apparently I'm now permanently banned and have to send in a support ticket about recovering my account.
