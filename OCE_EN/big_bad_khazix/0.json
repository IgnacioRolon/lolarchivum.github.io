Not just in the early hours of the morning and pre30 like usual, I mean 24/7, getting at least 2 bots in most game.\r\n\r\nRito plz respond.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-04T01:28:54.321+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhile I don't personally encounter bots _too_ frequently in my ARAM games, I agree with you that they are a problem and understand how frustrating it can be to be matched with one or more bot accounts.\n\nThe best thing for you to do is to report these players in the post-game lobby for \"Cheating\" and be as descriptive as possible in the report message about them botting.\n\nAccounts are banned in waves, similar to how Valves anti-cheat system bans accounts. This is to ensure that the people developing/using their tools are not aware of when or what was detected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aryiaicewolfe","date":"2017-02-07T10:33:31.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got back into league after about a 3 month break and I like to play aram... the last couple matches i have played have been nothing but bots. is there any specific way i should comment if reporting them.","replies":[]}]}
