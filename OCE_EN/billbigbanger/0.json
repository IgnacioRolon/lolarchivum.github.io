I've just reached honor level 3 on the account BillBigBanger and was wondering if it were possible for that to be enough to unban my old account with 100's of dollars worth of skins and all my champions masteries? The account is called Angry Lofty on the OCE servers. I'm curious to see this discussion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-26T01:16:41.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not aware of any such tests being run presently. There were some quite a few years ago that ended in basically universal relapse rates (i.e complete failure) so the idea was scrapped. The possibility also drastically reduced the deterrent factor of a permanent ban, so as far as I know, they went in other preventative-measure type directions instead.\n\nIf there is some sort of official testing going on (and not just people saying things to troll or drastically misinterpreting/misrepresenting information) then player support can probably shed some light on it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nSo the short answer to this is, to the very best of my knowledge this doesn't exist, and probably never will because the conditions you would have to put in place to make it effective are just too costly. A ban will only be removed if it was made in error.","replies":[]}]}
