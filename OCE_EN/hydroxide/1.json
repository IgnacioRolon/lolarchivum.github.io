High noon tf makes his q animation smaller. Underworld tf makes the cards hard to see, and tango tf makes his character model slightly smaller and he doesn&#039;t have a cape. Which one is the best?  {{champion:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-20T12:30:24.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like magnificent because its magnificent, but Underworld would be the strongest. Its cards are hard to see, and their hit box its 1.5x the actual animation and they move slightly slower than the actual damage, so it hits them when it looks like it shouldn't. His auto animations are also faster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XXXTENTACLEPORN","date":"2016-01-20T11:52:46.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Underworld.","replies":[]}]}
