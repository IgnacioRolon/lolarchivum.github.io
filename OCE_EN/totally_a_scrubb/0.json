You're really close to loosing your account and $700 forever :(\n\nFlaming your team is not ok, regardless of who started it. You really need to start muting players who are insulting you and report them after the game. Stop taking matters into your own hands and flaming them back, when you do this you become just as bad as them, and will get punished like them.\n\nFeel free to reply with anything you need help on.

Once the system believes you are demonstrating good behaviour it will start dropping you down tiers. Please note that the AVERAGE punished player takes about 3 months to drop their account back into good standing, however int his instance \"average\" refers to a player on a 10 game chat restriction. Since you are on a 14 day ban it will take you a lot longer to get back to good standing.\n\nI won't sugarcoat this, you are on very thin ice at the moment, and one significant slip up will cost you your account.\n\nI suggest you find other ways to vent your frustration, yell at your screen rather than typing or type into a notepad instead. Even if it takes valuable seconds out of your gameplay it's better than ruining the experience of your entire team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-22T00:47:36.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well apparently you didn't reform the first two times so...","replies":[{"poster":"Totally A Scrubb","date":"2016-12-22T00:50:45.371+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I DID NOTHING TILL THEY STARTED CCALLING ME BAD THEN I CALLED THEM BAD WHY DID ONLY ME GET SUSPENDED","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-12-22T02:12:31.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Totally A Scrubb,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=grf793Vk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-12-22T00:50:45.371+0000)\n>\n> I DID NOTHING TILL THEY STARTED CCALLING ME BAD THEN I CALLED THEM BAD WHY DID ONLY ME GET SUSPENDED\n\nYou getting suspended doesn't mean they didn't as well. There are a lot of factors that go into this though, such as you consistently being toxic, and any previous punishments you've experienced. Also, if premade players all report one person, their reports have less weight than a single player, so no, being reported once by a premade group will not get you punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-22T15:44:57.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best Advice i have seen for leage when solo cuing. - Mute all- Just concentrate on Play and pings.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-22T05:22:17.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 wrongs don't make 1 right.

But then again, 2 wrongs don't make 1 right, you were clearly doing it wrong when you start typing furiously at people and calling them names.
