that you were toxic, and as a result people reported you and you received a ban. I totally get that Riven was being an asshole too, but Riven being an asshole doesn't give you a free pass to use homophobic slurs and insult your team. There is no situation where it becomes acceptable to be toxic. \n\n\n >_Ok, so how do I deal with insta-lockers then?_\n> \n>  You initially handled it very well. You were the \"bigger person\" and went Top lane instead. It went downhill though when you began to flame people. If you thought this might happen, you really should've _/mute all_ and just focused on your play.\n> \n>  The other option is to dodge the game of course. A 6 minute penalty is far better than a 23 minute salty game that wastes everyone's time. \n> \n>  I'll give you some credit here though, Riot's current systems are terrible at dealing with insta-lockers. There's apparently systems in the [works right now](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/lo1oZ0Pm-champ-select-reporting?comment=000000010000), but what we have on live is pretty bad.
