You got away with it a lot in-lane but it's a risky move to Q-Q a Leona (for example).\n\n- Hold your Q as long as possible to optimise the CC-chaining (pun intended). Try not to re-activate it until the second 'tug' animation is complete. Unless of course you're trying to make rapid plays.\n\n- Your video was available in both 720p and 1080p; did something go wrong with the rendering? Try do a few test records & renders to remove the 'letterboxing' from your videos - it's much more appealing that way! (:\n\n- Try keep your videos between 2-5minutes in length (3mins optimum). It wasn't as interesting toward the end as the video felt like it dragged on for so long, but a nice effort nonetheless.\n\nYou're probably more experienced on Thresh by now (as per the above suggestions), but the insight is there if it's of any use. Good luck with your future videos! (: I appreciate the support, expect more to come soon!
