Just to name *some*: Olaf, Master Yi, Pantheon, etc. You might say \"just ward dragon.\" But the fact that junglers are able to solo such an important objective so early on is crazy. That boost to ability power/attack damage can mean life or death for a laner, or the other jungler. It can be really unfair for the other team.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-17T00:49:48.939+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah what everyone here has said, the amount of times I have just used my intuition gone down to dragon and caught a 20% health Yi/WW etc trying to solo then just kill them and take drag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-17T01:40:58.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, the buff isn't necessarily that game changing anyway.

You were told this apparently and yet come to the boards to get told again.

You have to ward it and keep it super safe. It isn't so much about just warding the dragon, but also placing some deep wards into the enemies jungle early so you can keep track of them. Sure, some champs can solo dragon at level 3 but it takes a while and in that time the enemy lanes could have harassed the allied laners out of lane and headed towards dragon to snipe the kill of drag and the jungler.","replies":[]}]}
