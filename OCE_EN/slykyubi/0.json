I think riot needs to take this stuff in account before being punished\r\nI just want to know why it was changed \r\nRiot i hope you see this and can answer my question","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-23T03:50:07.734+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The typical punishment tiers are:\n- 10 game chat restriction\n- 25 game chat restriction\n- 14 day ban\n- permanent ban\n\nThe tiers were chosen from years of data as the determined best points of reform. Past the first two, chat restrictions don't really have any effect (they used to do infinitely stacking chat restrictions), and for punishments after a 14 day reform rates drop to tiny numbers, hence why the tiers are what they are.\n\nAs for your punishment, it sounds like you were punished for feeding, which obviously skips the chat restriction tiers. To be frank, you have to be feeding pretty hard and pretty blatantly to get a ban first time, because the system is typically slower to punish such behaviour so it can be confident it's intentional.\n\nWhen you queue up for a game you are going in with the expectation that people will actually play the game. If you queue up for a normal game to practice a new champion or just to have a chill game with friends, the last thing you want is someone derailing that and trapping you in a game you can't play and can't enjoy.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-01-23T12:25:19.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so this year Riot is focusing on actual in-game behaviour instead of just verbal abuse and harassment?

I agree that the gameplay punishments are often lacking except in real blatant cases, so I can only hope we will see improvements this season.\n\nI disagree that they aren't allocating enough resources though. At a point there's only so many ideas and iterations of ideas, and hiring more people isn't going to make a difference. Skins are obviously the primary revenue, but having people ditch the game because of bad experiences doesn't exactly make them money, it's in their interest to police it as best they can, and Riot have pioneered a lot of this stuff.\n\nI couldn't say what the solution is, but just hiring more people isn't it.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-01-23T21:21:11.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a business end of things I'd have to disagree that hiring more people won't make a difference. If you have 5 people going back through reported replays of game then hire lets say another 5 (edited number 5) you'd go through them twice as fast. \n\nRiot are moving in the right direction (although i'm still salty on last years perm ban on one of my accounts and i've had a mate say kys (which ive never said to someone) and he doesnt get punished) I just think \n\n1) Riot should let people know when they're making changes to the ban/report system because people like me that use slang all day without limits then come to this game and have a ban randomly for using the slang i have used in this game for 3 years and have no ban. \n\n2) Riot should look into the trolls/inters a little more instead of looking more into word banning people. I.E - I've had someone know my mother is dead and try to use it against me in-game, i've reported that - got nothing. to then calling a mate a f#g and getting an instant 14 day suspension.... like really guys whats  going to effect a person more? \n\nNot saying that account didnt deserve a perm ban just saying a lot more people needed to go down with me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-24T04:21:55.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's important to note that whatever the language, if it isn't reported it isn't punished. I saw an example sometime ago of a truly atrocious log, but it didn't get reported so no punishment was issued (though unsurprisingly the guy was later banned). Point being if noone actually reported your friend he wouldn't have been punished whatever he said.\n\n1) In general, they do, though often not as widely as they could. I found the dev post with the new anti-bot methods basically by accident, and it was a really interesting read. If you don't actively follow those posts they're not well publicised. Some things are kept intentionally vague to prevent people abusing the system/finding ways around it.\n\n2) Why does it have to be instead of? The automated system does the bulk of the work, manual review just can't keep up with the sheer number of reports, which why they are *mostly* only used for appeals/ticket reports. The automated system is pretty good with chat, and lacking with gameplay, but tuning down the chat isn't going to make it better at picking up gameplay offences. \n\nI agree the gameplay side needs improvement, but I don't see it as an instead of type scenario. The current chat detection has no impact on the gameplay detection.\n\nIf you're talking about not seeing the notification, well you've heard us say it before, it's pretty broken so don't count on it. If you're just saying the guy kept playing, if he didn't say anything explicitly recognised as no tolerance language, it's possible he got a chat restriction instead. Support can escalate a punishment, but they usually won't if the automated system has already caught on so far as I can tell, presumably to do with it being a learning system.\n\nIt's hard to comment on cases like that without all the details, which we as players just don't have, so to be clear that's all just speculation. I know it's not a particularly satisfying answer, but I understand why they keep punishments largely private.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-01-24T09:32:16.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which I find funny, \nwhy isn't there just a bot in there that bans people for these words. i got perm banned for being reported for the same words.
