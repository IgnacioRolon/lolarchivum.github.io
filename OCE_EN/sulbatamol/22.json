This champion is literally garbage with shit passive. She is simply outclassed by all mid champs and supporter champs. IF u are a Egirl and wanna look pretty, get plastic surgery in real life . And dont tell me lux carried this game and that game. It is not becuz u guys won game becuz of lux, and if others champs there, game ended much quicker and effective manner.

Your kidding your self m8 I quite happen to enjoy lux kit and think it’s perfectly fine as it is. She can delete most champs with just 2 items and a full combo. As for meta picks who gives a shit what the meta is the meta is 2-3 champs most champs aren’t meta to begin with and mid lane lux has something like a 52% win rate which is just fine. As for landing phase on really shitty lux plays will hard shove the wave since she doesn’t have the mana for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-09T10:10:53.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well why people play rank when they are so tired in first place?

Most of the time good lux players are forced to use ult for pushing miniom waves as other champs are better at pushing minions waves and also to prevent champs like fizz to roam to other lanes. Please stop talking about lazy late games in norm because lux is definitely not one of the late game carries. While you try to cast your ult, you will b get killed by dmg dealers or bruisers in opponent teams.
