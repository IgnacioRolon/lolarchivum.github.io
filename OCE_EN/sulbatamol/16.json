I had to play a total of 550 ranked games, 500 games alone in gold 2~1 mmr to finally get myself out of terrible gold divisions. Finally, i feel like I reached the point where teammates are not too tetrible to play with. I put enormous effort and sweat into these games and I even let myself bled. [I rememeber I get nosebleeding after playing league for all night and it went on for next 1 hour. And I remember every time when I play ranked , i felt no different to those people sitting in fronta of pockey machine because im gambling my time in fronta computer to get myself a couple of good people to win a game. I find myself extremely unhealthy anf sick atm and I will play 3 hours only per day. Anyway gold players you suck and ty for all my suffering.

But i dont think there is much skill cap difference between high gold and low plat players. Only what matters i think is mmr. I was in above 1800 mmr and many gold players they do (which is like plat4 or above) , but weired enough system just dont let those people get out of gold division. And i do find plat 3 players with really low winrate with garnage mmr but system still keep them in plat division. This makes zero sense to me and they really need to fix this. Not saying I am high plat players who can easily stomped though gold divisions\n But one thing I am saying is some players are badly punished by ranked system atm and not granted to experience real league of legend [above 1900 mmr games]. I dont know but if someone is above average than the divisiond and wanna improve, they would have better chance by playing against high mmr players than playing with low mmr players. I didnt get to notice importance of above 8.5 cs\\min and many things because you didnt get punished by small mistakes in low mmt and even ppl say shit when you do right thing and it really prevents ppl from getting better and getting a hang of real competitive league of legend.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-25T01:51:18.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The same applies to MMR as it does to rank.

There was a single time I was autofilled into jungle and luckily have decent adcs to play with. I dont really like the way you saying people belong in certain rank in regards to winrates in certain division. I just proved it by myself by playing on weekend night. All you saying is im whinging here because I am not just good enough but it is not true. Oi listen to me you keep saying I have to beat higher mmr players consistently. But its not only me beating them. My teammates have to be good enough as well. I really dont understand people like you saying negative things for people who saying they lost game because of uneven match ups. I have seen so many players not only me but also enemy teammates and my allies were forced to lose and not even able to show true potential in game becauae of bottom being way too incompetent. I really dont think ranked system at the moment reflect genuine level of skill and knowlege of a player . I have seen so many pro players even have to be demoted to diam divisions and many players are being forced to play against players with a high skill cap in low division because system is so ineffective locating a player to where they truly belong. I might sound like a whinger nut it dosent mean i am necessarily wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-25T04:21:01.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?

Last night I played to my best and I barely missed out any farm and maximise gold earning and I also tried to help out other lanes while my opponent lanes just sit on top and farm and get solokilled by me and still took a free ride. It is not some game man. Really it is not some games, It feel so sad seeing my mmr and lp getting shredded for the sake of dumb system that had never gotten improved.

Ranked games are generally soul crushing and most of the times, people dont feel like they are rewarded after playing. Which makes some people to play more and getting tilted , and thereby creating a worse envt for other people to play as well.
