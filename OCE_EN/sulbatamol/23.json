They have no idea how to jungle efficiently and when it is good time to gank .                                          Seriously, I will not ask you to set up a kill for me or kill my opponent lanes. But please do watch mini map and think what an enemy jungle is doing at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n If you wanna farm all game why don&#039;t you play adc  or some shit. AND please give blue buff to mid laners. It&#039;s not my fault that your are so bad with managing mana. Mid laners are centres and aces of your team and you always have to show respect for them. Guess, Taliyah with blue buff, push lane so fast and roam to bot lane, getting a double kill. They make the best use of blue buffs.  You farming or taking for a walk in rift, doing nothing useful with a buff. SIGH...                                                                                                                   \r\n\r\nAlso ,please Please control objectives such as drakes and baron, even crabs on river. I have no fvcking idea you farming around bot side when baron is up . Sorry mate, but you the only one have smite in our team.                 \r\n Please, don&#039;t play jungle, if you can&#039;t achieve more than 80 in HSC or uni. I hate you all Vi players, and Kayn players who only build dmg and get one shoted. Jungles are for those who Think, not for those who Throw   {{champion:113}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:59}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-19T12:21:48.235+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"blue buff goes to whoever is most competent with a need for mana. \nThat might be toplane swain, midlane tailyah, or even support brand, \nwhoever gets the most benefit out of the mana and 10% cdr, gets the blue buff. Get over your midlane priviledge, you aren't the ace, this isn't some high elo game where the result is focused on midlane, in low elo the jungler is argueably the most important, and whilst they don't really need the mana, hence why you give the blue buff to those that do, I'd rather use it to keep up my pressure and mana, rather than gift it to a 0-5 tailyah who will inevitably give it to the syndra, who will inevitably use it to 1shot me 10% faster. \n\nSure if you're winning lane, going even, or are only slightly behind, it's yours, but if you lose lane, you shut up and build a RoA, some magic resist, and invest in wards to keep your midlaner from roaming.\n\nAlso in the elo bracket I assume you're referring too, the most frustrating thing is lack of assistance defending early invades, hence why it's often worth cheesing early kills with shaco, kayn, rengar, elise, nidalee ect... I once had a 6min mexican stand off between an elise and a shaco over blue side redbuff, because both of them weren't sure of the other's location, and both were spam pinging for assistance, before I, the toplane came down to help. In the end, they were both cripped and completely useless for the rest of the game, but both midlane and botlane could have gone in and cleaned up an easy kill, but nope, forced me to waste my time getting back to toplane.\n\nAlso cloud drake might not be worth it, and your jungler might just be leaving it up to prevent infernals from spawning whilst he's trying to get toplane a substantial lead. Or your jungler might be counterjungling bot since they intend to try to trade bot tower and drake for rift herald by waiting for the enemy jungle to hit rift or top, and then diving bot, which ends up being a decent trade if your team is in the lead, since rift is kind of weak if the enemy team doesn't have enough gold to start entering midgame grouping, and can be used to really hammer pressure if your midlane is able to help form a defensive wall which pressures the tier 2 luxury botlane tower, or if your toplane can roleswap, pressuring top tower very hard. Rift herald is horrible if used defensively since it's bad against minions, and if you can't group for it, or extend enough to push a lane in, the game can be over before it gets a chance to be used.\n\nThere is alot of macroplay involved in jungle, not much microplay, and a good jungler clears as if he was just passing to his next target (literally, they'll pull camps out to save walking time and won't ever circle back during a rotation), and is always on the move, rarely ever waiting or standing in the middle of nowhere, and should always be planning the next step, be it, invading for vision control, ganking, diving, preparing for an objective, counterganking, ect...","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2017-11-19T21:07:30.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wtf do you expect me to build RoA with Taliyah?
