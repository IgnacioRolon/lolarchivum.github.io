Are you kidding me?\n\nPlay something like Dota 2 then come back to tell me how snowbally LoL is. \n\nIf anything LoL NEEDS to be more snowbally otherwise the death of all early game champs is simply a matter of time as Riot is constantly shifting more power into late game.\n\nEDIT: And your \"Strong but requiring decent level of skill at the same time\" list is a joke, since everyone in the list is/was hilariously broken in one way or another, are you trolling?","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-20T12:19:00.958+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":3,"body":"well ur tier and KDA dont give u any right to tell me dat im trolling.

He counters Riven's early by design that's what we call counter picking. Cut him some slack, that's his ONLY use in the entire game atm.\n\nAll of the other \"broken champs\", I can only see Rengar sitting prob the closest to being actually broken in some aspects, maybe include Akali as she is too bipolar, the rest I say No, if we were to consider the entire community as a whole.\n\nAlso, if anything your \"broken champs\" are actually more balanced then the ones you think are \"balanced\", except Riven she cool and Maybe Zed atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-21T07:48:08.930+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"unfortunately. garen cannot counter riven if riven player has some experience. and i didnt list garen as broken because he can be deadly to certain champs whose player is not gosu with them as i stated there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
