I am a dude played pretty much all my games in high gold this season. I eventually got myself out and but I noticed why some people never get out of silver and gold even though they literally yearning for it. The very reason is that people rather play champions rather than learning a game. What I mean is that people never get to learn macro , but focus way too much on micro play. I really wish people play more of ezy champs with decent growth curves rather than playing micro intensive champs like vayne and yasuo. I am NOT saying you are bad at these champs. But it is hard to balance out both macro and micro aspects of the game for low elo players. I do believe macro always come first. Please learn ro cs above 8/min and learn to interact with team to get snowball rolling whenever its possible e.g. baron, tower, inhib. When you master basics thats when your climbing starts. Not saying you cant climb up being a master of champ. But it is harder way and what is point of locking yourself in plat div max when your understading and mechanics of a certain champ are above diam players. Please do not put yourself and teammates in burden by playing something when you are not confident to balance both or before learning basics of how to actually play a certain lane. Comments are welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-04-01T06:05:06.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played professional and competitive gaming since 1999.

Understand war itself before trying to one trick a champion in league.\n\nTo understand something at an advance level, you need to put effort into the begining of it. An amateur will think the basic is too easy, so he will skip the process. It not about people 1 trick or stuff like that.\n\nTruth of the matter is much simpler than you think. Just like IQ, your brain has a max capacity it can reach. Yet cant exceed.\n\nCurrently you can try to reach that thresh hold, but once you hit that limit, you're still at the bottom of the barrel compare to those that have a higher capacity. \n\nYou are telling people they can be way better if they learn all the stuff. But nope, brain dont just absore all informations just because you want it to. So the learning differences divide people in bronze to challenger.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-04-01T07:01:03.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's right, they \"you need to put effort into the begining of it\".

I know that people with IQ 84 under have troubles memorising or picking up basic partern. \n\nNot everyone care about this game the same way you do. For those people losing games in league is nothing to care for. You cant expect people to learn all that.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-04-01T07:43:51.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they don't care about the game, why do they play ranked? And yes IQ 84 can be diamond 5. If they are playing ranked currently, and have the capabilities to do so. \nAnyone can do anything really if they want to. I've seen challenger players with ONE ARM. In fact IWillDominate flamed this challenger player because they were in their game and messed up a Twisted Fate play. He flamed the guy hard on stream. He took those words right back when he learned that the guy had one arm.\n\nGo back to the TLDR and read it again.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-04-01T10:21:32.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that guy gets literally 2 kills in a stacked team and hardthinks he genuinely carried the game, that guys a joke","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-03-31T10:09:24.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Level 136, confirmed no-lifer.\n\nDude, go outside once in a while, the real life has amazing graphics, and over 5 billion players.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-04-01T06:39:19.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why the hate?

When you get to Diamond 2+ (NA platinum 1-2, adjusted for OCE), then learn complicated champions.\n\nIn this way you actually learn the essence of the game itself. No how some champion outplays another, or does some crazy micro combo, and then you team throw on the next play. Whats the point of trying to rank up by being a god of Lee Sin if you can't do a simple thing like watching the map?
