On the other hand I advise that if you want someone to try and help you here you provide a more thought out and less aggressive tone in your post.  \n\nIn response to your actual post I don't think Riot can do much about the Matchmaking System as it's basically fulfilling it's purpose as is. May I suggest that you either try finding a duo partner you can **trust** or take a break from ranked and try and recompose yourself. Whilst the latter may seem as a insult saying that it's probably you who is playing poorly. Trust me, I don't mean it that way. I'm simply saying that if you take a break from ranked when you are on a low end of the scale (TILT) then it's best to take a break from it. \n\nThis probably didn't help you much but I wish you the best.\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-20T12:49:33.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think he is just whingeing","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-20T04:52:15.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"carry harder.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-03-20T05:16:29.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something's gone wrong when people are expected to carry 4 other players in order to win in a \"team game\".","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-20T12:53:04.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol being asked to end it after taking out the only two towers for our team as zed, while everyone else gets thrashed.\nzed cant carry 4 people for fks sake.

I realise that might seem like an insult so let me just assure you, it most certainly is. More often than not when a person is complaining about \"bad team mates\" they're not much better themselves, they just don't realise it. I've experienced that myself and I'd say it's a pretty safe bet that everyone experiences that at some point. Before placing sole blame on the people you get matched with take a look at the way you play and see how you could improve. If, at that point, you're still finding no luck then there's not much that can be done since it would probably means you're where you belong, or at least close.\n\nThink of it this way: the people you get matched with in a match (both allies and enemies) come from the same pool and are pretty much the same in skill level. Given that there's a higher chance (11.11% more) for the enemy team to get \"bad\" players than your team, assuming you are more skilled than them. Fact is there's only one common factor between all your games, and that's you.","replies":[]}]}
