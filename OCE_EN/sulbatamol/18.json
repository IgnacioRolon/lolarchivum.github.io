I think top lane is the least rewarding  and the most useless position in league at the moment. Even tho this position demands players to master various champions and learn hell lot of matchups (I think more than 50 champs ate viable to be used in top lane depends on matchups), players dont get rewarded enough for their mastering the lane at current stage of league.                                                                                                            Firstly, the game itself depends too much on bot lane. It is really unenjoyable to play and feel so powerless when bot lane fails. Whoever stonmped bot lane going to give their team so much advantage in terms of gold and objectives. I tried to tp so many times sacrificing my lead , but it is really impossible to do anythin when our bot duo is worse than the enemies. I dont know why I have to watch bot lanr all the time and forced to save tp to prevent my bot duo from shitting on each other.                                                                     Secondly, it is way too depedent on junglers presence. It would be applicable to all other lanes. But no lane is affected to such an extent by one time presence of a jungler in lane. Many times you cannot farm (it is worse when you play melee champ), because enemy jungler is top and urs is wandering around rift not doing anything useful. Really cant do much and too ezy to lose your lead if your jungler dose not want to pay a visit.                                                 Thirdly, it is because supporters have been empowered , while carry or teamfight champions in top lane have been nerded way too much. Supporters can generate gold from items and they have much more impact in game in comparison to the past due to item such as ardent sensor and redemption. On the other hand, all the powerful champs in top lane such as maoki, jayce, gp had been nerfed to a sake of balance in  match ups. Even tp had been nerfed to a sake of balance of summnor spell. This gives less opportunity for top laners to show impact in mid game and early game , and thereby having a such minimal impact on game itself.                                                                                          Riot really needs to fix this because no other lane in league can take a free ride just by farming under tower for 25 min and doing nothing for the team. And no one is deserved to get punished so hard for having a bad bot duo even after winning a lane and took all the possible methods to help out teams while opponent did literally nothing. Fix this please.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T12:00:38.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with what you say, there needs to be more carry potential from solo laners. Its something that Scarra also mentions in his patch 8.6 rundown. I guess Riot have been heading in the right direction with the 8.4 patch, but you are right, supports are whingers that got Riot to turn them into a super empowering role. I wish they would just delete all support items and make it possible to buy green wards again.

TOP lane picks up a spell called teleport and it is the longest lane in summoners rift. I play karthus top and Yes, I sometimes die many times and fuck myself because my jungler is refused to pay a visit while enemy jungler camps there 24/7/. But you know, you can tp to lane and as a kathus I clear minions waves even after I died. \n\nThis means that it is not easy for them to take a tower unless jungler wants to spend an extra time in top lane and enemy top laners, by being absent from the lane, they are going to miss out a sum of CS and exp and they always have to pay more for roaming to other lanes (unless they manage minion wave perfectly and have TP on) than other laners.\n\nI dont thing KDA means a lot personally. It is not how many times you die, but how you died and what you did before you die.\n\nBut botlane, they lose a couple of times, games just change so drastically nowdays even in early game. \n\nYou can still stand a chance when your top lane feeds the hell, but when your bot lane feeds, It is GG and so unenjoyable and unpleasant to play on .","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-25T05:19:07.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the olaf literally just has to pop ghost and ult and we've got no chance.\n\nA feeding botlane can be resolved in part by a good assassin or a strong poke/burst mage, a fed toplane moving into the midgame allows a team to decide fights, through engage or flanking pressure, or splitpushing. \n\nIt's very important to have a relevant toplaner, and the main role of a fed toplaner is to provide top pressure and deny the enemy toplaner.

There is no such thing as mid game power spike as top laners unless you play something unusual which are high risk and high return champs like riven or karthus (which are risky picks and easily can be shut down by presence of enemy junglers and are going to be irrelevant during entire game if u die a couple of times during a laning phase).\n\nAre you really sure, assassins simply can shut down a fed adc?? Assassins are only relevant in game if they are stronger than adcs ( which means they have to be ahead in level and ahead in gold in comparison to adc ; thats why they go to mid most of the time and keep split to stay as a threat). Something like zed or talon are going to be easily shut down by a peel from only a support while fed adcs doing a ridiculous amount of dmg. \n\nOk . Bot lanes dies tower gone and dragon gone. What is going to happen next ?? Do they going to stay in bot lane? NOPE. They will head to top and now they are going to deny enemy top laner from farming and take tower. And the losing team is going to suffer more as exp advantage and gold goes to enemy adc and it is harder to manage minion waves as they took down towers while you didnt. This means whenever you get into the fight, you are going to lose all the farm, gold plus enemy minions pushing towers while you engage in the fight which you guys are less likely to win. Because enemy adcs have like a core advantage in comparison to your adc while enemy supports can give their team more utilities from items.\n\n TOP lane 30 cs  advantage is really ezy to be dissipated . I am not sure you play top many times or not. But this is a  lane which can punish enemy laners the most by freezing near the tower because most of the champs are melees. Even though you are winning a lane, you cannot get close to the enemy tower and shove minion waves to enemy tower, if your jungler is not going to pay a visit. \n\nYou are right in the sense that synergy between jg and mid are very important . I in fact played mid many many times as ryze last season. But honestly,  who gets snowball rolling? its bot lane duos. Jungle is in fact very important but it is more like they only create an environment.  Jungle and mid and top with tp can do only as much helping incompetent bot duos.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mı Ke","date":"2018-03-24T16:52:14.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but I really disagree\nIf you watch a lot of LCK games, especially Kingzone Dragon, their top laner is Khan, pay attention closely to his playstyle and the way hes splitpushing and teamfighting.\nYou are correct.

And you just proved my point by saying it. I had witnesses people in other lanes get drastically improved in terms of game knowledge and skill by moving up divisions. But TOP laners, meh. You play in >1900 MMR games , and they lock into nasus. Not saying Nasus is a bad pick but there is no reason to play this champion necessarily when there are way too many champions who can do things more meaningful and influential in mid game for top team. And I wondered why they picked into something like nasus? Well, I guess one of the biggest reason is they are not forced to evolve and they are somehow able to keep their rank or even climb up if they are lucky by not adapting or take a next step to their play style.\n\nSplitpush , Smart TP , meh. It is never a smart thing if you dont get a decent team to synergize with.
