It's not like they can just throw a switch and it goes out to pretty much EVERY SINGLE PLAYER  instantaneously, it doesn't work that way. It can actually take up to a few days before some people get it. 16:59 AEST is the time they set it in motion, not necessarily the time you would receive it.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2015-07-02T08:25:37.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"well, then why some ppl already received it and some ppl like me still waiting for it.\n\nThey clearly stated that they gonna give to us around 5 pm, but they didnt talk bout it would take longer for some ppl.\n\nAND plz dont act like ur working for rito . it makes me laugh a lot when some random guy like u acts like knows everything about rito system","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2015-07-02T08:55:58.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude,they are just trying to help lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scatman John","date":"2015-07-02T11:15:36.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sulbatamol,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Uz2Lfygs,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-07-02T08:25:37.437+0000)\n \n> AND plz dont act like ur working for rito . it makes me laugh a lot when some random guy like u acts like knows everything about rito system\n\nLol @ this, not all of the player base acts like children who cannot understand regular type-talk.
