I started first game of s8 with a  lux support who literally brought nothing positive in our team and made sure our adc lost lane. Maybe the person like other lux zealots way top deluded thinking her kits are perpect to be used as support,  ignoring her performance as support or even  in mid lane. She is in fact a poor champion and you cannot better out of her by getting more skilled. Even ahri I think she definitely has problem brining enough ap dmg for the team [considering how ahri mains use flash, summ spell, and even hextech items between skillshots  to somehow make dmg just enough to burst down adc]. If you guys saying me a jerk who simply stating  a fact that  she is in fact a poor performing champion which is backed up by reasonable amount of arguments, i think you are acting way too ignorant. I cant remember a single game of league without someone saying a single f word during a game. Then you guys simply admitted your community is a full of jerks. She is in fact a shit champion and her kits are way too dumb simple that you cant make much out of her vs decent players. If ppl try to make ez way out of ranked by being lazy and picking a certain champion due to a look only,  totally ignoring what is really expected from a mid laner,  those people definitely have attitude problems. I believe you are obligated to give your best shot in every single game, especially as a mid laner for your team and she is not definitely not the one in most of the match ups.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2018-03-10T22:38:08.643+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bascially a few of your comments were deleted because:\n\n* You used homophobic language, something that has no place in our community\n* You were attacking other members, mocking them and calling them braindead and stupid. This kind of thing doesn't really contribute to a positive discussion and falls under our \"dont be a jerk\" rule. \n\nYou are fully welcome to have your opinions about lux and express them on the boards (even if its about how you think she's a shitty champ), but as soon as you start calling other members braindead for not agreeing with you or bringing up other points, we are gonna have a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-11T11:14:36.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Ok. I am not entirely sure which game you are playing and what community you are speaking of. But i am pretty sure league is not the one playing where ppl send you death threats and still manage to keep their account in this server. How it is even a blatant insult for calling ppl stupid when it is backed up by reasonable amount of arguments???????????? Idk do you live in Kyoto currently? Thought its forum lol oce not lol Japan. Maybe I got into wrong forum for wrong server. Sorry dude.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T13:08:54.987+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"As was quoted in your ban notification (top right, same place as replies) where you were also told what was deleted and for what reason, if you want to use hate speech here, go nuts, but it's gonna be deleted and your boards account will be suspended.
