My average kDa in season 6 is around 4.0 and I&#039;m the one usually dose the most dmg. Unfortunately no matter what I do it&#039;s impossible to carry noobs who I think must be placed in lower league. Any advice for finding out decent dudes to play with?","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-06-27T23:48:58.873+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your mindset really isn't in the best state. Stats like K/D/A and Damage dealt may be good indicators of your ability to perform mechanically in a game, but we all know that it is possible to get fed in games and then throw it by not knowing how to end a game right. You can't just keep blaming teams for losses, as you effectively are just shifting blame to them when there will be HUNDREDS of things within a game that you could change to improve yourself. The fact that Elo Boosting and Pro Smurf/Climb streams are even a thing proves the Elo Hell theory wrong, as these players can have win rates of 90% and higher, regardless of their team. If you look to improve your faults in a similar fashion you'll see yourself winning more games too!\n\nThere are a ton of ways to find people through Facebook Groups, University Groups and even on the Boards. Just make a post talking about what your goals are, how often you play, what you're looking for in a duo partner etc in order to find people with similar interests to play with. The even easier option is add people from your games played!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninah","date":"2016-06-29T03:43:49.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not to bust ur balls but ur mmr isnt close to 1600.. im S3 and we have pretty much the same mmr.. so maybe the system is actually placing u with ppl Around ur elo ..

And why? I was Silver last season after about 20 games and gold in previous seasons, this season I am lucky to still be Silver 5 after ~150 games. I sit in the same boat you are in, in most games I get a decent KDA and the best overall stats in the game, but yet lose more than I win.\n\nI contribute this to Riot and their queue change they made, basically forcing us to join premade teams. They offer rewards, everyone gets on board and if you don't you fall behind. I have never seen so many premade players in my games this season as I did in the past, and what happens when you premade? You tend to stick by your friends more than anyone, refuse to listen to those not on your team and this just makes the whole team play a thing of the past.\n\nIt is no longer 5v5, it is more like 3+2 v 4+1 and therefore the 3+2 will lose since the 2 players will not help the 3 and the 4 will just run rampant and win. I had a game some time ago as Nasus top lane, towards the end I was 9/1, the rest of the map was lucky to have 2 kills, most of them more deaths than kills. I took the most damage, dealt the most damage, got the most turrets and pretty much everything, but not once did I leave top lane. Since the rest of my team was premade, they refused to help me, not like I needed it, but it helps my point. I was solo top and no one on my team came to help, period, not even when it was early game.\n\nThey roamed into each others lanes and helped each other, but I got stuck alone top and ended up going 1v4 at times. My team simply focused on themselves, ignored me and if I played any worse than I did, we would have probably lost due to them not helping. Now think if there were no premades, or less premades just because of the rewards, they would have joined me and made the game go 10-15 minutes less.\n\nIt is just how it is now, you play however you want and if your team is premade, or more premade than you, they will most of the time not help you, even if you are winning your lane, getting the most kills, damage and so on. They will go help their premade friends and not take advantage of how well you are playing and in the end, try and keep their friends in the game and lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-27T18:47:14.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am truely sorry for this but for some reason i need to type it for old times sake.\n\nGit gud.\n\nOn a serious note Rocka seems cool hook up with him.
