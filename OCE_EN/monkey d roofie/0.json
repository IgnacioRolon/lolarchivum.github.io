Ive also noticed that I cannot left click on the map any more, its been almost a year since I last played league and let my friend use my account while I wasn&#039;t playing, is there some settings that they&#039;ve changed that I&#039;ve missed or is my league bugged?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-24T02:08:14.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSeras already answered your quickcast problem below.\n\nFor the minimap issue, try hitting **ALT+M** in game and let me know if it helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-24T01:20:56.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you can turn quickcast on by clicking the little lightning bolts under abilities/items in the esc menu (under hotkeys). Is that the problem there? \n\nAs for not being able to click on the map, I'm not sure about that one. I'm not aware of any setting that would turn that off but I'll have a look for you.","replies":[]}]}
