I&#039;m not asking for specific details, because that&#039;s pretty obvious why you couldn&#039;t tell me; just some vague ideas on what we could see in the future.\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-11-28T22:47:17.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They were mentioning it a while ago, but with new preseason changes and the rollout of the [_new champ select_](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html) and [loot system](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/champion-mastery.html), it will probably be a while.\n\nIm pretty sure the loot system ties into your question as rewards are given based on mastering a champ and your end of game grades.

SO you can probably expect it once they get all the s6 balance changes as ironed out as they're gonna get.","replies":[]}]}]}
