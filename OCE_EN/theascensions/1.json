The drop rate also lowers each time you receive a key fragment, though it resets at the end of each month.\n\n>Key drop rates are **NOT linear** and only wins have a chance of dropping a key. So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. The goal is to create a nice ebb and flow.\n\n>**Grade** does NOT impact key drop chance.\n\n>**Premades** DO increase drop chance.\n\n>**Chests earned** has no impact on key drop chance.\n\n>[_**Source**_](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/rJ4rQmHA-after-getting-4-chests-key-fragments-no-longer-seem-to-drop-for-a-lot-of-people?comment=0006)\n\nOf course with an system like this based on chance, there's going to be those few people who get pretty unlucky, and it sounds like you might be one of them. Statisticallt speaking though, over the course of many games, you will get just as many keys as anyone else. My advice is to not to see the key frags/chests as a thing you should be getting regularly/need to be worked towards, but rather just as a little bonus reward when you do get them.\n\nI'd also like to dispel your perception that League is becoming pay to win. Nothing in hextech crafting has any impact on gameplay, it is purely cosmetic. The closest League gets to pay to win is in the form of IP boosts, and even they are unnecessary, and therefore more of a \"pay to win faster\" kind of deal. Trying to say that being able to buy keys (which you get by playing anyway) makes League pay to win is a flimsy argument at best.","replies":[]}]}
