HOWEVER you can get demoted if your MMR becomes that of the 5th division of the tier below yours. So in order to drop from S5 to B1 you have to have B5 MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"PursueYourDreams","date":"2015-03-15T14:51:51.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR?

Its a hidden number that basically decides who you get matched up with. The more you win, the higher your number, the more you lose, the lower your number.\n\nYou can tell if you have good MMR or not by how much LP you gain for wins and how much you lose for losses. If you are gaining more LP for a win then you lose for a loss than you have good MMR and will probably climb to higher rank fast.\nIf its roughly the same you have average MMR and are in the league where you belong.\nif you lose more than you gain you have bad MMR and you will probably drop divisions soon.","replies":[{"poster":"PursueYourDreams","date":"2015-03-16T00:40:56.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see thanks heaps for this, really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-15T14:39:23.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Scared the boost you got from Bronze to silver will be for nothing? smh.","replies":[{"poster":"PursueYourDreams","date":"2015-03-15T14:52:19.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boost?
