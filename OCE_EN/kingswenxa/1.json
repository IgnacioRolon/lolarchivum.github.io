But the ways I know that exist at the moment in regards to knowing what skins you own are as follows:\n\n* Going into your own profile | champion tab | click on the champion you want to check what skins for a scroll through (this method doesn't always work as I've noticed a bug occasionally where it says unowned, not purchasable etc.)\n* Go into the shop tab | purchase history (this isn't the best way as it only displays purchases within the last 90 days)\n* Go into the shop tab | sub section skins | un-tick the box \"Not Owned\" and it should show all the skins available for the champions that you own. Skins you own will show up with a green overlay saying \"OWNED\". \n\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"kingswenxa","date":"2015-02-18T05:25:21.312+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi thank you, i was just curious that how many skins i own, and i counted manually in shop tab lol. i wish riot can make some improvements on the skin stats, after all skin sale is a big part of their income, and if they make it more convenient to manage skins, wouldnt that attract more people to buy skins?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Se7eN Peace","date":"2015-02-17T15:19:16.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u can go and check the purchases tab in shop...\nthat wud help a bit...","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-17T14:51:24.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope. people been asking for something similar to that for a while. not going to happen any time soon i dont think.\n\nWould be cool to have a gallery or something. hell remove the item sets tab and replace it with, skins owned.","replies":[]}]}
