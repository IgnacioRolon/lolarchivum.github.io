Well I&#039;ve been demoted several times now. I placed into bronze, reached silver, then got demoted back. Regardless of how well I do the lp did not go back to the way it was when i was reaching silver. Who is correct in all this? I did believe once in silver you remained in silver for that season. Anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T06:17:02.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's no immunity in ranked, I believe, with the following exceptions:\n\n* Gold rank and under do not suffer from LP decay\n* If you were recently promoted into a new division/league, you'll be immune to being demoted again for a few games\n\nAlso note that if you don't complete your promotion series within 28 days then you are kicked out of your promotion series. This doesn't apply if you're in Bronze, though.\n\nWhere did you hear otherwise?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Super Euro Flash","date":"2015-04-25T08:05:57.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, you can go back down. If you LP gained per match is low, it's because your recent performance has been mediocre.","replies":[]}]}
