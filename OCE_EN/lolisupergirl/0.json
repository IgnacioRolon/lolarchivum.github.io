Why is anyone given a wall jump with no cool down and more range than flash?! Oh i got caught out? NO I DIDN'T I GET INFINITE GET OUT OF MISTAKE FREE CARDS. Flash is op enough either remove or nerf this into the ground. Like one time at the same cooldown as flash.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-23T02:27:38.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I think the wall jump is okay.\nBecause of its unique drawbacks it really separates the good Talons from the great ones.\nHe can't use the same piece of wall twice _(at least not for a meaningful length of time)_, and you also really have to know its interactions with all wall types _(its so easy to try to jump an odd shaped wall, and instead just kind of slide across it and land on the same side as you were on.)_\n\nUnlike several other assassins (who shall remain nameless), Talon truly embodies the 'assassin' playstyle.  If he wants to hurt you properly, he actually has to go ham putting himself at risk, not just sit back chucking shadow shurikens until such a time that a kill can be secured risk-free at his leisure.\n\nSo I think it's fair enough that he can have an interesting escape mechanic.\n\nRemember, he has to use it sparingly, if he uses it too much in one area, he blocks himself from using it in that area for quite a long time.  It's not like he can jump willy-nilly all over the place without consequence.\n\nMy advice would be to take a mental note of what walls he has used recently, and when.\nHe will max it last, which means each piece of wall will have a 160 second cool down _(almost 3 minutes)_, for most of the game, certainly for laning phase at least.  If you know he's used a piece of wall, stick near that wall, he's less likely to engage on you if he knows theres no easy way out.\n\nAnother good move is to keep your jungle warded in the later stages of the game, that way he won't fly over walls and surprise you.  Also sweep your jungle for wards to deny him vison over walls.  He isn't just going to jump a wall just to see what's on the other side.\n\nHis jump's speed scales off his own movement speed.  Slapping him with a slow before he jumps will make him an easier and predictable target as he slowly goes over the wall.  He is by no means invulnerable while jumping.\n\n_____________\n\nAs always, the best advice I can give, is to play him, get inside the mindset of a Talon player, learn what situations frighten them, what situations they look for to engage.  When he feels weak, and when he feels strong.  Then use that when you play against him.","replies":[]}]}
