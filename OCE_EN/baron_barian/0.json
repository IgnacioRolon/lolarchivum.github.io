But sure enough, there was another she had her eye on. One who quickly made a name for himself in the league of legends.\r\n\r\nAfter a particular bad day, the runt left Bandle City, hoping to prove he deserves his girl, but even with his brains and his skills with a hammer, he had nothing to his name to prove his worth. Fortunately, just as was leaving the gates to his home, another one opened as a strange beast emerged from of the river. \r\n\r\nEven after sitting and talking with the beast for an hour, the yordle noticed how water from the river continued to pour out of his mouth whenever they looked at each other face-to-face, but even so, its wise words and soothing voice allowed to yordle to trust his new friend. \r\n\r\n&quot;I am a traveller myself.&quot; the beast said to the yordle. &quot;And I can take you to where you truly need to go to reach your full potential. Somewhere that your skills will equal power. Power that you&#039;ve always had. In return, I ask that you save me a seat in that bar where you hang with your lady friend, for I crave your honey mead, as well as meal of a high quality. One that only&nbsp;your kind can serve.&quot;\r\n\r\nA fair deal, the yordle thought. His love of his life in exchange for dinner on his gold? Why of course, that was a deal he was willing to take.ï»¿","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-10-05T11:44:13.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm?","replies":[]}]}
