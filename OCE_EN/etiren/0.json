After getting the mystery skin it ended being a skin for a champ that already has a skin and technically was the skin I spent the most rp on. It is annoying for this to happen but truly I am still grateful for the gift however I know I will never use this skin ever. I would rather repack this skin as a mystery gift and give it away to someone then to keep it and never use it. Has something similar happened to anyone else?\nPlease no hate comments\nEdit: Forgot to add that I got Atlantean Fizz having already owned Tundra (don't start another one of those Atlantean v Tundra fights again)","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-01-10T17:40:39.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got Professor Ryze.\n\nI hate Ryze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-01-10T08:36:23.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So which skin/champion was it?","replies":[]}]}
