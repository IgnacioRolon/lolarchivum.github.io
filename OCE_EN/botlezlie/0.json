Poor choice in changing her, she was better before and easier to play, I&#039;m not saying the skill based thing is an issue, but the dagger thing is a joke and is way to hard to understand. I&#039;m begging you to change Katarina back. I&#039;m so ready to just quit league as a whole, community is revolting, do not create a champ just to try and change everything about it, thats what making new champs is about. I&#039;m deeply unable to cope with the poor decision, and you cannot jump to wards with your e anymore, absolute bomb of a champ update. Terrible, I&#039;m so furious and I&#039;m holding back my anger towards this.

Therefore it can make sense to only remove it on Kat and not him.\n\nFor Kat, you can E to your daggers instead of wards. If you want to go in and come back out, maybe drop a dagger with your W before you dive in so you can jump back to it. Of course, if you're in lane you can just jump back to allied minions. Keep in mind the huge CD reduction you get on E when you pick up a dagger.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SlothChan","date":"2016-11-09T06:20:19.765+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Fuck off she actually takes skill now and isn't just a face role","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-09T09:49:21.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlothChan,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=E3jJxxmI,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-09T06:20:19.765+0000)\n>\n> Fuck off she actually takes skill now and isn&#x27;t just a face role\n\n^^^\nThis\n\nNow players actually have a chance to react and fight katarina, rather than her just getting a couple of kills early and snowballing to the point were she deletes your entire team in less than a second","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-10T01:10:29.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Le xd, quit league then, no one cares lol, better to have less whinging players like you.
