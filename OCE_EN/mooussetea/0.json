Just went through a champ select with one toxic player going on about how another is a noob jinx player, only to see the guy being abused in the first place pick lee sin jg after ive already picked jg just to spite the toxic player and make him lose his series. i personally think both players deserve some kind of punishment, Instead of me losing lp for dodging a game and those guys getting away scott free","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-06T05:27:53.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MoousseTea,\n\nSorry you had to go through that experience man. We've been working on a few things to try and solve champion select trolls;\n\nTeam Builder Draft - http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/132349298626 (not out yet but we are working on it)\n> We're hoping that the new Champion Select experience (some players call the feature Team Builder Draft) will resolve a lot of issues with the current Champion Select.\n> The new player experience is something like this:\n> 1) Players invite their friends.\n> 2) Each player selects 2 positions (Top/Mid, or Mid/Fill for example).\n> 3) They queue up for matchmaking.\n> 4) We then send them into Champ Select by filling their team with the missing positions.\n> 5) They proceed to Bans/Picks (we've added a few new features to this experience, but will talk more about them later).\n> 6) They proceed to load into the game.\n\nIn combination with our current instant feedback + Player Behaviour systems\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-10-07T08:37:44.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm, this looks interesting!
