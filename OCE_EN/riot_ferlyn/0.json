With my first encounter with league: I&#039;ve been playing Dota for 2years and my mates started talking about this new game in beta (league of legends), we played and I&#039;ve never looked back since.\r\n\r\nI spent the last 6years in Japan doing mostly Anime related work (big big anime fan here), hosting shows/radio shows with Anime voice actors, producers and Anime singers in and around Japan and Asia completely geeking out when i get to work with the artists like T.M Revolution (gundam), MayN (Macross), LiSA (Sword Art Online) and so many more.  \r\n\r\nWith eSports, i&#039;ve been watching league since the Season 1 Championship with Fnatic vs aAa back in 2011 and never stopped since, it really does help increase one&#039;s knowledge and understanding of the revolution of esports and League. \r\nI started actively working in esports back in 2013 when i got to know a couple of eSports folks in Japan. I helped with player management in Japan with players and teams as well doubled as a shoutcaster in english, japanese and mandarin chinese which was super cool to head over to Shanghai every now and then to cast in mandarin with some awesome Chinese casters!\r\nI&#039;ve also been very lucky to have traveled to massive events like All-stars and Worlds to cover stories for Japanese media which was mind-blowing and solidified how awesome esports is and this is 100% where i want to be!\r\n\r\nOutside of Esports, gaming and anime, I am a die-hard Manchester United fan! Glory Glory Man United! English premier league, champions league are my other big passions along with F1! \r\n\r\nI think i have ranted on long enough about who i am,\r\nFeel free to ask my anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Benji","date":"2015-09-30T03:24:34.088+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favorite Rioter? :3","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ferlyn","date":"2015-09-30T03:41:46.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are! :D","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2015-09-30T03:44:03.237+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know if I should be surprised or cut {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-30T10:50:02.783+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/aoz8kgx8pzknypz7z38n.jpg\n\n-#been waiting to use this again.-","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-10-01T04:59:27.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahahaha I read the post where you used this","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-01T06:53:13.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What when someone said \"cant tell if you're stupid or just a bad player\" and I said why not both?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PokapokaCHU","date":"2015-10-07T09:02:31.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2015-10-08T00:33:35.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have a favourite, but I do have a top 5 ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-10-12T01:27:01.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"top 5.....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-09-30T03:33:06.770+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riot Benji,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Wrw4JTY7,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-30T03:24:34.088+0000)\n>\n> Who is your favorite Rioter? :3\n\nYou're a C9 fanboy, so it's not you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-10-01T04:27:50.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every....Single...Time...
