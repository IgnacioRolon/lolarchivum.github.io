I started playing League a few years ago, but I ended up leaving the game because I was flamed too often for &quot;sucking&quot; or &quot;feeding.&quot; I&#039;ve been back for not even a month, and I&#039;ve experienced this tenfold. I already want to quit again, and I hate it because I absolutely enjoy the gameplay. I&#039;ve been told to kill myself, commit suicide, uninstall League, never play said champ again, and endless colorful insults that I wish to not think about. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had two or three games so far this past month (one of which happened today) where the abuse was so bad to the point where I actually cried. I was trying out Syndra today in a non-ranked game, and I was laning against someone who clearly REALLY knew how to play Yasuo (quite aggressively at that). Ended up dying a few times and then was focused by the enemy jungler and mid laner because I was so far behind. I made it clear as day that I was learning the champ. I also explained that I&#039;d practiced the champ in bot games, read guides, and wanted to try her out in PVP. But this didn&#039;t stop people from acting like complete jerks. I was bashed so often and so early to the point where I was considering leaving the game, because at that point, I would have rather been reported and banned for leaving the game than be bullied anymore. I didn&#039;t discover the mute button until after that game, but that&#039;s beside the point. \r\n\r\nI do everything I know to do deal with toxicity &mdash; report, (now) mute, not adding fuel to the fire, taking breaks, finding other games, or all of those. I don&#039;t know how exactly how many players I&#039;ve reported for bad behavior &mdash; maybe ~50 so far. Only 2 have been banned. \r\n\r\nI am aggravated. And sick of this. I don&#039;t know how else to deal with it, other than what I&#039;m doing now.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-08-01T23:13:54.752+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe try not feeding : ^)....Na joking, from the description i'm hearing i can tell you are either unranked or in bronze, from a gold prospective i know what it feels like to get abused by bronze players, and i can see why you are frustrated with riots banning system cause it is actually pretty stupid tbh. Even i dislike it. Half the time you just have to explain to them whats going on and you should also focus more on improving, Syndra counters Yasuo, sure you may be new, the more reason you should have played passively and waited for your jungler to come. At this point you have no excuse for doing bad and the jungler has no excuse for flaming you either. Never rush your jungler to gank, for the record the jg does not have to help you in anyway shape or form, they can leave your lane and never come to help you if he wants to and believe it or not, is doing nothing wrong, this is what you need to know. Warn them before hand and if they flame you just tell them you had warned them and politely ask for a gank, if the jg is an asshole and says no even though Yasuo has no SS and is farming under your second turret than there is nothing he can blame you for.

I am a bronze 5 support main but I still like to be as nice as possible. If he/she saw you were having trouble he/she should have offered 'emotional' support, advice on combos and roamed mid inbetween botlane backs. Support is not just about warding and peeling. You also have 'support' the morale of the team and leave no man(or woman) behind.\n\nEven then there is no reason to be toxic to someone especially in normals if they are trying their best and are friendly. If you are getting dived alot though as a midlane immobile mage it's excusable to rush a tank/cdr item like zhonias or RoA+frozen heart since this will stop the dives if you back when below 30% hp and gives you a bit more time to do damage, it's especially useful due to syndra's high damage output and cc so you can still do alright with a tank item in your kit since you aren't pure damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T00:50:07.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"on another note if you just want to play normals try building a friends list of players around your level who are friendly and queue with them.

Thing that helped me a lot was /mute all as soon as I got into the game and I cannot believe how much this helped. Eventually I stopped doing this and whenever I had someone in my game that made me want to type something in chat that wasn't game related I just mute them immediately. \n\nIt also helped me to look at the game differently by not playing to win but to play to have fun. There is definitely a fine line with this and you should still remember the basics of building properly and not making stupid decisions. You still play to win but you have to remember the fun aspects first. When I did this I started to win more and have a good time. \n\nNumber one thing I would do is to focus on mastering one thing at a time. First I'd find the champion styles that suit you e.g. I play well with AP mages vel'koz, lux, orianna etc etc. I can pick up t hose t types of champions and do better on those then anything else because it comes naturally. Second focus on not dying and not greeding kills. It is so much more important not to die then it is to get kills. Number three is just to have map awareness and try and help your team as much as possible by ganking  and being there for them if they're caught out. But remember not to die int he process of trying to help them. Overall employing these things will make League less stressful :)","replies":[{"poster":"0uT0FN0Where","date":"2016-08-02T12:45:44.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or.... you know.... just try anything and dont follow build paths. i mean yeah you should but trolling and trying something new are very different, dont try full crit lissandra in ranked but go have fun see what works and whats fun","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-03T00:40:59.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try triforce, steraks, sunfire, spiritvisage, Randulins, Mercurytreads on a few tank top laners like sion, poppy, ect...

Like I said their feedback system 9/10 times won't do anything and simply puts the ban aside despite the players ban-worthy behaviour. Another game in which I play, CSGO, has a very toxic community, however what Valve includes that Riot doesn't is a preliminary vote (during a match) that then, if successful, kicks the player from the match and a ban from Competitive play (which increases each time) is immediately followed. Obviously because of the differences in games this exact method can't be introduced into LoL but it very much shows how more effective Valve is then Riot in handling toxicity.
