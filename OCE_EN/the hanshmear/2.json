Or the&ndash;okay, okay, I&#039;ll stop) the final 10 have been chosen and can be found below. \n\nThanks to all who entered, and for those who didn&#039;t get picked as a finalist&mdash;don&#039;t be disheartened! This is totally subjective! While we tried to have as much variety as possible (and we would have loved to fit in more) the fact that your entry isn&#039;t in here doesn&#039;t speak to the quality of the piece so please, keep writing! \n\nWithout further ado, it&#039;s up to you to decide which story is your favourite.
