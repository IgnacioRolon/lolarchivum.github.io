See below:\r\n\r\nWe recently introduced the cosmetic only Masterwork chests, but you could still upgrade a gemstone into a Hextech Chest and key. Some players over on Reddit made the suggestion that we replace the Hextech chest you can purchase with a gemstone with a Masterwork chest. We agree, so starting in patch 8.10, if you use a gemstone to unlock a chest, it&rsquo;ll be a Masterwork chest instead of a Hextech chest.\r\n\r\nYou can read about how the [loot system works and specific drop rates on our player support page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-20T11:57:35.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why could you even turn it into a chest in the first place?\n\nIt's like being given a bar of gold and swapping it for a $20 note.\nSeems dishonest to even have the option to swap something you get once or twice a year for something you get weekly.","replies":[{"poster":"Kizeod","date":"2018-04-20T12:22:58.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its compensation for people who cbf saving up gemstones or dont like any of the hextech exclusive skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-20T14:03:37.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So give them something worthwhile instead?\n\nA chest + key, basically = an Ashe champion shard. \nHardly equivalent to a gemstone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-20T14:23:12.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They now convert to a Masterwork chest + key (cosmetics only).

I have to get rid of it ASAP!\"\n\nI see no reason why if you do for some reason want to get rid of it, you shouldn't be able to trade it for something of moderately equivalent value? _(I mean, youve 'earned' it, why should you be short changed?)_\nThat goes for tokens and blue essence too.\n\nI bet you that there are people who traded their gemstones for chests either accidentally or because they didn't realise that gemstones had another purpose. Those people were essentially robbed.\n\nIf a player who remains within the client _(i.e. doesn't look at the boards or reddit or anything)_ gets a gemstone, they look at the options they have when they click on it: Save up 10 to get a skin, a little less for a ward, or they can trade 1 for a chest.\nAnd because they haven't done the research, they assume that all the options are fair and the reward if equivalent to the number of gemstones paid _(i.e. they may wrongly assume that Soulstealer Vayne is worth 10 chests)_, and so becasue the task of saving up 10 seems daunting, they choose the chest option, not realising they're throwing vast sums of money out the window.\n\nIf you really care about players, you wouldn't give them an option to waste it.\n\n______________________\n\nIt's like the Maori of old in NZ, when the european colonists came, they traded a single rifle and a couple of blankets for hundreds and hundreds of acres of pristine farmable land. Was it a legal transaction that both parties agreed on? Yes. \n\nBut today we see that as abhorrent, disgusting manipulation, daylight robbery.\nWhy should gemstones be any different? You're trading something insanely valuable, for fish and chips.\n\nit's dishonest.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-21T01:50:48.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You underestimate the power of OCD, or any other similar compulsion. If you aren't saving them up for anything, then yes absolutely some people will feel \"I *really* wish I could get this useless thing out of my loot it clutters it up\". Personally I have to use up event tokens for that 15 BE, even though I know they'll expire I have to have that little number on 0 or it just bothers me.\n\nIt's not really possible to know they don't have another purpose, since when you click on it the drop down tells you all the things you can redeem them for. I'll give you that people may assume that the loot exclusive skins are worth roughly 10 masterwork chests, but you could argue that they are worth less than that. \n\nThe exclusive skins are mostly 975 tier, the value of which (either in orange essence of in skin shards) you would certainly receive in 10 masterwork chests. The only thing that makes them worth more is their rarity, which isn't really all that hard to establish given how rarely you get gemstones.\n\nYou're hardly throwing vast sums of money out the window. If you're buying gemstone bundles it's because you want gemstones for something and therefore know their value to you, and if you're getting them for free...they're free. You could perhaps argue time, but you get them just for playing the game, so you'll either get another one eventually, or haven't invested enough in the game to care.\n\nIf someone is converting their gemstones without even googling what the skins they list look like (at which point they'll inevitably turn up the \"loot exclusive\") then they obviously don't care all that much about the skins. There was also a notification in client for HT Annie, and SS Vayne, and LZ Hec and so on which say \"Loot Exclusive\". If you don't look at or read those notifications you clearly don't care about the skins or already knew.\n\nTo you it may seem like a waste because the exclusivity of those skins has value to you, but to some people it just doesn't. I could care less about having Riot Squad Singed or PAX Jax because I don't like the skins and don't play the champions. If I got Black Alistar I'd be happy because it's a brutal skin, any exclusivity is a bonus sure, but it's *only* a bonus.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-23T11:57:54.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess we have to agree to disagree on this one.\n\nI just don't see why _(for any reason)_, something _(especially in a cyber world, where economics is nearly irrelevant)_ should be traded for anything less than its true value. \n\nWether you desperately want a mythical skin, or just want to clear your loot inventory, you should receive a reward relative to the value of what you are trading in.\n\nPeople as wealthy as Bill Gates or Elon musk, probably buy and get rid of cars the same way we buy and get rid of fidget spinners.\nDoes that mean that an Aston Martin DB9 should be worth any less just because it is less of a big deal for its owner? \n\nElon Musk has the right to sell his car for exactly the same price as someone who has worked all their life to get the same car.\nJust because Elon Musk happens to have 5 of them and trades them out every year for a new model, doesn't mean they should be worth any less money if he chose to sell one.\n\nThis is doubly true in a cyber world like league, where there are no economic or market factors in play such as deflation.\n\nIf 10 gemstones is worth 1 mythical skin, then 1 gemstone should be worth something equivalent to 1/10th of a mythical skin.\nA chest and a key _(even a master chest/key)_ is not equivalent to a mythical skin.\nIt takes roughly $250 to get enough gemstones for a mythical skin, it takes roughy $10 to get a skin that you would get from a chest. $10 isn't 1/10th of $250. Therefore, regardless of its personally value to you, if you trade gemstones for chests, _you are being short changed._\n\n______________\n\nI understand that to some people a mythical skin _(like you say, 975 quality)_ may not be worth any more or less than a purchasable skin. However regardless of their view of it, due to its rarity, the actual value of the skin is higher.\n\nFor example, just because the Mona Lisa and an exact forgery look identical, doesn't make them worth the same amount of money.\nTo me, the two paintings are identical, so I see no reason to pay $1,000,000,000 for one and $25 for the other. However that doesn't mean that the Mona Lisa is worth any less, just because I personally wouldn't pay that much for it.\n\nEssentially the only difference between the Mona Lisa and an exact forgery is the fact that one is 'original' and there can be only 1 'original', where as there can be unlimited copies made.  But does that really matter? They look identical, and the point of a painting is to look at it. So by that logic, they should be worth the same? \n\nBut they're not.\n\nIt's the same argument wth mythical skins.\nJust because you personally don't see the value, doesn't mean it isn't intrinsically valuable.\n\nSo in a cyber world with a stagnant economy, regardless of how you feel about it, a gemstone has a distinct value, and that value is 10% of the value of a mythical skin.\n\nTherefore regardless of how valuable the gemstone is to you personally, you should receive a reward equivalent to its actual value.\n\n_(Remember because it's a cyber world, the value is set artificially by Riot, not by supply/demand of the players as it would be in a real economy.)_","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-23T12:26:58.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think yes, we'll have to agree to disagree.\n\nThough I son't know if art is the best analogy, since the value of art (especially art like the Mona Lisa, which only has value because it was stolen that one time) is entirely subjective and in the case of the big stuff is pretty much always artificially inflated by collectors and people who want to avoid taxes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kizeod","date":"2018-04-20T15:41:09.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I would sell my soul for an ashe shard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
