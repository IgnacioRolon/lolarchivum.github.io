Scarlet wisps pulled away from her body as she walked to the edge of the cliff, falling from her long limbs in lingering caresses. It clung to her ankles and ghosted about her calves, refusing to leave her completely, like a blanket of heavy light carrying the touch of the divine light.\n\nThe weight of her weapon, hewn in the image of the crescent moon, seemed especially heavy that night as it rested against her shoulder. It could not be sheathed like a sword, forgotten at one&rsquo;s hip and left to swing with one&rsquo;s gait. Her weapon had to be carried constantly, a permanent presence in her hand just as the moon was a permanent presence in her life.\n\nWorship should not be forgotten. \n\nBut Ionia had done just that.\n\nIt was a cultural habit of Ionians to build in harmony with the natural topography of the land. By capitalising on the steep cliffs, narrow valleys, and thick forest they greatly enhanced their nation&rsquo;s defense. Any army would be defeated by the land itself long before they ever got near any vulnerable Ionian villages. An exhausted enemy was no threat, after all. \n\nBut for her, fleet of foot and uncaring for the political machinations of Runeterra&rsquo;s various ruling bodies, Ionia&rsquo;s terrain did nothing more than afford her the perfect vantage point for the city below.\n\nBright with revelry, the city glowed a mix of gold and red. Dancing flames and magic globes showing through a paper sheen of yellow and crimson to paint the terrain around it in the hues of festivity.\n\nFestivity. They had turned this holiest of events, where life and death parried on the edge of a blade, into a night of levity and celebration. Streamers fluttered on the wind. Ionians cavorted in garish costumes that mocked that which they claimed to revere. She had seen Shen and Akali in their festival garbs, dancing their ridiculous mockery of a dance. She had seen revelers wearing costumes for fiends such as Thresh of Kalista, acting like they were what they should fear on this night. It was a marker of the difference that the Fields of Justice had made upon Runeterra; Ionia no longer revered it once did.\n\nThey must be reminded of what the Blood Moon truly meant.\n\nDiana crouched slowly, feeling the unfamiliar weight of her ceremonial gear, so different to her normal armour. She surveyed the delighted city and knew, before night&rsquo;s end, that the only light that would shine upon it was that of the bright red moon above, reflecting in the blood they were about to spill.\nShe took no joy in the act. No, joy was an entirely inappropriate response. This was a duty to be carried out with severity and dignity. These people would have to die, but it was because their deaths were brought about by their own actions.\n\nDiana sighed and lowered her head. If only they had remembered respect. This could have been avoided entirely.\n\nShe became aware of a presence behind her, though no sound was made to herald the arrival of another. It was a pressure between her shoulder blades, like a hand touching there, but a hand that was simply aiming a knife prepared to strike. Diana rose slowly, shifting the grip of her weapon into her dominant hand.\n\nTo his credit, the acolyte behind her stopped a respectful distance, aware of the gap in their rank if not their skill.\n\n&ldquo;You have doubts?&rdquo; It was posed as a question, but the words held a trace of mockery, of condescension. As though the speaker already knew the answer. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need you for this, High Priestess.&rdquo; He spoke her revered title like it was a slur.\n\nDiana rolled her head on her neck slowly, a deceptively relaxed movement that she knew exposed the long column of her throat. Her wrist rotated, shifting her grip on her weapon as she turned smoothly in a graceful pivot.\n\n&ldquo;You are too used to Noxian subtlety, Talon.&rdquo; Though her words were scolding, her tone was light, almost educational. &ldquo;Perhaps this serves you well dancing with Du Couteau or dueling wit with Darius, but here you are not a grand assassin. Here, you serve the Blood Moon.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;We all do.&rdquo;\n\nDiana&rsquo;s eyes jumped past Talon&rsquo;s ugly expression to the red clad form that ghosted from the trees behind him. Blood Moon worshippers kept to themselves, as a general rule. It was not a religion. It did not require a dogma or a holy place. It did not require relics or effigies or figureheads. It required action. It required a way of living that hid from the sunlight. Not out of fear. No.\n\nIt was to make those in the light fear what happened when their beloved sun faded.\n\nAs such, Blood Moon worshippers were often surprising in their identities. Talon was not, nor was Diana&rsquo;s, truly. Even Jhin did not surprise Diana when he had arrived, sitting off to the side silently to await the coming slaughter. Indeed, she almost expected him to be a Blood Moon worshipper.\n\nBut had Diana listed names of those she thought would appear that night, Twisted Fate was certainly not one of them.\n\nTalon passed the rogue a look that was somewhere between a sneer and outright disgust. The fact that he had to bow to Diana as a superior in worship had rankled him to no end, but the fact that Twisted Fate stood as his equal was clearly something he could not stomach.\n\nTalon would be trouble, but it was trouble Diana would not deal with on this night.\n\nA ring of steps heralded Jhin rising, coming to stand abreast of the High Priestess. &ldquo;Looks like no one else is coming.&rdquo;\n\nFour.\n\nDiana exchanged a glance with each, expelling a breath.\n\n&ldquo;You are right, Fate,&rdquo; she said, locking gazes with him. &ldquo;Ionia has forgotten what a red moon truly means. We will remind them. We will remind them why they feared the Blood Moon. They have defiled our sanctity with their festivities for the last time.&rdquo;\n\nShe turned to Talon and swirled her blade around her body, hearing it hiss through the air like a serpent prepared to strike. &ldquo;But we are here to serve. Tonight is a holy night, and it will be treated as such. If I find any of you-&rdquo; She took that second to look at Jhin pointedly, then back at Talon. &ldquo;- any of you indulging in your personal vices, I will add your blood to the sacrament.&rdquo;\n\nTalon&rsquo;s face twitched. Diana did not look away. She was challenging him, then and there, to try and take her most holy status away from her. They had danced many times against one another on the Fields of Justice, and their exchanges had come to varying conclusions. But Talon&rsquo;s zeal for murder could not stand against her zeal for the moon. He knew it. She knew it.\n\nThe moon knew it.\n\nSlowly Talon inclined his head, masking the gesture of acquiescence into lifting his mask to his face. Twisted Fate did the same. Jhin had come with his mask on and, as one would expect, had yet to remove it.\n\nDiana lifted her blade and sliced it behind her, toward the village. Talon went first, sprinting over the edge of the cliff and launching himself into the treeline blow. Jhin went after, electing to slide down the cliff instead of trusting himself to the strength of the boughs. Twisted Fate was last, and bowed to Diana deeply before his own magic carried him to a destination unknown.\n\nSoon, only Diana was left with the moon above her. As she turned to face her beloved sovereign, she conjured her mask in her hands. She kept her eyes locked on the moon as she brought the mask to her face, losing herself in the role of High Priestess of the Blood Moon.\n\nPraying to the Moon that, as the screams of Ionians began, she would not have to do this again.","replies":[{"poster":"Bahnshii","date":"2017-04-21T07:01:11.003+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for the shortlist!
