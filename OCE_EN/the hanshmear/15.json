He needed to put on a show, each and every time he woke. His Z-drive hummed quietly, a subtle green glow emanating from the device. It was why he was chosen to be part of the P.R.O.J.E.C.T., after all. He had turned it off once &ndash; only for a moment &ndash; but the Owner punished him severely as a result. Ekko didn&rsquo;t realise machines could feel pain quite so vividly. Well, cyborgs. The line was hard to draw. As with every other day, the escorts led him into the main auditorium, joined simultaneously by Ashe and Katarina. They all held their weapons close &ndash; Katarina clutched her twin blades, named the _Hyper Edge_, while Ashe&rsquo;s _E.M. Caster_ glowed the gentle blue it always had.\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Greetings, _Project_ initiates,&rdquo; the booming voice of the Owner came out from the perch upon which he always addressed the Beta team. He took two steps forward, with his hands folded behind his back. He looked like a vulture, with thick, broad shoulders and dark circles under his eyes. He raised his hand in a salute. &ldquo;Do not be afraid &ndash; as requested by each of you, we have given you a transcendence of power. Do not be alarmed at your loss of memory,&rdquo; the Owner lowered his hand with a small smile. Ekko gritted his teeth behind his closed lips. The same words, the same greeting, every day.\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a temporary side effect of the operation. It will be back by tomorrow, I assure you.&rdquo; He reached down, tapping his wrist &ndash; only for the lights to dim, an image appearing in the air before him, a projected hologram. It was a barbaric village, decorated with bones and skulls. &ldquo;Meanwhile, your first mission for the _Project_ foundation will be to liberate this outpost. We have already captured the women and children &ndash; all that remain are the barbarians themselves.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\tThis was always the beginning of the diversion in each day, Ekko had learnt. Each would begin with the autonomous greeting and introduction, before they were instructed to go about their mission. Ekko had refused, once. The Owner infected him with the Program viruses, preferring to break him rather than to fix him. The Zaunite barely had time to activate his Z-Drive. It was his one trump card, the one way he could escape the erasure of his memories. He knew what the other Project initiates did not. But each time he brought up the truth, he was struck down. Violently. He had lost count of how many times he had almost died.\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;&hellip; mission briefing. I assign you as _Project Beta_. Complete your task with diligence.&rdquo; He gazed down at the three before turning and walking away. Ekko had zoned out, lost in his thoughts during his tirade. It often lasted longer than a half hour. Each mission was the same, though. Slaughter the bad guys before coming back and to get your memories wiped.\r\n\r\n\t_Ugh._\r\n\r\n\tThe escorts left, and in the corner of their vision each of the initiates were given a map to their destination, zooming in and out of focus at will. Ekko liked to leave it at the top left, where he wouldn&rsquo;t usually look at it. Ashe seemed to take on the leader role fairly easily. There were few occasions when she didn&rsquo;t. Katarina stood with her blades in her hand, bouncing them in her hands, testing their weight. Ashe was focusing on her map, presumably &ndash; as she was motionless for a few moments before turning back, glancing at the two.\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n▲ \t\t▼\t\t ▲\r\n\r\n\tIt wasn&rsquo;t a long walk. If it was, it certainly didn&rsquo;t feel like it. Ashe attributed it to her newfound mechanical form. Muscles made from metal don&rsquo;t tire from exhaustion, after all. Hydraulics didn&rsquo;t tend to slow down. Still, she encouraged herself to walk at a steady pace, enjoying the sights on her way to the barbarian outpost. The snowy fields were rather pretty. She didn&rsquo;t see any sign of snow on the projected hologram earlier, but the map was definitely leading her forwards. They&rsquo;d arrive at their destination quite soon. Her _E.M. Caster_ hummed quietly, the attached scouting drone buzzing with energy, eager to begin its own mission. It didn&rsquo;t have an AI of its own, it was just following a program. Ashe still felt like it had its own personality, though &ndash; in its own way.\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Ugh, can we hurry up? I wanna get this over with,&rdquo; the bitter voice of Katarina spat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hated snow when I was human.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Snow&rsquo;s beautiful.&rdquo; Ashe stated simply, though she did begin walking just a little faster to comply with the assassin&rsquo;s request. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even feel the cold. We&rsquo;re machines.&rdquo; Kat was right, though &ndash; sightseeing could come after their mission. Ekko remained oddly quiet, trailing behind them. \r\n\r\n\tTheir destination faded into view from the distance, the image an exact replica of the projection they had earlier been shown. Warbanners cascaded down from tall, primitive monuments. Skulls and bones littered the ground in some sort of sick fashion statement. There wasn&rsquo;t an ounce of snow, as if the evil and hatred had simply melted it all away. Ashe began slowing, before finally stopping and holding her arm out, signalling for the others to halt. After a few moments, she lifted her _E.M. Caster_, taking aim before firing. The drone tweeted happily as it launched into the air, providing an overhead view of the trail to the outpost to each of the troupe&rsquo;s vision &ndash; just beneath their map.\r\n\r\n\tThe drone revealed the locations of each bandit, each crouched fighter, ready for an ambush. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Ashe said simply, the three Project members falling into a quick sprint in an effort to keep up with the drone. Once again, Ekko lagged behind. The barbarians were no match for Katarina&rsquo;s blades, the assassin darting in with a flurry of strikes, decimating the clustered enemy forces. The others fared little better &ndash; Ashe easily submitting a flurry of arrows into whomever leaped out at her. They were all ugly. All had the same look on their faces. They knew that the three Project members were coming &ndash; they just didn&rsquo;t know how quickly they&rsquo;d lose the fight.\r\n\r\n\tAshe held no love for the dwindling members, each of her Caster&rsquo;s arrows finding their mark. Katarina had busied herself with the snipers, causing chaos deep within their ranks as she blinked around, from man to man, easily carving through each. Ashe paused, blinking as her vision flickered. She chalked it off as interference from the flames that had somehow begun to decorate the settlement.\r\n\r\n\tThe stone settlement.\r\n\r\n\tAshe frowned, clicking her visor out of her face. Staring at the flickering flames, dancing freely across the marble and stone. She took a step forward, slinging her Caster over her shoulder. She took another. Heavy footsteps trudging through the snow.\r\n\r\n\tSnow?\r\n\r\n\tAshe looked down, blinking at the flawless dirt path. Where were the bloodstains? She rose her foot. There was some resistance, as well as when she placed her foot back down. She leant down, grabbing at the air just above the ground. Her vision flickered once again, showing blood splattered snow in her hand for the briefest moment. \r\n\r\n\tWithout dropping the invisible weight in her hand she darted towards the flaming marble, grabbing at it. The texture was yielding. Her vision flickered for another, but longer moment. Wood. Burning timber. Her head swung around, glancing at the dead men on the ground. Once again, her vision wavered. This time however, it stayed. She saw women and children curled up on the ground. Some with hardlight arrows &ndash; her hardlight arrows, sticking up from their bodies. Others with lacerations, cuts. The men&hellip; She recognized their builds, in a distant part of her memory. Freljordian. Her stomach lurched, memories forcing themselves into her mind, unbidden.\r\n\r\n\tAshe threw her head back, and screamed.\r\n\r\n▲ \t\t▼\t\t ▲\r\n\r\n\tEkko blinked, sprinting towards Ashe from his flanking position. That scream. He recognised it. He had done the same, once. He grinned to himself as he weaved around the dead bodies, each one a stepping stone to enlightenment. Katarina could wait. She&rsquo;d figure out, in her own time. \r\n\r\n\tAshe sobbed, her mechanical nature preventing tears from flowing from her eyes. She saw Ekko rush towards her, immediately leaping back, grasping her E.M. Caster and aiming it towards him. Fear was evident in her eyes, despite her robotic nature. She was trembling.\r\n\r\n\tMachines don&rsquo;t tremble.\r\n\r\n\tWithout a word, Ekko blinked towards her, wrapping her in a tender embrace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; he whispered, taking her hand in his and reaching back to pull his Z-Drive&rsquo;s cord. With a blinding flash of green light, the timeline paused, a new one taking its place. \r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Our will is stronger than their steel.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Akaloli","date":"2017-04-19T14:30:59.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Riot Hanshmear,\nThe author of this work has noticed that the first section has been removed (that offered mystery and intrigue, prompting plot)?
