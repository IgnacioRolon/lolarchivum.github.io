While we focus on this, we won&rsquo;t be running a game mode over the next couple patches.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-10T03:27:59.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what about regular URF?","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-11T03:23:43.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said it makes people quit league so nope not coming back","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-01-11T23:47:53.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"More on that here: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/12/ask-riot-urf/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-01-10T02:58:43.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick question (and it's probably been asked on the NA post, but I don't like going to NA), what's the reasoning for \"pausing\" the RGMQ while working on bringing OFA up to date? I presume it's to do with the resources available for handling the various Featured Game Modes, and that the teams responsible for that just don't have the ability to maintain the RGM while working on properly updating a mode that hasn't been around for so long, would that be correct?","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2018-01-11T23:53:24.265+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, \n\nI don't work on the RGM's personally, but Riot Stephiroth had this to say: \n\n\"It actually takes a decent amount of work to maintain a game mode for the rotation!\n\nEvery game mode we re-release has to be tested, bug fixed, changed to accommodate new systems (Runes Reforged being a good example), changed to accommodate new champions and their new mechanics (good examples: when Kayn was added, we had to update any mode that is supposed to lock you in the base for the first couple seconds of the game, like Ascension and Nexus Siege).\n\nAnd the same resources that work on maintaining these older modes for the rotation are the same resources that work on new game modes, or standing up our long forgotten game modes. If this was a different mode, it might be a different story; but One For All, out of all of our modes, requires some of the most maintenance due to new gameplay changes being introduced all the time.\n\nBasically every bug we fix, every balance change we need to make to those old modes, takes time away from our ability to work on One For All. So that's why we came to this decision, because we really want to get One For All out the door for all players.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-10T04:16:37.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They did also just have their end of year break, and probably most resources have been moved to making sure the season 8 patch and season start go smoothly.

You get a spike of revenue that eazes pressure of the need for RP could use \n3. You can run it more often and can be used as a way to make more profits\n4. It's a free to play game yes, but this mode should have a small weekly pass because the mode is so fucking popular and doesn't need to be changed","replies":[]},{"poster":"papi","date":"2018-01-22T08:02:41.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP ONE FOR ALL URF ON DOMINION{{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-01-13T16:31:26.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh the mode I miss the most is Twisted Treeline Hexakill.
