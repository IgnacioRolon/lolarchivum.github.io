But even under this harsh boiling hatred, many cultivators battle against one another on a platform made from the purest of Divine Jades; for the path of a cultivator is to go against the Will of Heaven and to stand above all. On the stage various peerless geniuses battle against one another, holding nothing back, every technique learnt over the last century, every secret knowledge honed in darkness, every treasure founded in fortuitousness discovery; all revealed before the eyes of their elders. The clash of weapon against weapon sings through the air like that of the Immortal Muse, whilst killing intent spills over the stage boundaries like an overflowing ocean. All fighting for the right to enter the cave mouth behind them, all fighting for the legend of the Sacred Jade Sword hidden within an Immortal Lake within the cave. \r\n\r\nHowever, one man, clothed in an azure silken tunic with deep royal blue strands floating behind him, watches this gathering of Heaven&#039;s Children with absolute disdain. His smooth fine features stands out even among those around him, silken white hair cupping his face like the hands of a concubine. \r\n\r\n&quot;_To think I, Dragon King of the South Seas, am standing before these country bumpkins, to fight over a fabled jade sword ..._&quot; His fist clench tightly as his heart speaks, anger burning behind his eyes like the very fire of an asura that wages war against all above, &quot;_I will sunder your soul Irelia, and I will make you suffer for this torment!_&quot; Glancing about, the youthful looking man unleashes his hatred. His eyes flicker as a deep golden light shines forth briefly before vanishing like a Flood Dragon returning home. \r\n\r\nHe takes one simple step forward and vanishes, a moment later his form appears on the stage that had previously been nearly a kilometer away. Before him, two forms dance against each other. One is a female clothed in purple with features that place her as an unrivaled beauty, whilst the other is a man cloaked in crimson garbs and white bone armor. One dances with their blade, their flickering blade light flowing in elegant circles, perfectly defending and attacking at the same time. The other dashes to and fro like the wind, appearing and disappearing around his opponent, the single sided blade in his hand never ceasing. \r\n\r\n&quot;Hey!&quot; A voice shouts out from behind the azure man, contempt and disregard laced into each word, &quot;Get off the stage! Await your turn to compete in the Conclave of Destiny!&quot; \r\n\r\nThe azure garbed man ignores him as he begins to move forward, his right hand curling like a dragons claw around a golden hilt.\r\n\r\n&quot;I said wai - !&quot; \r\n\r\nVarious glares ripple across the air, all of them aimed at his back with a burning fury, as elders of &#039;_supreme sects_&#039; witness the headless corpse that had been cut off mid sentence slowly slump to the ground behind him. \r\n\r\nAt this point even the two competing cultivators had stopped their battle, both looking at him with prideful anger. \r\n\r\n&quot;Do you know what you are interrupting?!&quot; The purple clad female demands, her eyes cold as ice as she beholds the intruder to the Conclave of Destiny, &quot;I am the Soaring Sword Fiora! Await your -&quot; \r\n\r\n_CLANG!_\r\n\r\n&quot;YOU!&quot; She thunders with a darkened face, her thin white blade having come up just in the nick of time, a second slower and her head would&#039;ve have rolled. However, despite her rage, trepidation began to creep within her as cold sweat burst out across her skin as she stumbled back ten steps before being able to regain her stance. \r\n\r\n&quot;Move mortal.&quot; The azure man snarls, voice rumbling deeply like that of a dragons growl, &quot;Or the next strike will kill you.&quot; His glowing golden eyes glances over to the other competitor, who upon seeing that gaze immediately lowers their head and backs away. Satisfied his gaze returns to the female named Fiora, that still stands in his way, &quot;I said, MOVE!&quot;\r\n\r\nWithin an instant three flashing golden lights lash out as he strikes out, the azure colored sword seemingly having transformed into the slash of a True Dragon. Fiora&#039;s face turns ugly as she immediately takes a single step back, forcing her blade to arise into the strongest defensive stance she knew. Soft violet light explodes around her as four golden blades hover above in the formation of a crane. With a resounding clash the three golden lights is deflected to the side, gouging deeply into the Divine Jade stage. \r\n\r\n&quot;Wing of the Defending Crane!&quot; One elder cries out from the crowd, &quot;Remarkable!&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;As expected of the Dao Companion to the Eternal Blade Yi! Formidable!&quot; Another praises. \r\n\r\n&quot;But look ... that man&#039;s strike gouged the stage ...&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;No way, that stage is made from Divine Jade, a heavenly material so strong that even God characters cannot break it.&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;Then explain that to me!&quot; One martial artist loudly roared at his friend, pointing wildly at the stage where three deep grooves had freshly gouged. \r\n\r\n&quot;Impossible ... who is that man?!&quot; \r\n\r\nWhile the voices murmured around them, Fiora stared at the man before her with an ashed face. That had been her strongest defensive technique and it only just managed to block the azure garbed man&#039;s strike! The stance had been made by a previous Sword Saint that had gained insight from watching a flock of Heavenly Cranes taking their migration flight. The more she looked at her foe, the more fear crept into her heart, savagely tearing apart all confidence and boldness that previously had cloaked her like clothing. \r\n\r\nHe stood there before her, unmoving and unyielding, his very presence was oppressive, crushing her will to live. It was as if one of those fabled True Dragons from above the Celestial Court had descended before her. His golden gaze heralding a sense of death. That whatever he glanced at would die if he so desired. Even the Heaven had to bow before such arrogance and ferocity. \r\n\r\nAs his blade raised once more, Fiora shakily attempted to resist, her arms shaking as she got into another stance, but just as the man&#039;s vicious blade descended with untold power once more, a voice called from beside them. \r\n\r\n&quot;Fellow Daoist Brother, would you be willing to give our Wuju Sect some face and allow this matter to end here?&quot; \r\n\r\nThis new voice was smooth, calming and even contained within it the resonance of incredible enlightened wisdom. All eyes jumped to stare at this new comer, and murmurs exploded to life around them. \r\n\r\n&quot;Eternal Sword Yi ...&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;The 100,000 year prodigy has stood up for his Dao Companion!&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;I wish I had a Dao Companion like that.&quot; \r\n\r\nThe rage filled azure man glanced at this new comer with undisguised hatred and disdain, his feelings of contempt plastered as a fitted snarl, &quot;Is that name supposed to intimidate me mortal?&quot; Undisturbed by the name and status of the youth that stood before him. His golden eyes took in the smooth tanned skin, contrasted by the royal purple robes that hung loosely around the youth&#039;s body, exactly like the long flowing black hair that ran down the interrupters back. \r\n\r\n&quot;No fellow Doaist, I just besiege you to allow my Dao Companion to leave.&quot; Eternal Sword Yi cupped his fist together, bowing slightly as he requested for Fiora&#039;s safety.\r\n\r\n&quot;_Yi ...._&quot; Fiora cried in her heart, clenching her fist as she bitterly wept. Because of her weakness the man of her dreams had to plead before another. The very lover of her Dao Heart which she promised to never betray, was here begging on her behalf, &quot;_How pathetic am I ..._&quot; \r\n\r\nGlancing over the pair, the azure man snorted, sheathing his blade as he continued walking forward towards the open cave mouth behind the stage, &quot;Leave. I do not have time to entertain you maggots.&quot; \r\n\r\n&quot;Many thanks fellow Daoist.&quot; The prodigal youth called out, not willing to raise his head, nor move, until the azure garbed man disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\n&quot;Yi.&quot; Fiora whispered, her eyes brimmed red as she clasped on to one of his arms, beauty and elegance screaming out at the hearts of all around so that none felt anything but sympathy for her, &quot;I am so sorry.&quot; \r\n\r\nEternal Sword Yi turned to look at her, his deep onyx eyes glimmering, &quot;I am just glad you are alright.&quot; He whispered softly.\r\n\r\nAs they began walking down the stage, all gathered sects still silent, Fiora murmured a single question to Yi, &quot;Do you know that monster was?&quot; Her heart still trembling, for today death had knocked on her door more loudly and closely than it had ever done so. \r\n\r\nHer Dao Companion grimaced, glancing at her without pause in his step, &quot;That was the Dragon King of the Southern Seas; the Enduring Sword Talon.&quot;","replies":[]}
