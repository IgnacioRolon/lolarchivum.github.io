With that in mind, in order to make it not a wasted slot in solo lane, I think CertainlyT should consider allowing W to be self castable still with halved damage from the damage you get in the rework. If this is allowed then there is still sufficient risk to the ability as it won&#039;t do anything without getting into melee and putting mordekaiser at risk.\r\n\r\nI feel this would be a fair compromise.\r\n\r\nThat being said I think the Dragon pet is a huge gimmick and should be removed to allow power be put back into his other abilities, but CertainlyT is too fond of gimmicks to allow that change.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-12T03:57:20.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quizmar","date":"2015-08-12T02:35:01.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So while I'm not 100% on board with Morde bot lane I am starting to see the fun of it and if that's what Riot wants then thats ok I guess. However W still needs to be castable on minions for the simple fact that your support won't always be with you. Mordekaiser has to actively stick to someone at all times or he is useless. I've seen plenty a game in his new kit and there just isn't any meaningful decisions Morde can make without someone beside him.\n\nThat simply isn't a trait befitting of someone who is supposed to be the carry role in Bot lane. Most adcs aren't helpless without a support. I main Quinn and Jinx for adc and do just fine after laning phase without a babysitter whereas from every game of Morde I've seen so far you just have to accept that you are more useless than a support who is by themselves....and if you see an enemy either run or accept death.\n\nI urge that the Dragon pet be removed as so much of Morde's power is sinked into what boils down to a cool but fairly useless gimmick.\n\nPlease remove dragon and put power back into his W (creep casting for reduced damage and heal or even no heal) and E (slightly better base damage)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-11T06:05:36.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-11T04:32:11.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If riot doesnt change this im refunding my Pentakill and High Stakes skins i bought for morde","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-08-10T09:11:03.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since when can Mordekaiser even become a support or ADC. First off, ADC means 'Attack DAMAGE Carry', which Morde certainly isn't. Second, his W will be the ONLY ability in his whole kit to have an effect on your laner, his others just being high-damage spells. What they're doing to him is kinda useless and unfair, except for the dragon change, which I find pretty unique and cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-08-11T02:02:44.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the changes he is intended to replace the marksman in lane. His goal is to beat the lane to level 6, using the solo exp in a duo lane mechanic, than gain an advantage with the level 6 all-on. I see the tactic working with burst supports like annie/leona.\n\nThe logic behind it is that while your team won't have an adc, you will convert the the enemy adc for all your besieging needs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Quizmar","date":"2015-08-10T05:24:17.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been thinking about it since it was announced and it's driving me nuts. CertainlyT has no back and forth with the community, so it doesn't seem like he's listening at all, when that may not be the case. I just wish he'd take on some of the smarter constructive criticisms people have voiced, and stop acting like his vision for the champion is more important than the people who are gonna have to play him in his atrocious state that he's currently being worked into.\n\nHe doesn't have to be as good in solo lane as duo he just has to be viable and competitive, not super niche and borderline useless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-10T04:38:18.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been thinking about this exact thng all night.
