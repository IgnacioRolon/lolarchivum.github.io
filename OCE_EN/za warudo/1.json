Most of the people below lvl30 are smurfs, people making new accounts because they were banned for toxicity and bots.\n\nSo this matchmaking might have actually been fairer than matching you with other prelvl30s. You're almost lvl30 anyway, just watch high elo streams and replays, remember that you're not going to be able to make all the flashy plays until you're comfortable, focus on the basics, and you'll be good (or 'decent', this community doesn't really recognise 'above average' as good for some reason) in no time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-10-13T20:30:45.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In a cramped server like these, mismatches like this happen. The best thing you can do is not only learn from your mistakes but how these players position and how their playstyles differ from yours.

It makes matchmaking pre 30s with other pre 30s pretty damn hard since there likely wont be that many queued up at any given time, and a good portion of those that are will be playing with friends that are already ranked. The time of day you are playing at will also have a pretty big impact on matchmaking, like if you play pre-30 in the middle of the night.\n\nNormal MMR and ranked MMR are not the same.\n A lot of high elo players don't play normals that much so will have a comparatively low normal MMR. You also have the issue that there won't be many high elo players queued up for normals at any given time either (most prefer ranked), they get placed with and against lower players as well.","replies":[]}]}
