I splashed out a bit and got the HP Omen which has the following stats:\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (quad)\r\nGraphics: [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M] -4gb\r\nRam: 8gb\r\n\r\nI thought this would be fine since it&#039;s on its way to matching my desktop stats but when i played some bots to test it out today, it was so choppy and laggy and got even more laggy during team fights, this was super noticeable as i main Riven. I changed all settings to literally lowest, no shadows, etc, etc and it got slightly better but still terrible. I made sure the video card is updated and that i was running on the dedicated graphics, not the cpu graphics.\r\n\r\nWhy would this be so laggy? The specs seem way more the the recommended requirements.","replies":[{"poster":"Tushix","date":"2016-12-26T13:55:03.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just in case anyone else has this problem and sees this, my \"disk\" on task manager was at 99% constantly hence the lag. This was due to all the 'beneficial' automatic functions associated with a new laptop such as automatic update searches and stupid background programs. I uninstalled about 10 programs and altered my startup so there was only the necessary programs running. I also found my laptop couldn't find my GPU as it was not at its most recent update. After updating my GPU and setting it to run for every program, I can play league with max fps on max settings.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-28T02:38:32.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Geez and I thought Dell was bad with that stuff.","replies":[]}]}]}
