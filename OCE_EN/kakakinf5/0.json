Knowing that just the slightest mistake you make when laning against this monster will leave you screaming at your monitor when you realised how much advantage he's getting with as small as 300 gold and some experience.\r\n\r\nIn early game he is an absolute beast, especially when you are playing as a melee champion, his Q basically allows him to have two separate auto attacks and makes trading a lot easier, I think it's more suitable if riot gave his Q a slightly longer cooldown at low levels just to make laning phase slightly easier, I think that will benefit a majority of the people who played against Yasuo.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm most concerned about Yasuo is mainly his ultimate, his ultimate is on such a low cooldown that he literally has ult whenever the laner decides to go all in on him and it makes killing Yasuo much harder and much riskier, I think riot should consider giving his ult a longer cooldown just to make the opponent's laning phase easier and also nerf the 50% armor penetration after Yasuo has ulted because it really gives tank champions a kick in the butt.\r\n\r\nSo here is my opinion on nerfing Yasuo, hopefully riot employees do see this article and make official changes to Yasuo because the community absolutely despised this champion and they all reckon that Yasuo should be nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-05T22:55:03.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Kakakinf5,\n\n\nI do agree with you that Yasuo can be a painful champion to lane against when he gets ahead. However the champion isn't without his weaknesses.\n\n\nYasuo has a lot of things that can counter him and usually the best thing to do is to shut him down in the early phases of the game before he gets some for chance. Champions such as Akali show in their kit brilliant ways to counter him. \n\n\nYou've got her Q which is able to poke him from range and remove him flow shield. Her W which can make her to invis which she can use if yasuoâ€™s tornado is heading towards her to stop him from ulting. Along with a dash to dodge the Q as well.\n\n\nI think this matchup really highlights how to trade with him. Making sure you are poking when you can if you have ranged abilities or autos to remove his flow sheild and then trading with him when it is down. Another thing you can do is a lot of yasuo's like dashing into your minion wave, when he does you can force a fight because your Minions will focus him.\n\n\n---\n\n\nOther things that counter Yasuo can be things such as Hard CC to reduce his mobility and things that can reduce his attack speed. Frozen heart is a great item to build when against a Yasuo because of how big being able to move around and attack fast is part of his kit. On top of this if you are vsing him in mid you can take exhaust to help all in him easier. Reducing his movement speed (less flow) and his damage for a short time.\n\n\n---\n\n\nLooking at the things you suggested though I feel like with the state that Yasuo is in, I feel that we should consider that Riot often balances champions through removal, changing or adding of mechanics. While you might be right he may just need a number tweak, we should also look into the mechanics themselves and see how they can be tweaked in a fair way for all elos.\n\n\n---\n\n\nI hope that this helps, if you have any ideas on balancing Yasuo from a mechanics perspective that will put him into a fair and balanced state without over nerfing him I am curious on your input.\n\n\nGood luck in your games.\n\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-05T09:53:26.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And anyone who complains about yasuo sure find a little adjustment to their damn attitude after using him and finding out the numerous weakness he actually has, he is free this week so please play 5 games and go use that \"broken\" champ and do some \"broken\" things with him, I dare you.\n\nAs a side note just for you he only hard counters ~10% champions, is hard countered by ~20%, soft countered by ~30% and the remainder is pure skill match up and outplays. Now go play with that oh so \"broken\" champ","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2017-01-05T13:51:10.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only way to nerf yasuo without community backlash is to switch the crit reduction on his q and auto, make his q's 10% less and autos 20% less instead of vice versa","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-05T15:53:42.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or learn how many weaknesses he has and stop bitching, his weaknesses are so damn easy to exploit anyway, hell you dont even need to exploit them a gank at jg lv 2 usually spells the end for a yasuo.\n\nAnd you can't use the argument \"he will just farm until fed\" because once behind a yasuo is so damn easy to keep behind.\n\nAnd that crit thing, safer bet would be 15% reduction on both. Crit is yasuo's sustained damage after all and most literally only crit for 100 until 15-20 min as it is","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-01-05T09:26:58.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot already said they were going to nerf him, they also said they were considering reworking him along with master yi and i think aatrox","replies":[]}]}
