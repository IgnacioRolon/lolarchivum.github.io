Before featured game modes Riot made SR look all \"christmas like\", it had snow and everything. There's always \"chrismas related\" skins that will be released, and since they started with the featured game modes they've been doing that for certain holidays, christmas included. I remember 2 years ago we had \"Snowdown Showdown\" which was on HA, was 1v1/2v2 and it was first to 100 CS, 5 kills or first turret destroyed (if I remember correctly), that was fun. Then they had \"Legend of the Poro King\" last year, which is how the Poro Toss summoner spell (and later the Mark summoner spell) came to be. No doubt they've got something planned for this year too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T01:43:05.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow was snowdown really two years ago?
