Before the update, when you wanted to evolve a skill at level 6, 11 and 16 with Kha&#039;Zix, the squares would be highlighted orange, now with the change, they&#039;re exactly the same as a regular skill level up, so it can be confusing. I accidentally evolved the wrong skill because I thought it was just a regular skill level up. \r\n\r\nHope Riot can look into this.","replies":[{"poster":"Xs7r4ws","date":"2015-07-30T19:23:42.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with you, I main Kha'Zix and love assassins. However the three first times i tried to play him after the new HUD release i evolved wrong abilities on level 6 or 11\nI \nhope something will be done to solve this problem, even knowing that there aren't so many Kha'Zix players nowadays, this issue is something that really bothers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fake Support","date":"2015-07-28T13:00:55.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also experienced an issue with the level up whilst dead, it glitched out and wouldn't let me level up anything but r, then auto selected r.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-27T11:50:13.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Put this into the 'Help & Support' folder high chance Riot won't see it here in 'Miscellaneous'.","replies":[]}]}
