Before the update, when you wanted to evolve a skill at level 6, 11 and 16 with Kha&#039;Zix, the squares would be highlighted orange, now with the change, they&#039;re exactly the same as a regular skill level up, so it can be confusing. I accidentally evolved the wrong skill because I thought it was just a regular skill level up.&quot;","replies":[]}
