I'm usually able to reach a top of like 150-200 so I don't know what's up. FPS is directed to your computer (right?) and even though my router has been screwing up lately, it shouldn't be that...I think.\r\n\r\nAnyone have an idea what this is and how to fix it?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-22T14:33:20.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You aren't the only one.
