I've been gaining a good amount of LP and just then in a Plat 1 game I gained +37. I've never gotten this much LP before but I'm just curious, if I get into Dia 5 with around these LP gains (30+?), will I be eligible for a division skip? \r\n\r\nNot exactly sure how they work but I remember when smurfing, I was able to skip through some divisions in Silver/Gold with around 30+ LP gains.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-02T01:07:43.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think division skipping is only possible below plat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acinicus","date":"2015-02-02T00:24:07.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way I have seen a division skip is when you win all your games and your first 2 promotion series matches or 3 of you are going into a new tier, but other than that the LP gains dont mean you will be skipping any divisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-01T16:23:24.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eventually yes you will skip a division, on this smurf account i completely skipped promos to gold, you keep winning and the system sees that you don't belong where you are so it skips you, MMR op.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-01T15:31:39.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably.
