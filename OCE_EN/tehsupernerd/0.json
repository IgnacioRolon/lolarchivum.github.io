With all the bans.\nFair enough, I ask my team and we get some bans down. Cool.\n\nThen it comes time to pick a champ for the unfortunate fella on the other side.\nOne of my teammates yells out \"nunu\", so I click the ~~clown~~ yeti.\n\nNothing happens.\n\nWeird, ok. Haven't played nemesis yet, maybe it's like a blind pick other thing.\n\nTry clicking Mundo. Still nothing happens.\n\nI haven't received a champion yet, so I wonder what's happening.\nThe timers ticking down, maybe it just isn't showing who I've selected.\nI repeatedly click the giant fuzzball.\n\nThe timer runs out.\n\"You have been kicked for not selecting a champion\"\n\nWhut.\nBut don't worry:\n\"weâ€™ll be sending out a fancy summoner icon to all Nemesis Draft players who play the mode without quitting during champion select or the actual game!\" - [Fizznchips](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/meet-your-nemesis-draft)\n\nSo neither of us first-pickers (I don't know how this works, it looks like we both pick at the same time) got to select a character.\nSo we both probably got booted. And no summoner icon :(\n\n[EDIT] got into another game where I wasn't first pick, looks like it picks normally, whatever.\n\nIs this just me, randomly, or have others experienced not being able to chose a character, then had a nice dose of \"dialed up queue dodge penalties.\"\n\n\nTL;DR couldn't choose a champion for the other scrub, got timed out for \"dodging\", QQ no summoner icon, rito fix pls","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T03:23:36.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has this ever happened to you before?\n\nDid you play the moment Nemesis was released?","replies":[{"poster":"tehSuperNerd","date":"2015-02-15T04:38:35.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Posted this immediately after I got kicked - during the 12 minute wait.\nNo idea when nemesis got released.\n\nManaged to get into 2 games after this, but still slightly annoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-15T10:01:10.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shame about the missing out on the icon. I can only hope that all my games work fine.\n\nIt *can* just be a one off event, where a specific piece of data didn't get through to the server and thus your ability to select champions was denied. There's nothing that can really be done about that, as connections to the internet are not perfect.\n\n>Makes you think that they'd use coding which doesn't rely on a near constant and perfect connection.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
