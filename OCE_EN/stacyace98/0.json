In both of those you made some poor item decisions. Runaans is not good on Quinn, you always want a shiv for the bonus damage and it helps your wave clear as one Q+Shiv proc is enough to mostly clear a wave. You also shouldn't rush lethality items. It is okay to build one later on but you want to get an Infinity Edge and a Shiv as your first items. It gives you great damage on your procs, the bonus damage won't crit but the auto itself will crit auto+passive damage hurts a lot.\n\nThese are my most recent Quinn games notice how in every game I have an IE and a Shiv\n\nhttp://puu.sh/t14rl/3d549ed61c.png","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-26T15:01:42.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she was updated not even a year ago anyway","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-26T22:56:12.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the worse, though.\n\nIt was a half-assed attempt at making her popular, where Riot didn't even have a proper direction to go in (treating a marksman like an assassin) and removing one of her core aspects (blind). They would've been so much better off if they had adjusted her Harrier, Heightened Senses and Vault similarly to how they had, left Blinding Assault as it was (or perhaps a slight nerf to the damage) and adjusted some of the values on her Tag Team *or* giving her a rework.\n\nI don't imagine it will be something they're going to fix anytime soon.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-12-26T00:34:32.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are playing Quinn as an ADC you are playing her wrong. Take her mid, top or jungle. Your ult isn't a tool to escape a gank its a tool to roam around the map and push in lanes or help your other laners with ganks. I play Quinn mid mostly and have level 7 on her now. You want to focus on winning lane and then use your gold/item advantage to fly into other lanes with your ult and help your laners out. Late game you can also use it to roam between lanes farming and pushing as no one can match your rotation speed.","replies":[]}]}
