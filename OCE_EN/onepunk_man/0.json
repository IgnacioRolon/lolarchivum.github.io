The last time was five minutes ago, during an ARAM champion select : i used two rerolls, someone dodged the game, and when the next aram champion select started i had 0 rerolls.\r\n\r\n I know for sure that last year this was not happening, i&#039;m used to getting my rerolls back when some guy dodges the game. Is this a new thing ? Or is it a bug due to the new client ?\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-11T07:00:45.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI think I remember this coming up in discussions recently, off the top of my head I think the conclusion was made that it was one of these two things.\n\n* A bug relating to the new client, causing you to lose a reroll when you should be refunded.\n* A visual display bug, relogging should resolve this.\n\nLet me know if you can confirm either of these.","replies":[]}]}
