Just think about it o.o\nWe need more players in the Oceanic servers.. so the only way we can get more players to join is by telling others about LoL.\nAnd I believe the refer a friend system with the sweet rewards is a good way to encourage others, to know and perhaps join league of legends in the community. And then this will increase the players in OCE(So that we may not need to worry about opening 3v3 on certain days as our player count has increased). Incentives gives you motivation right?\nComment on your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Last GuardiaN","date":"2014-12-03T02:48:14.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i agree that, ALL THE DEALS are on the Old server's, Riot hates us ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qua4ratic","date":"2014-12-11T22:57:55.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've stated pretty clearly we are getting it ASAP. There's things to be worked out or something :) The rest of the world haven't got it yet either, lets not get too down before we miss out when they roll it out. I have fiath we get it when everyone else does!\n\nIf a red ever does read this though, i've tried asking numerous times, will previous refer-a-friend progress be counted when this new one rolls out? The info put out about the NA rollout clearly said it would, but hey, we never had any version here on OCE and I came from NA where I had done lots of referring. I now have no one left to refer =P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-12-02T04:28:50.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 refer a friend would be an incentive for neckbeards to have friends I approve.","replies":[{"poster":"ItzDemo","date":"2014-12-02T22:38:32.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Amen :) have a cookie my friend{{item:2009}}~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-02T06:19:59.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're all waiting...","replies":[{"poster":"ItzDemo","date":"2014-12-02T22:34:29.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waiting for so long q.q\nJust made this post to hopefully make riot focus on getting the referral system out there ASAP :)\nFree IP and RP woot woot!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MlkyIceCrmyShk","date":"2014-12-02T09:05:15.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ItzDemo","date":"2014-12-02T22:33:08.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alot of the Asian servers have it too :)\nI guess the OCE servers is working on the referral system, however sadly I don't believe its their top priority :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-02T07:22:07.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they're reworking it or something, so hopefully they'll give it us then.","replies":[]}]}
