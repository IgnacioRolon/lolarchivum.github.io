My play style mostly involves getting two lanes ahead and maybe the third lane depending on jg clears and timing. I like getting objectives and turrets a lot. Early sneaky barons. I played jg/top/mid (mid because it&#039;s supposed to be in high demand so I&#039;d usually get jg). Voice comms are needed for the cheesiest strats OCE.","replies":[]}
