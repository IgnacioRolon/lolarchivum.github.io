The patch is completely downloaded  and when I press the launch button, the EULA agreement thing comes up, I press accept and then nothing happens after this.I have tried reinstalling the game 3 times, forcing repatches and followed everything according to this https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues. I&#039;m kinda lost to what to do now. If anyone had this problem and if you have  resolved it please share.\r\n\r\nthanks","replies":[{"poster":"Cadith","date":"2015-08-20T18:28:48.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any of you using bitdefender 2015?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Andyroo66","date":"2015-07-30T13:36:14.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a problem similar to this and have found that restarting your computer can help but sometimes you just have to give it some time after you click launch once for the disclaimers to pop up after a recent patch and in between the two disclaimers I have found there is also a significant time lapse just wait it out, it may seem frustrating but it worked for me \nGood luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bronze VI Lux","date":"2015-07-25T11:03:15.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also added my lol patcher log and it seems that there is a problem with the LoLLauncherLib... not sure what to do though :(","replies":[]}]}
