How the hell does that work?\r\n\r\nIt is demoralizing when I am placed in a match with NOBODY on the other team being similar rank to me.\r\nNot demoralizing only for me, but also for the people who have to have a shit player like me on their team of silvers and gold, against another team of silvers.\r\nLook at these teams from last game:\r\n\r\nsibotasu - Silver IV.\r\nNeymar - Silver V\r\nDeepkickerZ - Silver II.\r\nPorateas - Silver III\r\nVKT N3 TITAN - Silver V\r\n\r\nMy Team:\r\nJuju Sanada - Silver IV\r\nKatsumiii - Gold V\r\nManGo Cn - Silver IV\r\nOptimus Zim - Silver V.\r\nMe - Bronze III\r\n\r\nHow the hell is that fair on me?\r\nHow am I supposed to have a chance here?\r\nWhen I am ranked Bronze 3, I expected that I would be pitted up against other bronze players, so that I could have fair matches, and learn to carry people my own level to climb the ladder.\r\n\r\nI know, some of you might say &quot;that gold player should be able to carry you&quot;, well that definitely wasn&#039;t the case in the game above, and that still doesn&#039;t make the game fun for me, because I can&#039;t compete fairly with people my own skill grade...\r\n\r\nHow am I supposed to climb the ladder, when I am being matched against people who are way above my skill?\r\nWhy am I being matched against/with people in silver and gold, as a bronze 3 player?","replies":[]}
