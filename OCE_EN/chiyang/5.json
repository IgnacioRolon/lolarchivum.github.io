It was an annoyance at best, but the &quot;remake&quot; system worked really well for that problem.\nThere is another problem however, that this &quot;remake&quot; system does not help at all.\n\n_**Example Situation:**_\nEver had a player leave right after joining, but then continue to join, and leave constantly througout the game, while feeding the enemy in the process?\nThis is even worse than just having a leaver, because that person keeps reconnecting, going into lane, then disconnecting while feeding the enemy, over and over.\n\nI have experienced this multiple times now, in ranked games. Normal games don't bother me as much, but when it is a ranked game, and this happens, it really doesn't encourage you to keep playing ranked.\n\n_**Conclusion:**_\nThe &quot;Remake&quot; system needs to address this problem too, and make adjustments to at least reduce the amount of times this type of situation ocurrs.\n\nHave you ever experienced this? If so, how many times has this happened to you?\nDoes anyone have any ideas for addressing this issue?\nLets vote, to show RIOT how many people are experiencing this issue.","replies":[]}
