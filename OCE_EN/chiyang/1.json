I submitted a ticket to support, and got a response:\n&quot;We cant give you anything for free&quot;.\n**followed by a buttload of promotional advertisements**\n&quot;After checking your account, I can see that your IP boost is intact and the number of hours have been accounted for&quot;.\n\nThe problem with the statement I received, is that they did not mention the two screenshots that were taken 1 hour after the other.\n1 screenshot shows &quot;7 hours remaining&quot;, then the next screenshot taken 1 hour later, shows &quot;4 hours remaining&quot;.\nThe time and date were visible on my PC screen at the bottom right, and if you really wanted to check that the time was not tampered with, you could check the metadata for the image files themselves for the timestamp.\nThe URL&#039;s below link to the images.\n\nI&#039;ll also note that the second image says &quot;4 wins remaining + 4 hours remaining&quot;. Its completely wacked out... This was taken less than an hour after the first image which shows &quot;0 wins remaining + 7 hours remaining&quot;.\nI went to bed, woke up, and sure enough, the icon read \"3 wins remaining + 0 hours remaining\". 3 games later, it said I had run out of IP boost...\nIts like it changed from a 24 hour boost, to a 4 win boost, or something wacked out like that... either way, i certainly did not get what I paid for...\n\nIf I was to ask the community&#039;s oppinion, would you say I deserve some kind of compensation at least, instead of the following response?:\n&quot;I cant give you anything for free, but I can spam you the promotions we are giving out to everyone this week&quot;\n\ni65.tinypic.com/6em4bq.jpg\n\ni68.tinypic.com/35ib12b.jpg\n\nP.s. considering, I paid real money for this Ip boost, providing some kind of compensation for this defective product/service I paid for, seems to me like something that should be required by law.\nRight?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-23T09:52:32.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm currently in the process of getting another set of eyes to look into this, to double check that nothing was missed.\n\nIf you could provide a ticket number here for reference that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"ChiYang","date":"2016-07-26T00:59:09.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, didnt realize someone finally replied to this.\nThe ticket is Request #22551842.\n\nI've received another response after following it up, and they have said the following:\n\nSummoner,\n\nThank you for providing me with this information. We have a Billing Support Team in place dedicated to working with issues like this one, so I need to transfer your ticket to someone with the tools to resolve your issue.\n\nPlease keep in mind that we respond to tickets in the order we receive them, so ‘bumping’ your ticket by sending us additional messages will send it to the back of our queue.
