WTF?","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i carry my team like crazy, going **10/0/4** by 20 mins, causing enemy to surrender, I only get an **A** grade.\nWhen our support goes **5/1/7** never leaving bot lane, he gets an **S** grade...\nI took way more objectives than he did (Dragon, Towers etc) and I had more gold at the end of the match, but his CS was higher... I&#039;m not supposed to take CS. I&#039;m supposed to gank for my gold, take objectives, and force an early surrender.\n\nI&#039;m currently lvl 6 mastery with Shaco, but getting an S just seems to only happen if I have a drawn out game, which is really undesireable for shaco, because at a certain point, he starts to drop behind others.\n\nIf I do my job properly, this game I just had is exactly what I am supposed to achieve as Shaco. Gank lanes, get kills, snowball lanes, and disrupt the enemy jungler enough that he wants to surrender.\nI did all of that perfectly this game, but I still only get an A...\n\nSo basically, this stupid rating system, is asking me to go take CS from peoples lanes as well, so I can have a good CS score??\nOr maybe get less kills so they dont surrender, and let the game drag out and HOPE the enemy doesn&#039;t catch up and eventually make me useless?\n\nRIOT needs to make some adjustments to account more for a jungler&#039;s objectives. Because with a perfect game as Shaco, RIOT&#039;s rating system doesnt seem to think i did very well...","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-14T09:50:27.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you're misunderstanding a few things, but there's definitely some truth to what you're saying :)\n\n\n\n_Let me clear up something first:_\n\n+ The rating system is based on **how well you did compared to other Shaco junglers**. \n\n If your stats show you're in the top percentage of **Shaco** junglers, then you'll receive an S class rank. You didn't get an S class rank that game because other **Shaco** junglers got better scores, which meant your score wasn't quite good enough for the S class percentage.\n\nTo be clear, **Yasuo** was competing against other **Yasuos** and you were competing against other **Shacos** to get your S class ranks. \n\nThe stats he needed to get S class can't be compared to yours because you're on different champions.\n\nIf an **Urgot** goes 3/0/5 with decent CS, he might get into the S class percentage because most players will feed on **Urgot**. Now if a champion like **Jinx** got that score, she might only get an A because it's quite common for **Jinx** to do better than that.\n\n__*\n\nI'll be fair though, I have noticed myself that CS seems a little over valued. CSing on junglers seems to get me a better score than ganking, in my experience.\n\nI'd say the best thing to do here is to keep **Riot** pressed on the issues. We had a similar issue for support S ranks and it got fixed like that :D","replies":[{"poster":"ChiYang","date":"2016-09-15T08:17:03.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have received S class as shaco before. The problem I am having here is not \"how well I did compared to other shaco's\".\nThe problem is how RIOT's system JUDGES WHAT IS GOOD shaco playing.\n\nRiot's system takes CS, Kills, Deaths, Assists, and objectives into account, but this doesn't work for shaco if you have a perfect game with him.\n\nDoes the system take into account how long the game was? \nOr does it take my 20 minute game with 10 kills, and compare it to another shaco's 40 minute game with 20 kills, and say they played better because they got 20 kills?\nDo you see the dilema here?\nOn average, I got a kill every 2 mins. If i was in a 50 minute game, that would equate to 25 kills.\n\nProblem is, the enemy surrendered, BECAUSE I was doing really well, and the game got cut short, apparently meaning I played worse than the average S class Shaco.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-15T09:33:07.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have no idea what **Riot** actually uses for the champion mastery score past KDA and CS. \n\nThey might infact take all those things you said into account, or they might take none of them into account like you claim. All **Riot** has said is that they use a \"series of performance metrics\".\n\nI'm not too sure where you read that they didn't consider those metrics, but the reality is that no one knows. Personally I've noticed they do account for shorter games etc. (atleast on support), but that's just my experience.","replies":[{"poster":"ChiYang","date":"2016-09-15T13:38:18.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt read that they didn't consider those metrics.\nThis experience however, suggests it, or at the very least, something has been left out of the equasion.\n\nHere's the way I see it:\n\nGame 1:\nThis game, I got 10/0/4, and forced a surrender. 1 kill every 2 mins. with one lane gank every 3 mins.\nThe game ended at 20 mins.\nIts pretty damn hard to do better than that, within a 20 min time frame... to increase my score, I'd have to take cs from lanes, which I'd get flamed for before during lane phase.\nThis earned me an A Grade.\n\nGame 2:\nThis game, I went 18/3/4. Slightly less kills per min. Ganks were similar, but slightly less.\nObjectives were more, because there was more time to get them. \nCS was more, because lane phase was over, and i could split push.\nThe game ended at 45 mins.\nThis was enough to earn me an S.\n\nThis strongly suggests, that even though I played better in game 1, compared to game 2, I got a lower score purely because the game didnt go for as long.\nIt strongly suggests that it doesnt weigh your performance against the gaming time played.\nSomething is obviously missing from the equasion.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-15T20:12:29.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, your statistics are a pretty interesting start, but of course the sample size is very low with only 2 games.
