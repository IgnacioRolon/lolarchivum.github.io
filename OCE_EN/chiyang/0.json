While moving toward Hunted targets, Nidalee gains Prowl's bonus movement speed and ignores unit collision. Additionally, Nidalee's first use of Takedown and  Pounce against Hunted targets are empowered.\n\nHUNT BONUS: Pounce can be used to target nearby Hunted targets and gains increased range against them.\n\nKilling a unit or dashing to a Hunted target reduces Pounce's base cooldown an amount if it's currently at a higher amount.\n\nBear in mind for some things tho it is a wiki so it can be messed with and also have out of date info or be wrong","replies":[{"poster":"ChiYang","date":"2016-07-09T14:42:51.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all that info.\nI wasnt sure where to look before.\n\nI'm still having trouble with this.\nI feel like i'm doing everything right, but the CD does not seem to be reducing when i pounce on the marked targets...\n\nI place the traps underneath where each wolf would spawn, then i change to animal form.\nWhen they appear, i immediately pounce on them.\nAt this point, I expect my pounce CD should reduce enough that I can almost immediately pounce again. right?\nThis does not seem to be happening.","replies":[{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-10T18:39:39.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At level 1 It reduces it to 3 second cooldown (Down from 5 second CD) on your first Jump onto a Hunted target - so it cuts 2 seconds off your pounce cooldown - killing a unit can be used to drop the cooldown so make sure u use it as a finisher if you want the cooldown reduc.\n\nEach time you put a new rank into Aspect of the Cougar (Level 6, 11 and 16) the cooldown it cuts off your skills when you kill something is increased (COOLDOWN REFUND: 40 / 50 / 60 / 70%) so with level 16 Nidalee (3 Points into Aspect of the Cougar) her Pounce will be 5 seconds and if you hit a hunted target will drop to 1.5 seconds.\n\nIt scales with Cooldown reduction though, so since with 40% CDR your pounce will be dropped to 3 seconds - hitting a hunted target or killing a Unit will drop your pounce cooldown to 0.9 seconds at level 16 with rank 3 into Aspect of the Cougar. (So if you jump to a marked target it will be 0.9 seconds until you can jump again - but you wont be able to spam it on the same Hunt- marked Target -however throwing a spear or the unit stepping on another Bushwack reapplies hunt.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
