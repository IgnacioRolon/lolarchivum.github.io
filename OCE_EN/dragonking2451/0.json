The last game I played was the Yi game with TP and Smite, and as to why I chose TP well I like to backdoor sometimes, probably bad but I liked it.\r\n\r\nSo this is my attempt to prove I was hacked:\r\n\r\n1. In all the games prior to Yasuo I had flashed binded to the D key and the secondary assigned to the F key, the hacker assigned flash to the F key and ignite to the D key.  if you look at every game this season It was binded to the D key. \r\n\r\n2. I am JG/Support main, JG I was using Yi because everyone says Yi is free wins in low elo :)))) and support I would primarily use Blitzcrank as sup for the same reason unless he was banned then I would attempt Leona or Braum.  The hacker uses Yasuo in either the mid or top lane, and if you look at match history I've never gone mid in ranked while I went top maybe once or twice.  Also I cannot CS for shit and that is something I am working on.\r\n\r\n3. My runes and masteries, I take sorcery because I like gathering storm and actually the past games I played I almost always had sorcery to ensure I would at least win the endgame at like 40-50 minutes.  Actually I have never used Domination which the hacker used.\r\n\r\n4. probably not worth much in the courtroom but the op score was 10 in the games the hacker ran a third party program for.\r\n\r\ntbh I am probably lucky that I was only in Bronze 1 as that would not be too much to climb to again with a new account *with a better password.  I am also very lucky that I played off-meta as it adds to my case a bit.  I imagine if this happened to a diamond player they would be way more upset especially if they had a full skin collection and played full meta..  But this is my attempt to show I was hacked using OP.GG to prove it.

You will be asked a bunch of questions, and you don't have to answer all of them, but you do have to answer most. If you feel you can't answer a lot of the questions, then any information that is unique to the account but not visible on the account (either through client or on third party websites) is helpful here.\n\nOnce ownership and security is verified, you can open the conversation about having the punishment issued as a result of the compromise revoked.\n\nPlease be aware that there are some things that can prevent the account from being recovered. This includes (but is not limited to) things like having previously shared the account, having been compromised many times in the past, the compromise originating from someone with physical access to your account rather than digital (as in, they logged in from your computer) etc.","replies":[]}]}
