The map could be a Shurima themed Colosseum map called something like &quot;Colosseum of the Sands&quot;. The gamemode itself would be a typical free for all where everyone chooses champions and battle it out in the arena till last man standing or something similar.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-03T04:04:41.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what about a ffa with 4 players a team, a circular map and a large jungle, with 1 line going straight to the center with a triangle curve at the centre to seperate minion pushes with possibly a buff monster at the middle of that, maybe 5 champs a team if u can decide which lane goes the support/adc. but only 1 buff monster a jungle, comment with thoughts and if i forgot something to say about this map, and what would happen when a team loses","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-23T23:08:33.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it.

You'd need an interesting way to heal people up as the battle goes on though, or else matches will be 30 seconds at most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-23T13:54:45.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I think would be more interesting with that thematic design would be a gamemode with 3 teams of 3 summoners, where the teams fought in a spawling circular labyrinth and the gameplay would resolve alot like ascension, but the winning team would get tank, damage and regen buffs but the losing teams would do 80% reduced damage to each other and this could make some odd teamwork.\n\nThe reduced damage to the other losing team would encourage the weaker teams to teamup to take down the winning team and would create some unusual interactions, like an alistair headbutting an illoai or Full AP shaco clone into the enemy team to cause chaos, but it also creates interactions where the losing teams might focus the winning team, but not exactly work together to do it and do it in such ways to get their temporary allies killed as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-23T12:08:59.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All for one free for all, all go eve and shaco, opp.","replies":[]}]}
