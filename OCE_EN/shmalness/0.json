However, if someone was to flame another player even a little bit they are hit with a ban. it&#039;s fkn stupid and still nothing is done about it. I just had a lee sin that started really well then decided he was &#039;bored&#039;, soft inted 3 deaths and went AFk whilst I was in promos. Why tf should another players toxicity cost me my promos, and knowing no repercussions will be made makes it even worse. It&#039;s about time Riot actually started punishing these players instead of doing nothing about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-08-09T06:36:54.347+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too think it's a joke.
