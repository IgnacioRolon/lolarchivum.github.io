I join champ select after queue timer runs out and call my role etc. I go to select a champion and the screen goes dim and I can&#039;t click anywhere. I haven&#039;t selected a champ so I&#039;m taken out of select.\n\nThen I get to wait 15minutes to play\nHow fun\n\nEdit: after waiting those 15mins I picked my champ and screen only goes black after I select summoner spell, someone left that champ select so my screen is dim and I'm in queue, match found comes up and I'm able to click accept so I do, found out I still can't click a champ and got removed from select so waiting another 15mins just to play 1 game, been an hour waiting now since new update \n\nWill I get my hour back or na rito?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-15T01:34:39.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe issue you're experiencing has been acknowledged by Riot and they're working on a fix, see [this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/hprhLF4v-61-champion-select-bug-unable-to-select-champion-after-changing-summoner-spells) thread for more information and for how YOU can help speed up the fix.","replies":[]}]}
