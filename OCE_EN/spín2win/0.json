Last year I was permanently banned for toxic behaviour on my account xXInfiniumXx. At the time I was banned, It came without warning. No 2 week suspensions, no chat restrictions, nothing. I was suddenly permabanned which left me quite displeased as I wasn&#039;t even given a chance to stop being toxic/misbehave. I decided to just forget about the account and move on. I made a new account (Sp&iacute;n2Win with an accute &iacute; accent) and just focused on playing and winning games. A year and a bit passed and I&#039;ve managed to get honour 5 twice. During late  S7 and S8 July 2018. I&#039;m requesting my old account  being unbanned so I may continue to use it again. Thanks!\n\nLinks:\nOld account:http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=xxinfiniumxx\nNew account:http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Sp%C3%ADn2Win","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-12T08:51:49.278+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't have been instant perma banned for toxicity. Even the most severe chat behaviours result in a one time 14 day ban as a warning and gameplay offences the same. If you were permabanned, either you've had a punishment in the past and your account was not yet in good standing, or it was for something like cheating (scripting, third party advantages etc). Even a false positive for toxicity would follow those same rules so there must have been more to it.\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of why your original account was punished, and whether or not you appealed (and if yes the outcome of that) the punishment at the time there isn't much we can tell you.\n\nWe can point you to support to ask for more context/appeal as HeartVine has, we can ask you for the aforementioned info to help offer more context, and we can tell you that an account legitimately banned will never be restored regardless of any reformation (they tried that, it didn't work), but that's about it I'm afraid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-12T07:57:24.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wish to appeal the ban on your account, you will need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (choose the \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\" option) and handle the situation with them. They will manually review the ban and take any necessary steps *if* they determine the ban was made in error. If they determine the ban was not made in error, they will inform you as such and the ban will remain.\n\nYou also have the option of posting the related chat logs here for others to discuss, if you wish, however doing so will likely not change anything about the punishment itself, as the standard procedure for that is to contact support.","replies":[]}]}
