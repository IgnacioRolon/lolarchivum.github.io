It's good that you raised this as we should have released something about this earlier.\n\nOver the last 2 years we have been working with a partner to bring OPL Tipping to fans, which we really loved as an initiative, but unfortunately during the off season we were unable to come to an agreement with our partner to continue to provide this product to fans for 2019 and were not able to create anything ourselves instead.\n\nWe really love the tipping program and it will be something we look at kicking off again in the future, but in the meantime - the good people at Snowball Esports are working to release a lightweight tipping program for 2019 (which is coming in hot) that we will provide some RP prizing for. I'll post in here when it goes live if you would like to get on board.","replies":[{"poster":"iConnix","date":"2019-01-17T07:56:07.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Belquin,\nThanks for the update. It is unfortunate to see OPLTips discontinued :(\n\nI did manage to find Snowball Esports via a quick google search :)\nPretty bummed that it's only prizes for Top 3 (as opposed to Tiered Prizes on OPL Tips (i.e. 1st, 2nd-10th, 11th-50th), but i guess it will do! )\n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2019-01-18T03:33:09.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fair - there will likely be less tippers though, so you should be in a good place to take out prizes {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LishusTas","date":"2019-01-17T09:00:25.307+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummed as well. Last split was my first ever being into  fully into LOL esports (got hooked MSI 2018) and i snuck into 9th place and got 5k RP. I was crazy chuffed and am also sad to see it go.
