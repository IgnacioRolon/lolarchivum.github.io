Pulsedire Ez has the famous 'over 9000' quote and is voiced by Gohan as well, final boss veigar also has that quote among others,\nRiven is loosely based off inuyasha whose sword works almost the say way and his ultimate technics is called 'wind scar' and hers is 'wind slash' plus her enemy Yasuo has massive similarities to sesshomaru inuyashas brother who is constantly trying to kill inuyasha he also is a wondering Samurai with armour only on one shoulder, karthus makes death note references, irelia's hiten style is blatantly from Kenshin humura's Hiten mitsurugi style of sword fighting, super Galaxy rumble is a reference to gurren laggen\nAnd mecha Astros and maphite have transformers references, there are so many others too, and heaps of non anime too:\nMecha aatrox - pacific rim\nShaco - the joker\nAzir/Nashua/re nekton - Egyptian gods\nGnar - lilo and stitch\nVolibear - the golden compass\n\nSo I would be very surprised if the character you mention wasn't even slightly considered in the production of this skin considering the similarities","replies":[]}]}
