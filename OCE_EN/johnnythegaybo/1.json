I have been really enjoying League over the past few years, don&#039;t get me wrong, I just don&#039;t feel the way I used to about this game. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of champions or a way to make league fun again. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\nJohnny.","replies":[{"poster":"Rishu","date":"2016-12-31T09:29:22.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just keep Filling, learn new roles, play new builds. It will suck for a bit but you'll come across a champion you never knew you'd enjoy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-12-30T05:41:36.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Limit the amount of time you play each day. I remember times when I would play League on the weekends for 8 hours at a time, which was totally ridiculous and just plain unhealthy. Now, I try to keep it to a limit of 2-3 hours a day on weekends, and I enjoy it so much more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-29T23:53:06.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You could take a break, like I did.\n\nI took I think 1 year off League, and it's cool again. Not the best thing ever kind of deal, but it's pretty cool for the most part atm.\n\nYou don't have to force yourself to like it, if you wanna a change of pace, just go for it and take a break.
