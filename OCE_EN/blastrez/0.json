Like every other damn help thread i make\n\nThat's just because this specific board encourages people not to reply to others. If you wait enough, eventually I come around, and I reply to all applicable posts made here.\n\nI'll presume you're on Windows, because you mentioned \"task manager\".\n\nScan your computer for malicious softwares such as viruses or malware. Then, try cleaning your registry with something like CCleaner.\n\nMake sure all of your drivers and operating systems are completely updated. If possible, avoid using Windows Update to update your graphics, as usually they store outdated drivers on their servers.\n\nIf it's still not working, try [flushing your DNS/IP](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq10), and then [try an alternative DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5) (which you'll have to flush again afterward, and have to reset your computer).\n\nIf it's *still* not working, reply to this message and get back to me.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlastRez","date":"2015-05-08T01:28:54.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha, i knew noone would comment.
