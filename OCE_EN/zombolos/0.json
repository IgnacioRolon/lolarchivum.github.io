So you could post a message to your team. If anyone has any other ideas feel free to post them in the comments. \r\n\r\nAnother Idea is to have ranks so you could promote from members to generals or something were generals are trusted members that can like invite and start games and stuff that captains can do.","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-05T03:14:38.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one suggestion that ranked team captains can use, the  social networks that team members have all together along with their captain. Using Skype, TeamSpeak or maybe even facebook/twitter to create a group conversation for your team. In league you can create your own private chat and invite other members as well, keeping in touch with them is important overall.\n\nMy friend also created his own website though this was for his Runescape clan(a forum) and I can relate that to your ranked team idea for a message board, if you want that link I can put it for you, got to ask my friend for it since he is downloading anime and sleeping  right now _-_.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-04-05T06:31:07.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ Pretty much. Set up a Facebook page, create an ignore chatroom and set to autojoin and use Skype/teamspeak.\n\nIf you want to go as far as create a website for your ranked team, I would suggest using [this](http://esportsify.com ).\n\nAs for creating generals and stuff so people that aren't captains can invite and start games... Anyone in a ranked team can already do that. You just have to select which team you want to invite from the dropdown menu when you pick the 'ranked teams' option.","replies":[]}]}]}
