I also want to talk about nerfs to other strong champs that used to be at the top of their game but after certain patches they were sent to the depths of teir 5 never to return. These champs include {{champion:134}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:2}}. And pls if any of my information seems incorrect or otherwise stupid, ***correct me***.","replies":[{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2015-02-21T07:59:38.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Shurima has Fallen\" \n\nWhat again? \n\nIts been like a month...\n\n-GL,HF","replies":[]},{"poster":"Myrddin","date":"2015-02-20T16:58:58.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the nerfs are too much, but they have stated that he will be getting buffs in 5.5.","replies":[{"poster":"Kyuubix","date":"2015-02-21T00:49:10.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really, where have you heard this?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-02-20T22:37:33.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the Azir nerfs are fine \n\nAzir is my favourite and main champ and i was so tired of his 62% ban rate, now its only the people who love Azir for his appearance/lore/playstyle that play him not all the Yi players who played him just cos he was op, any true Azir main would be happy about these nerfs because it means; less people play him, which means less of your opponents have experience playing against him. he is no longer broken which means that you don't feel like a %%%% when you play him and when you do well, you know that you did well because YOU personally did well, unlike champs like Riven and Kat who do well because the champ did well not you.\nhe is hardly banned now in comparison to 62% so for once we can actually play him in ranked. i can only find good things about these nerfs \n\nif you only played him because he was OP then you were wasting your time you should have played Riven or Kat or one of them that requires less brainpower and does better to lift you up ranks.\nbut if you played him because you genuinely liked the champ then you should be happy because now you will be one of the few who stick with Azir and do well when using him.","replies":[{"poster":"Kyuubix","date":"2015-02-21T00:48:28.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.
