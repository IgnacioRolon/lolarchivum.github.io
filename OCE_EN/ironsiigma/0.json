This is my first ever League of Legends montage, the clips may not be spectacular and same goes for the editing, but i'm new to Vegas and I had a muck around with a few Video FX things.","url":"https://youtu.be/MgcwrYqKDWQ","image":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MgcwrYqKDWQ/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I recently (two days ago) made my first ever montage, I hardly ever use Sony Vegas and it was practically my first time editing something fully with it. I was curious if you guys could give me some opinions/feedback on what I could improve on in future montages? I would really appreciate any comments you guys have to share!

( there is a way around this )\n\n\nThe montage was really good, pref ranked games over pub stomp norms. but that's personal pref and in no way should be seen as a negative thing!\nwe all get our content one way or another. each their own.\n\n\noverall i think its good, and i look forward to seeing some quality content in the future :)\n\n\nAddme if you like, would be great to chat with another person about game content :)\n\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"Ironsiigma","date":"2015-06-22T03:22:32.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, thank you for the feedback, it will help for my future montages :) and yeah I do really need to sync the music with kills for it to sounds better, again, thanks for taking the time and watching it and commenting!
