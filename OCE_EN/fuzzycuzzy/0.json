If ranked is stressing you out this much it is probably a good idea to take a break from it for a while. You could play norms/arams for a while, or switch to a different game. I personally recommend [Stife](https://strife.com). \n\nNot exactly sure where you are getting this 70% from, as it seems to me you are running an overall rate of 48% with a steady rate of 50% over each set of 20 ranked games. \n\nWhile nobody except a select few Rioters knows how the MMR system works, players have come to guess what happens. While it may not be accurate, the patterns kinda fit. \n\n**The (presumed, not official basics).**\n\n* You win games, your MMR goes up\n* You lose games, your MMR goes down\n* MMR determines who you are matched against (mmr= match making rating)\n* You win against a team with more MMR than yours, _maybe_ you get more MMR (and vice versa).\n\nRecently I have managed to climb from Bronze 1 to Gold 5 with an overall win rate between 48-55%. It got me pretty intersted in how MMR might work.\n\nPrior to urf weekend I was playing ranked mainly by myself, a couple of games here and there with some people the same rank as me (silver 5). My LP gains were about 24 and I was losing 16. Pretty normal.\n\nOne of my bronze (bronze 5)  friends asked me to duo with him so he could get to silver and I could get to gold. I said yes, and so we played a bunch of games together. After about 10 games together I was only getting 20 LP for a win and losing 19 LP for a loss, even though we had a 80% win rate together. This continues throughout the 3day urf weekend when I finally hit gold on the sunday night. \n\nUpon hitting gold (my friend unfortunately was still bronze so needed to get to silver himself), I asked one of my plat (plat 4) friend to duo with me. We played a game and won it, and I gained 26LP (despite only climbing up to gold in gains of 20). We then lost a couple and I was only losing about 15 each time, which leads me to believe that who we play with also has an affect on our MMR/LP gains **(once again this is purely speculative and I could be completely wrong, only select few Rioters know the truth)**. \n\n>It is pretty difficult to climb, but not impossible. I personally think getting past x5 is the hardest part. I had the same issue back in bronze5, silver 5 and am now a lil bit stuck in gold 5. It's ok though, just keep a positive attitude and you'll get there eventually ♥","replies":[]}]}
