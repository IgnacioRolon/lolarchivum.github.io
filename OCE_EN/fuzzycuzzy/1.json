There's nothing more irritating than a leaver on your team. A little back story is that I just had a Yasuo main's champ banned by our jungler so he, in classic Yasuo main style, inted our game and left at about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThis actually happened in my game previous to that as well. The draven left becuase he and the Senna had an argument. \r\n\r\nOut of this I've lost like 35 LP and both were due to leavers within 10 minutes of the game starting. I don't see how I have any ability to have not lost these games, especially the one where the Yasuo main inted. \r\n\r\nI'm not saying to not give the winning team LP, but maybe like, can the losing team (due to a leaver) not lose LP? or at least only lose HALF the correct amount or something. \r\n\r\nIt's so tilting when you play 5 games, win 3 of them, but then have a 0% chance to win the next 2 because people leave. My MMR is so shit at the moment because of things like this happening. I have over 50% win rate but I'm hard stuck gold 4. \r\n\r\nIf you're worried about this causing issues with Win Trading, maybe an idea like, if there's a leaver under 10 minutes, allow the team to /remake where the winning team gets like half LP or something.\r\n\r\nIt just feels really unfair at the moment and makes climbing the ladder all that much harder.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nFuzzy.","replies":[]}
