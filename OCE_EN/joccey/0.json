Once that has finally been sorted, the last few attempts I&#039;ve had less than 10 seconds to actually **select** my champion for the role I am &quot;delegated&quot; to. This has been incredibly frustrating and meant I have had a time-ban imposed on me because I was not able to select a champ quick enough.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love other people&#039;s thoughts on what we can do to improve it. Obviously as we move forward with selecting the Role you want then you will queue up for those roles but until that is done, thoughts and opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-16T10:07:00.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"having a role selector for norms would be top.

I think the queue times wouldn't be too much, most champ selects I get into have at least 1 person call \"fill\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joccey","date":"2016-11-16T11:17:42.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly, like I'd rather wait a little longer during queue phase so that I know I've got a better chance at getting my desired role rather than hoping people don't argue because if that happens, I don't have enough time to select a champ and it bans me for time-out.","replies":[]}]}]}
