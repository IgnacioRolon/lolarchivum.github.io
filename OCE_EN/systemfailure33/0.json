Theres nothing on the server status page (http://status.leagueoflegends.com/#oce) about any of this so im asking is this normal? Is there a reason for it? What time does ranked or normal draft come back online exactly?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-04T10:51:22.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait what?
