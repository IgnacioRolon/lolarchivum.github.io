Riot have announced that they have been under serving players who wish to better communicate their individual rank though.\n\nI am hoping they bring out a new system in season 7 that gives players point/loss gain relative to their solo performance in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"me run mid","date":"2016-06-01T19:26:13.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 .  In old ranked you could only duo, couldn't queue as three, so i think when you said:\n\"let's say 3 solo players and a 2-man premade vs a 3-man and a 2-man premade?\"\nYou meant 2 2 man premades and a solo player\n\n2 .  It's a lot easier to be coordinated as 5 man than it is as a 2 man + 3 man, granted you could invite randoms into discord or something, even so you're still at a disadvantage as the 5 man has probably played a lot of games together and possibly have more synergy. \n\nI'm not really too bothered by the new system though as i still mainly duo with my adc or solo, and tbh I haven't felt disadvantaged getting matched vs a 5 man before, but I can see why it could be a potential disadvantage.","replies":[]}]}
