Not just game modes but stuff like the Refer A Friend program.

Especially with this relatively few amount of players on the server.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Give us the incentive to refer friends.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T22:44:30.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't pay as much attention to OCE as they do NA, simple.

Their headquarters are in California.\nThe other server's staffs are basically just there to adapt whatever Riot releases, manage their community and maintain their server.\nBut even Riot NA doesn't have THAT much of a say, since the huge Chinese corporation of Tencent directs Riot NA. That's just how the hierarchy is built up for Riot.\n\nBut features (which NA has) and we weirdly don't is pretty lame and it doesn't even make any sense since most servers have for example dominion game mode or are able to refer friends. It's really only Oceania players that get screwed over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nestay","date":"2015-01-01T05:26:28.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.","replies":[]}]}
