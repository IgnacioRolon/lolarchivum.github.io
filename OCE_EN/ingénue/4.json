Straight after hitting Level 30, I started playing ranked and got placed in bronze V but managed to climb to bronze 1 in about a week. Last season I made it up to silver 2, then tilted back down to silver 5 in the weeks before season end. During preseason I made it back to silver 2 again, and recently finished my ranked placements (going 2/8) and ending up in bronze 1 again. I played super poorly during my placements and am working hard to get my tilt under control and am starting to improve already :D I am moving house on the 16th of this month, and will only be able to play during the day on weekdays until then.\r\n\r\nThis season I am maining ADC, so am looking for a support, top lane, mid lane and jungler to join me on this journey and become friends so we don&#039;t have to face the toxin of dynamic que alone. \r\n\r\nBasically to apply leave these details below:\r\n\r\n* Do you live in NZ? - this is a must\r\n* Age - Highly pref people 20+\r\n* Vague availability\r\n* Current rank (and highest)\r\n* Preferred role + champs for that role (none of this &quot;i play all lanes equally well&quot;)\r\n* Skype, CV, TS (what do you prefer)\r\n\r\n**_DO NOT APPLY IF YOU ARE TOXIC OR RAGEY_**","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-02-07T05:46:31.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you live in NZ?
