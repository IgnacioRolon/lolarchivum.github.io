Both normal and ranked, but primarily on the ranked days as my goal is to get to gold. I&#039;m currently TT bronze 2, and my 5s flex rank is gold 5 and solo queue is gold 1. Would prefer someone who is like myself, with a low TT rank but an average soloq rank. \r\n\r\nBeing a support 1-trick, i&#039;m not super great with the champs the TT meta requires so i&#039;m still getting a feel for what works for me :)\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested, please leave a comment below. My friends list is only 3 spots off full, so I won&#039;t be accepting anyone through client. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time &hearts;","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-28T23:13:55.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey im keen.
