Games are won all the time off of even one single death at the wrong time. If you learn nothing else in LOL, learn to not die. Fortunately, &quot;not dying&quot; is not hard to accomplish. It simply requires you to purposely put a high priority on survival._\n\n_Beyond the effects on your team, dying carries a ton of personal pain with it. It increases the chances that your enemy will purposely go after you (easy kill) or make fun of you. It increases the chances that your team will ridicule you and blame you for everything bad in the world. To them, it will seem like you were the only one who fed their carry. To them, you are the reason they got ganked. It is totally illogical, but you will be the one solely blamed. Of course, you are a major contributor if you die a lot, but you get my point. No one wants to be &quot;that guy&quot;._\n\n**Note: As you become a better player, your ability to evaluate the potential risk of a situation improves, allowing you to become more aggressive. Of course, at that point you will be too good to gain anything from this post anyway.**\n\n________\n\n\n> #10 Tips to reduce your death count:\n\n##Before the game:\n\n**1. You can choose defensive summoner spells.**\n\nYour options are Heal, Cleanse, barrier, Ghost, Flash. Flash is pretty much a staple for most players, allowing you to evade skill shots (when you can&#039;t dodge) and escape over walls. Barrier and heal are both pretty useful, especially if you are going to be playing passively or are in a matchup that does not favour you. Exhaust can also be pretty useful here, and is popping up more and more in solo laners due to the popularity of champions such as Zed/Yasuo/Riven. \n\n**2. You can choose a ranged champion.**\n\nMelee champions may seem strong, but they must constantly place themselves in a position to be hit, whether it is farming creeps, stopping a push, defending a tower, fighting in a team fight, chasing an enemy, etc, etc. Melee champions must commit deeper than ranged heroes in every situation. Because of this and other reasons, a melee is a poor choice for any struggling player who is trying not to die.\n\n**3. You can choose a champion with a stun and/or escape skill.**\n\nMost champions have at least one of these skills but some are better than others for getting away. When you pick your champion, think of how your skills could be used to help you escape a gank. If your skills won&#039;t help much, you might consider a different champion. For example, Veigar can create a stun circle that stuns anyone who tries to cross it and run the other way; whereas Morgana must shoot an aimed snare that would only hit one person if you even land it. Since ganks usually involve more than one person chasing you down, Veigar&#039;s stun is obviously way better for getting away than Morgana&#039;s snare.\n\n##During the game:\n\n\n**4. Beware of bushes.**\n\nBushes are not your friend unless you are standing in them, especially in early-game, and especially when your enemies have yet to appear in your lane. The problem with bushes is they are potentially a trap waiting to be sprung. Checking them by walking in is like checking for a car bomb by turning the ignition. My recommendation is don&#039;t go in them until you see your enemies in the lane. Before that time, assume enemies are in the bushes ready to run out behind you. Act accordingly. The best way to not give up first blood is to assume any MIA heroes are just waiting nearby to gank you.\n\nLater in the game, instead of a bush containing 2-3 heroes it could have all five in it. Sometimes when I play, the enemies kind of disappear from the minimap and I wish I knew where they were (another reason wards are awesome). Then I see one or two of my allies wandering around our jungle kind of checking the bushes. Normally the result of this is they find the right bush and 5 nukes later they are dead just like that. Every time I see them doing this I started telling them to get together and not wander into bushes. Even a 5-man wandering into a bush containing another 5-man is a recipe for disaster. Don&#039;t wander willy-nilly into bushes when enemy positions are unknown.\n\n**5. Don&#039;t make yourself a gank target.**\n\n_Don&#039;t hang around with low life. For the love of god and all that is sacred go heal FFS!!!_\n Seriously, if you are low on life, you should hit b and teleport home to heal. Hanging around with low life is something good players do sometimes, but even they are taking a risk that may not payoff. Being at low life is like a big sign saying &quot;please gank me before I have the sense to heal&quot;. You also quickly lose the pressure in your lane and often end up behind in CS and exp. \n\nDon&#039;t wander around alone. Lonely heroes are prime candidates for getting ganked. The further away from your tower you are alone, the more likely you will be killed by a gank squad. A good rule of thumb is once you start losing a tower or two, your team should group up as much as possible while still defending the towers. The best situation is all 5 of you together all the time, but aside from suggesting this to your team, at least YOU can group up. If nothing else, follow your best ally around and support whatever they do.\n\n**6. Buy a little survivability.**\n\nAt least get basic boots the first time you return to the fountain. Get a cloth armour or null magic mantle. Turn the boots into Mercury boots. Later in the game, consider buying a Banshee&#039;s veil to block spells or a Thornmail to defend against dps (works best on high health, tankier champs). Yes, you can buy damage items too, but too often people ONLY buy damage items and totally ignore survivability. You NEED some kind of toughness if you don&#039;t want to be an easy victim.\nHealth items such as black cleaver for AD and ROA, liandrys and rylais (AP) can also be quite useful for this. \n Note: Lifesteal is not a survivability item. It is mostly a convenience item to heal without going home and doesn&#039;t really make you survive much if you don't have the defences  to survive long enough to use it. \n\n**7. Buy wards and use them**\n\nThis gets it&#039;s own paragraph. Place wards, even the ones that cost gold. Every time I return to base I try to grab a pink. Place them + trinket wards in the bushes near mid lane, in the river area, in bushes your enemy would gank you from, near the enemy lizard so your team can try to gank them there, etc. Place the wards in places you want to know are safe. Yes they will expire. Yes the enemy might not go there, but when they do go there to hide, they will be totally screwed by your ward, saving lives and possibly even turning the tables on your enemy. Use wards (and tell your team YOU placed them so they give you credit). It is SO worth the money and your team will appreciate your efforts to help.\n\n**8. Split up when you flee.**\n\nWhen your team gets routed and is all running away, if the enemy is chasing, they will try to catch the nearest hero, kill them, and proceed to the next nearest. If you run right beside your ally, chasing him = chasing you. They don&#039;t even have to pick which one to chase down! They can kill one and keep chasing to kill the other. Running side by side makes the enemy team have a real easy decision what to do and makes it easy for them to split off and cut off your path of escape. Fleeing in different directions confuses their players with indecision which way to go and means either: one of you will not be chased, or their team will split up. If they split up you have a lot better chance escaping from 1-2 champs than 3-5. Your ally also has a better chance. It may mean you BOTH get away.\n\n**9. Towers don&#039;t make you invulnerable.**\n\nIf 3-5 enemies are pushing your tower and you are 1-2 players defending it, you may just get nuked 5 times and die in 0.3 seconds and then lose your tower anyway. Towers don&#039;t stop you from being hit. Don&#039;t get a false sense of security from them. When your tower is being pushed you should still stay out of range of enemy spells so you don&#039;t get killed. This is especially true if your life is low. Yes you might bait them into dying to the tower if they are too greedy, but chances are you will die first. Hanging around with low life is something only good players should do. They can do so because they know exactly what spells/ranges/damages/etc can occur and are ready to avoid/counter it. Don&#039;t roll the dice. I have killed SO many people that stuck around with low life, and pretty much every game my allies push into a tower and a couple enemies hover around or teleport near the tower thinking they won&#039;t get hit until the tower is dead, but they get caught too close and 5x nukes rain on their head before the tower falls. It&#039;s not that it&#039;s always a bad idea to be there, but it IS a risk and many times a needless one. Better to let the tower die than feed them your death AND the tower.\n\n**10. Don&#039;t be greedy.**\n\n* Don&#039;t chase into tower range. EVER. This is another high-risk thing that only good players should attempt. It is 90% of the time not worth it, so just don&#039;t do it. If they get to tower range, they get to live. Just let them go take a long walk home to heal.\n\n* If your allies are fighting, you should be running over to help, but if they start dying off before you get there, seriously consider whether to run in. Even if some of them are low on life, they can still stun you, slow you, nuke you, attack you, exhaust you so all your attacks miss, etc. Many people run in to try to kill that one 200 hit point champ, and just die in the process maybe getting a kill, maybe not. It&#039;s not worth it to run into the meat grinder!\n\n* In battle, sometimes an enemy champ gets beat down and starts running away while his teammates stay and fight. Do not chase! Do not chase down fleeing champs until they are ALL fleeing. When an enemy champ flees, the 5v5 is now a 5v4, but if you chase down the enemy instead of fighting those that remain, you give your team a 4v4 situation. If two of you get greedy and chase, it is a 3v4 situation for those that don&#039;t chase. Meanwhile anyone that chases may get hit in the back by the enemy&#039;s buddies. Chasing is for when the fight is won, and not before. Chasing too early often means your team gets strung out and killed, and you might not even catch the guy you were chasing!\n\n_______\n\nI honestly hope the advice here will help a low-skilled player survive better. These tactics can also help even a good player survive better when they get off to a bad/unlucky start and now have to struggle to recover with a weakened champ.\n\n\nThanks for reading and please feel free to add any additional tips you think a newish player could use to survive better. I am by no means claiming to be some kind of pro. I simply wanted to give some good advice to help frustrated players out there turn things around.\n\n> Taken and adapted with permission from the original owner: **dredzach**\nView original post [here](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=58743)","replies":[{"poster":"dredzach","date":"2016-09-16T05:30:03.028+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had forgotten all about this post. Back in 2010 when I wrote it, Riot actually rewarded me a free Pantheon skin just for writing it. Shows how different the community was back then. The community was smaller and more close knit, like WC3 Dota was. Hell, many people like myself used to be in the Dota community, posting on their forums about champion balance, etc.\n\nAnyway, as I read this now, surprisingly not much has changed as far as the advice. One thing I will say is back then the items were different. Especially where I suggest to get certain items, I only meant them as examples of things you could get to help.\n\nOne thing us experienced players don't realize is that new players can't be effective with optimal builds. New players need extra defense because they make mistakes where they take extra damage. Often new players die so fast they don't have a chance to fight back or even realize what is killing them. Defensive items won't help them win the most games, but they will act like training wheels that allow the new player a buffer before they die, more time to learn how to use their champion.\n\nAs for players who are better, they will know to abandon the training wheels and start building optimal builds, but as I say in the tips, at that point you really don't need tips, do you.... well maybe reminders not to be too greedy chasing. We all need that reminder every once in awhile lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-14T06:26:03.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"on the buying survivability point you might want to change that a bit since thornmail doesn't really help low hp targets like assassins or adcs like a leblanc, zed, ashe, ect..., I don't care if the enemy team has a kogmaw, jax and yi on their team; yes someone should buy a thornmail but not assassins or adcs. They should build items like ga for high risk carry champions, RoA, Rylias, Abyssal and Zhonias for ap mids, melee ad assassins should consider maw, banshees (against heavy cc) or deadmans. Adc's like twitch, ashe, sivir and jinx should consider items like the black cleaver phantom dancer, frozen mallet for kiting adcs without a slow or bloodthirster and caster adcs like ezreal and corki should consider steraks gauge, deaths dance, blood thirster, frozen mallet and black cleaver. Tanks and bruiser toplaners should already be building some tank items for off-tank if not all tank items anyways. Squishy ad melee carry toplaners should consider the ad assassin or adc defensive items too.\nAlso for ad assassins merc treads is kinda standard anyways and ap assassins need sorc boots to do their assassin thing and should get defensive stats from other items.\n\nI'm new and have only been playing for a few months and I'm still garbage tier but that's just my 2cents on build paths; also having some sustain items is almost as good as tankier items on long range champs since you can just poke more, you're harder to get low and so it's harder to all in you, Bloodthirster's high lifesteal and shield make an adc alot harder to assail. \n\nAll you experienced players saying arrogant things like build thornmail on leblanc or adcs should get sunfire cape to stop feeding is annoying me because it doesn't help you improve at all and we eventually want to get to a point where we don't need to always buy tank on our adcs.\n","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-09-14T06:45:27.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great points :) \n\nIts no so much that we want newer players to build thorn mail and sunfire on ADC/assassin champions (I mean, thats just stupid), its that newer/low skill players need to realise that pure damage isn't the only path. So many people I have seen \"stuck in elo hell due to bad teams\" play high damage champions, but fail to build _any_ form of defensive items so get crushed before they have the chance to crush. \n\nIt isn't a matter of building a full tank build on Ashe. It's more of being able to read the team comps, read how the game is going & prioritising items to get some of that defence going a little bit earlier on instead of continuing to rush your damage items and go 0/10 in lane. \nI don't mean full out rushing banshees veil (common when losing), but just buy the cheaper precursor items before heading on in your path to IE. A little survivability goes a long way. If you watch high elo games, its pretty common for ADCs/ assassins to buy one of the cheap defence items (cloth armour, null magic mantle) if they are struggling to cope with the poke. \n\nThe only reason thorn mail is a core item during the tutorial is so that players are able to advance, even if they fluke their way through it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-15T17:57:22.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">play high damage champions, but fail to build any form of defensive items so get crushed before they have the chance to crush.\n\nIf that is there issue, then it's their ability to not outplay their lane opponent more then anything (especially since these people are stuck)\n\nHigh Damage assassin's really don't need the survivability, they just need to know how to do their job to start a winning teamfight.\n\nAnd the issue is that the items you suggested are terrible for the types of high damage champions you are talking about.\n\nAD: Maw, Steraks, Black Cleaver, Scimitar.\nAP: Abyssal, Zhonya's, Rylai's, Liandry's\n\nIt's not about building full defense, it's about knowing what half tank half damage items are actually good.\n\nAnd i will say these lists are shortened because i haven't even played league in 3 days and can't think of all the half tank items, but there are so many.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-14T07:01:01.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I seemed a bit vehement; I hold a bit of a grudge against some people who like to mislead newer players like myself into doing these things just so we don't feed as hard as we normally would.

This build might work on a toplane mundo but as an adc you're next to useless.

One of the hardest things to learn when starting this game is figure out how to position and even then, even if you position properly, you can still be screwed over by an assassin who burst you in 0.5 seconds if you are playing a low health character like an ADC/Mage/Assassin/Support.  \n\nAnother thing I would add is learn to play from behind.  After you die once or twice in lane, you need to stop fighting and focus on just surviving, csing, and getting levels.  I see this constantly in bot lane where my teams ADC is ahead and the enemy bot lane still tries to fight despite us being a full item or two ahead.  Or when the support roams, normally Bard players, or the support DCs and the enemy ADC continues to CS as if they have back up.  If you are at a disadvantage, play that way.  Learn to turtle and just defend.  \n\nI played a one for all as Master Yi vs Cassiopeia one time.  I had never played Yi before and my teammates sent me mid cause they wanted to be with their teammates in the other two lanes despite me asking what to build/buy/max when we loaded into the game.  I spent the first 10ish minutes sitting at my tower, only last hitting the minions if I could do it without taking damage from her or last hitting with alpha strike, and trying to dodge most of her poison.  I was behind on minions compared to her obviously, but I was even with levels.  Only after she blocked me off from my tower with her miasma did I go in to fight her simply because walking over it probably would've killed me anyway with all her damage so I was going to make her work for the kill if she wanted it and I somehow managed to kill her despite her having more items than me.  Saving alpha to dodge her ult was probably the only reason I won the fight, but that was my goal was to just survive long enough till I could fight her.  Had no clue what I was doing the rest of the game but I was at least doing something right from the start.\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2260458254/230464500\n\nIf people played that way, especially when they are behind, then we wouldn't have people being 1/10 15 minutes into a game.\n\nPlaying ARAM is a good way to learn to itemize properly.  Had a game as Ashe with Jinx, Jayce, Varus, and Azir vs Morgana, Braum, Anivia, Maokai, and Soraka.  Their entire team went AP except Braum who went tanky and Soraka who went health regen, so I went {{item:3085}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3072}} eventually selling boots for {{item:3046}} and then changing that to {{item:3071}} when their team started building more tank items.  Azir bought a {{item:3102}} as his last item and Jayce got {{item:3111}} early and bought a {{item:3156}} late into the game.  The rest of our team was straight up damage.  Would I ever build this on Ashe outside of ARAM?  Probably not.  However, against this specific team comp, I felt it was a good decision cause A) we had no tank so I was trying to be the psuedo tank, B) Wit's End gave me MR and eventually the enemy team had 3 thornmails (makes sense with 4 AA-based champs) so I already sorta countered that item, and C) Black Cleaver synergized with my Q and gave me armor shred so the rest of my team did more damage.  Strangest build of my life but my team eventually won after my team realized we had the damage once they blew everything to kill me.\nhttp://matchhistory.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/NA1/2268689456/230464500","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-09-15T05:42:32.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not dying is also a great way to get that elusive S or S+.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-14T06:37:24.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever young up-and-comers used to ask me for general advice I always said the same thing: _play to not lose._ It's a minor shift in mentality but I think it really encapsulates what this post is about.
