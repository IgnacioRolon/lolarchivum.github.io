I am going to give you the insider tips and tricks on not getting pinged for any of these. \n\n**1. Leaver buster\n2. Account security\n3. Playing the game\n4. Communicating with other summoners. **\n\n____\n\n#Leaver buster. \n\n_Leaver buster is an automated system that punishes players for inactivity; either for failing to connect or for leaving at some stage in the game. Due to its competitive environment, it is possible to be punished after just **one** afk in ranked or if you haven&#039;t played many games. In saying this, Riot do know that accidents/emergencies do happen and that hardware and software isn&#039;t 100% reliable, so in other queues you do get a bit of leniency and can leave a game here and there without being punished (given it isn&#039;t a regular occurrence). You can read more about the leaverbuster system including its punishment scheme **[HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)**_\n\n**how to stay leaver buster free**\n\n* Always make sure you have ~ 60 minutes to dedicate to a game. Do not start a game right before you need to go to work or school or do something else important.\n* Don&#039;t be &quot;that guy&quot; that rage quits/ AFKs in fountain/jungle/base.\n* If you are constantly crashing, check out our [support guide](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbPY3Rpr-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here). \n* Be aware of your ping (try a custom) prior to going into game. If you are in a situation where you may lag if someone else uses the internet, be aware of the times that this is likely to happen and stay clear or upgrade your internet. If you are unable to do so, at least stay away from ranked. \n* If your computer is from the dark ages and even with all the support guide fixes is still unreliable af, join a club that does customs, so that way you won&#039;t get punished. Alternatively, scrounge up some money and upgrade. \n\n_____\n\n#Account security\n\n_Everything from boosting to using programmes to get an advantage over others is a bannable offence. Sometimes your account may be comromised and this may happen without your knowledge. Either way, it leads to a pretty harsh ban._\n\n_**How to avoid account security bans**_\n\n* Even if you really want that extra LP to push you to x rank,[ don&#039;t get boosted](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751834-MMR-Elo-Boosting). Boosters often use scripts on accounts because they don&#039;t actually care about you, they care about the money. \n* Do not modify your client in any way. Even using addons for custom skins/ voiceovers is not worth losing your account. No matter how cool they sound (even though Riot does not officially condemn the use of these custom programs, a lot of them may contain something you aren&#039;t aware of. Better to be safe than sorry).\n* Do not account share. Even if its your best buddy/sibling/cousing/parent. Don&#039;t do it. One day you might have a falling out and they may systematically break the summoners code to get you banned just to spite you. \n* [Do not fall for any fake giveaways](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/8GVrAi62-security-reminder-beware-of-scamsphishing-sites). \n\n[In general, verify your account (4 win IP boost yay), regularly change your password + do not have it the same as the email pass. ](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/account-security-education)\nIf your account does get compromised and you need to go through account recovery some good info to have is: name changes, past emails linked to account, refunds, last champ/skin purchased, crafting inventory, **buying and redeeming a physical RP card and keeping the code all to yourself**. \n\n____\n\n#Playing the game\n\n_In league of legends, your actions speak as loud as your words. A lot of the time, these punishments aren&#039;t going to be picked up by the automatic system (especially if the player isn&#039;t typing anything) and need a manual review, hence a delay in punishment. In some cases, it is easy enough to pick up on how one&#039;s actions are negatively impacting a game, in others it can be much more difficult. This is where reports come in, if someone is consistently getting reported for the same thing they will receive a punishment even if what they are doing isn&#039;t as obvious as running it down mid with 6 boots._\n\n**Staying ban free from your actions** \n\n* Don&#039;t int feed. Don&#039;t be that guy. \n* Even if your bot lane doesn&#039;t leash you or your mid can&#039;t land a skillshot to save themselves, you still have to help your team. Abandoning a teammate is essentially abandoning a chance at victory or chance to help someone better themselves.\n* Keep your extreme off meta picks out of ranked, and preferably in 5 man premades. [Picking off meta is fine](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q5), picking off meta and [doing something completely out of the norm when your team wishes you against it](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/79aGu3wR-support-singed-isnt-banable-but-thats-not-the-point) is not. \n\n____\n\n#Communicating with other summoners\n\n_When speaking with strangers or having strangers on your team, your homophobic slurs aren&#039;t just &quot;competitive banter&quot;. You aren&#039;t being &quot;assertive and factual&quot; when you tell your teammates how much they suck and that they should uninstall. You&#039;re just being a &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;._ \n\n**Easiest way to stay toxicity ban free?**\n\nVerbalise your insults instead of typing them. Use your brain. Is it that hard? \n_Riot isn&#039;t going to give you a permanent chat restriction. You are above the age of 13, it is expected that you have a little bit of self control and maybe even a small dose of empathy. Think of it as practice for the real world. If you say some of this stuff IRL, you could easily damage your reputation._\n\n* Situation 1: _You are playing botlane. You and your partner just ended a trade that didn&#039;t go too well. You ended up dying, with your mate living with 200hp and the two enemies both on ~100hp. Despite minions clearly in the enemies favour, you know that if your partner goes balls to the wall, they can get a double kill and end up unscathed.  Your partner decided to back instead. _\n**What you should do** instead of spam pinging them and flaming them in chat, is respect their decision. They know their skill better than you do. Maybe they aren&#039;t confident on that champ, maybe they had cooldowns. Its better for them to back off instead of doing something risky and ending up dead for it. \n\n* Situation 2: _ Your teammate makes a mistake. Maybe they get caught out, maybe they died to an obvious gank, missed a smite, missed a ward in the bush. Either way, you saw it from a mile off and they should have too._\n**What you should do** instead of spam ping missing over their dead/retreating body or missed ward/skillshot/smite is realise that everyone makes mistakes. You aren&#039;t so clean yourself. Chances are that they are aware of the mistake and are pretty embarrassed already and will learn from it. They don&#039;t need you to add to the situation. \n\n* Situation 3: _Your teammate isn&#039;t doing so well. Maybe they have died a lot, can&#039;t hit a skillshot, can&#039;t gank a lane, are really far behind.\n**What you should do** instead of spam pinging them or flaming them in chat /all chat saying &quot;this x lane&quot;, is to be the better player and to evolve your strategy. Could you orchestrate a gank as jungle/support? Could you aid in warding? Could you snowball a lane to speed up laning phase? \n\n* Situation 4: _You&#039;re in a game with someone who is a higher rank than you / you are in a ranked game and the player isn&#039;t doing as well as you expected._\n**What you should do** instead of calling them a boosted animal and asking them who boosted them/where they purchased their account from is to take a second and think. Maybe they aren&#039;t familiar with the champ/role they are playing and are trying to learn but are vs someone who obviously is more knowledgeable about the matchup/ lane dynamic. Maybe they are a 1trick and really struggle when they don&#039;t get their role/champ (so many OTP omg). Maybe they are sick/upset/tilted from &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;s like you in their previous games. Their rank didn&#039;t come from playing like a god 100% of the time, but rather by playing consistently. A few bad games here and there doesn&#039;t negate their rank so keep your salt. If you think you play better than them, then prove it and climb.  \n\n* Situation 5: _You&#039;re in game with a &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;. Maybe they are int feeding, maybe they are picking on you._\n**What you should do** instead of &quot;defending yourself&quot; with an equally toxic slew of garbage from your own imagination, it to go back to basics. Do what you were taught to in kindergarten, mute and step away from the bully, and try to enjoy the game regardless of what is happening + make sure to report them after the game \n\n**other situations**\n\n* [Do not ask for reports on another player](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/EE7d58Pu-dear-riotsome-clarification-please?show=flat&amp;comment=0007). Despite your good intentions, it can be considered bullying/harrasment, especially if you are asking for &quot;int feeder&quot; reports when the player intact just had a bad game. \n* Don&#039;t give up and act like a ball of negativity. Don&#039;t say &quot;GG&quot; after first blood, a fallen objective in the enemies favour, a teammates mistake. Don&#039;t try to open mid unless the rest of your team is in complete agreement. Even though what you are saying isn&#039;t directly comparable to racism/sexism/homophobia and suicide encouragement, you are still creating a negative environment for players and can still get punished for this. \n\n____\n\n##TL;DR?\n\nStaying ban free is easy, just use your brain. \n\n[GL HF summoners &hearts;](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-10T11:29:50.587+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"TLDR: Don't be a d!ck.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-12T06:08:47.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was my original title before I added the account security and leaverbuster info","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-10T11:41:55.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"No it's TLDR: Don't say anything.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-10T08:21:00.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">You are above the age of 13\n\nIncorrect considering the majority of players are little children who easily get mad and strive to be the strongest keyboard warrior in the land.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-09T16:44:59.138+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":">Picking off meta is fine, picking off meta and doing something completely out of the norm when your team wishes you against it is not.\n\nThis sentence doesn't make sense and is the issue with that ban.\n\nNever will your team want you to pick something off meta.\n\nEDIT: I just read the whole thing, and you can't do shit.\n\nYou can't play the champion you like unless you are a meta slave/win every single game.\n\nYou can't play the role you want cause auto fills everywhere.\n\nYou can't ask the enemy team to report an afk, cause that is harassment, and by extension, mentioning the game is a 4v5 is bannable.\n\nIntent feeding is ok as long as your \"trying\" (in other words, don't walk it down mid, get a few CS and die over and over, cause you are a bronzie at heart) and you are immune to anything said to you, because anything said to you is a bannable offense.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-09T21:18:15.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">\"Picking off meta is fine, picking off meta and doing something completely out of the norm when your team wishes you against it is not.\"\n>This sentence doesn't make sense and is the issue with that ban.\n>Never will your team want you to pick something off meta.\n\nOk, so I get what your saying and a big part of this is probably due to me leaving out context as I was pretty sure I was going to hit some kind of word limit. \n\nIn terms of creating a positive gameplay experience, especially in ranked it is expected that you stick to the 1-1-2+ jungle meta. \nIt isn't strict in which champions you should be playing where (e.g Mf sup & Ezreal jungle), but rather how you work in that role. For (completely made up) example, I could queue into your ranked series game as a jungler. I pick Raka jungle, have played it a lot and have a win rate that seems pretty decent. From the champ select, I'm sure a lot of people would be like \"oh hell no\" and accuse me of trolling, telling me to change or straight out dodge. If we did manage to get into game, I could do my first buff with a leash, but then the rest of my clear is pretty bad till I get some levels so I come sit midlane with you to share XP and CS for a couple of minutes. Chances are, you or any player would see this as \"troll\", even if I told you what I was doing before hand and that I was experienced in this. Would this not tilt you? Would you not say this would negatively impact your game?\n\nI didn't say that non-meta picks would get you banned (as someone that plays all of the champs as support I can tell you that I am still ban free after 3 years), just to keep your **extreme** off meta picks (and strategies) out of ranked and preferably in a premade 5 so you can communicate and all agree. \n\n\n>You can't ask the enemy team to report an afk, cause that is harassment, and by extension, mentioning the game is a 4v5 is bannable.\n\nThis is situational, once again I will add context. Leaverbuster will usually pick up on the AFK. In terms of int feeding and toxicity, generally [it should always be a personal decision for each player as to whether or not they feel another player warrants a report.](http://boards.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour-en/EE7d58Pu-dear-riotsome-clarification-please?show=flat&comment=0007) If you feel necessary to ask, at least wait until the end of game screen to ask for a report. Especially if you are trying to fish for reports for a \"feeder\". It's pretty devastating for someones confidence to have one of their teammates constantly berate them and try to /all \"please report x for feed\" if they aren't feeding intentionally. \nOne of my recent games was like this, the enemy toplaner spent more time dissing their adc and fishing for reports rather than actually playing the game. I stood up for the ADC and after the game they added me to thank me, explaining that they were a relatively fresh level 30 and were still getting used to PVP.\n\n> You can't play the role you want cause auto fills everywhere.\n\nThen play support every couple of games and get autofill protected? \nIf you're a mid/top main it was like this even before NCS was introduced. Queue as a premade and get the role you want every single time? \nAsk politely for the role in champ select? \n\n\n>Intent feeding is ok as long as your \"trying\" (in other words, don't walk it down mid, get a few CS and die over and over, cause you are a bronzie at heart)\n\nI think this is where a lot of frustration comes from, especially lower players. \nYes, there is more than 1 type of intentional feeding.\nWe have the classic 'run it down mid buy troll items\" \nWe also have the \"afk farm and split push paying no attention to enemy location and completely ignoring my team\".\n+ probably a couple of other types that I can't think of in my sleep deprived state.\n\nBoth are forms of intent feeding, and both need to be punished. Ofc report players like this. If they don't get picked up by the automated system, the report might just trigger a manual review, from there the reviewer could see a clear pattern in the \"spawn, cs my way up to tower, die to gank, do it all over again\". Intent feeding isn't always clear cut, I agree, but there is a difference between a player doing either of these, and a player thats 0/6 in the first 10 minutes even though they are glued to their tower and simply don't know how to play from this far behind (this is more common than intentional feeders, and while also just as frustrating, it is a good idea to learn the difference and perhaps offer to help them in a custom after the game).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-12-09T16:00:40.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is a very good guide.
