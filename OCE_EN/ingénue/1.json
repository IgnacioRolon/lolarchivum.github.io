Random disconnections are also not unheard of, with my computer showing connection to wifi when there actually isn't, as well as the router randomly deciding not to provide any internet connection at all (these problems also happen to my flatmates who all have different computers of varying ages).  These problems are well known to other vodaphone users (I had the same plan in the city where I spent my summer, as well as having many friends around the country with the same ISP and issues). \r\n\r\nSince my flatmates are pretty lazy, I have decided to take matters into my own hands and find a better internet provider so we can enter ranked ques without the deadly fear of disconnections hanging above us. \r\n\r\n**A little info about my flat:** It is a flat of 8 uni students (6 guys and 2 girls). Internet is heavily used by the guys and one of the girls for online gaming and updating console games. It is also used by everyone to download and stream movies/youtube videos as well as just generally surfing the net (I may add that when we play league we are only playing league and that no-one in the flat is doing anything other than playing league). \r\n\r\nHas anyone got any recommendations for good ISP that would be able to cater to this situation better than vodaphone? Money isn't really and issue because at the moment we can barely even do our uni assignments at home with this internet and we are pretty desperate for a fix. \r\n\r\n***TL;DR** vodaphone sucks ♥♥♥♥ and I need a new ISP for a flat of 8 people (majority gamers). Which NZ ISP would be the best in your opinion?*","replies":[{"poster":"KLofM","date":"2015-10-15T09:51:24.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Spark on their fibre. Apart from one outage earlier in the year (probably due to some farmer accidentally digging out some line or something) I've been enjoying solid 200/20 with about ~35ms ping (aside from two days a few weeks ago where the servers seemed to be laggy).
