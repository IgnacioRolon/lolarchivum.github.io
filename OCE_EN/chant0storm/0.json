Whenever I press a key that then requires me to click the mouse button in order to activate, there's a roughly two second delay during which my clicks do nothing.

We can use that to check your keyboard driver version on HP's website. Then update it if there is an update available or reinstall it if there is not. \n\nFast way to check if it is the issue is try an external keyboard and see if you have the same problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
