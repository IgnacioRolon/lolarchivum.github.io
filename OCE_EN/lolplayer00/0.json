I played ranked flex and won 8 out of 10 games and got into Silver 3. I played more and nearly ranked up to silver 2 with 98 LP. The next day, you guys fixed this crap and let us play another game to decide our rank! I lost a game got into Bronze 4? This is Bull crap! I can&#039;t stand playing league now. It is so crap unlike last season was way more better than this!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T08:30:08.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were S5 0 LP in season 6, so a B4 placement is far from unreasonable. You will almost always be ranked a little lower after placements.\n\nThe original placements were broken and unfair in matchmaking, seeding and ranks all around, hence the need for a fix.

However this last ranking happened after i went  15/6/3 as Gnar and not to brag but completely carrying my team with a 4.6:1 KDA, 58% KP. Maybe a little unfair?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-17T01:39:22.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The match placed you essentially as any other placement would, namely a little lower than your end of season rank. Even people who go 10W/0L in placements at most get placed equal with their end of season rank, never higher. Most people in fact drop at least two divs.\n\nDoes it suck that you got dropped? Yes. But the B3 placement was erroneous from a B5 ending rank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
