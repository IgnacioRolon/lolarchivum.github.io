Basically to get an S+ you have to be in the top x% of Tryndamere scores on OCE, S is y% and S- is z% where y is slightly bigger then x and z slightly bigger than y. There was a 2% stat thrown around at one point but I can no longer find it, nor can I remember if that 2% was for all S or only S+.\n\nIt doesn't matter how impressive the score. If there are enough scores better you won't get that elusive S+. Remember that these scores are something to strive for, they aren't meant to be easy. While it is immensely frustrating to just miss the S you need for a token (especially if the difference is seemingly one dumb death), you have to try and just take it as motivation to do better next time.\n\nI had only one mastery 7 champion for the longest time, but now I have 4, with one more token for 5. Once I stopped focusing on getting that S, and started just focusing on improving my weak points and playing better, the S ranks came on their own.\n\nThis is a reward system remember, don't let it create a negative experience for you, even an S- is an impressive rank to achieve and you should be proud all the same.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-03-17T05:09:30.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was your CS/min in that game?","replies":[]}]}
