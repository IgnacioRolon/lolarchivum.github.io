Will an alternate just be unable to login?\n\nI am not aware of any rules or conditions about using an alternate account to sign up for the Alpha, otherwise, you should be able to login to the Alpha client with the alternate account as long as it is approved.\n\nThe Alpha client can be downloaded by anyone, but it can only be logged in with accounts that are approved for the testing.\n\nYour alternate account must still meet the requirements to be able to sign up. FAQ [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/faq).\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Spooning U,realm=OCE,application-id=PpTM71nT,discussion-id=d7IQ3AmP,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-28T05:05:16.672+0000)\n>\n> Hi, most of my friends are in a much lower league than me...

Right now, you will have to use the Legacy client to access the Shop, Hextech inventory, or play Ranked and RGMs.\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mosguinz","date":"2016-07-30T03:57:16.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as your 'alternate account' has been approved for the Alpha Client testing, you should be able to login with that account in the Alpha Client.\n\nIf you haven't signed up for the Alpha Client yet, apply [here](https://account.leagueoflegends.com/oce/en/alpha).\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
