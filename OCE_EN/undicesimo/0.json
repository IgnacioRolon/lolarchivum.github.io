(ONLY OCE SERVER, not clickbait, not fake)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**GIVEAWAY IS CLOSED!**\n----------------------------\nAlright, STORY TIME! I know $10 is not a very huge value to some of you, but my ~~genius~~ friend recently came back from Australia and bought me $10 RP card and gave it to me as a birthday gift.... Straight to the point, WE PLAY ON NA SERVER. And the RP card is only redeemable for OCE server. You guys should get it, none of me or my friends could benefit from this RP card. \n\n**CONDITIONS!!!**\nHere&#039;s the thing though, I want YOU, whoever wants this thing, to make ~100 words (50 words minimum) paragraph (on the comment below!) expressing how dramatically desperate you desire this code. **THE FUNNIER AND _DANKER_ THE BETTER. ** Include gifs and/or memes for +style points.\n\nI will not read any additional comments beyond 24 hours after I posted this thread. When I decide a winner (depends on how many comments i received within this time window, sorry if it took a little longer), I will reply my twitter username to your comment (informing that you&#039;re the winner, duh.) and then you will have to STATE your twitter name and proceed to MESSAGE (personally) me, then I can give you the code. (if you dont have a twitter, make one. FOR THE RP!) \n\noh, also, if you don't respond to my comment within another 24 hours, I'll pick another winner.\n\nAdditional info : the time this thread is posted is 6:00 PM (UTC+7), 17 April 2017.\nGood luck!\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nUPDATE : Wow, the replies I got are fewer than I expected. But promises are promises, winner is decided! Congratulations to DobbyIsFree! \n\nGIVEAWAY IS CLOSED","replies":[{"poster":"DobbyIsFree","date":"2017-04-18T03:21:35.697+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I need this RP because I'm a {{champion:17}} main and I need Cottontail {{champion:17}} be cute asf while I simultaneously tilt the entire enemy team.
