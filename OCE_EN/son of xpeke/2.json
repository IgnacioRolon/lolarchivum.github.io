So yesterday during a game loading screen my AVG randomly pops up and says it found a virus in one of the riot folders (although I don't think it was actually a file from your sources don't worry) and it wouldn't allow me to minimize the window, alt + tab or even open task manager from the ctrl + alt + del page.. Only thing it would allow me to do was click a 'restart my pc' kinda option on the AVG detection window. So as you do, I did that... Then when I tried to join back into my game, I couldn't open league after clicking launch on the patcher... I ended up having to completely redownload it cause nothing else was working, spent like an hour trying everything else first, read like 20 forum pages and nothing helped...  Now its finally working now but I've been placed in the lower priority queue (the 10 minute one) because of the 'AFK'.. Clearly you can see that I did not just 'AFK' the game, so it would be highly appreciated if you could remove this lower priority BC from my account please :)","replies":[]}
