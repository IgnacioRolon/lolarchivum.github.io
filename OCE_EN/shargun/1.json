Don&#039;t get me wrong. Riot&#039;s work in the eSports and gaming community are unparalleled and highly commendable but you don&#039;t need a whole world or a historical log for that. If you&#039;re going to tease me with all of these things plus stunning artworks and maps, why take them away? Maybe you should create an entirely different game for the people who don&#039;t have time for the competitive scene of League. It sounds stupid, but back when I started (and nowdays) I want to walk through Summoner&#039;s Rift as Jax (he was my first champion and one of my favourites), talking to NPCs, helping the community and being a real hero in that sense. The Lore of the game was very big, but weak. The role of the League of Legends REALLY felt more as a means for the game rather than an organic part of Runeterra. I wanted to have my favourite character Jax explore the wild, untamed forests and meadows of the land, defeating weak soldiers of the rival factions and helping out those loyal to Ionia. I wanted him to discover treasures untold in lost pyramids, all whilst fighting the powerful guardians like the mummy lord cursed into despair, who fights with a mourn so strong it weakens anyone in his presence. I wanted to run along the rooftops of Zaun, finding the right building and sneak in. I would find the mad scientist dabbling over a captured innocent, bumbling so loudly he couldn&#039;t hear me approach as I ended his maniacal spree of experimentation. It doesn&#039;t actually have to be its own fully fledged game like this, but I just want something where I can enjoy League for what it is without having to fully commit 40 minutes at a time at risk of banning to an intense mental endeavour.\n\nAs much as I would like an &quot;RPG&quot; of sorts, I know that such a task would be monumental so I am more interested in the middle ground (unless the idea of a League RPG gets you as excited as I am). Even just some more maps to see that world (although it&#039;s a bit ironic to ask for that on the day they announce The Crystal Scar is being removed). Thoughts?","replies":[]}
