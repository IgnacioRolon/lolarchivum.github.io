{"poster":"Shargun","date":"2015-02-04T06:27:54.630+0000","title":"Critical Hit Chance Discussion","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hi I'm Shargun and I just want to start some critical (haha) discussion about critical hits/crit chance:\r\n\r\nThe basics:\r\nA critical hit is one of the oldest tropes in combat gaming history. It is when (often by matter of chance) that occasionally, an extraordinary outcome occurs: Such as a rookie hitting his target square in the forehead for the first time ever. The purpose of critical hits is to create variety in the computed algorithms of combat of a game, so essentially to create a haphazard experience (in a good way). In League of Legends, a basic attack has a percentage chance to score a critical hit (dealing double damage, 2.5X with an infinity edge), with the percentage calculated by factors including runes, masteries and items.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy it needs discussion:\r\nLeague of Legends is arguably the most successful eSport in history, with viewing force and prize pools surpassing even major League sport equivalents. Absolute training and teamwork go into winning games of League of Legends so we face a roadblock. The game has no elements of luck (excluding maybe some baron/dragon combos) except for critical hits. Abilities can't go haywire dealing 200% damage though. Critical hits don't provide a large room for counterplay apart from the standard tactics against high attack damage champions. For example: Draven is running away from a vayne. Vayne flashses to secure some basic attacks to finish him off. They're both level 3 so draven's 200 health would enable him to survive ~2-3 basic attacks. With that in mind, draven uses blood rush, rather than flash to get away because he knows he can handle the first basic attack. Suddenly, the gods are in vayne's favour and she scores a lucky crit from her one mark she put in her rune page. Draven is wiped out immediately. Unless draven were to use his 5 minute cooldown summoner spells for safety against an event with a 1% chance of occurrence (which some players might, I'm not a god of League), then the critical hit ensures a very easy kill when hit.\r\n\r\nCritical hits provide random spikes of power in a game where methodical analysis of scenarios in an instant are paramount to success. Critical hits put a spanner in the works and, what's most important that I haven't yet mentioned, remove the \"pure skill\" epithet of League of Legends. That is to say, fights can be won (which, in the greatest circumstance, leads to $1,000,000) by a bit of luck (items affect the probability but the luck is still there when you're not playing yasuo mid). With such high prize pools and fame, to have an element of luck presents itself as a flaw to the appreciation of a professional player's skill.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to tackle the issue:\r\nRiot can't remove critical hit chance with a magic wand and League will carry on as if nothing changed. There are a number of difficulties in removing it:\r\n- The total removal of critical hit chance does a staggering blow to the strength of attack damage champions\r\n- The removal of critical hit chance removes value from a number of items that have a cost that depends on critical hit chance\r\n- Infinity edge will become a glorified BF sword\r\n- Critical hits have become a widely accepted and adored feature of League of Legends\r\n\r\nThere are a number of approaches, all ranging in quality and effectiveness. I will present a few, with my \"rating\" of them out of 10:\r\n\r\n1: Leave the system as it is. Shargun is a madman:\r\nWhilst this option provides a safe bet for balance administration, doesn't affect the competitive scene too strongly and is the easiest of the approaches to enact, there are a number of negatives I have already mentioned. 3/10\r\n\r\n2: Remove critical hit chance and buff attack damage champions and the appropriate items:\r\nThis has a number of problems in it, such as attack damage champions gaining a buff early game for a stat that they initially mightn't have had at all for the first 10 minutes. Even a scaling buff has its own issues. The extra strength of critical hits becomes a raw number increase making carries very strong against ability power champions and, much more dangerously, to structures. \r\nWith careful reallocating of strengths, this has the possibility of working. 5/10\r\n\r\n3: Critical hit percentage chance becomes an inverted fraction of the number of attacks before the next one deals the critical damage:\r\nTo explain the maths behind this, with a 1% crit chance, like ashe's passive, after a certain course of action, I will know when my next critical hit is. With 1% critical hit rate, I would have to give 100 basic attacks before I get the assurance that the next hit will be critical. With a 66% critical hit chance, every two attacks would critically hit but then a third wouldn't.  This has a more creative way of transferring the strength of critical hits and it doesn't result in patching of such a serious extent. Whilst an attack damage carry would score approximately the same number of critical hits with this formula compared to the current system, the fact that one can know when every critical hit will come means that these champions will probably become stronger and a nerf will be needed. \r\nWith a balanced form of this, organised countrplay over the fact that you have a critical hit can come about, thickening the tactics of League of Legends. 7/10\r\n\r\n4: Turn critical hits into power attacks:\r\nThis is probably the most innovative one yet and what looks to be the safest for balance. Simply put, rather than scoring a critical hit, you can make power attacks for the 200% damage instead. By holding down the right click button on a target (or by holding what could be a \"power attack\" button on the keyboard or something fluid that anyone can think of), you charge up a power attack that immobilises you but is only stopped by \"hard\" crowd control (stuns, knockups, knockbacks etc.). In order for this to work smoothly with itemisation, critical hit chance as an item feature would be replaced with a charge speed feature, which decreases the speed at which a power attack needs to be charged. With 0% charge time, the function takes 200-250% (I haven't thought strongly of balance yet) of the time needed to make a basic attack in order for a character to make a power attack. At 100% power charge, the charge time is so fast it is as fast as a regular basic attack (replacing basic attacks). For an easy balance touch, power attacks would NOT work against structures, or the numbers would be tweaked so that for all levels of power charge, 'normal', or 'quick' attacks would be more efficient against structures. \r\nThis could work because it removes the controlled strength of an immediate boost in damage at the whims of the player unless properly itemised whilst removing the randomness of critical hits like they are at the moment. Crowd control is a big discussion point for introducing this, and it would require a LARGE amount of work retexturing and redesigning champions to include the charge effects. I can't find any more large faults of this scheme so the only real issue is the workload. 8.5/10\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThanks for reading all the way down to here, please comment how you feel about the topic and feel free to add possible approaches and evaluate any approaches up here. If a unanimous decision is made for a particular one, its score will increase and if someone makes a compelling argument against any of the posted approaches I will consider it and likely, the score will go down. Feedback is critical (dammit I said it again) for making positive change here.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Critical hit chance shouldn't be random. Replace it with buffs, countable critical hits (something like an ashe passive) or something like a slower, power attack.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-04T07:23:10.019+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another one of these threads, crit chance is fine as is and requires no change whatsoever, stop complaining, you brought no valid points whatsoever all you did was cry \"WAAA WAAA WAAA HE CRIT ME :(\", crit chance has been the same since release and its not going to change in this game nor will it change in the thousands of other games that have crit chance.\n\nAll you have done here was delete several champs from the game and made the game stale and boring with everything you have mentioned, crit chance is not a problem whatsoever, these useless threads from silver players crying about being critted need to stop.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-04T07:22:01.057+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot won't do anything about it as we already have 2 champions who are based of crits Yasuo and Tryndamere this would mean they would have to remake them before they removed crit","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-02-04T11:16:41.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the thing with crit is that you are sacrificing other stats for a stat that does nothing until it activates.\n\nI've lost easy lanes with crit plank because against all the odds I NEVER got a crit when I would have liked one.
