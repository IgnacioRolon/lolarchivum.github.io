Placements aren't static for every player, meaning that even if you won ten out of ten games, you're not going to be instantly put into challenger tier. Inversely, losing all of you placement games won't mean you're going to bronze tier.\n\nYour placement matches pit you against opponents that are based off of your MMR you accumulated while playing normal games. If you don't know what that is, I'll happily explain it for you.\n\nWinning seven out of ten placements is almost the usual for what most players get. Don't be disheartened by it, it just means you'll have more game time in getting to the top!\n\nBest of luck in your ranked games!","replies":[]}]}
