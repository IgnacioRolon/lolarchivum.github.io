Anyway, I was diamond in season 3. I am pretty shit now, but I do okay. I play Fiddle only. Me and my mate (who plays support) are looking for a mature ADC. My mate is Gold 2 , I am silver 5. Basically looking for somebody who plays ADC every game where possible. \r\nHit me up in lolking or add me in game &#039;hi im danny&#039;. \r\nWe play around 2 games a night - we play seriously, but we dont rage, and we dont grind game after game like others. \r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"MainAtVayne","date":"2016-07-25T05:32:06.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i main adc, add me ign mainatvayne \nxox","replies":[]}]}
