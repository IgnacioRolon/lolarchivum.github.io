They didn&#039;t mind at all and would even encourage me when I got back the game was still ongoing, I quickly levelled and turned the 2v5 around. After the game, the client informed me of a new leave bust for 20 minutes 5 times. The game was an intermediate bot game and my team didn&#039;t even mind me leaving, I never upset anyone and we still won the game. I&#039;m paranoid from the fact that I got 5 leaver buster from an intermediate bot game! I&#039;m suggesting that riot should add a function that allows teammates to choose whether or not they get to leave the game without penalty, more players would be satisfied that they aren&#039;t wasting more time than they should. I believe a team should decide whether or not the player gets the punishment, not the system, after all, it doesn&#039;t know the entire situation.","replies":[{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2017-10-04T11:12:34.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you are asking too much\nAdding a specific thing in a game requires a lot of programming work. \nThis is how the game works in general, you leave the game, you get punished \nIn general, in normal and ranked game, leaving a game will definitely make people frustrating\nYour idea only works when you are playing with your friends, how about soloQ-ers? I think they would \"vote to punish\" surely if someone leaves the game in the middle","replies":[{"poster":"3Bies","date":"2017-10-04T20:01:27.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they can at least put it on premade, it would help a lot of people who need to urgently go say hospital.","replies":[]}]}]}
