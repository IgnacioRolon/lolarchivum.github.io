I have recieved multiple error dialogue boxes and it continued to pester me from trying to use the client to find the issue. I restarted my laptop and when I opened the client, after giving a dialogue box about how it is attempting to repair my files I logged into the client to find a box telling me that I have 5 leaverbusters. I had a few games before the bugsplat where real life called for me, but to give me leaverbusters because of a bug from the client?\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll link photos below for proof of bugsplat and leaverbust notice. \r\nhttps://imgur.com/cTt0zL4\r\nhttps://imgur.com/YfCU6ay","replies":[{"poster":"Aneirin","date":"2019-02-06T00:33:56.146+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game is broken at the moment; 3 ranked games, someone not able to connect in each one.
