Of all his spells E has to be the most feared by players, or at least it was, now there is so much delay after a warning circle that I barely use it any more (the warning circle is the worst part), Veigar has pretty much become a 2 skill champ (Q & R), which is a real shame because he used to be so much fun to play. I hope the devs can reinstate some of that \"oh crap, I've been hit by event horizon!!\" feeling to Veigar.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on the recent few patches for Veigar?","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-18T11:14:25.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay his q is now better you can get 2 ap per q so basically you got 70 at 10 mins now you get 100+ his e yes is harder to land but it is still as potent in teamfights with the new buff to stoping dashes this means if you can lock ahri inside just as she ults shes likely to get stunned his w is more for teamfights now as well or zoning","replies":[]}]}
