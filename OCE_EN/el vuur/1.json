To stop uncalled for boots, have the voted champ enter a capture code to stay in the game.\n\nIf you need some help in detecting them:\n1. Bots don't have masteries\n2. Bots play ARAM\n3. Bots will instantly buy items and run to the outer turret\n4. Bots will have a very high death count\n\nPlayed several games over the last week with bots, one ARAM game was basically a 2v2 game as there were 3 bots on each team. At least it was more even that way lol. I remember last time I posted about this I played a 1 v 5 ARAM game, I think it would be more fun playing the practice tool...\n\nTime to start taking this seriously Riot, please.","replies":[{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-09-07T01:07:02.361+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"What pisses me off even more is Riot won't even reply to threads like these letting the players know that they are even aware of the issue and are doing something to fix it.\n\nI say compensation for time lost, I wouldn't care if it was one game in one hundred that had a bot but it is every fucking game, so Riot FIX YOUR SHIT!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ordranis","date":"2017-09-05T04:12:32.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are bots that have masteries and don't automatically leave the fountain.

Some of the bot programs will sit there for 30-40 seconds then buy a renewable potion, an oracles elixir and I think it's boots.  They'll also run through the healths on the way to \"the fight\" from the base even though they just spawned on full health.  Aside from that their combat-bot is about the same.","replies":[{"poster":"El Vuur","date":"2018-04-16T13:08:49.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This has become more and more true the last few months.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gdox","date":"2017-09-14T03:12:31.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't fret I am sure Riot is dishing them out chat restrictions lol\n\nYour right though they are becoming a hazard, the number of games without a Bot is now uncommon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-09-03T12:09:55.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot won't do anything, to be honest I have a feeling they have no idea how to even fix the problem it's been going on for years and don't even care as long as people are silly enough to keep spending money.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T03:12:00.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bots don't swear\nso riot don't care\n\nThey also artificially inflate population statistics whis is good for riot who are shedding players at an alarming rate.","replies":[]}]}
