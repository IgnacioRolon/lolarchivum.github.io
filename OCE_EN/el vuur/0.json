It's coming up *every* time I log in. Actually, the only time I don't see it is if someone has left me a positive game vote in the game after I've already quit lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xFaker","date":"2015-07-09T05:48:06.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Press Alt F4","replies":[]}]}
