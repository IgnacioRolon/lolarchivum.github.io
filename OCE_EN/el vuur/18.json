There's no \"AR\" in that. There was nothing better than maining support (yes, it is a thing, and yes, I'm sure there are many better things lol), and then playing Sona in URF in bot lane and make you and your ADC near invincible. This round of AR+URF I don't think I've even played Sona once? I really enjoy ARAM for the AR part, but that's because it's an \"all mid\" game and the whole game goes for 10 - 20 mins. Being able to play my favourite champs, on cooldown steroids, that's fun. Playing a free rotation champ, or champ I bought and regret buying, and winging it for 25 mins, not so much fun.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that AR can make the game completely unbalanced, to the point where a game can be over in under 8 mins. That's not fun, for either side. Being able to choose champs will allow ppl to pick OP unbalanced URF champs, but will also afford the opposing team the same capacity, or to pick champs that can counter the OP champs.\r\n\r\nFinally, as this is long enough as it is, URF is still a bunch of fun, I'm still playing it a lot, thanks RIOT for making this broken mode. And while it feels not so great as it was when it was just URF, it's still a blast.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-27T22:42:00.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what I miss is playing meme urf picks. Sure Poppy might not be Kassadin or Fizz or Zed levels of Urf awesomeness, but there is nothing more funny to me than picking lethality(?) poppy screaming RAMROD!, engaging predator boots, ghost, w, righteous glory, shurelias, ghostblade, and just running into a fight at 1100ms to slam someone into a wall with very limited counterplay, kill them hopefully if they aren't too tanky, and then proceed to flash out and try to run away.\n\nProtip: don't stand near walls when splitpushing if the enemy team has a lethality/movespeed poppy.","replies":[]}]}
