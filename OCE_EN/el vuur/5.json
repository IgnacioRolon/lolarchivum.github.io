Disabling rerolls as well.\r\n\r\nVery frustrating getting a great champ and a good team line up, then having someone rage quit and ending up with a champ you&#039;re not good at in the subsequent random champion select.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-02T05:03:29.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was having a conversation about this with someone recently, we couldn't see eye to eye either.\nI know it's sad that you missed on a champion you liked because someone dodged, but at the same time, they weren't forced into playing a champion they hate? See, to me that sounds like it's all balanced out, the issue is done and you get to queue up again.\n\nYet I see quite a few people on here, talking about how dodgers should be punished harder. To what end? so people are so afraid of what RIot might do to them that they will play a champion they hate, even if it means having a miserable game?\n\nYes, ARAM stands for All Random All Mid, but can you really be expected to be willing to play all 140~ champs?\n\nEveryone has a playstyle, so logically there are champions that each person will perform poorly on, and with how toxic our community is, can you really blame someone for not wanting to play a champion they can't perform well on?\n\nThey'll just be flamed by their own team all game, been there before.\n\nYou can't force people to play a game they don't want to, it's as simple as that and there really is no grey area.\n\nTl;DR: Check your privilege.

There is actually a higher dodge penalty in aram to deter dodging, starting at 15 minutes (which is essentially the length of an aram game anyway). I understand that it's frustrating to lose a good team comp though.","replies":[]}]}
