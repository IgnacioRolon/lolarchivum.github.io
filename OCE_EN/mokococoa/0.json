It was a whole mess but the details really aren&#039;t important. I just recently came back and my friend list was cleared. I don&#039;t remember the user names of most of the people I used to play with to re add them, except for one. He is a friend of mine irl. I got his username to add him, and when I did I got a message saying he was on my blocked list or something like that, but then let me send the request anyway. Which makes me think that whoever hacked my account is the one who did the blocking.\r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to see a list of the people you have blocked? I would like to go through it and unblock anyone who shouldn&#039;t be on there, but cant seem to find where to do it.\r\n\r\nAlso, unlrelated but arguably more important, who is the wise guy that decided that Zac needs permabanned now? I wanna bounce! No one cared about him when I left last year. Maybe I just cant get the practice in with the new kit, but I think he was more dangerous before the rework\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-06-14T07:17:29.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nYeap, there is a way to see everyone on your blocked list.
