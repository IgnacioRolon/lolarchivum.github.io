Please help!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, \r\nI have recently been playing Cassiopeia and i am experiencing a bug with her e. It seems every time i cast twin fang when my character is stationary, it directs me and moves me towards the enemy fountain. It doesn&#039;t matter where i am on the map, it will always move me towards the enemy fountain ONLY if my character is still, if i am moving around it will cast the ability normally, how it should. I don&#039;t know if this is something on my end, or some setting i am not aware with. I haven&#039;t seen any other players report this so I&#039;m assuming its not a bug, but please give me any tips or anything you could recommend so  i can play cassio without the frustration of movement control loss. \r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-05T14:09:22.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat sounds really odd.\nTo rule out any possible corruption with any game assets could you please [run a client repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"SonofSea","date":"2016-11-11T10:45:31.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!\nOK, so I did a client repair, loaded into a custom game and it still appears to direct me towards the enemy fountain upon casting the twin fang, no other ability, no other champion, only with Cassio's e.
