Here's Riot's official post about this [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/Mc1nPqMw-new-champion-select-coming-to-ranked-soon).\n\nAnd just to confirm, 72 hours is not completely correct. The official post by Sephyre said:\n\n> Champ select will be live on NA and TR for Ranked for a 72-hour testing cycle beginning on the 14th. If that goes well it will then be rolled **_one_** at a time to the other regions including OCE.\n\nSince they did say one at a time, it could mean we wont get it for 1 - 3 days after that 72 hour period. \n\n(You wont find the exact reply I quoted above BTW, because there's been a glitch and it's missing now. I know it existed though, because I was the one Sephyre was replying to.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beanreaper","date":"2016-01-17T09:00:57.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read 72 hours somewhere (from initial launch).
