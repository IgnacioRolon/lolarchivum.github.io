The system gave you one last shot at reforming, and TBH you blew it.\n\n You went out there and got into arguments with people. You told people to \"fuck off\", insulted Lux for feeding, sarcastically insulted Darius, insulted Jax, and blamed GP for trolling.\n\nThe good news is though, if you choose to make a new account, I think you could reform very easily. You mostly got banned here for getting into fights with the enemy team. \n\nIf you just turn of /all chat in settings, I think you'd be a decent positive/neutral player :D","replies":[{"poster":"WhenYouPulverise","date":"2017-01-22T04:36:12.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"When Lux killed me, she danced in front of tower.

I told him this almost word for word \"Hey, can you play someone with a knockup?\" He said sure. Then switched to GP. The sarcastic insult on Darius wasn't to the Darius as a player. It was to the champion.

I imagine what he said wasn't great either. But you're responsible for your own actions, which in this case were very rude and passive-aggressive.

Trolls are generally defined by the fact that they're working in direct opposition of their team, meaning that picking a champion into a position that your team doesn't agree on can be considered trolling, you know, since this is a *team* game. You might not have considered Yasuo a \"troll pick\", but that doesn't mean your team(s) felt the same way.\n\nThat said, there is a *lot* of passive-aggressive chat in this, which *is* reportable under the category of \"Negative Attitude\" (specifically \"Griefing\"). Not only that, but there are also a few \"targeted\" comments (reportable under the category of \"Verbal Abuse\") that would result in some form of punishment. Then you consider that you had stated at one point (several times over) \"I'm done\", which is reportable under \"Negative Attitude\" (specifically, \"Giving Up\").\n\nWhen push comes to shove, you can claim to be reformed but the only way to know for sure is by your behaviour, and it certainly seems you aren't reformed.","replies":[{"poster":"WhenYouPulverise","date":"2017-01-22T04:29:56.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The \"I'm done\" was a joke in response to Vayne killing me.

The only person who had a problem with Yasuo ADC was the Ziggs. I actually carried that game as Yasuo ADC in a 2v1 lane. And I didn't say I was reformed.

It can take friendly banter etc out of context and hand out bans.\n\nIt's times like this were people who appear to be somewhat passive aggressive (considering we don't know or have access to the full chat history) that the system should just hand out either a permanent chat ban or a lengthy one. Maybe a full season chat ban and a permanent one own the track if you don't reform? I agree with permanent bans for those being racist etc, but logs like this are hardly game breaking and deserve this kind of punishment.\n\nIMO permanent bans should be reserved for those who intent feed, boost, script, continually troll (5 boot build etc), racist or are verbally abusive (I'm talking about the REALLY toxic people). If people have negative attitudes but still try game in game out then a season chat ban or perma chat ban would suffice.\n\nBut then again Riot would be missing out on skin sales from those who they perma banned and created new accounts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2017-01-22T03:51:11.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Are you really that dumb? of course you deserved to be banned!\nyou didnt use racism or any harsh form of aggression, riot supports toxic players, in all my time playing league, ive seen intentional feeders/racists/peados get no penalties which is basically the same as supporting them from riot, the problem is that you dont fill their community, friendly players dont fit in here, you have to be toxic to not be penalised, you dun goofed ma boy","replies":[{"poster":"WhenYouPulverise","date":"2017-01-22T03:53:27.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're right.
