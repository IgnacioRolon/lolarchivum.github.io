FARMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMING. 1 shot adc and win cause uve got the adc doing serious dmg plus urself who has been farming. morde has almost never had any love. hardly anyone plays him and it would be a shame if he were to be placed in the never play again bin. morde is a walking suit of armor which may give u the impression of a tank, but he was designed to be BURST. a burst mage unlike any other that had a unique ultimate to copy an enemy. a unique ability to shield minions. this is the morde i missed. him being able to activate his ult by himself and not need an assassin to do it for him.\r\n\r\nmeanwhile on the other hand while morde is being destroyed, champs like lee are being left as is. for all the lee players out there im sorry. he has so much dmg for a fighter/assassin/tank. he can build anything and still do dmg. yes they did remove the attack speed reduction off w, but cmon seriously, an ultimate that is single target, can hit enemies for the same dmg while also being a catalyst for yasuo. cmon riot stop focussing on destroying champs that already need buffs and then just completely destroying him into oblivion and focus on champs that need a nerf or buff more than morde. focus on riven, lee, j4 ( yes i know about the patch notes), this is just my thoughts so criticism is welcome idm.","replies":[]}
