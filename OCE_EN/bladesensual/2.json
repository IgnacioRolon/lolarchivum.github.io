Her ganks are also quite good but only once shes 6+ and shes deadly once she ganks with a red buff.\nBut back to what Niji said, she is really underrated and underplayed. But you can take this to your advantage because underplayed champs dont really get nerfed/reworked/banned. Spam her in ranked! ^-^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Reijimashin","date":"2015-04-12T06:35:06.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play Diana quite a lot in mid.
