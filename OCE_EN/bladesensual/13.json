The enemy team will have the same pool of champions as your team so it is not unfair (Just like the Blood Moon Gamemode), and make all champions unlocked the prevent URF only accounts and truly make it all random, but it gives the player the freedom to choose what they want to play. I believe this would prevent alot of backlash from the community that ARURF receives because if the other team gets &quot;all OP champs, while i get bad champs&quot;, then you can also choose those &quot;OP champs&quot;.\nTo make it even more interesting, why not ask the community what the worst champions on urf are and have a select list of only &quot;terrible tier champions&quot; where both teams would get bad champs and you see the madness unfold as you awkwardly try to play the gamemode against equally unsuitable champions in URF. i would personally laugh so hard seeing champions like {{champion:77}}  and {{champion:48}}  play this, but that is just my opinion, and may not be yours.\nor even better why not buff every champion to be just as OP as un-nerfed URF hecarim, and remove all restraints so you can see the true power of champions, probably not, but alas\nAnyway, to those that are or have read this, i hope you all enjoy URF/ARURF while it&#039;s still up\n-BladeSensual","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-02-27T13:28:58.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't like ARURF, simply don't play the game mode.
