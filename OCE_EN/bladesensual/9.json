JUST 1. then maybe i could find something to look forward to instead of the meatheads that will feed and troll like always.\r\nupvote and downvote me. idc. i just find it so hard to believe that people can actually get away with this crap and believe me they do. only person that reports them for intentionally feeding or not communicating is me. and 1 report goes NOWHERE.\r\nFIX THIS CRAP SYSTEM U HAVE FOR MATCHMAKING. I DONT WANT FIRST TIME RANKED PEOPLE AND I WANT PEOPLE THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR TEAM","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-28T12:38:48.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL Bro calm down lel","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-04-28T10:50:16.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and again another person complaining that their team is holding them down instead of trying to improve upon their own play, classic, and 100c cs by 20 minutes is normal for bronze games.","replies":[{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-04-29T05:41:48.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wumachine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=RqMAvTId,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-28T10:50:16.243+0000)\n>\n> and again another person complaining that their team is holding them down instead of trying to improve upon their own play, classic, and 100c cs by 20 minutes is normal for bronze games.\n\nThis. \nWhat people fail to understand is that everyone is in the same boat, we all get the trolls, the AFK's, the feeders and the bads.
