WTF. this is completely crap. i was vs sion top and when he ulted, he missed me and then turned from behind and hit me. he ran through the lane i was standing next 2 river, he ran at turret TURNED and ran back at me. this is absolutely ridiculous. my team didnt believe me until they saw it for themselves. sion went down mid lane and managed to make a right hand turn in his ult and hit 3 people on my team. i am so fed up wqith this kind of nonsense. if u dont believe me, look at my match replay and go to when sion reaches 6. this is absolutely disgraceful!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T09:43:51.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">sion being able 2 turn 100 degree angles instantly.\n\nOut of context that sentences states something that's already entirely possible within the game's rules.\n\nBut yes, there are ways to exploit his pathing while ulting via the use of particular items and commands.
