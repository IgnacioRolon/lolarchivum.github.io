They are two completely different things (one is streaming video while the other is updating your position/action). It *is* a possibility that your internet is just slow.

That's not the problem.\n\nDo you have any other applications open while playing League (eg. Internet Explorer, Safari, iTunes, Steam, Windows Media Player, Skype)?

That may have been causing your lag in the first place, a certain corrupt file, but if that doesn't fix it, try the following:\n\n[Refreshing your IP address.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq9) If that doesn't work, see what happens if you [change your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4) (you'll need to flush your IP once again after doing this).\n\nYou didn't mention your OS, so I'm presuming you're on Windows.\n\nYou might also want to open up a support ticket if this doesn't fix it.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
