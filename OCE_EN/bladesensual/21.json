AP {{champion:11}} , summoner spell dodge and rage (i think it was rage). old maps like the winter summoners rift. old {{champion:14}} , and {{champion:28}} . DFG. this would be the gamemode i would like to see and i think it could really play out well. sure a few champs were OP, but seriously what champion wasnt. make the new gamemode bring out the strongest in each champion (when their stats and ratios were the highest). what could be even better if you could have the old version of the champion like ap yi, on the same team as someone like the ad yi we see every so often\r\nthese are just my thoughts so feel free to leave a comment and say what could b improved to make this a gamemode that could happen","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-07T09:08:01.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea but think about the size of that patch.
