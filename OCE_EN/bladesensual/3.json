I tried a bit of it back on the NA servers in seasons 2-3 but gave it up as a waste of time and was perfectly happy just playing draft normals- all the gameplay depth, half the stress.\n\nThen I transferred out to the OCE server, as we all did, only for Riot to pull Draft Normals out from under us for *particularly* moronic reasons a few months later, leaving ranked as the ONLY non-shit mode left in the game (blind pick is for scrubs). I've never forgiven them and, unless they reinstate it, I never will.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-30T06:52:01.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to yoloq","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-30T06:46:34.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow man, that sucks.\nYeah ive been having \"Smurfs\" alot in my games too.\n\nIts just a bad streak, you probably went on Tilt.\nRest up, and give it a go later.\n^ I havent been playing ranked today because I noticed I was going on Tilt and decided not to play.\n\nYou can only go up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-03-30T06:40:16.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No use saying wtf riot its not their fault plus theres nothing they can do about player behaviour unless you report them","replies":[]}]}
