Now I have done many botlanes with terrible supports and carried them to victory and such. An ADC can be 0/4 but if they have 200 CS (which most supports don't help with) they can still carry.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-05-25T02:00:42.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you dense? Vayne and Quinn top lane work well because there's only one champion fighting them in lane, and they're ranged champs in a very melee centered lane. It's like how Teemo became extremely popular toplane because he could just laugh and kill champs from poison.\n\nAn ADC solo in botlane dies. This is just the truth. You can't go for the enemy ADC, as their support will peel you off and smack you into the dirt for the ADC to riddle you bullets, arrows or axes.\n\nA support, and a good one at that, IS part of not only the team, but the ADC as well. Without a good support an ADC is nothing.\n\nHe has every right to expect recognition and to be grateful when people congratulate him for playing well in his role.\n\n\nThe game isn't won on who scores the most kills. It's won by who works together and takes objectives. Can't do that without a good Support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-24T08:58:08.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bipolar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=04MEW3Eg,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T08:52:23.375+0000)\n>\n> If that were true I'd believe you, but you can solo lane an ADC and still do very well, explains Vayne and Quinn toplane.

Basically anyone on OCE below top 50 challenger is trash and most solo queue games are just a retard-fest, even at challenger level.\n\n2) If you want to lie to your team and tell them they're not retarded then go ahead. If you take a whole lot of developmentally challenged kids and put them in a room there's bound to be plenty of hugging until one of them tard-rages out and stabs another with scissors. If you want positive reinforcement then, as support, YOU should be the one sucking your teammates off because you're the only one who doesn't have to farm. You're pretty much the team's cheerleader.\n\n3) Supports don't carry games. Unless you're actually a good support, which you almost certainly are not, you rely on your team doing the heavy lifting while you walk up and down the brush missing skillshots and watching your AD carry get bullied. You don't deserve adulation just for doing your job.","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-05-24T12:27:54.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"how do i miss skillshots as sona?","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-05-24T13:12:01.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you tell me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-05-24T13:18:11.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congratulations!
