The nerfs should not be too punishing for a good Ryze player. \n\nPeople complain about his E-Q damage, and I get that it does a lot, but trust me when I say that this isn&#039;t the thing about him that makes him &quot;OP&quot;. His Q is easily avoidable with it&#039;s slow projectile speed and thin hitbox, unless you are rooted obviously, which is a 12 second cooldown.\n\nAs a Ryze main I am telling you that it is his E&#039;s cooldown that makes him so annoying. This obviously resets his Q, and has something like a 2.14 second cooldown at max rank with some generic CDR. The main one shot/damage combo is Q-E-Q-W-Q-E-Q, when nerfing his E cooldown to maybe over 4 seconds max rank would make it just Q-W-Q-E-Q. This is already one, but the first combo just does more damage.\n\nIf a Ryze wants to build CDR, then he should be rewarded by been able to spam E-Q. But if he doesn&#039;t build CDR, he shouldn&#039;t be able to spam combos. Simple as that.\n\nAs for my personal opinion on the matter, I don&#039;t think Ryze is OP at all. People just haven&#039;t adjusted to his play style and matchups yet. And as a Jarvan player for jg, it isn&#039;t too hard to lock him down with a neat one shot combo, with an ult to help my top laner eliminate him.\n\nSo he doesn&#039;t really need a massive nerf to his ult&#039;s range or his Q&#039;s damage or his E&#039;s amplified damage. If Riot wants to actually nerf Ryze but not make him forgotten like Skarner was with his nerfs, they should nerf the thing that makes his poke, combos and damage so powerful. His E&#039;s cooldown.\n\nBtw I know Skarner isn&#039;t as bad as people think, but he was very strong after the rework, but then they nerfed him and now he has an average of a 2% play rate, even though his win rate is 48-53%. But he isn&#039;t very often played outside of people who play him a lot.\n\nSo yeah, I know Riot isn&#039;t going to read this, but if they go full bandwagon and just nerf his ult or his damage ridiculously then the problem with their balancing isn&#039;t that they make bad choices, it&#039;s that every player complains and eventually gets what they want in trade for money.\n\n{{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:13}}  {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-14T12:31:50.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I've seen (from both playing him and against him) he doesn't seem that OP. He's strong is you use him properly, but he certainly isn't a braindead 'spam all the keys with your face' champion.\n\nHe cant use his ult in-combat, so he has to be like Taliyah/Twisted Tate and do a lot of damage with just his abilities, which is a fair trade off.\nYou have to really make your fingers work for it when doing his combo's and if you press the wrong button its pretty easy to fuck up the rest of the combo. \nAgain its hard to judge until people know how to use him (and how to play against him) properly, but i think he is okay. his combo does a lot of damage, but it takes a while and he isn't exactly the hardest champ to run away from.\n\nAs for balancing, i lost faith in that ages ago, everyone plays Zed, and as a result Zed received no nerfs for months and months and only got some attention when he has a 90% ban rate (and even then it wasn't really that big of a nerf) and they ruined it soon after by taking QSS away from his helpless victims. But Kindred suddenly gets the spotlight and BAM! gutted instantly.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-14T12:59:39.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with Zed isn't really his kit or damage, but the fact that Riot keeps making AD items that perfectly synergize or go well with him. E.g Death's Dance, Duskblade, Youmuus update, and to make up for this immense power by these items exclusively gained by Zed, they need to nerf him.\n\nAs for Ryze, I completely agree and most people just don't know how to play against him yet. So far some counters I have identified:\n\nLee Sin\nFiora\nXerath\nLux\nZed\nTalon\nEkko\nVeigar\nYasuo\n\nNotice all of these champions are in relatively good spots right now. None of them are bad per-say. Ryze gets dumpstered by any champion that is an assassin, a long range burst / poke mage or any melee damage that can get on top of him.\n\nI don't personally think he is OP, but Riot clearly does. So they have guaranteed a nerf, and I think the E cooldown is the \"biggest issue\".","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-14T23:25:00.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True about Zed, Serrated Dirk is too powerful on him too early (especially when mages are rushing buying armour for an inefficient Zhonya's instead of their regular build)\n\nI cant say I've vsed all of those champs yet with Ryze, but Yas seems to be a problem for him, although I've had quite a bit of success vs fiora, (maybe it was just a couple of bad fiora's)\n\nThats a shame that riot will nerf him, at least on the plus side as soon as a champion gets nerfed, a lot of people stop playing them, with means he isn't in game as much which means less people have practice playing against him, so true Ryze players can do better sometimes.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-07-14T13:08:53.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is Ryze is a lot better than before and not just in gameplay style.\n\n\nEasier farming,\nTeam wide teleport with a 2 second channel\nStronger poke\nNo longer reliant on reaching level 6 to properly burst\nAbilities now have a clear indication of different effects when used in different ways \nEasier stacking of tear\nAP now translates into mana\nBetter ganks, better lane safety\nSpeed boost is now moved into his passive and not his ult","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-14T15:41:05.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa whoa whoa Ryze is a better overall design then before, he isn't stronger.\n\nHis passive + ult combo before guaranteed 1v3s easily. He was never reliant on reaching lvl 6 to burst, all level six gave him in a 1v1 situation was movement speed. His passive stacks were his burst. As for stronger poke, I think you mean stronger trades. His old E was much better poke, but his current E means fighting an enemy laner is better now.\n\nEasier stacking of tear, definitely not. He would just get his passive up and burst a wave or camp and get up to 30 stacks in some cases. Better ganks, I can definitely agree with, but he is meant to be a roamer so they needed to put something in. Easier farming, yeah, with his E he has good last hit potential. \n\nHe does not have better wave clear however, his old ult would be used with E and W to burst waves in 2 seconds or less, and his ult would end with about a 12 second cooldown.\n\nAblities now have a clear indication of different effects when used in different ways. What does that even mean? If anything clarity adds counter-play for the enemy. Clarity in what you are doing isn't an advantage.\n\nBetter lane safety, yep, but if he get's CCed that safety gets obliterated, so to be safe in lane you need to actively be managing combos and ultimate.\n\nSpeed boost moved passive and not his ult. Actually it is his Q, and it takes 3 spells to activate, 2 of which are point and click meaning Ryze has to have a target nearby to chain 3 abilities on and can't just press R to speed away with a very short cooldown.\n\nHe no longer has spell vamp or cooldown reduction, he no longer has magic resist reduction, he no longer has a long root at base, you need to E it for it to really be that much CC.\n\nYou also need to E a target before Qing to do any damage now.\n\nLook, the old Ryze was \"good\" all the time and breathtakingly overpowered with your passive up, and ult if there is more than one target. This new Ryze has gave him more rounded out power, but removed this issue that he couldn't be killed without chaining hard CC like stuns, knock ups.\n\nHe is overall weaker, but it was needed. He is really strong now and I think you guys need to wait a week before judging him, just like Riot is. They have said they will probably be nerfing him, but they haven't given us ideas as to what. The fact that he can spam E seems like the most important thing to nerf to me, but that is my opinion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
