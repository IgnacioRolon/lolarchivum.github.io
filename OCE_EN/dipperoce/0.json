(The tumblr cringe). Anyway, if any one elses skill or desicion making gets reduced by these certain oddities, I have the solution for you!\r\n\r\nAlways use /mute all at the start of every game, can never be too safe. Doesn&#039;t limit communication, people ping if they really want something.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t want to start an argument about the practicality of this, I have been winning 17% more games ever since I started doing this because people can put me on tilt quite easily when they say something that makes me shrivel up inside at how ignorant they are.\r\n\r\nRiot have implemented /mute all for a reason, they have blessed us with this, so do me a favor and instead of arguing with people just use /mute all today!\r\n\r\n(Side effects may include random flaming in the post game lobby that you were un-aware of in game and a slight decrease in team decision making if playing alone).\r\n\r\nYou can still give advice to them if you need to, so there isn&#039;t any reason to hold back. As a matter of fact, the chatbox should be removed completely and it would solve League&#039;s problem of flaming.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-17T00:01:19.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. It's all well and good for us as emissaries to say that if your team tilts you just /mute all, but rarely do people listen to us (sometimes the green name seems to make us less credible, when really we're players like everyone else).\n\nI agree wholeheartedly. If you get tilted by the words of your teammates then you're obviously not going to be playing on the top of your game, so it makes sense to take steps to prevent that. \n\n/mute all isn't necessary for everyone, and that's obvs why it isn't a default on option, but it's there to help if we need it, which is why it's so very frustrating that people would allow their own experiences to be ruined further because \"there shouldn't be toxicity at all Riot are lazy\". Regardless of how you feel about the punishment system, you shouldn't let your own experience suffer for it when there is a way to prevent it.\n\nI disagree that removing the chatbox entirely is the way to go, but I agree there are improvements that could be made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-17T02:48:26.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you mute all how will you say \"gg ez\" now","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-17T03:50:13.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can still type back to them, they will still see it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-07-16T22:35:03.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand how players can be penalised for writing words and another human taking offense to these words. People need to grow a backbone and not care about what other people say. If mum and dad (Riot) keep stepping in this game with be lame af. Has anyone here ever played a physical sport? Verbal abuse happens all the time and I don't ever see anyone step in to stop it.\n\nAlthough OP you are correct. If people do get offended by trash talk then muting all is the best option. :)\n\nYou cannot change the ways of others, you can change yourself though. Relax, take a breath and mute that player if you are aggravated.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-17T03:49:11.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't care about \"toxic\" people. I care about getting into an argument with someone when I know I'm right so my attention is split between them and the game, and even if I mute them at this point I'm still playing at less than 100%, which is important especially when you are bronze.\n\nToxic people have never really bothered me, you should be able to trashtalk people in video games like Dunkey said, I don't personally do this, but I don't really care if they do. But I don't wanna risk getting tilted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-16T23:53:36.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played field hockey for 10 years and if you tried to pull some shit like verbally abusing your opponents you'd get kicked off the field before you could blink.\n\nThere's a big difference between smack talk and verbal abuse, where you draw the line shifts (not that much though) depending on the game you are playing. \n\nWhere that line lies is determined by the community, in Leagues case via what they choose to report or not report. Riot themselves only determine baselines for what is punishable or not (i.e intent feeding, trolling, racism etc), the rest is determined by the community. You'll notice that OCE tends to be a lot more crass than NA, it's for this reason.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-07-16T18:31:52.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"idgaf about reading all of your content, all I wana say is I do get tilted coz of those dumb as.s and RIOT fkin doing sh,it in this case","replies":[]}]}
