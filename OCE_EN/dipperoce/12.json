This is your account we are talking about. You are 100% responsible for anything that happens to it, meaning when Riot reaches out and help people who actually get hacked or have been banned by mistake or aren&#039;t really toxic, they are been generous.\r\n\r\nSpecifically focusing on the people who are toxic as they are the most common culprits, they say Riot is greedy for money and will ban you and steal all your money, and they should transfer or give you a refund. 2 ways of looking at this. 1. A business standpoint 2. A fair standpoint. Both ways you can look at it, Riot is in the right.\r\n\r\n1. Business standpoint. \r\nYou have spent money on your account, and have received an item. You have not received skins, you have received Riot Points. This is now your money, or your currency. Your real life money is now irrelevant, this is a bitcoin. You use this bitcoin to buy other virtual items, which you get your use out of and own on your account. You may apply these cosmetics, gameplay moderations, champions, or hextech boxes whenever you wish to. So you get your moneys worth, if you are irresponsible with your account and these things are lost as a result of your actions, you are in the wrong, not Riot.\r\n\r\n2. Fair standpoint.\r\nYou say that Riot shouldn&#039;t be able to ban or take away things from you as you have spent a lot of money. If they followed your logic, only then would they be greedy. Riot holds a consistent standard. If you do something wrong, you can receive a punishment. If they made exceptions just because you have spent money on them, and poor people get banned while you get privileges, wouldn&#039;t that make them greedy for money? You have spent money on things of your own will, and they are removed as a result of your own will performing actions Riot does not want you to.\r\n\r\nAll of this makes sense to me. Why is it hard to get for some people? I feel like I rushed this a bit but it really is important that people stop hating on Riot for no reason, because if they actually mess up it will be nullified and possibly go unchanged.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2017-03-01T04:03:11.964+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if it that they don't care anymore or they have so much going on they don't have as much time to engage with the community as much as what they use to. \n\nI might be a bit old fashion in my thinking here but if Riot wants to still be around in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years time then they need to be successful. That means they need to show as a business they are a) profitable in both short and long term b) Consistently innovating and refining content and services whether its a new champ, new game mode, new community event, or reworking any of those (or even new games i.e. blitzcrank grab, etc) c) Maintain good relationships with all stakeholders. This includes the player base. If Riot didn't care about this then they would take no action against trolls, toxic player, or those breaking the rules. The fact they actively work to identify, punish and in most cases try to reform the player shows that they care about all their players. However not matter how hard you try to help some people, they will always be a negative influence (via trolling, toxic, etc). It is those people that get permabanned. \n\nNow admittedly Riot hasn't always been able to show measurable successes in some of these areas but they are always trying. A good example would be introduction of the Loot system to allow players who can not, or choose not to spend any real money on content like skins, icons and wards a means to obtain them. Did Riot have to do this? No, but they saw this as a way to add another level of engagement and to reward players.\n\nHaving said all that, I try to be as civil as possible during games because I don't want to lose the amount of time, effort, and money I have invested into this game. Whether this marks me as one of the few on OCE who do so, I'm not sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-02-28T13:03:45.220+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason those people complain is because they are stupid.

The only new and slightly refreshing content we get is a new champ every now and then and skins which need to be purchased. Think about it, the only consistent thing being released in this game is skins and they pump them out at a crazy rate. Why do you think that is?\n\nIf Riot were about the people they would scrap the automated banning system and move to something that actually works! If you want to take 90% of the toxicity out of the game hows about they start banning those who cause it in the first place? Then intent feeders, the griefers and the people who sit in the jungle for 50 minutes and do nothing all game long until you lose. That's the real problem and the people being perma banned are mostly those lashing out at these assholes via chat.\n\nI'm not condoning their actions but clearly something is wrong with the system when those who continually grief but sit silent are playing on and those who speak out are being banned. You only have to read over their chat logs to see they are frustrated with these kinds of people who unfortunately make up majority of the OCE community. I'm not sure what elo you are, but where I sit at the moment griefing etc is a regular occurrence and happens in every 1 in 3 games if not more.\n\nBut at the end of the day as Broken Scipts said Riot simply don't care anymore. It's not hard to see. It's just most have accepted it and accepted the game for what it is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FEED AND SUCCEED","date":"2017-03-02T13:20:41.676+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Lmao @ people trying to suggest that RIot is not greedy.\n\nCorporations are the definition of greed. What they do, they only do if there's a return in it for them. They constantly want more and do whatever it takes to increase their profit margins. They will not be content with with what they have now, they search for ways to have more, whether it's short term or long term. That's the definition of GREED. \n\nTencent (owners of riot) are literally this. Their purpose is to turn their investors/shareholders money into more money. They truly just want your money and that's it. Any decisions Riot make are purely based on $$, whether it's literally which skin/champ they think will make them the most short term or if it's some kind of marketing/image thing they think will help them in the long term. These are the orders they receive from Tencent.\n\ni guarantee you that the owners of Tencent, the management of Tencent and the management of Riot don't care about you in any way other than how much cash you have. Stop trying to use trivial and irrelevant things such as people getting banned, which would largely have nothing to do with the owners and management, to try to claim otherwise.\n\nI wonder what meager amount of resources they actually spend (compared to how much they make) on their banning and player behaviour shit anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-03-02T23:30:27.715+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone gets banned and then says they shouldn't have got banned because they spent money, and Riot doesn't conform with that, then Riot isn't greedy. And even if they are thirsty for money (like every business ever), that doesn't stop them from treating their player-base fairly. Treating people fairly doesn't mean caring.\n\nAnd also, what does Tencent have to do with this? Riot decides what happens, Tencent has 0 influence, they just make money off of Riot for investing in them early. Tencent been a greedy cooperation doesn't matter; they saw potential for Riot's game to take off and put money on it, and are now living the pay-off. Riot still gets a lot of money, people getting banned for toxicity is an issue that comes from the player's greed and acting in undesirable ways by Riot.\n\nMaking money =/= greed. They will advance their game to do what they can to make money, which is usually, y'know, what people pay for? If you are buying skins that you want and Riot is making money that they want, where is the issue?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-02T14:04:35.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"#greed\n*noun*\nintense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, or food.\n___\nKeyword being selfish. As a company comprised of people there will always be a greed element in the sense that those people want money to do what they want in their lives. Selfish, but not explicitly a bad thing. A little bit of greed isn't a bad thing, it's when greed is the only motivation and overshadows things like creative integrity that it becomes a problem.\n\nThe company as a whole is a bit different. There is a solid argument that Tencent is a greedy company, they are a parent company who acquired Riot Games for the sole purpose of making money out of a profitable opportunity. Riot itself however, still maintains full creative control of League of Legends.\n\nRiot HAS to make money. You cannot develop a product without money, and you cannot maintain that development without some revenue source. The more money they make, the more people they can hire and the better job they can do to grow, expand, and still make their employees some good money along the way. RIOT values creative integrity and community satisfaction way up there on their list of priorities, which makes them rather a selfless company. A greedy company does not give you free stuff. A greedy company only cares about toxicity to the point where it has started driving players away.\n\nWhat do you want Riot to do? Lose money on League? That just isn't sustainable, the game would die because there would be no-one to maintain it. I'll take a 'greedy' company like Riot over a greedy company like EA any day thanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-01T00:55:39.686+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"I agree.
