My PC is terrible. It's not that I don't want to use the new client, it's that I can't use it. When I exit a game, it takes 2 minutes for the client to load again. When I change game mode, it's takes me 10 seconds because it's laggy and freezes. You could say \"get a better computer\" but the point is the old client worked fine and we're being forced to use this new one.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-11T15:48:41.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"takes 2 min to load because it closes the client in games, you should disable close client and enable low spec mode.\n\nThey automatically tick close client on most machines, so you need to untick it for fast end game loading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-04-11T05:40:35.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should only be the case if you have the \"Close client during game\" option ticked. Check out the client settings under general and make sure that is unticked, and it shouldn't take so long to load up after game anymore.\n\nIf you're continuing to see issues I would definitely contact player support as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Trickster","date":"2017-04-11T14:03:29.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They wouldn't be ticked by default. Low specs and Close Client during game only increased a little of the FPS but something surely is messed up. FPS is way lower then usual and Even ping has gone up. OCE servers gg. My net and PC is still the same, so can't say its me. Just give us back the Legacy until you fix it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-11T04:28:11.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you provide more detail about your situation?

Pretty much all those issues are caused by corrupt or misinstalled files or connection issues (such is the nature of a delayed/staggered upgrade) and ought to be fixed by a client repair.","replies":[]}]}]}
