His combo variety is actually so awesome, it feels like a fighter game. You can do DPS (QWQEQ), defensive/speed (QEWQ), waveclear/aoe (EEQ), the list goes on. He is probably the most diverse character for combo-ing in the game now.\r\n\r\n2. After playing a few games as him I finally got the hang of his ult. At rank 1, it isn&#039;t really a gap closer. It is used more as a suprise tool for ganking/roaming. You can sit behind an area that doesn&#039;t get warded early game, and ult in either top lane or bot lane or even mid lane. You could probably get there faster by walking, but it&#039;s the surprise teleport combined with ghost that makes it so good. At rank 2, a lot of team possibilities open up. For example, we lost our jg at one point. So I used ult with our Bard to flank them behind, and as they chased us, I combo&#039;d and killed Graves and then ghosted around to the rest of my team where we aced them. It is a great ability.\r\n\r\n3. I think they might have finally done the proper rework. This one seemed so broken on the PBE, and I thought he could be monstrous on live, but they clearly traded his momentary broken windows of power for an all around &quot;strong&quot; champion. I say strong meaning he is good, but can be shut down all the time instead of when his passive is down, and in return he gets a decent damage output all the time instead of when his passive and ult are up.\r\n\r\n4. He is balanced now. He definitely has some good trading power early game, but he doesn&#039;t go completely broken even when fed. His damage is respectable and ultimate is strong, but I don&#039;t suspect Riot will be nerfing him, especially compared to other reworks/new champions we have had in the PAST. (Ekko joke).\r\n\r\nHe probably could be nerfed if pros abuse his team play potential, but as a stand alone champion I think they did really well in designing the new new new new Ryze, and I look forward to seeing innovation from professionals.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by balanced just to clarify is he doesn&#039;t have that crazy 1v1 or 1v2 potential anymore. His burst was extremely broken and just took some basic W-Q-E-Q to pull off. Anyway before I keep ranting I&#039;m gonna end it here and say good job Rito Gems, and if anyone has opinions about the new Ryze or disagrees with me, please comment below.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-14T08:55:34.169+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ryze's new E and Ultimate, Makes me blush.

It isn't Ryze at all now. This should have been the kit of a new champ or something. This isn't a rework, this is Riot making a new kit, and slapping \"Ryze\" on top of it, a personality we know from our noob days back when we started.\n\nHis new lore? lol what Lore? No story whatsoever besides \"he collects shit that made the world to save it\". Well... what else? Is he a good guy? Does he have a life? Is he even human? Like wtf Rito pick it up PLEASE\n\nonly compliment I have is that his new splash looks cool.

I can still remember the Bilgewater event with Murder Bridge and how cool it was. \n\nTBH i really think that Riot heavily neglects the lore aspect of the game, and its something that really puts me off.

Now as unique as this was for several years, it just wasn't a healthy design and couldn't be balanced. He was really weak, but if he had 3-4-5 stacks he could burst down 2-3 people with ease.\n\nRiot realized that even though the concept of one spell reducing the other 3 was really cool, they gave up on it. It was so boring, all you did was stack then W-Q-E-Q, repeat over and over again letting you if played right get 3 roots in 3 seconds.\n\nSo, Riot wanted to take him in a new direction. And that direction was variety in his combos. His old E didn't do much besides some AOE potential and magic resist reduction, which wasn't utilized properly. His old ultimate was used for the movement speed, AOE damage, and spell vamp, but as Riot has started removing \"spell vamp\", this needed to be swapped out for something better.\n\nIf they are going to make him able to pull off combos at any time and not just when he has his passive, they needed to still incorporate that reset mechanic, but in a better way. The Q reset design still gives the \"use Q then another spell repeat\", except some changes and a lot more possibilities. \n\nHis new ultimate managed to turn him into a team player in just the right way. He couldn't get into fights and start his combos very well before, and now with group initiation or flanking ready to go, he can easily turn contesting objectives into an ace.\n\nOverall, the new Ryze is an amazing champion design, and I believe the essence of Ryze is still there. Most reworks change this much of a champion. And as for this particular rework of Ryze, I think it has put him in a pretty good spot for number tweaking in the future.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-13T09:04:56.531+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im right with you, I think the Ryze update is fantastic!\n\nAnd his new look and lore is amazing!","replies":[]}]}
