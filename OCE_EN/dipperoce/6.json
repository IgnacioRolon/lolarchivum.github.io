I played Ryze JG, and carried his ass gg kappa. If anyone was watching, yes me, Ashe and Fid were all trolling, at 11 at night.\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to say is: people don&#039;t realize what it&#039;s like to play with your idol until you do. I was just watching his stream while waiting for a game on my other account, PostVoracity, and I noticed a name &quot;Bobby Orlando&quot; in my lobby. I guess my brain farted because I was switching between his stream and the client, so I probably didn&#039;t see the connection for a while. I already locked in Ryze by the time I noticed.\r\n\r\nLong story short he looks decent in his videos, but when you play with him you realize just how good he is. Constant prediction hooks, long ranged, sets my boy Ashe up bot lane and overall carries pretty hard, especially with a fed Veigar on their team.\r\n\r\nAt one point I didn&#039;t pick up a lantern under tower because a minion was in the way and it forced me to basic-attack, seriously wtf Riot. Anyway, we won the game pretty quickly and I knew since this is his account for a new Thresh video he wouldn&#039;t friend me, but it was worth a shot. Upvoot if yo cri evertim.\r\n\r\nSo that made my year let alone my day, I honestly feel blessed. He&#039;s such a cool guy, and even though he yelled at us a couple times cause he doesn&#039;t understand our epic challenjour carrying mechonix, we forgive him. \r\n\r\nTy Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"EroticDiscoHeat","date":"2016-07-07T02:32:22.598+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"you played well 2 my friend.
