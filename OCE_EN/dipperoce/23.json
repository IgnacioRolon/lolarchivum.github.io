Oh yeah she also has a stun.  What is this champion missing?\n\nOverall if they remove her %hp or her true damage that would give a build path vs her, atm there is none except Deaths Dance and Phantom Dancer which is not optimal for a lot of champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-16T23:23:32.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She had minor nerfs patched in (base AD down by 2 and true damage lowered early)\n\nI honestly think Camille should only get healed if she hits a champion with the W not anything. You can take a bad trade, spam W on the wave and get half your HP back.\n\nMy honest opinion is why in the hell does she have almost everything available in the game? A shield, a heal, %HP damage, True Damage, A dash, a stun, a slow, attack speed buff, movespeed buff... she is pretty much the new, even more stacked Irelia.\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nRengar was bugfixed since his passive was giving him %AD based on TOTAL instead of just BONUS. So he should do less damage. But I think they need to tone down his healing a little. Or make it so his Q doesnt let him dash a little. The number of Rengos than spam that to run away is ridic.\n\nI used to think Katarina was horrendously broken. But having played her a couple more times she isn't that bad. Don't get me wrong, a good Katarina has VERY little counterplay, but your average Kat is easy to beat now I find.","replies":[]}]}
