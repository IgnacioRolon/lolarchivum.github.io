I ended last season G5 (stopped playing) with G3-G2 estimated mmr. This season placements have left me mentally distressed so far as I have performed phenomenally and snowballed my team lead after lead and they keep throwing it. \r\n\r\nAre placements based off of individual performance as well? Like farm, damage dealt, kda, kp and objectives taken? Because it would comfort me to know that winning 1 out of 5 games so far doesn&#039;t mean I get placed in silver automatically. I know I can climb up easily once I am placed but these games are very frustrating because the enemies and allies are clearly of lower skill than me (I know I&#039;m still gold trash btw) so every game feels like a weighted coin toss.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t know if I&#039;m getting unlucky or my new season mmr is scuffed to all hell but I would like to know if there are other factors to placement ranking than just wins and losses, if anyone could share their experiences of bits of info I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\nPS, I am not attempting to put down my silver team mates by writing this if you get that impression, I am genuinely curious. These have been the most annoying games of League of Legends i have ever played. These players stop to type in the middle of a team-fight because someone has flamed them in the last 5 minutes, it hurts to watch. I know I am just in an unlucky batch and am not branding all silver players as bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-17T09:16:47.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll try to keep it as simple as possible cause it can get pretty confusing. \n\n1. Placement is pretty much entirely based on your end of season rank and MMR.\n2. MMR found on sites like op.gg are at best an estimate. They use their own calculations not Riot's, because Riot's are hidden essentially to prevent abuse of the system.\n3. You will almost always end up 2-3 divisions lower than your previous season rank. Very occasionally someone with very high MMR or who really boosted through preseason will end up a little higher. Those who stopped before reaching their peak rank will often only be 1-2 divs below their end of season rank due to higher MMR as well.\n4. Placement matches don't matter all that much to your actual placement unless you were previously unranked. For the most part they are just to make sure you are still at your skill level. We don't know exactly what goes into your MMR gains/losses because of the hidden calculations.\n5. At G5 last season, you should expect in the realm of S1-3.\n6. If you want to estimate yourself, look at what ranked players you are being matched with in placements. If they're above your end of season rank, only knock 1-2 divs off your end of season. If they're even 2-3 divs. If they're lower, 3-5.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2018-01-17T12:43:28.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k well on my silver 5 last season smurf i got silver 2 so i was hoping that i could get a decent rank out of placements on this account aswell but oh well can just climb i guess","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-17T12:54:15.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's very unusual to get higher than end of season rank. Not unheard of certainly, but also not the norm. Vast majority get placed lower. It really all comes down to mmr. If your season end mmr was higher than your rank, and maybe you climbed a bit in preseason as well, then perhaps vsed and beat higher mmr players in placements, it adds up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
