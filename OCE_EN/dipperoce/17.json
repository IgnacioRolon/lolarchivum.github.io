If you have been banned for LEGITIMATELY no reason, I don't recommend whining on the boards and sending a ticket, but I don't hate you for it.\n\nPeople who say this (refering to title) like it means anything are cringe. It is a part of Riot&#039;s TOS to prevent getting sued when some idiot goes tries to bring the company to court because he got banned or something. People say &quot;they can just ban you for any or NO reason, it&#039;s part of their TOS&quot;. Again, this doesn&#039;t actually mean they ban people for no reason, it means that if someone takes it to the legal stage, they can say &quot;in our TOS it clearly states you can be banned for no reason as we own the account&quot;.\n\nThis is about business, this is nothing to do with you &quot;getting hacked and someone scripted on my account and they were toxic and are a booster&quot;.\n\nLike it&#039;s completely ridiculous, I used to be one of the most toxic players on here but I just stopped after a chat restriction, I&#039;ve never scripted, I&#039;ve never been boosted, and I&#039;ve never been banned. So when people bring out these isolated cases, 99% of the time they are lying. Why can you blame Riot for using automated responses and not really trusting you?\n\nFact is your account has done something against the rules, and Riot doesn&#039;t allow that. If you are telling the truth, usually the cases get solved and Riot says &quot;sorry, we&#039;ve unbanned your account&quot;. I have watched it happen like this many times on the boards. People who make up victim complexes so they can lie and get their account unbanned, even if they stop doing malicious activities, and then use their story as a way to blast Riot, deserve a perma-ban.\n\nPeople who get banned as a result by an accidents cases are looked into, and the reason Riot doesn&#039;t respond is, because they know you are lying and complaining, and they also know they don&#039;t have to do anything about it. They can&#039;t respond and come of as toxic on the boards, that&#039;s not what they are there for.\n\nIf I was ever permabanned as a mistake by getting hacked, the script system failing, that&#039;s about the only two ones I can think of, I&#039;m sure Riot would be willing to clean it up. Fact is your posts don&#039;t give any detail and that just makes you look worse.","replies":[{"poster":"PheroxNZ","date":"2017-02-27T03:10:27.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro i know how you feel the same happened to me and im perma ban","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-27T04:38:42.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"unsure wether truthful, or proving his point\n{{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-02-27T07:56:47.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one misunderstands this post, I was very clear.

I sent almost 40 emails to the support team with no help. They kept telling me nothing was wrong and my account deserved the ban. They kept saying they looked into the case but probably not in enough detail.\n\nIf it was not for my post on the forms and someone from riot taking a closer look at my case I would not have had my account restored.\n\nYes most people do lie and waist time of the support team. Though a very small group sometimes are truly innocent.\n\nThe support team I feel can not handle extremely complex cases, let's be honest like all support teams they have very limited resources. \n\nMy post was the only reason I think that I was able to recover my account. If it wasn't for Riot Gehirn personally looking into my case it would have not been resolved.\n\nI'm great full that he took the time to look into it for me, though at the end of the day if I didn't kick up a stink in the forums he would never have even known about my case.\n\nThe support team closed my case I'd say 4-5 times before he looked into it.\n\nAll in all, if you are truly innocent and the support tram was unable to help you need someone from riot to help. They will only see it though the forums.\n\nThough yes, most people do lie and sadly that's what makes it so hard for someone who done nothing wrong to be helped.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-02-28T10:20:59.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many people lie.

This means that if you don't get it solved on both, you are most likely a rare case. But your boards post had no substance to it, Riot had to look into your situation as they initially should have.

With cases like this guys, usually it's one of the real fringe cases where they have to dig quite a bit deeper to find the lie/truth, so on their first cursory look, and probably also their second deeper look, support still determined the ban was valid. \n\nI suspect there was more to his case than we will ever see, though I gather it turned out he had been unknowingly hacked, and this likely contributed tot he problem. Support may have believed that he was the hacker, leading them to say nothing of it until the owner tried to recover the account, or they didn't see the evidence of hacking until it was brought to their attention and they were looking for it.\n\nThat would be my best guess as to why his resolution took so long. There may have been mistakes on the support teams part, they are human after all, but cases like his are very rare in my experience. Most false bans I have seen are resolved within a week (give or take for response times and all that).","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-03-01T07:34:50.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not exactly \"automated\", but people are complaining that they don't read it and just give a bot like response.

For the vast majority of tickets, a macro response answers the question appropriately (and does so very quickly) which gives the support agents more time to look at deeper tickets.\n\nI believe that player behaviour support is encouraged to hand write as many responses as they can though I can't be sure of that, and obviously account recovery is a bit more involved since they have to do all the investigative stuff, but for the most part the macros do the job.\n\nI see it less as a sign of neglect, and more as the chosen balance of priorities. By having most first (and sometimes second) responses as macros it means that they can get to more tickets faster. The best way I can express to think about is, what would you prefer, a personalised ticket that you have to wait 3-4 days for, or a copy paste response that answers your question that you only have to wait 24~ hours for.\n\nObviously the macros don't always hit the mark, but for the vast majority they work as intended. Most of the people (that I see) that have a problem with macro responses are the ones that are lying (or deluded) about their account bans and want to complain that support isn't doing their job, which is ironic since these are the people the macro responses are best for, because there is an obligation to answer them, but engaging them tends to only make them worse.\n\nMy view is, I don't care if it's a macro as long as it answers my question, and if it only answers most of my question, it just means I can be more specific in my reply about what I'm asking.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Leylin Farlier","date":"2017-02-28T21:36:22.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account got hacked when I played at a public shop, I almost gave up on it.

I will flame out-loud, which Riot mentions that even if you have negative emotions, as long as you try and don't voice those emotions onto your team, any anger dealing way is fine.

Sadly, even if someone is intentionally feeding, flaming, trolling, and been toxic all at the same time, you still don't have the right to flame back. Which really sucks because they are giving you so much negativity, and instead of taking it out on my team I usually take it out on my wall. I would lie if I said I haven't reached for the nearest object that isn't my computer and smashed it.\n\nMy friend once got permanently banned, he was literally the most toxic player you could meet. A real silver 5 player. Nowadays he can play any role, focuses on top, is Gold 4 climbing to plat in solo and flex, and is one of the most passive players in game. If you piss him off, you must have really messed up. He respects Riot's decisions apart from a few balancing changes. Based on the information I've given you, you would be surprised to hear he lost around $700 in champions and skins. Why doesn't he hate Riot?\n\nBecause picture if all that stuff was free. You wouldn't be complaining about a ban. So why should Riot's player standards change just because you have forked over a bunch of cash? Wouldn't that make them the greedy cooperation? \"If you pay us we won't ban you, if you can't afford it too bad\". Fact is your logic is really the opposite of what makes sense. They have consistent standards stated in their EULA and TOS, if you disobey that they won't hesitate to punish you, it's your fault if you spend money first. That's the definition of a fair company. Poor people aren't bullied compared to rich people.","replies":[]}]}]}
