If the afk was there, they would vote no making it a 3 against 2. My friend was waiting to load in a normal game and my other friend voted yes as an obvious troll. He didn't expect this.\n\nI thought it was majority rules for /remake. Does anyone know? Cause we had 2 votes for yes and 2 votes for no and we still remaked even though the two votes for yes were a joke. Gotta suck.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-14T13:04:56.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's like if Riot did \"2 against two votes in the surrender makes it a surrender\". It's stupid, the other player didn't vote so it's the same scenario. Obviously remake is different, but it defeats the purpose of having a vote. You might as well have a remake button and skip the vote entirely.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-14T09:54:13.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn...\n\nI find remake so annoying tbh, Yea in ranked its a good idea because it levels the playing field, and i agree with it being there in ranked. \n\nBut in normals its just annoying, people who are AFK in the first 2 minutes are usually AFK for a reason, like they went to the bathroom or something and took longer than they thought. (or the load screen was really fast) And theyre usually back before long.\n\nWaiting 5 min for a game, spending another 7ish mins in champ select and load screen, then 3 minutes of game, just to start the whole process again, is a waste.  Thats only 5 minutes away from a surrender vote anyway, so if someone really was AFK then you can just surrender at 20 mins. \n\nSo many times i only have time for one game, get into it, and its a remake, and then i haven't played a game AND I haven't got time for another full length one.\n\n**TL;DR:** Keep remake in ranked, but dont bother about it in normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-14T09:36:33.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, it just has to be two votes, which is really stupid imo it should be majority rules.","replies":[]}]}
