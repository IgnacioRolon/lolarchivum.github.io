It&#039;s probably not URF skins since they come out on April 1st. It possibly could be a new feature or addition to the gamemode.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is Riot trying to hype everyone up, but then again for me it would be more of a &quot;finally&quot;. Then again it could be same old Riot with their unreasonable logic behind decisions. This isn&#039;t just what everyone wants, it&#039;s literally the most diverse and fun schedule, yet you just take it off and haven&#039;t said why.\r\n\r\nThis would be way better than whatever you have now:\r\n\r\nAscension\r\nOne For All\r\nNexus Siege\r\nUltra Rapid Fire\r\nDefinitely not Dominion\r\nLegend of the Poro King\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t know if I missed any but just put that on and maybe make some themed skins only available when the corresponding gamemode is on and you will see much more success.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-29T10:02:06.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, game rotation should be exactly that, a rotation. Not play a single game mode twice, until the entire queue has been played once each.\nWould give us URF more often (which 90% of people seem to want), and give everyone else access to the modes they like. Personally i dont like any other rotation except URF, and havent tried doom bots but want to. But im happy to have the other modes queue up each week if it means URF will be unlocked more than twice a year\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-29T08:08:43.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just waiting for the doom bots.","replies":[]}]}
