My ping will spike up to about 300ms (technically 500 but it goes down instantly) after it happens and descend slowly.

It has recently being getting so extreme that it means the difference between victories and losses. It could be a packet loss issue, routing issue or a personal wifi issue. Whatever it is, if anyone has experienced this or can tell me a suggestion, please speak up.\n\nP.S I&#039;m fairly certain it&#039;s not my firewall but you never know\n\nEdit: I have found a section in Riot support that details my symptoms exactly. \nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209765743-Connection-Troubleshooting-Log-Reader","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T13:50:25.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like packet loss to me. for sure, though as to the cause that's a bit harder to nail down.
