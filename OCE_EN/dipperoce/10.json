Forcing one of their players to leave after trying to win? Well I just had some of those and instead of stacking just built Quasus to end the game as fast as possible because I didn&#039;t want to waste my time. I play league for a competitive experience, and I will end. I still danced and trolled them when they were doing a meme chase, but I&#039;m not going to build stupid and not play just cause the enemies want to ruin the experience.\r\n\r\nThey had a GP that left due to not wanting to deal with it. He beat me in lane. I feel his frustration, but he was forced to play with these people. The 3 others on my team and the trolls on the enemy agreed to report me and my friend because 1. we voted no on the troll surrender vote. 2. I was &quot;tryharding&quot;. Of course I&#039;m going to want to get out of this annoying experience. If I wanted to troll and not have to try to win I would play intro bots. \r\n\r\nI did the right thing and reported them, but my team seems to sympathize with this as if they are friends of the enemy team. This is not a positive experience for me, my friend, or the GP on the other team. Shows how toxic this community can be with the false sense of agreement or peer pressure. My friend also wanted a good lane as he hadn&#039;t got a legit mid lane in a few games and was trying to practice his mechanics, only to be upset to see that kindred, ashe, xin and singed walked under his tower 1 by 1 and he picked up gold. Saying to me sarcastically, &quot;wow dude I&#039;m so good&quot;. Shows how low this whole thing is.\r\n\r\nSo they ruined GPs game which was perfectly fine, beating me top lane. My team somehow agrees with the enemy team that feeding is a good thing and this game is &quot;free IP&quot; enjoy it. &quot;Play ranked if you want a competitive experience&quot;. It&#039;s late at night I&#039;m not risking my LP, I just want to play League of Legends. This should not be accepted. But apparently I&#039;m expected to waste my time in this game for 40 minutes or something. No thanks. I have things to do in the morning and I want to play this game normally.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy this game at the last few minutes cause the enemy walked up to me, trolling around. I did their little dance, then dropped an E and they died. It&#039;s very satisfying seeing them go &quot;wow tryhard&quot;. I&#039;m clearly not trying hard because you guys aren&#039;t giving me an experience worth that. You just feed and then complaining that you can&#039;t waste more time because I&#039;m putting Rot portals and ending.\r\n\r\nI am convinced late night league of legends is full of people that are playing from their electric beds in the hospital. I kinda feel bad for them.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-06T07:42:20.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree and disagree on this, kinda.\n\nI agree that fun shouldn't come at the expense of others, and that free-win/win-trading is really just well, a bit dodgy (imagine giving out free-wins in your community Saturday football event, not so cool ain't it, even for a casual match). Fouls and toxicity are not allowed anywhere, and league is no exception.\n\nBut I disagree on a small aspect of this post. Because I also do believe that normal games is where random things are meant to happen, though not intentional feeding and win-trading obviously, but there is a certain degree of flexibility (or chaos) that should be allowed in normals, because it's just like the free-for-all of shooty-shooty-bang-bang games where you just hop on and play. I don't suppose that one has to always push for the idea of ending and winning the game in normals, I mean if you want to, that's fine, but I don't think that's crucial for normals as that would be something that ranked is built for. As long as the game is fair with no foul play and just general toxicity, I do think everything (messing about and dragging the game out included) does go in normals.\n\nBut as a whole, I think I do share your sentiment on this one.

You can also do this in ranked. You can't intentionally feed because its a waste of time as all 5 and as 4 you ruin someones game. Ranked is a more tryhard competitive enviroment yes, and there is certain things more chill and tolerable in normals obviously, but they shouldn't be allowed to do this kind of garbage. It transfers over. Fun shouldn't come at the expense of others on their team.\n\nI meant I had to end as in it was so boring and annoying. They are some of the most obnoxious players and the least time I spend in game the better. When my team and their team is flaming and reporting me for winning a game, don't try to tell me things are going right. Their GP may not have lost LP, but you do realize they pushed him so low that he just flat up disconnected. Justification of this behaviour is preposterous.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2017-01-05T22:39:22.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Sounds like they had fun.

Please use the report option after the game and mute players you find annoying. \n\nI play late at night as well but I do not play over school holidays for the obvious reason, the kids are home and are playing. This game is a great and challenging game which is why it's popular but it grew way too fast for the company to keep up with. However riot is trying to fix things slowly.\n\nSo my advice is to wait until after school holidays, remember to report and always remember this is just a game and try not to get worked up in a negative way. Or you will eventually find yourself just like the trolls you hate.","replies":[]}]}
