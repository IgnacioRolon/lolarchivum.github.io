And then they keep going cause they can&#039;t grasp the concept? Well whenever a good Dyr or Singed play they will use their style of play to their advantage, and when people don&#039;t understand what this is and start miaing it is really tilting.\n\nJust stop spamming pings and focus on the game. When you mia someone it makes them lose their confidence and mechanics in the heat of the moment. Sometimes I will be getting the free-est kill and end up dying because of someone on my team spam miaing me as if I&#039;m doing something wrong. Then they justify it by saying &quot;Pinged you 100000 times&quot; as if that&#039;s a good thing.\n\nI may not bring much to a team but based on my previous experiences shot-calling is my strongest asset. I know what I and my team is capable of in a fight, what objectives to go for and how to play. Like instead of going mid when their team is sieging and dying with them, I could take a tower or two bot lane. 1 of 2 things will happen. I will either get and inhib because no one comes, or they will be forced to send at least 2-3 people bot cause your solo champs ain&#039;t stopping me.\n\nThis allows my team to either have a free mid/top lane or win a fight. But some people have bad logic and spam assistance pings. &quot;HELP US!&quot;. Then will proceed to flame leading to my tilt and certain demise. I notice most of these players are bronze. That might be one of the reason why people are bronze is because they don&#039;t properly understand the game, just the champions, mechanics and map, but not the actual essence.\n\nAnyway my point is if your teammate is doing something and look confident, don&#039;t ping to flame them or persuade them out. Ping to assist them. Like if they are playing aggressively instead of spam pinging yellow ping on them, alert them where the enemy is and use missing or blue pings. They usually know what they are doing, pings discourage them, leading to the &quot;I told you so\" situation.\n\nOf course on the other hand if you know they are doing something stupid, instead of spam pinging them, use the pings properly. Ping mias on enemy champions coming and use the fall back pings.  \n\nPings are meant to offer strategically value not the death of a team. I&#039;m not saying you have to respect the players on your team, but there is more than one way to skin a cat, and I for one am sick of the constant visual cluster of an angry communication. You can have people muted, have ping volume muted, and still get tilted cause of this constant garbage.\n\nTo the point of Singed or Udyr, their speed allows them to go for unorthodox plays. They both like getting chased and wasting time, they both like ccing a champion then neglecting them and moving onto the next target, they both like CHASING targets, and their speed makes it a good option to make use of the speed instead of hammering away at a single target for too long. They both have the ability to solo large groups or 1v1 enemies, but where they shine is with their team OR in their best situations which is getting chased or chasing while been fed. (Either in cs or kills).\n\nTeams usually don&#039;t take advantage of that power and flame Dyr or Singed as if they are meant to act as like a Wukong or support champion. This usually leads to losses, but most of the time a team will know how to synergize and let them set up and carry. So don&#039;t spam ping them, they know what they are doing.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-26T14:56:55.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol obviously don't know what your team is capable of as the only way to win in low elo is to ignore the idiots and do what you do to win. The amount of times people have lost because they listened to people tilting, or teams didn't listen to literal logic.\n\nSay yes you have udyr, with a split push build, you have baron and you are botlane while the enemy team has 5 people at baron and your team has 4, you can easily win if your team keeps their team there fro ~10 sec, its logical you are in their nexus towers easy win if undisturbed but instead of using their ranged spells to keep enemies from returning they run away and return to base themselves.\n\nPoint of that being the people in low elo won't listen to your shot calls even if you make them, so don't rely on them and just do it yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-12-26T15:39:08.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the mindset I've adopted recently, I have to do it myself if I really am better than low elo, and already within like 2 days I got to silver after a year and a half in bronze. I have noticed myself carrying a lot more games. My point is I WILL inevitably win the game, but my team thinks I should be participating in their shenanigans.\n\nEven when I pick out a good time to team fight and stunning and blasting people, they still get confused when I switch targets to prioritize more valuable people. Basically I don't waste time in a fight. It's not that they are bad and I can't win, it's that the pings are so annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-27T04:51:17.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good thread. Low elo certainly have no concepts of strategy. This includes 1) Objectives priority 2) Target Priority 3) Roles (in general, and in fights), and the biggest one of all, 4) Map pressure.\n\nI guess if they started to understand these, they wouldn't be low elo. Low elo think they just have to master a champion and the game is easy. \"I'll carry\", \"I'll win lane guaranteed, I'm Yasuo\", \"I have a 90% winrate on Twisted Fate\". This may be true, but if it is WHY ARE YOU STILL IN LOW ELO? \"I always do better than my teammates, i go 10-8-20 while they always feed and we lose the game! It's not fair, i'm in elo hell\".\n\nNah bro you didn't\n\n1) Roam to help other lanes,\n2) Push HARDER to use your extra items and draw enemies to you and away from your team,\n3) Contest objectives,\n4) Ward enough to spot ganks, and probably the biggest one,\n5) TELL YOUR TEAMMATES WHAT YOUR NEXT PLAN OF ACTION WILL BE IN THE GAME\n\nSo yeah they fed, but YOU cost the TEAM the game. YOU LOST. YOU. They were a bunch of imbeciles but YOU didn't carry. YOU LOST THE GAME.\n\n\"But Singed went 0-10-0, how can you say that it was my fault?\" While it took the enemies 30 seconds to kill him every time, you did NOTHING to help the TEAM. YOU LOST. YOU.\n\n==================================================================\n\nSo yeah those pings are dumb. After someone dies, there's no point pinging them if they made a mistake, or in most cases the pinger themselves made a mistake and then thought \"I'm pinging them because I knew you'd die\" instead of actually helping them fight because the person taking it understood the power spikes, the mana and health levels, the vision control and heaps of stuff that the pinger didn't even consider. \n\nIf Singed or Udyr is going ham, he's doing it for a reason. You can stand around watching him die, or you can use your low elo dumbarse brain to actually play the game. He's either going ham because you can assist him, or hes going ham so that you can PUSH AND GET OBJECTIVES. If you did nothing while he died, and he's not feeding on purpose, then it was YOUR FAULT THAT HE JUST DIED **FOR NOTHING**. \n\nJust think more, stop stupid pinging to point out WHAT YOUR DUMB BRONZE BRAIN THOUGHT TO DEMORALIZE YOUR TEAMMATE, and get on with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-12-27T08:59:38.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I ask is if I'm 1v5ing taking an inhib down and succeeding instead of wandering around in the enemy jungle take a baron or dragon, or at least some kind of objective.
