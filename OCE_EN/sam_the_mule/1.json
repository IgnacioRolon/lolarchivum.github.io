I had the same issue a while ago, I&#039;m not sure how long, but the issue resolved itself seemingly, until now where it&#039;s begun again. Before roughly five games ago I was taken to the window that&#039;s open while the game&#039;s running, where it ordinarily says to reconnect, where instead it would say, &quot;Connection Error: The request to the PVP server has timed out. Please login again to continue,&quot; or something to that effect. I&#039;d then have to relog after every single game finished, and miss out on the stats screen and seeing what grade I had gotten, which was exceedingly annoying. \r\n\r\nNow it happens that the game finishes, and I&#039;m taken to the normal window that pops up, the client, where it says waiting for stats. However, after a few seconds it stops and the same &quot;Connection Error...&quot; message pops up. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried repairing the client, I&#039;ve reinstalled, I&#039;ve done all these things to Keychain Access, I&#039;ve prayed to Riot, everything. I&#039;m on Mac OSX El Capitan, and I can&#039;t find a fix anywhere online, I look forward to a response.","replies":[{"poster":"rokinakoki","date":"2017-02-08T19:03:54.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the exact same problem.
