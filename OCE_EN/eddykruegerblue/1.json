If you think you have solid grounds to argue otherwise for your ban, use support ticket.\n* Whether or not you got the last turret and was about to take their nexus is pretty irrelevant, because no one gets reported for nearly closing up the game, failing to, or something. Nor does in-game effort cancels out your other real offences if they're present; a person can be a great player, but they can also be a massive cock too (though admittedly I have no idea which category you're reported under and punished in since you've made 0 mention).\n* Are bot really int feeding? And even if they are, this has nothing to do with you. Because this thread is about you getting banned, not them. Are they banned from supposedly int feeding? Possibly, no one knows but if they really did and were reported then chances are, they're also punished (or at least close to).\n* Someone taking cs or otherwise means nothing in this case. Not to mention, support needs to cs from time to time too, it's not like they're just cool taking absolutely 0 creeps, so idk what you're trying to say.\n\nBut again, this thread is about you doing something that nets you the ban, which you've completely avoided to even talk about but instead focusing entirely on shifting blame on others. Doesn't matter if they're guilty of whatever you're accusing them of and whether or not what they did were actually punishable, that has really nothing to do with your ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocaset","date":"2017-03-06T01:30:43.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Justice doesn't matter in League of Legends.
