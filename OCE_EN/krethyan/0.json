This is when it all goes to shit the only password accepted is over 23 characters long, 1 off the limit, so now slightly pissed I make that my password and then go to change it back to the original since you can't just reuse a password. Now nothing I put down is acceptable. Even though my original password followed all the specifications it won't accept it \r\n\r\ntl;dr passwords f*cked, send help\r\n\r\nI also forgot to mention this also happened the day before but after I entered my password around 20 times it worked (I've been sitting here for over an hour for the people who are just going to tell me to try that again)","replies":[]}
