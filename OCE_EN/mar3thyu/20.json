When I tried to rejoin the game I got a firewall error and restarted my computer a few times. After about 5 minutes the orange reconnect button didn't appear when I logged into LoL. The game definitely hadn't ended as it was about 5 minutes into the game when it happened. The match hasn't appeared in my Match History and I can go into a custom game just fine. I'm pretty sure it's a server issue as something like this has never happened before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-05-31T09:56:23.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something similar happened to me, are you getting a firewall error?","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-05-31T09:58:10.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DianasGotSwag,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=YFO0ebjd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-31T09:56:23.311+0000)\n>\n> Something similar happened to me, are you getting a firewall error?\n\nnope was server :/","replies":[]}]}]}
