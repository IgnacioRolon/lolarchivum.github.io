His Q got buffed, and that's good! His E can be dodged by anyone. Once it's been cast, that's it. Your opponent can guess where you put it, and they get 0.75 seconds to dodge that %%%%.

I have trapped people in the center and they are able to walk out before the delay finishes, it is also hard to predict where to put his w as they will just move slightly and dodge it completely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-04T05:31:57.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's got minor changes on PBE right now.
