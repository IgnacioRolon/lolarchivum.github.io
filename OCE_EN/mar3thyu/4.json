You gotta wait as long as possible before igniting him. His ult lasts 5 seconds. Ignite him after around 4 seconds. At level 18, for example, Tryn will heal 300 damage, reduced to 150 by Ignite. Ignite does 410 damage, or 328 damage after considering his ult will absorb the first tick. Even if he's chugging potions, without additional help from allies he *will* die.\n\nSimilarly, at level 6:\n\n* Tryn heals 190, reduced to 95 by ignite. Health potions heal 5 health per second when chugged (reduced from 10 health a second) -> ~20 extra healing. Total = 115\n* Ignite deals 170 damage, reduced to 136 when his ult absorbs the first tick. \n\nTryn literally cannot survive a late ignite unless he has a heal/shield from a team mate. Or unless he's building full AP Tryn.\n\nIf you're going to die before you can ignite that late, then don't bother igniting.\n\nOf course, Exhaust is more effective against Tryn than ignite, so consider taking that instead if it's a particularly difficult matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-02T02:39:48.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahahah he can my build lets him heal for 200 per hit and he crits for 1200 damage + lol","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-02T02:43:01.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes in Bronze Elo you can get away with it, against competent players you're not going to want to stick around under tower when your ult is already over.

Late game champs work perfectly fine in high Elo. You see them all the time in Challenger Elo on all servers. I'm Plat 2, I've spent plenty of time in Plat 4 already, so I'm pretty familiar with what works and what doesn't work.\n\nTryn is perfectly fine in Plat 4 Elo. You just need to play a little smarter and more aggressive, that's all.\n\nFor evidence, check out http://champion.gg/champion/Tryndamere which gives stats for Tryn in Plat+ Elo. Even people who literally just pick up Tryn and play him have a 50% win rate. On average his win rate is 53%. This suggests that Tryn is very strong in high Elo, and basically proves that you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nFinally, no Plat smurf would ever end up in Bronze unless they intentionally feed.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-02T22:10:16.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 wen I play in plat 4 I always get camped so hard wen I pick a late game champ and as for the bronze I feed steal my teams jg and just out right troll","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-03T03:46:09.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1 wen I play in plat 4 I always get camped so hard\n\nAlright, let's see the summoner name of your main.

[Trolling to get down to Bronze is a bannable offense](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/21dem4/regarding_players_intentionally_losing_games_to/), Riot generally bans all smurfs permanently as well as disabling all ranked rewards from your main (and banning it for 2 weeks too). \n\nDon't bother deleting your comments, I've taken a screenshot of this and will be including this in the report.
