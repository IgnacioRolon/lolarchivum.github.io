It's a hardware issue within the datacenter. We're working through our provider to try and resolve the issue. It's taking a lot longer than anticipated.

I'll update again in the next hour (hopefully we'll have some good news). \n\nOnce the link is restored, history should trickle back to you all.\n\n\nUpdate#2 - We've gotten traction with the ISP where a software issue is occurring. We hope to have more information within the hour. \n\nEdit- Not sure where my red name is...checking on that. I'm a live producer working with the engineering team solving the problem.
