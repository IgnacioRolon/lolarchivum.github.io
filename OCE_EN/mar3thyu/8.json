The most basic outline is that they either delete you or you delete them. It's a little bit like feast or famine style. It's much harder to create an Assassin than a Bruiser/Fighter champion because of the unstable nature of Assassin play styles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-28T10:36:47.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about reducing their damage. Assassins are quite litterally \"the guys that drop you dead in a matter of instants\". Otherwise they're fighters, brawlers, mages or the like.\nHealthy assassins means simply giving them a weak spot, meaning they can kill you instantly BUT.\nBut, they are out of spells and can't keep up the fight.\nBut, they don't have an escape.\nBut, they can't stop you from killing them back if you survive.\nThings like that. They won't have ALL those weaknesses, but something on that line, you'll always find it.\n\nA healthy champion isn't a weak champion, it's a champion with BOTH strengths and weaknesses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-27T00:40:39.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont seem to be able to delete full health fools with ahri since the dfg days.\n\nI do miss the days of ambushing a lone lane pusher and deleting them.
