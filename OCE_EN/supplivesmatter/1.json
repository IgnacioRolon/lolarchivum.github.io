Upon reaching 100 stacks (After 5 seconds of continuous running), the chemicals begin to leak from the tank due to too much pressure, leaving behind a poisonous residue that deals 2.5/4/5.5/7/8.5 (+1.25% Ability Power) magic damage every 0.25 seconds *(10/16/22/28/34 (+5% Ability Power) magic damage per second)* for 2 seconds to any enemy that steps into the trail.\n\n**[Passive - Empowered Poison Trail]:** Upon using an ability the tank&#039;s lid bursts open for 5 seconds, leaking out a whole plumage of chemical smoke. The damage is doubled and enemies lose 10% of their vision for every second they stay in the poisonous trail (maximum 30%).\n***\n**Second Ability: Chemical Explosion**\n\n**[Active]:** Can only use once 100 stacks of Poison Trail have been achieved. The tank on Singed&#039;s back explodes from the amount of chemical pressure stored inside, propelling him forward and knocking all enemies near Singed away [300/350/400/450/500 range] and dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+25% Ability Power, 5% Maximum Health) magic damage to all enemies hit and infecting them with an empowered Poison Trail for 2 seconds. Singed can jump over walls with this ability.\n\nThis ability can be used while Maniacal Charge is active. All stacks from Poison Trail are not consumed in the explosion, but are necessary for the ability to be used.\n**Mana Cost:** 70/75/80/85/90 mana.\n**Cooldown:** 15 seconds at all levels.\n***\n**Third Ability: Maniacal Charge**\n\n**[Active]:** Singed lowers his shield and runs forward for 3 seconds, gaining a 80/120/160/200/240 (+3.5/4.0/4.5/5.0/5.5% Maximum Health) shield and 30% movement speed. Any enemies he runs through are flung over him, taking 50/75/100/125/150 (+0.4 Ability Power) physical damage and are slowed by 20% for 1 second upon landing. Enemies can only be flung once per charge.\n\n**Mana Cost:** 65 mana at all levels.\n**Cooldown:** 16/15/14/13/12 seconds.\n***\n**Ultimate Ability: Insanity Potion**\n\n**[Passive]:** When Insanity Potion is off cooldown and Singed is out of combat, a bar will appear above Singed&#039;s ability bar with four stats on it: Ability Power, Armour, Magic Resist, and Regeneration. The minimum for each bar is 1 and the maximum is 5. Singed gains 3 points per rank of this ability to increase the stats on that bar based on what stats he would want in his Insanity Potion. All stats start at level 1 and do not require a point to increase.\n\n**[Active]:** Channeling over 1.5 seconds, Singed drinks a concoction of chemicals that increases his Ability Power, Armour, Magic Resist, Health and Mana Regeneration depending on the points put into them on the passive of this ultimate ability:\n\n**[Ability Power]:** 20/25/30 Ability Power, increasing by 5/10/15 for every point put into increasing the ability power bar.\n**[Armour]:** 30/40/50/ Armour, increasing by 10/15/20 for every point put into increasing the armour bar.\n**[Magic Resist]:** 30/40/50 Magic Resist, increasing by 10/15/20 for every point put into the magic resist bar.\n**[Regeneration]:** 5/7.5/10 Health and Mana Regeneration per second, increasing by 3/5/7 for every point put into the regeneration bar.\n\nThe Insanity Potion lasts for up to 20 seconds, and Poison Trail will be empowered for the entire duration.\n\n**Mana Cost:** 100 mana at all levels.\n**Cooldown:** 100/80/60 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Bromacia","date":"2017-04-20T00:25:19.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully understand where your coming from and i love the effort in this post. with all that damage you have him doing plus the fact that he is naturally {{item:3083}}  he would actually be exceedingly overpowered, right now he is great at lane proxy and pushing because chasing him is futile and that allows him to push without conseqence, the down side to him is he has little to know contribution to teamfights so thats what balances him out in my opinion.\n\nim trying to be constructive by saying that this kit is a wet dream but its simply too good for one champ like singed to have with {{item:3151}} , {{item:3116}} and {{item:3001}}  he will melt people and then grab a {{item:3027}} and he would be literally unstoppable and will melt you faster than a 21/0 {{champion:84}}","replies":[{"poster":"SuppLivesMatter","date":"2017-04-20T07:00:52.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair call, I could lower the damage values but I see where you're coming from. Thanks for the feedback though!","replies":[{"poster":"Bromacia","date":"2017-04-20T13:44:23.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm glad you didn't get offended, the damage values are a little high, factor a little better ratios for his abilities too you don't want him becoming a late game nuker","replies":[{"poster":"SuppLivesMatter","date":"2017-04-21T10:52:23.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not at all, concepts are about feedback after all! I took your advice and had a look at the ratios again. Q's AP Scaling was reduced, W's Base Damage and AP Scaling was reduced, E's AP Scaling was reduced, and I reduced the base Ability Power gained from putting points into AP for Insanity Potion. This would hopefully make Singed feel like his AP Scalings are there, but low enough to not make a serious impact in nuking enemies. Whereas the tank stats are much more beneficial when considering Singed a serious Top-Lane Tank.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
