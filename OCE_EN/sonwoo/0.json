I got flamed by my jungles for &quot;feeding&quot; when I had a even lane with Garen (was playing darius)\r\nAnd then I decided to ignore her for a while keeping my hope that we could win my ranked game. Then when we started losing, She lost my temper at me and then she started hardcore flaming me. She was the only one. I died for her she said I was inting. Soon after the game she reported me and a few hours later I realised I was perma banned. Is this really fair? People retaliate. And it&#039;s hard to stand back against especially in these kind of situations. I&#039;m confident that everyone has had this kind of situations\r\n\r\nRiot could u please get rid of my ban?\r\nIn kind regards&hearts;️","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-25T22:05:37.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a poll saying \"second chance\", but if you're perma banned you've already had 3-4 chances.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-26T00:31:42.442+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=QAPLA,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=k6d7omEy,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-25T22:05:37.928+0000)\n>\n> You have a poll saying &quot;second chance&quot;, but if you&#x27;re perma banned you&#x27;ve already had 3-4 chances.\n\nnot necessarily. the swear bots enforce skipping punishment tiers all the time.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-26T03:47:08.593+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically this.\n\nEscalated bans mean you can't really reliably say that someone deserves a perma, because it could be 1 bad word, and then a random \"toxicity\" ban","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T09:58:01.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If you want feedback on your ban from the community it's a good idea to post your reform card from the client.

I had Emailed a thousand words to Riot and hope them to understand all of this. I believe that your account has been banned because you certainly had a radical speech, not without reason that Riot would ban your account. But I have to say I agree with you, we all want to win in the rank game and hope that our efforts can be rewarded but sometimes there is always some lag game player to destroy our efforts, anger is inevitable, if someone can endure the anger and endure forever, I can only say that this person lost as a part of human. The game support said to me, the Riot will only deny the account, not deny the player, but I want to say that not every one of us can easily give up the account that we have worked for so long. I understand your feelings. At the same time, I also believe that Riot can create a game world without language violence, Riot can punish for language violence, but it is not necessary for language to cause a permanent ban.Using unauthorized third-party plugin, buying smurf can lead to permanent title, because this is fraud, even fraud in real life will also suffer because of the degree of legal judgment, but the language is not the same, I have never heard that any country would have sentenced me to jail because I had said dirty words","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-31T12:46:04.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as you'd like your account back, it won't happen. Riot knows people who get banned will make new accounts and it's harder than ever to get the champs you want now. So you'll be paying $ for the champs now. \n\nRiot should change their penalty system, and give us a GOD DAMN TRIBUNAL.","replies":[{"poster":"CooMing","date":"2018-01-31T14:14:56.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pretty agree with your last sentences, but if you think all players who got permanent ban can set a new account and continue to play LOL, then you are wrong, not everyone deserves to get this harsh punishment.
