Without seeing the ticket I'm not exactly sure what part of the process you are in, but it sounds like you've been asked all the account recovery questions. \n\nIt is also possible they have evidence that you may have been the one to take those actions resulting in or in part resulting in the 14 day suspension even if they account was under compromise. Evidently they have proved the purchases were made under compromise, hence the rollback there. Without the actual ticket we're lacking a lot of context, but the easiest way to find out what's going on, is just to ask them.","replies":[{"poster":"Email Support 47","date":"2019-01-31T02:50:07.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They never provided any evidence, I asked them to check IP logins/locations but they ignored this request. They basically just blamed me as being responsible for the suspension which is untrue since I haven't had access for over a year. \n\nYet the person that was accessing my account had purchased items/chests and playing games months before and leading up to the very day the 14 day suspension being handed out, yet they removed the items but not the suspension & honour level lock. Where is the logic in that? \n\nBelow are some of the ticket responses, as you can see they are not consistent in terms of what happened to my account, e.g they blame me as being the person responsible for earning the suspension but it's the same time as all the RP purchases on my account that they removed:\n\nREPTYLER\nJanuary 20th 2019, 12:15:40 am\nGreetings,\n\nAfter reviewing your information, it appears that there is a harmful program on your computer that may be allowing unauthorized access to your information. I urge you to scan your computer with anti-virus and anti-malware software to remove the program. After you have scanned your computer, please change the password for your e-mail account as well as your League of Legends account. We recommend that you use a strong, unique password that you don't share with anyone.\n\nFor more information on protecting your account, please check out the following Knowledge Base article and let me know if you have any questions:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751664\n\nDo take the time to perform the asked steps as it is imperative to ensure the account protection.\n\nWill be waiting for your reply.\n\n\"It's bananas!\"\n\nReptyler\nPlayer Support Specialist\n----------------------\nJanuary 20th 2019, 10:45:15 pm\nHey there, my friend!\n\nThank you for reaching out in regards to this.\n\nI went ahead and checked and it seems that this part has not been mentioned in the ticket where this matter has been taken care of, so I will clarify this for you here.\n\nAccount repair in means of items and such, are done due to having an impact on you - the owner of the account - alone. However, in means of punishments, since these are based on the behavior that has been displayed on the account in question, it's a matter that's affecting others, and this cannot be ignored.\n\nThus, I'm afraid that even if someone else played on your account when the suspension has been placed, it was the account that was at fault for the discomfort of others, so the suspension will not be removed. Please keep in mind that the security of your account and all actions taken on it are your responsibility.\n\nAlso, as a friendly note, please also keep in mind that after a Two Week Suspension, the system becomes far more sensitive to your in-game behavior and use of language, and even the tiniest display of negativity can lead to a permaban. Worry not, for players who report you have no effect upon this, as we do not punish players who did nothing wrong.\n\nHowever, any negativity display is to be avoided in order to not get the account permanently banned, so please be careful, ok? I'll be rooting for you and hope for this to not happen. May your nerves be of steel and may the mute button be abused in case someone is triggering you.\n\nI understand that this might be an unpleasant situation for your, but I also wish to mention that there are 9 more days to wait until you can get back on the Rift. So I hope that these days will pass swiftly for you, my friend.\n\nThank you for understanding and for your patience. If you have any other concerns, let me know.\n\nKindest regards,\n\n☽ RaynnTheDruid ☾\nPlayer Support Specialist\n---------------------------------------\nKARATHEEM\nJanuary 21st 2019, 3:34:20 am\nHey buddy.\n\nPrior to my colleague reaching out to you in regards to this we investigated the matter and checked to see what exactly happened the account. Our Player Behavior team was in charge of this, and unfortunately they were unable to find any signs of the account being compromised in such a manner that would lead us to believe that the suspension was unjustly placed. I know this probably isn't the answer you were looking forward to hear, however I'm afraid that we won't be able to alter or lift the ban. Should there be anything else we can help out with though that is unrelated to this matter, feel free to let us know.\n\nKaratheem\nPlayer Support Specialist\n\"If you're too big to be criticized, you're too small to be praised.\"\n-----------------------------------\nHARVESTEROFSOULS\nJanuary 30th 2019, 10:20:43 pm\nHey there,\n\nHarvester here.\n\nTerribly sorry for the delay - we've been dealing with a lot of tickets as of late. But I'm here now!\n\nIndeed, some repairs have been performed, returning the account to its original state - but worry not, none of your content has been removed.\n\nHope that helped clear things up. ^^\n\nThat said, if there's anything else I can do for you, do let me know.\n\nWish you a great Wednesday!\n\nHarvesterOfSouls,\nPlayer Support Specialist\n\n\"I like my weapons how I like my music... heavy and metal!\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-31T05:23:16.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support will rarely share such specific info with you, simply because if someone else (given your account was compromised) sees those tickets then they would have things like location info which is hardly what you want, it's also to prevent the same happening if the person submitting the ticket is not the original account owner and so on and so forth.\n\nStill lacking context given we don't know what questions you asked, but from those tickets it looks like these are the conclusions they've come to:\n\n*  You had a malicious program that may have exposed sensitive information and possibly resulted in compromise (for the record, this means League isn't the only thing that might have been compromised, time to change *all* your important passwords)\n*  You needed to secure your account, probably because there was evidence of people other than you being on the account, if not necessarily evidence of compromise (If you haven't yet done this, do it ASAP)\n*  The account had punishments issued against it because it was negatively affecting *other* players. It was the kind of punishment that would typically be removed in compromise scenarios, but there are exceptions which I'll talk about in a sec.\n*  The evidence that the behaviour that resulted in punishment was done under compromise was not complete, in other words, there was doubt that that behaviour was undertaken by someone accessing your account without permission.\n*  \"Repairs\" were made to the account, I'm really not sure what such things would entail, you'd be better off asking for details.\n\nSo the exceptions. Typically, if an account is found to be cheating, being toxic, etc while under compromise, those punishments will be reversed once the account is secured, however in some cases such is not appropriate. Such cases include (but are not limited to) things like:\n\n*  Your account has been compromised multiple times, and you haven't made the effort to secure it.\n*  You have shared your account.\n*  Your account has been compromised multiple times, and you have actively given out access again.\n*  The account was not originally yours (belonged to a friend, sibling, was bought etc)\n*  The compromise was done by someone who cannot be accurately distinguished from you, or proven to be accessing the account without your permission (i.e friend, sibling, etc)\n\nObviously only player support has the whole story here, since we can't see all the backend stuff as players on boards, and it sounds like they've probably made their final decision, but there's no harm in asking for more context.","replies":[{"poster":"Email Support 47","date":"2019-01-31T05:54:46.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They should at least ask for my location and IP address to compare to the IP address used to login when the offenses were happening.\n\nNot once did the Riot support staff tell me that my account had been compromised before or multiple times, they have just stuck to their guns saying the suspension was not unjust.\n\nI haven't received a single email from Riot since 2013, so I wouldn't be notified of anything happening to my account.\n\nRiot knows that somebody was using my account without permission since they were purchasing items with their own credit card, which they removed those items from my account. These purchases were being made since November 2018 until the end of December 2018, with games being played from that date until the suspension was handed out on 15.1.19\n\nSo Riot is aware my account was compromised, they are aware someone was accessing it without permission and buying items and playing games during that period.\n\nBut it's my fault for not receiving emails from Riot about this activity?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-31T06:31:27.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems likely that there was some form of account sharing involved. Whether that was someone you shared the account with, or a sibling or friend who knew your password, or someone that a person you shared the account with in the past shared it on to.\n\nFor them to give you that sort of answer from the info you have given, tells me there was probably evidence of account sharing somewhere along the line, even if the recent activity wasn't strictly with your permission. When an account is shared it drastically reduces the steps Riot can take to protect it.\n\nI agree that we need 2FA yesterday, but sharing accounts makes things real tricky. The sharing itself isn't actively punished, even if it's technically against the ToS, but it opens a lot of vulnerabilities and opportunities for harm.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
