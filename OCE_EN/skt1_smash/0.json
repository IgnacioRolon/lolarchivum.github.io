I am currently level 11 and am wondering if anyone is up for a few games. It would be even greater if we had team skins (SKT, TSM, FNATIC, BLOOD MOON, ETC) but it would be fun just to have a buddy to win every game with. Add me in game / comment if you would like in!\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"punchybrah","date":"2015-12-16T01:50:25.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!!
