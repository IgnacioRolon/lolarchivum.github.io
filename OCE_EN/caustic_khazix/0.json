He dared a look behind him, his fragile eyes erupting with pain as blue fell from the sky. It seemed that they had stopped chasing – at least, for now.\n\nWithout the urgency of the chase, the hunger returned.\n\nAll at once it hit him in a wave. Kha’zix growled, collapsing as it gnawed at him, combining with the searing, alien pain until-\n“I think I heard him over here!”\n\nThe hunger and the pain became bearable at the sound of prey. Slowly, painfully, Kha’zix rose from where he had collapsed, moving with a silent grace as he hid himself in a mess of strange, flexible and green terrain.\n\nOne of them was closing in. He could hear the single strident footsteps moving towards him as he waited, hunger and anticipation lending him the strength to hold out against the pain. \n\nWhen it had almost reached him Kha’zix stepped out of the painful world, the greens and browns melting into purples and greys as the pain melted into a staggering relief that threatened to paralyse him. \n\nIt took all the fortitude he could muster to move, to position himself behind it before he would inevitably phase away from the comfort of his home.\n\nPain returned with the sheets of blue that rained down on his body as the alien greens and browns appeared once again. He was behind the grey carapace, whose long, thin and straight spike was stuck into the ground so it could kneel forward and inspect the depressed silhouette that Kha’zix had left in the green.\n\nIn an instant, Kha’zix was upon it. He was weak, but the impetus of his leap knocked it to the ground with a loud crash and a cry of surprise. Quickly, he finished it, piercing the unprotected neck with his claws.\n\nThe hunger urged him to consume it, to pick apart its shell and adopt it as his own, but Kha’zix resisted. The others would be here soon. He dragged the carapace away, hooking his claws around the thing’s appendages and bringing it to the deep, gurgling blue that could hide a creature’s trail.\n\nWith a small growl of exertion, Kha’zix threw the body into the blue, then steeled himself before leaping in after it.\n\nHe fought both panic and pain as the blue enveloped him. It seeped through his own carapace, burning and chilling to the bone. Kha’zix focused on the body in front of him, doing his best to ignore the pain. _Soon_, he told himself. \n\n_Soon I will feast._\n________________________________________\n\nKha’zix crouched over the body, trying to identify where the shell might open and reveal the flesh inside. He had already attempted to consume it, but it was constructed of an alien material that neither his claws nor his teeth could pierce. Perhaps he’d be able to consume it from the inside, adapt the resistance to blue and green alongside the impenetrable qualities of the carapace.\n\nThe anatomy of these creatures puzzled him. Its shell didn’t cling to its body as a good carapace should, rather it seemed to fit loosely around its body, and-\n\nThe thing’s skull wasn’t connected to the body. Leaning forward, Kha’zix hooked his claws around the base of the bone and jerked upward. It flew off, revealing brown fur and exposed flesh. \n\nKha’zix rushed to the skull, puzzling over the strange, detaching bone and the fur underneath as he gingerly inspecting its insides with his claws and teeth. Nothing. The interior was just as hard and impenetrable as the outside.\n\nIrritated, he turned back to the exposed flesh. Perhaps if it couldn’t give him a strong carapace, then it could give him sharper eyes to see with or ears to hear with – or even information about this world. The other, smaller creatures he had consumed were frustratingly dim-witted; most of the information he garnered was useless and animalistic, answering none of his questions.\n\nKha’zix picked at the head, discovering yet another layer of bone beneath its flesh and a set of sensory organs on its front. He consumed these first, though despite the fear that these creatures engendered over others, their senses were weak, hardly worth the effort compared to those of the smaller creatures.\n\nNext, the complex mass of flesh that Kha’zix had come to understand would hold this creature’s information. He carefully sliced through the second skull, consuming its contents.\n\nA strange sensation shot through Kha’zix brain and body, his limbs locking and tensing as information flooded his mind. These creatures. They were not like the others. He understood now, why these… humans engendered such fear. They had an intelligence, an awareness that he had thought only belonged to the… the void?\n\nYes. That was what they called it.\n\nAlien, yet impossibly familiar memories flooded him, combining into a cacophony of strange emotions and sights that were impossibly different to the hunger, the thrill of the hunt. Memories of… childhood. Learning to wield a spear. Of chasing a purple, grotesque insectoid that they called a voidreaver through grass - not green but grass. Not blue but water.\n\nAnd the information. There was so much stored here! He now knew that what he had thought a carapace was in fact armour; an amalgamation of metals and sometimes even magic that supposedly protected those inside from creatures like himself. He knew now how to unlock this armour, how to access the body inside, but also that the rest of its body was weak, useless. The only advantage these things had over others were their minds. It was admirable, almost, that these things had taken over the world with just their-\n\nA wave of hunger enveloped Kha’zix. He needed more. More of this glorious ecstasy of thought, of these… emotions.\nRising, Kha’zix processed it all. Not too far from here there was a farm. This one – no, Ansel’s farm. There would be more humans – a family there. A family of a wife and a child, of defenseless humans.\n\nHe ran, faster than ever before – though not because of an adaption of the legs but of an adaption of willpower, of excitement, of understanding.\n\nIt was almost sunrise when he arrived at the orderly brown landscape of the farm. Even at this time of day, it was likely that Aya would be up and about, quite possibly waiting for Ansel to come back from a long night of hunting.\n\nThe sight of the farm and the knowledge that there it contained vulnerable prey caused the hunger to rise within him, stronger than ever before. He stepped into the void, wasting precious seconds as he recoiled from the array of harsh, purple and hostile lights that greeted him. Scrambling to recover time, he barely made it to the barn by the time he phased back into the soft brown landscape of Ionia.\n\nGathering himself and shaking away the visceral terror that had overcome him, Kha’zix stepped around the barn, hiding himself in the house’s blind spots as he made his way to a window. He could hear Aya singing softly beyond the pane of glass, could picture her soft features and her dark hair.\n\nThe glass shattered into pieces and the singing into screams as Kha’zix leapt through the window and slammed his shoulder into her body, driving her to the ground in a mess of flailing limbs.\n\nKha’zix reveled in her fear, pinning her to the ground with his legs as he raised his claws, ready to end her terrific, piercing cries. He swung downwards, claws aimed at her heart, where they would surely –\n\nThe cries intensified, pain now mixing with fear as his claws pierced her the shoulders.\n\nKha’zix froze, another sound – a child’s scream – piercing his ears. Horrified, he withdrew his claws, somehow eliciting even greater cries of pain from the women as he stared the bloodied tips of his claws with dread. A wave of emotions flooded him. Anguish. Disgust. Remorse. But more than that. Fleeting images… smells… the strange and yet wonderful sensation of another’s lips pressed against his own.\n\nFor the first time, Kha’zix truly studied his prey. No. His victim. His… Ansel’s love.\n\nThe hunger slammed him. A wall of visceral, primitive urges shoving against the tirade of swirling feelings building inside of him. He pressed his head into his arms, not sure if he should expect to see claws, or hands or-\n\nKha’zix could taste the creature’s fear. Feel its body squirming beneath him. He leaned over her, reveling in the acrid smell of the thing’s sweat and the cries of the thing’s child.\n\nThe hunger always won.\n\n***","replies":[]}
