His ultimate, instead of making a circle of rock, would make a Colosseum and cheering noises while it is up.. His E, instead of being a flag, would be a head on a pike or something. I hope you like my idea and thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-02T17:00:49.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dragonslayer needs a VU it's out of date.
