She had not killed him. No, it would be better to take him to Karma, or perhaps Shen, to find out why a Noxian was on Ionian soil. The less ammunition she gave Irelia the better. Noxian or no, the warden of Ionia would all too happily condemn Ahri for draining the life essence of the man.\n\nA raw wave of fury ran through Ahri, making her fur bristle. She did not choose how to live. She did not choose what she needed to feed on any more than an Ionian chose to be born Ionian.\n\nNothing she ever did would be good enough to please Irelia.\n\n_And it never will._\n\nAhri whirled at the malicious whisper that floated through the air, dancing along her skin like the icy breath of Freljord. No, colder than that. Not even the icy winds of the Howling Abyss could trickle into her very soul. \n\n&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she demanded, claws flared. &ldquo;Did the Noxian dog come with a friend, for once?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Noxians have no friends. Do you?&rdquo; The ethereal voice was heard this time, a dissonant, disharmonious echo of voices all talking over one another. Beyond it all was the rattle of chains and Ahri sensed the alluring draw of countless spirits all in one spot.\n\nSo hypnotizing that she actually took a step forward before she caught herself, forcing herself back.\n\n&ldquo;Thresh.&rdquo; Ahri cast her eyes about at the thick Ionian forests, strangely darkest right before the coming dawn. _That_ was the chill she felt. The same unease that champions claimed filled the air of the Twisted Treeline. A wrongness. More than that, however, was the implications of Thresh&#039;s presence. This was not the Institute of War. This was not the Rift. If he slew her here, death would be permanent. &ldquo;How are you in Ionia?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Am I here?&rdquo; A soft chuckle. &ldquo;Are you sure, fox? Perhaps it is _you_ who are with _me_.&rdquo;\n\nThe words sent a chill down Ahri&rsquo;s spine, making her tails flare in an animalistic instinct, trying to make herself look bigger before a threatening force. Somehow they played on a fear Ahri had never truly given voice to, a fear that made her refuse to acknowledge that the air of the Twisted Treeline didn&rsquo;t bother her all too greatly. \n\nA fear that she might not belong to the forests of Ionia. \n\nThat she had been kindled in the wrong place.\n\nToo many times Ahri had looked upon a fallen foe and drank deep of their spirit essence with a gusto that frightened her, but only afterwards. At the time she was simply lost to the euphoric bliss of devouring life. Someone&rsquo;s life. A person&rsquo;s life. Whenever she devoured the vitality another needed to live, there was more than the fact that she needed it to survive.\n\nShe _enjoyed_ it.\n\nA fact so at odds with the Ionian way of life.\n\nThresh&rsquo;s disembodied head floated out of the darkness before her and pulled her from her thoughts and back into the startling reality of his presence. The green fire of his inner spirit burning through the empty eye sockets and cast dancing shadows around her. His laughter looped around her limbs, binding her in invisible, burning chains. Her skin prickled unpleasantly. Pain emerging from no source. Her mind scrambled to make sense of the madness even as Thresh approached her.\n\n&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Her voice was a thready whisper.\n\nThe vicious smile on the leering skull deepened. &ldquo;You called to me.&rdquo;\n\nAhri shook her head in desperate denial, eyes going painfully wide. &ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Your suffering. Your anguish. Your _hunger_.&rdquo; The tendrils behind his head danced like fingers. &quot;_Delicious_.&quot;\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo; Ahri broke free of those invisible bonds and whirled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re lying!&rdquo;\n\nThresh&rsquo;s hook sailed past Ahri, striking her shoulder and sending her sprawling. The massive wrought blade buried itself in the flank of a tree, the chain going taught, barring her escape. Ahri scrambled to her feet and turned, coming nose-to-skull with Thresh. She froze, a prey animal rather than a predator. Thresh&rsquo;s jaw opened, green fire licking along her skin. Movement out of the corner of her eye had her glancing to see him bring the lantern up, so close that she could have rested her cheek against it. Immediately the pull of the essences within made her dizzy, drunk on the raw life force that exuded from the wrought metal cage. She trembled as ghost claws danced over her face, threatening to break through her skin.  Her tails fell from the air, the fox lacking the strength to hold them up. She could not look away from the lantern. \n\n_Embrace yourself_. The words echoed in her mind and slithered into her soul. _I know your true nature_.\n\nHer clawed hand came up, the green light dancing along her skin as her fingers reached for the swirling vortex of spirit essence. Of souls. She felt the Ionian forest fall away. The trees warped in on themselves. A mist curled along her limbs and around her ankles. Biting air grabbed at her like hands, peeling away her skin and baring the ravening beast within.\n\n_Embrace_.\n\nThe temptation was so delicious, so sweet. She could _taste_ their essence.\n\nA shadow of a face appeared in the lantern. A soft, feminine scream tickled the back of Ahri&rsquo;s mind. Pain. Fear. Anguish. The taste of the essence turned to ash on her tongue, fouled by suffering.\n\nAhri ripped herself away from Thresh, stumbling backwards. No matter what she was, she did not covet the torment of others. Thresh reared up, ripping the hook out of the tree and returning it to his hand. Green fire blazed. Ahri closed her eyes and lifted her chin. She was not a creature of the Isles! If he was to kill her, so be it, but she would die an Ionian!\n\n&quot;You cannot run from your very nature, soul-eater. You belong with us.&quot;\n\n&ldquo;I will hear no more of this, Chain Warden!&rdquo; she shouted, covering her ears in desperation, eyes still closed. Foxfire blossomed around her.\n\n When there came no reply, Ahri cracked first one eye, then the other. The forest around her was no longer lit by green fire, but with the warm pink hue of the breaking dawn. Thresh, as expected, was gone. After a few seconds the fire winked away, leaving Ahri standing alone in the clearing with the unconscious Noxian spy. She glanced down at her shoulder, where no injury lay. A dream? Her hand stroked the unmarred skin. The ramifications chilled Ahri. So vivid. So real.\n\n_Why_?\n\nA crack of a twig made Ahri shout and whirl, lifting her orb to throw it at the intruder.\n\nA whirl of blades appeared before Irelia, violence a hair-trigger away.\n\n&ldquo;_Stand down_.&rdquo;\n\nAhri immediately obeyed as Karma appeared on the scene behind Irelia, glancing at the fallen Noxian.\n\n&ldquo;Good work, Ahri. You intercepted our prey.&rdquo;\n\nIrelia&rsquo;s glare did not falter from Ahri even as she lowered her weapon. The fox wondered, briefly, if Irelia&rsquo;s face was frozen like that.\n\n&ldquo;And he lives. Excellent. We can interrogate him.&rdquo; Karma turned to look at Irelia expectantly.\n\n&ldquo;Surprising,&rdquo; the other Ionian woman murmured as she hoisted the Noxian spy on her shoulder. &ldquo;Here I was thinking the fox would have simply sucked the life out of him instead.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I am not some mindless killer, Irelia,&rdquo; snapped Ahri. &ldquo;As I have told you many times.&rdquo;\n\nIrelia cast an arch stare over her unburdened shoulder. &ldquo;_Yet_.&rdquo;\n\nKarma sighed but did not condemn Irelia&rsquo;s words, an omission that cut Ahri deeply. Even those that did not necessarily agree never spoke out in her defense. Wu, the only person Ahri would call &lsquo;friend&rsquo;, had also been decidedly muted in his defense of her of late. When Karma and Irelia left with their quarry, Ahri was once again enveloped by the loneliness of the woods around her. \n\nShe clenched a fist.\n\n_I do not need any of them._\n\nEars lowering, Ahri spun on one heel to vanish into the forest, trying to put the stinging pain in her chest behind her. As she did, however, something on a tree caught her attention. An eerie shadow thrown by the growing light, where the golden rays of the Ionian dawn failed to illuminate a deep, vicious gash in the trunk. Almost against her will, Ahri reached out and touched the fractured wood. As soon as her fingers made contact with the bark Thresh&rsquo;s high-pitched cackle rang through the trees. Ahri glanced over her shoulder, but the Chain Warden was not there. Instead, his parting words whispered through her mind again.\n\n_You belong with us._","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T14:01:54.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always love reading an Ahri story.
