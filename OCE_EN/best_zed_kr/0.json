Blast in the past would basically allow us to play the old SR maps and champs from a previous season, for example: Blast from the past season 2 would allow us to play on the S2 map as well as allowing us to use champions during their season 2 state such as Jax (90% dodge chance), Kassadin (RIP silence) and Yi(AP Yi) and the items and summoner spells would also be available. Post season 2 champions would also be allowed on the game mode as it would be interesting how over/underpowered they would be with S2 items.\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-19T13:45:41.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would take a helluva long time to make.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Zed KR","date":"2015-04-19T13:47:25.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUT IMAGINE THE FUN!!!!{{champion:17}}","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-19T17:57:31.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it would also take forever to switch between each map and to get back the old maps, the servers would be soooooo laggy!!! its a okay idea but lets be honest here, it would take to long and not many people would want that really bad looking season 2 map back, it would be a pretty quiet gamemode","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-20T11:13:31.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, I wish I was around during season 1 - 2...
