It took me a while to do this, but here it is :)\nFeel free to post any improvements. I know it&#039;s rough but I made him up on the spot.

Sona shouldn't be the only one with damage reduction, but I see that similarity now :). And Varus' ult doesn't buff CC, nor does his Q require a charge up. In my opinion; \n-his Q is like a Tahm Kench Q, combined with Puppeteer from the Black Market Brawlers event.\n-his W is like Sona's passive + W, as well as old Fiora's E and a damage boost.\n-his E is like old Rengar's (I should change it a little to make it more distinctive from that)\n-and his R is like Volibear's ult without splash damage, as well as a phage passive, and a Rengar's full passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-01-06T09:43:07.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure he means 80 ad 10 lifesteal and 20 crit","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-08T07:35:32.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do, I fixed it up so you can't get confused.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
