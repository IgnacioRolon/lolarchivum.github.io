I keep getting bugsplat telling me to upgrade and download something (intel(R) update utility) from the site mentioned in the title line, and after 7-9 bug splats I finally tried it. www.intel.com It worked wonderfully and I had less lag than usual for a day but I still couldn&#039;t connect to those weekly game modes and the thumbnail pictures for siege mode items aren&#039;t showing. Then my ms started spiking from a regular 50ms-70ms to 95ms-2000ms the next day :/? I just want to know whether any body else has  had this problem? I haven&#039;t seen spikes that pointy for 3-5 months or that 2012 server attack on na.","replies":[]}
