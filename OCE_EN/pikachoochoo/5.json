Obviously choosing to play with people you understand gives you an advantage, but it's the same principle as someone who practices CSing in customs vs someone who doesn't.\n\nThe solo player *could* take the time to add people from their games who they liked/play well with to play in a team for those S ranks, or they could choose to take the disadvantage because they prefer to play solo.\n\n>maybe ARAM's not balanced because people follow metas so hard\n\nARAM isn't balanced because champions aren't designed for ARAM, they're designed for SR. A champion like Morgana that has powerful team-fighting potential is going to do much better in ARAM than a champion like Kha'Zix who is designed for pick comps just by virtue of their base design.\n\nTwisted Treeline faces some of the same problems, but the fact that you can *pick* from the roster of champions that are effective in TT removes or mitigates most of them because it evolves it's own meta. ARAM doesn't have that luxury.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-06T05:01:05.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so anti \"elitism\" by rewarding people the same rate for pile jumping people who don't have enough trustworthy friends???? That's kinda lame. I don't get why you're mentioning cs, I personally don't like the starter meta (+ none permanent pots or people who buy control wards without a healthy enough lead with the luxury to) so I just buy 2 faerie charms usually on a long range poke spam support and a refillable potion with caster runes and prevent enemies from cs or even xp if they don't adapt then sometimes get the gold item to make grouchy allies happy -.- even though there's already a 7 or more kill lead to surpass worrying about somebody getting our bounty gold. Just don't get Q on Khaz then until it's the last upgrade and max W (if there's some untrustworthy allies + tank runes) or upgrade evenly with e but even without the bonus isolation dmg or passive it's still a nice amount (I don't know the range for triggering isolation dmg or if it's based on sight or the distance between champions in range) and you could just get Q once if you want to trigger an item like sheen or shojins.
