I  wish I recorded that match, it was me playing as Alistar, a ballerina Viktor and a piggybacking tankish Olaf I think xD There use to be an option where you could report somebody for being a noob :/ Yes.

I REALLY hope Riot doesn't have backstabbers. Sometimes I feel like somebody doesn't like how I build boring but op builds that tank hard or turning ad champions like Varus into an ad caster that's hard to reach who can take off 3-4/5 worth of  hp off an enemy caster with a well aimed Q cast.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-18T02:45:04.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting that lying bug again.

It's definitely not my connection because I had two smooth matches before those then lastly, I tried to make a custom match to change my settings to see if I could turn pings off but that just froze me in load screen too and I had to turn everything off. I've reported this problem before like once for pings but it wasn't this severe and the rest is pretty much the same but worse than before now -.- I'm almost at 5+ reports on the same thing towards Riot support. I feel so stalked. I even report everybody now just in case my allies are doing it X...X I even had to button smash just to prevent afk kicking me out. ","replies":[]}]}
