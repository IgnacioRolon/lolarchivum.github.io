I'm just putting this post up for anybody from Adelaide to be watchful :/ I'm genuinely extra disturbed because he/she kept spamming Poppy with roses emoji. I don't know who exactly was causing the lag, he/she just seemed the most likely because of coincidence","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-06T04:39:29.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"eh, sorry for the late reply, wasn't really leaning towards money (if you meant Riot), just that years ago a noob feeder on NA raged at me for me warning him/her ahead of time before things happened and telling him/her off like a parent repeatedly in-game, he/she then threatened to have me banned because he/she claimed to know Riot staff and I did get banned for 3 days, and I still think saying the obvious and typing warnings repeatedly stoically in chat because somebody's repeatedly not listening or purposely being stubborn and tilting by not accepting tips, isn't flaming (it was ranked too -.-). I quit LoL for  like 1-2 years after that bs. Then there's those randoms repeatedly spamming penguin emojis and penguin with shades emojis ingame (mainly ARAM) because I have a penguin profile picture on another site, wink spam, all behaving the same (e.g dancing instead of helping, afking, griefing, idly watching, running when not in danger, etc) and talking fruitilly like they're trying to make me a bad guy for being straight (nothing against fruity people but it is hypocrisy if they can be fruity then try to annoy others that aren't against it to be fruity)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-06T05:36:43.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RE the 3 day ban, I can't exactly comment on specifics without the logs, but \"telling someone off like a parent repeatedly\" generally isn't welcome.\n\nRE the penguin emotes.

The worse was 75 splits and only 1-2 out of all the matches in the past 4 days would let the team know if they wanted s rank to legitimatize their reason for splitting, otherwise the majority just kept splitting instead of just ending in RANKED https://ibb.co/qWHWmMf Now I feel like a public troll finder talisman + this https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/kB5tm0y9-i-downloaded-a-match-due-to-a-toxic-person-for-the-5th-match-today-in-ranked-but-its-not-even","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-06T20:27:10.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, is that demon emperor guy annoying????

It can also easily be caused by an issue between you and the League servers (think ISP type issues) rather than at one end or the other. If it's nothing on your end, checking your ISPs service status page is always a good and easy next step.\n\nThe chance of it being caused by another player is basically nil. It's not technically *impossible*, but practically speaking it may as well be. It would probably be easier for them to compromise your account and get it banned, which assuming you're safe with your passwords and don't share the account, also doesn't fall anywhere close to the category of \"easy\".\n\nThreats (or allusions to) on the other hand are taken very seriously, and if you are concerned you can pass the report on to player support for evaluation. Could be nothing, and just someone who thinks it's funny (which it totally isn't), but serious threats can end in law enforcement getting involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-10-21T03:35:25.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still paranoid of corrupt Riot staff lol >.&lt;","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-21T09:11:16.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dare I ask why?\n\nWhatever you think of their money-making methods of late or the other controversies circling, they haven't exactly given us reason to believe they would tamper with games, even if doing it in such a specific manner for a single player on a tiny server were practically possible or worthwhile (which it's really not).","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-06T04:41:02.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=NBhEWAwE,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2019-10-21T09:11:16.968+0000)\n>\n> Dare I ask why?\n> \n> Whatever you think of their money-making methods of late or the other controversies circling, they haven't exactly given us reason to believe they would tamper with games, even if doing it in such a specific manner for a single player on a tiny server were practically possible or worthwhile (which it's really not).\n\ndid you mean this???? https://www.facebook.com/nasdaily/videos/the-chinese-money-trap/2154074531573487/","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
