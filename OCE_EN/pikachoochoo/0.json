(don't read after this, mostly rant and reminders in case they pull bullshit onto me except for the last sentence). Oh look, a good start as Ashe then 3 slowly soft tilt, support stops following up and the positive jungler that didn't gank much keeps trying to solo. Then a Yuumi holds gold for too long 2-3 items only to waste it all on heal meta when allies are wasting the heals. Oh look a support that wont poke much, full mana nearly 9min  out of 14min in laning. Oh 1-2 holding spells to last hit and 1 leaves after feeding. Yay 3-4 holding spells to last hit instead of just helping even though I'm spamming 24/7 as lethality Varus (1/3 to 1/4hp chunk dmg Q arrows maxed). Great, 2 funny name people leave without a word. Oh look, too many aoes to assassin or bruiser in, I'll go 500mr Jax n tank lead for my team only to have 2-3 not help on purpose or run away from nothing 3-7 times each. So many aoes again, oh look 1 leaves because my maxed shield is protecting allies from 550+ dmg as Lux (only got Q once until last upgrade, 6-10 minutes into the match, it counts towards srank right???) but it doesn't matter, the 3 remaining keep risking getting hit by skillshots. Yay adc but only 1 peels for me the whole match 2/3 into the game. Oh no, a team full of people who like underage children (club tag) all behaving weirdly even though I'm 100% crit Yi with duskblade, stormrazor, static n etc. Oh, it's that bot troll again and it seems to have an ap friend that's built 3 warmongers to clean up without doing the work instead of helping kill enemies by being ap. Another bot feeder and Yuumi wasting gold on heal meta. Leaver and 1-2 \"new\" players. YAY, a great match but there's 1 person who won't die to use his 4-6k gold over 14-16 minutes and gives the enemy team a chance to fight instead of winning in 9-14 minutes by making us underpowered even though I'm crit Rengar with maxed Q and 100% crit by 8-11 minutes. Oh no, him/her again, holding gold too long again. Leaver but he/she claimed to need to go to school. Buncha soft tilters or greedy people again. Yay, I'm carrying with 2-5X the dmg of my allies, not counting the troll pretending to be a bot again (4th time) but it doesn't matter, 1 griefs after I kill 3 champs solo and the \"bot\" keeps building guinsooses until it has 3. I haven't named any players! Long story short has anybody else pissed off lazy xp farmers (bot users) or ruined the accreditation of boosters to the point that they take turns trying to make you rage quit as allies on your own team -.-","replies":[{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2019-12-08T16:54:03.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The enter key is your friend!","replies":[]}]}
