Not to mention, it wouldn't work very well if they could as such a system would be easily abusable (like Buttsubushi said, kill all processes/tun off modem/turn off computer would show as \"seemingly unintentional\").\n\nEven if you did get reported, you should be fine. It takes more than one match (even if reported by 9 people in that match) for leavebuster to take *any* action, except (perhaps) in extreme cases. The leavebuster system accounts for occasional unintentional disruptions that the average person might experience, and in my experience it works just fine (I've probably racked up 1-2 dozen \"leaves\" from things out of my control over the 3+ years I've been playing and have never been punished).","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-06-20T20:02:15.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-15T02:19:12.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can relate to the feeling of panic that comes over you when your power outs and you're mid game.
