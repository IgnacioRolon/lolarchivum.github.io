Because some matches feel like I'm feeding kids by helping 24/7 and getting people fed even if they troll (e.g they wait to last hit until helping or wait for allies to die first) then they still get s-rank when I practically grew them into a beast 1/3 to half way into the match and their behavior. Does anybody remember when you use to get s-rank for helping so much and you weren't even in a custom team and just solo queuing or was that a bug? Oops, wrong section, sort of, it sort of counts for half of it though.","replies":[]}
