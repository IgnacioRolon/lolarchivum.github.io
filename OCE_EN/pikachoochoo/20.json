Does anybody else get this bug or still see mini buffs in TFT that aren't visible by animation or trait except playing so much that you notice the dps or mitigation is a bit weird still based off the hp bar? Will the yordles, pirates, and dragons, ninjas and whoever else I might have forgotten ever return too, just wondering. https://ibb.co/CVFN6Rb https://ibb.co/7zxGQsY &lt;- time lapse. So I couldn't report anybody in the end results lobby for the 4th-7th time but weirdest of all is 2-4 times I've seen the weird tiny bonus buff on my team and I call myself out ingame because I'm not a cheating butthole.
