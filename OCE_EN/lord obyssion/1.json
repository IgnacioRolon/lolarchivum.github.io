I like sweet drinks and such but sweet food I don't really like much lollies, chocolate, iced cake etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-16T02:25:19.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have breakfast at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-15T21:40:59.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two eggs, two slices of cheese and two slices of bread for breakfast...\n%%%% I'm still hungry.","replies":[]}]}
