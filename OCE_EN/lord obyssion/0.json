So how do you counter your team you ask? /shrug\r\n\r\nEvery season I make silver 1 for my series to get into gold 5. Last season I quit entirely to go play CS:GO and when I came back I was decayed to silver 5. After doing my 10 match making games I was placed in Bronze 2 \"fair enough\" and I thought it would be a piece of cake to get myself out of wood tier considering they are bronze right? but you have to take into account that you also have bronze players on your own team. I'm not really saying that new players are bad because that would be fairly toxic\r\n\r\nI would like to however point out that considering I am roughly a gold 5 skilled player who started from season 2 and even I am having difficulties getting out of bronze. Infact I was demoted to bronze 3 hahahaha...   shit.. :( \r\n\r\nThis screen shot is my regular score.. it's nothing special for a fiddlesticks but yeah we lost and it happens ALOT.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-02T02:41:25.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nIt looks like you had an annoying game with a troll (dat ez though). It is frustrating that some games are unwinnable. BUT you shouldn't focus on these rare unwinnable games, dont let them put you on tilt.\n\n> Here is a visual guide on how carrying can't help you win games.\n\nYou say the above statement but when I look at your history out of your past 8 fiddlesticks games you have won 6. It's pretty clear your fiddle is good and you're carrying no problem? I am confused as to why you chose this one game to make a generalized statement about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-01T15:29:25.919+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick someone who can not only team fight but can push lanes and take towers relatively quickly.\n\nIts all well and good going 4 for 5 in a teamfight. but if your the last man standing as fiddle you aren't going to be threatening the enemy nexus anytime soon.\n\nOnce you hit an elo where you feel you no longer need to (or can't) solo carry, then you can bring out the other \"helping the team\" picks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Obyssion","date":"2015-02-02T06:10:22.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly! recently I've been looking into Rammus top (sounds funny) but it's been working quite well in bronze I found. He does decent damage to most melee a part from Jax and Darius, I can tank so I get to choose when to initiate but that's even if my team will join in lol it's funny watching them run away sometimes. His ult can kill turrets too which I didn't know and I smash them down pretty fast. He's a lot of fun and I may use him to get out of bronze or heimerdinger mid.\n\nThank you again for your advice!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-02-01T16:44:10.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you built a liandries against 5 squishies instead of full ap?\n\nYour garen had a positive score who almost built correctly and your MF had the most cs in the game and maxed build.\n\nYou had 4 people on your team who maxed build and one obvious troll.\n\nAm I missing something because apparently you had more than half a team who were doing more than afk, it also looks like by your kda and your lack of damage from your items against your opponents that you were on clean up duty.\n\nIt looks like you actually went in after everyone else already initiated and got most of the kills after your team initiated.\n\nIf you really want to see an unwinnable game check this one out in my promos.\n\nIn this game i equaled over 79% of the enemy teams combined cs and got over 71% of my teams kills.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-02T00:53:25.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your garen had a positive score who almost built correctly\n\nyes yes, garen needs that on hit mana return item....sure it gives AD and lifesteal, but hydra/BT is infinitely better on melee and BT is infinitely better on ranged. let alone the fact the mana return does nothing for garen.

The best part about being in bronze is that it doesn't matter how much you die you can experiment, try tower diving with a new champion or just learn counter jungling (what your boundaries are) it can be fun and it can teach you a lot more rather than being to afraid to try new things because you don't want to lose games.\n\nThe choice is yours but I do wish you luck in your games!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-01T15:04:15.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then there is the fact that other people who don't belong in Bronze may be on the enemy team.

Although it looks like I am winning the majority of my games I am still only gaining 16 points per win and losing 21 points per loss.  \nThe problem here is that in bronze people are over extending to often, not warding or warding correctly (poor placement) building incorrectly (I can't talk because of my build but that was a last minute thing I changed as an attempt to counter 5 people on my nexus)\n\nThey aren't sure on how to initiate or team fight for that matter I find that they are unsure of who to focus or how to use their abilities to peel etc etc. Above all of those things they don't communicate or listen which makes it very difficult. I'm not frustrated don't get me wrong I have a good laugh and I think it's cute mainly because they are new players I'm assuming and I do like to teach people. I know I wont be in bronze for long.\n\nI posted this for a bit of fun, not to complain. As for the ezrael he wasn't trolling he just gave up at the very last minute. I have sympathy for peoples frustration. Somehow I am wondering though if we can reach a wider audience to teach people how to play just like that aus chatroom that was opened a while ago that had diamond players mentoring new players.\n\nAs for veni vidi vici the screenshot is just evidence of how difficult it \"can\" be so your comment is contradictory to other discussions. \nIt reminds me much of when bronze players were teaming up with platinums to carry games and if you sent Riot a complaint\n\nThey would reply with \"We're sorry you're having this difficulty but rank does not determine skill.\" \nwhere as most people would say that it does, so who is right? That is why they put a cap on the gap now.
