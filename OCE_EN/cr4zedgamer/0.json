If you're having an issue with adcs who build lord dominicks you either need to consider building some more hp, thornmail so they suffer as well, or an item with coldsteel to reduce their attack speed.\n\nThey nerfed flat armour pen since it was unhealthy on assassins since it was exceptionally good earlygame and for killing squishies and not very useful for killing tanks. Hence why lethality is now basically scaling armour pen.\n\n% armour pen is very useful for killing tanks but won't do much against a squishy. Lord Dominicks isn't all that useful against a target with similar hp and already almost no armour. Against squishies you'd get more out of just building another ad or atkspeed item compared to the armour pen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-11-25T16:40:25.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cr4zedgamer,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=B9NEPEal,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-11-25T01:00:27.302+0000)\n>\n> still leaves the question why wasnt it changed if it does just as much if not more than normal armor pen, and if so adc champs can build this mid game to destroy tanks\n\nit is meant as an item to shred tanks unlike flat ar pen which was meant to be used against squishy targets with low armor imagine hitting a 3000hp 300 ar malph as an adc that isn't vayne without %ar pen you would do nothing to him but against targets with no ar it is useless","replies":[{"poster":"Cr4zedgamer","date":"2016-11-26T06:09:21.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but what your saying is tanks should not go tank we should build flat hp and other mr and other things, a tank is a tank for a reason and there is no point building def if every adc is gonna build it mid game","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-11-26T09:51:07.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cr4zedgamer,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=B9NEPEal,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2016-11-26T06:09:21.388+0000)\n>\n> but what your saying is tanks should not go tank we should build flat hp and other mr and other things, a tank is a tank for a reason and there is no point building def if every adc is gonna build it mid game\n\nyou have a problem with this item but not {{item:3071}} which goes off total arm so it ends up doing more plus %apen has been in the game for ages the original last whisperer and no one else has a problem with the item it's in the game for a reason if it was broken riot would nerf it but it's not so find a way to deal with it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-11-24T11:49:40.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately it is a double sided coin.\n\nIt's really the only way to get through a tank for the AD, but for the tank, you may as well sell all your items once it's built and build damage.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-11-24T12:07:46.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=B9NEPEal,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-24T11:49:40.571+0000)\n>\n> Unfortunately it is a double sided coin.\n> \n> It&#x27;s really the only way to get through a tank for the AD, but for the tank, you may as well sell all your items once it&#x27;s built and build damage.\n\nOr hp","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-26T10:37:02.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or ninja tabby since they lowkey reworked it to block % damage from auto attacks and not just flat damage like the doran's shield.
