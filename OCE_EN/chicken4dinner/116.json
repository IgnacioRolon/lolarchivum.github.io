Would like feedback","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically it is a creature of the void based in ionia that kills People and leaves them as sodden mushy pieces in barrels,  boxes, roof gutterings and sometimes in storage containers with other things in them. Eventually trapped by mages in its own darkness and horror, they made the harrowing decision for it to be put in the league of legends so that it may do that to other champions for the law of the realm, instead of the mass innocents.\n\nBTW: I am pretty bad with numbers so scaling has been done to the best of my ability but with specific balancing in terms of damage, time and all of that I need help :/\n\nPassive: Gouge: Every 6th basic attack rips the flesh out of her enemy, dealing bonus damage, healing her for 30% and dealing damage if the enemy moves for the next 4 seconds. These stacks do not decay.  \n\nQ: Creep/Lurk CD 8: Upon targeting an enemy, Heeerg will strafe around at a fixed distance from your enemy (moves based on cursor direction) and becomes immune to vision or crowd control effects as long as she is not within sight of them, this lasts 6/x seconds. Her next attack will fear the enemy and cause them to take extra damage from Heeergs other spells for x seconds. If no enemy is targeted then Heerg will not strafe but all other effects are available. Cooldown is not after casting but after effect ends, right click to end strafing.\n\nW: Bloodloss (Innate)/ Whiplash CD 7/x, cost 4%/x of current health: Heeerg's basic attacks and spells add stacks of bloodloss up to a max of 8 stacks (deals 2% of max health as damage per stack per second) upon going over 8 stacks the target enemy instead takes additional damage, consuming the stacks, is knocked back slightly and gains clot (cannot gain bloodloss stacks for a period of time) each stack lasts 5 seconds and this timer is not refreshed per new stack. Heeerg swings her barbed tongue in an arc, dealing damage and travels further if you are moving. this spell is also treated as a basic attack. \n\nE: Click/ Trace CD 1/20, cost 8% of current health: Heeerg will make a clicking sound with her teeth that is audible to moderately ranged enemies (who can also hear the direction it is coming from) If spotted Heeerg can activate trace instead (thus the health cost) and will leave her blood on the ground (in a trail) that you can re cast to spit in a direction to fool enemies. Enemies that walk over the trail are marked as a red mist if out of sight (in sight they are shown to be leaving their own trail (to their allies as well) while covered in a red mist) and will take a small amount damage over time (kinda to the scale of teemos poison or heim's turrets). This effect, including enemies marked lasts 6 seconds \n\nR: The defiling CD 120, no cost: Innate, Heeerg's spells will now passively increase her attack speed (something around 15-50% as she levels up (however they do stack)) and movement speed (like 5-20% (also stacks)) for a moderate duration when cast (except click). Upon activation, Heeerg leaps onto an enemy and rips them apart for 2 seconds suppressing them and dealing massive damage based on their current health and your missing health. Heeerg heals for 120% of the damage dealt and gains attack speed based on health gained (Scaled by % of (your) max health gained - % of (their) max health loss) and gains attack damage for the same duration based on damage dealt (Scaled by % of (their) max health in damage - % of (your) max health in gain) the passive component is disabled while the active component is going on. The bonuses of the active last 8 seconds.\n\nNote that the two bonuses of the utimates' active scale inversely to each other (like for attack speed, it is increased by lots of the health gain and decreased by little of the damage done) as an example, the same goes for attack damage\n\nBtw: the champion is shaped like a lizard, with a long tongue (doesn't hang out unless for fun animations) and two claws, her walking animation is simular to a stalking cat. Has no tail.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-01T01:46:30.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"that kills People and leaves them as sodden mushy pieces\"\n\nFeedback: Don't make anything too gory lol remember there are twelvies playing LoL too :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-02-01T02:03:23.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol, they might go to their mommy's and start crying because someone got eaten.......and before you know it parents are suing LoL for its immature writings, and they get shut down :O ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-01T01:55:32.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clarify your Q - \"becomes immune to vision or crowd control effects\"\nYour W says it acts as a basic attack...so I'm assuming it procs on-hit effects?\nYou will need to change your E because it forces enemies to play with sound, which not all players are able to\n\nTone down on the gore and horror man, so many 'ripping apart people'...\nI'm sure another Voidborn won't hurt but you're really tuning it's lore to the next level of gore.\nYou'll need to actually put in scalings for others so see if it's OP or not...refer to something like what I did (look at how I pointed out all the stats except for champion base stats like HP/MS/etc: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/hAX9qRAg-champion-design-rebooted-from-aaaaaaaaaages-ago","replies":[]}]}
