And I assume you mean as an ADC, because if you were top tank MS Hecarim being chased by Xerath support or something, it wouldn't be worth it at all. On the other extreme, if you're being chased by 5 people, it also wouldn't be worth it at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-29T12:13:29.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean the enemy adc gets an advantage and chases me, he is full health and misses q as taham... then he runs in to try and get 3 stacks on the enemy jinx letting annie get her stun on me and when he realizes the minion wave is killing him he runs away and I die, jinx uses chompers and traps him to get a double...\n\nHe leaves me to 1v1 shyvana who has a 2 level and sated devourer lead ( I did kill her but died in the process)\n\nDies under tower because of bad positioning\n\nI can't even farm because he does not know the basics of presence, annie is harassing me so show some teeth and bite back but no you are going to camp bush until they walk in and kill you\n\nGoes to mid lane after they take dragon, getting 1v3'd by the leaving enemy team and I am 1v1 against a 6/0 jinx.\n\nIn every teamfight he dives into the middle of a heavy cc teamcomp spamming his q\n\nNever once used his w to save someone, or even eat their carry\n\nLiteral definition of useless\n\nThe list goes on, I can provide more info if it pleases you\n\n( was vayne, already weak early game)","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-29T12:16:59.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, _Those_ Supports.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
