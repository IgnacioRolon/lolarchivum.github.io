It makes me feel like I can see everything. If you soloq, nag the ADC to buy a damn pink already. 5 pinks on the map is OP\n\nLast hitting requires a whole lot of attention. It's not as important as losing dragon, but it's very hard to do it without focusing, at least to me.\n\nThe jungler better not be taking my blue buff. And they better not be acting like idiots or we lose, and we lose BAD.\n\nThe enemy laner usually makes it pretty obvious when he's about to do something. I can't remember a time when I did not see a Zed use his shadowy ninja shadow on me and got hurt because of it, even when I was staring at my wards.\n\nWhen I ping the enemy jungler being in a warded area because the jungler is so engrossed in his farming game, I feel like a hero saving the ADC from a gank. ~~Especially if I'm playing Jayce or something and the ADC is female.~~\n\nSometimes an early dragon can really make early game hard, so catching them in the act is almost always important. Usually pinging Supp or ADC MIA is enough but it's important to specifically check the dragon for the occasional solo drag in Lansing phase by the jungler.\n\nStructures aren't usually destroyed so early, and there's a huge notification. Just be careful and look at the other lane's tower hp every once in a while.\n\nIn premades, allies should ward without me yelling in their ears, so I don't pay too much attention unless it's solo queue.\n\nYour allies can need help early on, but they should be pinging for themselves, so don't waste too much time checking on them.\n\nIf you pushed your wave to the enemy tower to roam, and see an unattended and juicy wave full of EXP and gold just waiting to be obliterated, go for it if you think the lane you were going to gank can live a while longer.","replies":[]}]}
