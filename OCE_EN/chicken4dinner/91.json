By that I mean do you have a say to what you change into? It's a nice thought, but if you had just killed a Rift Scuttler you'd be stuck in an almost useless state for however long the duration of the triggered ult will be set to be. If you mean something along the lines of Primal Zergs in Starcraft then it would be a pretty cool concept, but hard to execute. This would mean the champion is limited to the jungle and would completely be useless if counter-jungled by Nunu or Lee Sin for example. Also, it would be ridiculously overpowered when you have cleared the jungle especially after level 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-11T12:55:49.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idea can be neat, but this is Riot's balance team we are looking at here, I have to say No sadly.","replies":[]}]}
