Ward is always need and you do not only need to ward, you also need to warn your team mate due to sometimes you have ward but they just ignore the mini map.\n2. You need to learn how to rotate to help other lane not just you adc. With this I can only said play a lot and you will learn how to do this.\n3. You always need at least {{item:2043}} every time you want to go on big object such as dragon, baron, sometime even just to make sure they don't have ward behind you when you go high ground.\n4. Protect your carry in team fight: If your carry too dumb to go on team fight, ignore that guy, let him die. If your carry is super good, buy everything you can to help him, not you, him. Like {{item:3222}} {{item:3190}} or even {{item:3504}} to make sure he can win your team fight.\n5. Last one, do not try to highlight yourself, let the carry get the compliment, like if you give him double kill, said \"GJ ...\", be the background.

Often it's best to take vision ward for that brush later in the game because it is on your side of the map and will be easier to clear out any sight wards that will be placed.\n\nAn example of when it is okay to put vision wards outside of brushes is when your team is trying to secure dragon. If you place a Vision ward on the entrance of the dragon pit you will be able to see most of the sight wards in the pit and pretty much all of the sight wards that might be placed outside. Sometimes players use another vision ward and place it within the dragon pit because players can place wards to the back of the wall (behind the wall of the entrances) there is a blindspot if vision wards are placed outside the dragon pit.\n\nYou can \"extend\" your ward range through some **parts** of thick walls.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-05-22T04:38:02.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends a lot on what supports you're playing, but mastering items is a pretty big deal on supports.

You put those wards down and it's your job to interpret the information they give. Your team doesn't know why you put X ward in X location, all they know is they either have wards or not. You really have to pay extra attention to the map.\n\nAlso you don't always have to ward in bushes. Even with Vision Wards, as eventually supports learn the ranges of vision wards from brushes and ward just out of range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-05-22T04:19:45.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. What matters most is where wards are placed not how many you've placed. \n2. Mobi's rush offers catch potential in lane and map pressure. 2 trinkets and buying a ward does the job of a Sightstone during lane phase as long as you're smart and keep tabs on their Jungler/Mid.\n3. Use {{item:3302}} and {{item:3303}} in lane phase then buy {{item:3069}} when your team starts grouping. \n4. Ignite is meta you should be running it every game unless you're vsing assassins and your team has low/no CC to deal with them.\n5.

You most probably need armor red health yellow and magic resist blues. You need to absorb damage being dished out by adc and the enemy supp. You score  or kda  0/??/??. And remember to ward. You must build a balance between tank and  an assassin  a good ratio would be 60% health items 30% damage item 10% utility. In short the adc has your back if he has been offing the enemy team.
