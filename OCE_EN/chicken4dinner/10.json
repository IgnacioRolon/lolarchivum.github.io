It is the most reliable way to remain in the game early, competitive in the mid game and have a decent late game, all the while having a generally decent lineup to push and fight. Different champions shine in different areas, but generally most teams are geared towards one of a few things they want to do.\n\n2. It is what people are used to playing with. Its easier to play with champions you see regularly than champions you don't, and I know that works the other way with the enemy team as well but it is easier to adapt to what the opponent is doing (you pay more attention to them normally) than your ally that picked a champion you are unfamiliar with.\n\nAnother thing though, telling people that it is your first time on said champion has 0 relevance to the game, other than telling your teammates that you expect to do poorly. Though it should be said they should not react like that, it brings no advantage to the team itself. Ask things if you are unsure, but don't make people expect nothing of you.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-31T13:43:39.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-31T14:51:24.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just gonna respond to your title.\nJust live with it, you called last, then live with it, that's how you kinda get better btw","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-29T06:01:10.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it wasnt ranked which you said it wasnt.
