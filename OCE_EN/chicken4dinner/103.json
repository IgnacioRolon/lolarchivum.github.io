(he even called me a dumb white boy, I live in Australia lol)\n\nI&#039;m not offended yet the tribunal is up and people receive bans like shotgun blasts from a robber who is panicking... so I spent the rest of it feeding him kills and saving his life. He might have still done it anyway.\n\nAnyway, is there some sort of \"blanket\" of insurance where someone is reported by 3 or more players and it doesn&#039;t result in a ban? Because honestly, we don't want the community becoming full of premade trolls doing this... the damage is likely going to hurt the community for a while","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-07-09T12:08:27.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, speaking from experience void reports mostly result in no bans, not everyone is a tard so keep that in mind as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-09T12:21:01.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty","replies":[]}]}]}
