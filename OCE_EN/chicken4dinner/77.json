Getting both is great, but itemizing with the focus on one or the other is better as straight up attackspeed with sustain means you can just stick to your targets and chew at their hp while crits gives you the power to burst them down in a few seconds (maybe even one if you are fed). This aside because of her solid ganking potential (perma invis, you can just walk u behind an enemy in their lane to gank) means that you want crap that helps her chase and deal damage while relying on her ad scaling magic damaging abilities. This brings me on to my 3rd point (yes there were two others) that you want to outsource a lot of your damage from stuff like bortk active and passive or the spellblade on trinity to keep her burst/ sustain damage viable as her damage from abilities tend to fall off when playing AD... mostly because they deal magic damage. \r\n\r\nTo simplify, lategame evelyn AD is useless without specific itemization restricting her build paths (you have two choices really when going full ad, and they both require pretty much the same things) Thanks to the lack of unique damage from items (shiv proc, bortk) she is stuck on like I said pretty much the same &quot;things&quot;. She deals a truckton more damage then ap evelyn (now with runeglave I might reconsider this statement, when I try it out) but sucks if you attempt to experiment\r\n\r\nThen again you can just go hybrid and save the hassle of trying to make it work with unique builds (what I did)","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-15T01:28:18.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always go hybrid with trinity.
