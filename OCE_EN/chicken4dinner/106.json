It seems fun to play and when I look at game trailers and stuff I see all these exciting interactions between characters in 1v1&#039;s and group fights yet the reality is so different, people misplay and tilt all of the time while not taking into account their own actions for their failures (this is aimed at the larger community, not every individual who plays the game). \r\n\r\nThe focus I see in games is also not on the game itself, yet rather on an individuals &quot;performance&quot; instead of rightfully judging them by gauging their ability to close out games. I feel the game accommodates this way too much seeing as &quot;outplaying&quot; an opponent is not a win condition yet is hugely emphasized on success, in fact there is so much emphasis that now too much pressure is being put on an individual not to make a single mistake and it hugely effect&#039;s people&#039;s confidence to the point where they are being gated below their potential.\r\n\r\nEnough critical feedback on the community for now, here is what I found key issues for the game.\r\n\r\nIt being a linear game is no issue, I have loved linear games before but here it isn&#039;t clear on what you need to do to succeed. I would understand the lack of direction in a game where it was half a sandbox (inb4 no sandbox mode h8 lol) and you could win in any way you chose as long as it worked functionally. Yet this game is of non-linear design requiring linear formulas to do well... To make my issue clear, in a certain match up I need to stand at a particular point in the minion wave to trade favorably however the minion wave is fluid and I can walk to any location to do any number of things and I am not immediately told that &quot;that was a mistake, you needed to do this very particular thing to succeed and now you will get outscaled by this %&quot;. This is frustrating and indecision is common on my behalf because I have no idea what exactly I have to do when say in this situation; no one is in my lane, dragon just came up but bot now needs my help yet when I leave to help them I realize it was a really bad idea because the enemy laner came back and started pushing up to my tower costing me a few minion waves, 3 mins later I am ready to do dragon again but the enemy team is stalking around it and I am not sure if I wait to hide or try and intimidate them... In the end I am 4 levels behind the enemy team with a kda of 5/12 and little end game farm.&quot; that is not uncommon for me...\r\n\r\nMechanics are not useful, they just aren&#039;t however they are the most fun thing to have in this game. This makes me torn between liking the game and not giving two craps if Riot goes bankrupt, mostly because it is a game that accommodates mechanics yet to win you just need good game knowledge and a steady hand and mechanics have nothing to do with it. You can outplay and kill someone or you can slowly out trade until you can push for a kill, which the sure way of winning the fight?\r\n\r\nFinally, this game with a emphasis on mechanics and individually being awesome requires 5 complete strangers to decide on a strategy and work together in outmaneuvering the enemy team. This requires trust, awareness and the ability to grab an opportunity and make it happen which is not fostered in the game _at all_. Players are combative and unresponsive choosing to opt for the satisfaction of being a lone wolf and having &quot;dem skillz&quot; rather then being a team player and I honestly don&#039;t blame them for having that mindset, this game offers no satisfaction for cooperating and the game can be bland as a result (think pro games and how often you just see one team pushing the other into their base, doesn&#039;t look fun or impressive does it? However out of comp these same players have fun, intense and exciting games picking riven or vayne and wrecking face and it looks sick but it&#039;s not the way to win).\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up, make a team game a team game not a gunho kick some ass design for a game that does not reward you for playing like that.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-01-30T15:55:43.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall your complaint comes down to you not understanding how to play the game, and the community in general being how every online game community is. Selfish in their own gameplay.\n\nNo one can clear up the game for you. IT IS NOT LINEAR. You calling the game linear shows you have no idea at all what you are talking about.\nMultiplayer games such as this are dynamic, they have multiple ways to achieve the end goal.\nYou can see that by two clearly different strategies like force pushing as a team versus split pushing, and these in turn are vastly different to say Protect the Vayne comp.\n\nLinear in terms of gameplay is COD, where only one game type is played TDM and there is only one way to win, kill more than you get killed.\n\nAs for your example of playing and not knowing what to do at the time, it's simple, you don't know how to play.\nThis is also pretty clear from your match history. The example you gave suggests you main mid lane, yet your match history says you don't main anything and that you haven't learned a role.\nEvery little thing in the game tells you what you should do. CS versus your opponent's CS. Which lanes are winning/losing. Will it be more efficient to snowballs this lane, or help this lane, instead of helping the losing lane. Has bot lane been helping the jungler by prepping dragon area with wards. Are the enemy players in good ganking positions. Who's warding, where are they warding, are they placing good wards.\n\nLet's say you're Lux versus Zed. You are 40cs ahead, died once in a bad gank, but have two kills more.\nBot lane is in trouble, they are pushed in and can't fight back, the enemy bot lane is well warded, but top lane is even.\nBest thing to do here is clear two waves, force it to the enemy tower and back off making it look like you're headed bot, but instead head top telling your top laner to bait the enemy towards their tower.\nSnowballing top lane will also help you get more gold and exp which also snowballs you.\nYes bot lane has lost, but there is almost nothing you can do for a losing lane. 9/10 trying to reverse a losing lane will just feed that lane more.\n\nIt should also be noted that all the trailers/official supportive content for the game all displays teamwork and not individual plays and outplays.\nOnly community made material supports the individual play style, so you should in no way be complaining about this, as it's nothing that Riot can control.","replies":[]}]}
