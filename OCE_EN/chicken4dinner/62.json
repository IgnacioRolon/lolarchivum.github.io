you don't have to cs. you don't need to do damage, you just tank and ward and you save your adc most of the game so i guess they do do a lot more then just chill but compared to top or add or mid they

yet im not constantly on my toes wondering when to push into an engage or avoid one.\nOr wondering that when I am trying to out trade an opponent that im missing half a wave of cs.\nOr that after two early deaths that I have been shut down already...\n\nWarding, zoning, peeling and keeping your lane partner alive as he/she trades damage is much more favourable if you need to lay back a bit rather then slow reactions against a zed mid lane.\n\nBesides, hitting someone with a snowball as Nunu and watching your buffed ADC melt their face is very satisfying so long as you keep the pressure on the other opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-09T07:49:44.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">yet im not constantly on my toes wondering when to push into an engage or

9/10 times follow you up.\n\nAnd outside laning phase, your looking for flash ult's anyway, which is a decent engage.\n\nI mean sure there are time's that it won't make a difference, but those times

from support isn't a good idea) and support is by far the more involving, and the one where mistakes are punished harder because your generally the lowest level person in the game (example is this: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/81609006/200474676?tab=overview  both supports are the lowest on their teams, and as a note, this game i was short a randuins, had we gone longer i would have had another game full of actives).\n\nNot to mention as top lane you have maybe 2 actives (hydra, Randuins/Locket) ontop of a ward/sweeper which is a lot more simple mechanically.\n\nWatching the map and CSing should be skills that you get to the point where your able to do it automatically, sure as a support your not CSing (relic shield though) but your also trying to make openings in a 2v2 and trying to avoid letting the other support have an opening (the positioning in the 2v2 lane is a lot harder to manage then the positioning up top)\n\nNot to mention, as a support, if your not warding the right areas a winning game can instantly turn against you, and it's never fun to be warding as a squishy Nami/Janna/Sona.\n\nHonestly in a ranked game, unless your not actually full on supporting and are just half assing it, supporting is a lot more complicated then a decent chunk of other roles during the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG

doesn't have to cs they are lower level and have a hard time, where as a top lamer has to be very picky on the situation, figuring out if its a good time to try and get a trade off, weather the jungle will bank you if you are going in for a trade and also if you go to trade you have pushed lane more, then you have to worry about junglier and tower agro and all that %%%%.. they are both complicated role, but if you want to play a role where cs isn't important and you would rather focus on your team then i guess support is the right way to go, but if you want a tank/ bruiser role then top is the way to go (idk about that now with the new meta and all) but from this whole discussion (btw very nice points you have) we can conclude that both roles and for that matter all roles have their difficulties. :D thank you for opening my eyes to this :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-09T08:02:50.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Puts pink in
