People get shot down too quickly when trying to be constructive and there are not any trolls that bother people that much because people here are too negative anyway for it to be a massive diversion from the usual hate that gets slandered everywhere.\n\nAnd lets be honest, when you saw this title you thought I was going to whinge about someone in a game or something didn&#039;t you? People are too self important, they don&#039;t seem to understand how important it is to have an open mind about what others think or do and believe that they are special and immediate action must be taken because they find it unpleasant.\n\nI have a question, why?","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-09-27T12:26:33.334+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"this community is garbage, bunch of self entitled gimps who believe the slightest bit of constructive criticism is in some way abusing them, most have ZERO understanding of team comps, nor wish to learn.\n\nbut that might have something to do with the fact we have no punishment here, and no draft pick to learn our comps or strats. High elo players are forced to learn on smurfs which in turns creates more problems then it solves.\n\n\nOCE when talked about in other regions is the laughing stock of the LOL Community, we are the trash, the scum and the putrid filth. and for those wishing change are given nothing but false hope from a team of staff who have ZERO control and say\n\nif your creative or have any desire to be creative or develop the community in some way you are stomped on.
