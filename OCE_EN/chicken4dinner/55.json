The reason I have fears is because of ban posts where you see someone banned for toxicity and you look at them and it is obvious that no one at riot has read the chat logs, same with some of the posts of mine that have been removed (I got called out for name and shame when I was talking about the negative dynamics with under confidant individuals in games who are afraid of being bullied for being bad at it. No name was mentioned, closest thing to it was &#039;the 4/16 vayne&#039;), After sending a ticket to the rioter responsible for the removal it took him two weeks to get back to me and his response was essentially &quot;don&#039;t name and shame and don&#039;t bother me again&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhat if my dumbass friend and I are mucking around in a full premade group where he builds full waramogs lee sin and I go full zephyr twisted fate?? Sure you can tell us to do that in a custom game but how often do people play 5v5 custom _in oceana?_\r\n\r\nWhat if we play ultimate bravery in normal with 4 other people?\r\n\r\nWhat if we proxy singed in normals?\r\n\r\nWhat if some asshat feeder dives mid at me a few times so in response I feed their midlaner the same amount? (no shutdown from me either)\r\n\r\nWhat if what if what if??\r\n\r\nThere are too many unknowns and not enough breadth of explanation on what is deemed acceptable. I know I can&#039;t play on my friends account, but he didn&#039;t know until we scoured for ages for the rules (no space where the general ban worthy rules are held, so I had to ask a rioter).\r\n\r\nI am just worried that by failing (or even succeeding in some cases) a playstyle I will get hammered for feeding... or maybe even jokingly saying key words like give kill or feeding (lmao, dive like that again and people might think you are **feeding**) would cause trouble with the system.\r\n\r\nIdk, maybe could a rioter clarify?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-08T08:57:31.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The community guidelines are poorly defined but some things are certain. \n\n1. _\"It is obvious that no one at riot has read the chat logs\"_ \nCorrect. Not trying to hate on Riot but the whole banning system is auto-mated now. Don't worry though, it works better than people think.\n  \n2. _\"What if we play ultimate bravery in normal with 4 other people?\"\n\"What if we proxy singed in normals?\"_\nWell as long as you're not intentionally feeding or harassing in chat, then this is perfectly fine, there is no chance of you getting banned for builds. I don't think their system even collects build information to be processed. Not limited to normals either BTW, feel free to try some wacky bilds in ranked if you want.\n\n3. _\"What if some asshat feeder dives mid at me a few times so in response I feed their midlaner the same amount?\"_\n**No.** Definitely bannable. It is extremely hard to police though, so the chances of you getting banned for this are lower than they should be.\n\n4. _\"I am just worried that by failing (or even succeeding in some cases) a playstyle I will get hammered for feeding...\"_\nYou can never get banned for building a certain way, as long as you still play to win.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, here are 2 talks/conferences by Riot Lyte from GDC. You'll be most interested in the second one I think.\n\n[Talk 1.](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player)\n\n[Talk 2.](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player)","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-11-08T22:49:56.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot, especially for the detailed post","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-09T06:51:33.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NP It's what I'm best at :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
