She'll push lane in most cases if she harasses you making her vulnerable to ganks.\n\nRammus is generally GG atm just because the game is so much more aggressive and Rammus really wrecks so much more mid-game than he used to. I suggest taking cleanse if they have a ramus or building a QSS although in this case because top laner is AD that's a lot of wasted stats.\n\nSome games are just GG because of picks etc and there's little you can do about it.\n\nI've seen a Jax in competitive play get destroyed by an Irelia to the point where he actually just sat behind minions dancing.\n\nThere isn't always something you can do but another idea is to build Armor because this will cut down a lot of Vi's damage and shes unlikely to build armor pen (She gets shred every 3 autos so go for hit and run trades) [also bait out her Q etc if possible, she has high mana costs] and this will basically punish her for building tank. On top of this, wards would help even if they're a bit annoying to place because you're likely to die placing them or miss out on too much lane control etc.\n\nRengar top sucks in my opinion because he is insanely lane control dependent or just ends up farming with bola strikes and if you play aggressive early he gets destroyed so keep this in mind as people are likely to play aggressive early and if you make it to late/mid game its easier to get stacks up on your skills and on top of this things like your Roar will give you more stats and heal more allowing easier laning (rengar power spikes from skills around level 7-8) - also consider maxing Roar in tough matchups to utilize its early sustain and stat bonuses.\n\nVi's a strong top laner but she's better in the jungle because she is a strong flanker and has decent CC (mainly at 6) and has a decent late game so try to go aggressive around level 4, otherwise level 7-8.\n\nShe power spikes at 3 and 4 then at 7-8 so you have to play smart and keep in mind Rammus will clear around 3:30 so sit back at this point (Sit back at 3:30 most of the time if you are blue side and they're a blue then red jungler as this is about the time they clear) and keep in mind Rammus's gank patterns are consistently and early because of his kit and also remember his powerball damage is pretty hectic and hes hard to escape from so consider items like mercs in laning phase to escape his CC - it will also reduce his damage.\n\nPlay especially safe early vs that matchup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-02T11:12:08.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look you aren't going to get matchups you enjoy in top lane with an assassin Rengar.\n\nIt's the same problem Zed tops have, your pretty much useless unless your opponent is bronze 5.\n\nIf you want something cheese for top lane, go riven.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-03T03:27:33.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you start losing, give up farm to avoid dying.

What I tend to do when vsing any sort of tank (Garen, Shen etc.) is take full Armor Pen runes because I normally don't expect to win hard early game, and Arm. Pen runes scale so well into the late game (if you build ghost blade, lw and all that other good stuff) when vsing heavy armor champs. Another thing I do is finish off hydra before building a bruit because in a pressure lane you'll need help sustaining. Also people normally tend to use EMP Q during any match up (from what i've seen.. but im low silver so yeah) which vsing someone like Rammas is counter productive, try to use EMP W for the HP and try to hit the enemy champ with it at the same time. Other then that just play safe under turrent till level 6 and then go gank other lanes because you'll lose the tower regardless so if you roam at least you'll be positively (hopefully) impacting other lanes and helping them scale.
