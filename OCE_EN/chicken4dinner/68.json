It is more then just some tutelage session as this shows real time cause and effect of our behaviours and actions in ranked play...\r\n\r\nThis is an open invitation to anyone who is eager to practise without costing a ranked game for their team or who are eager to get into ranked (ie someone who is level 26 and wants to brush their game up a notch before hitting 30), yet it does require you to take it seriously.\r\n\r\nI will write down the names of people who troll in these matches and** ban **them, these matches are password protected and I will simply refrain from giving it to you... unless you send a message that makes me feel you are serious about improvement. Or you could try guessing if you think that will work.\r\n\r\nAnyone at any skill level is welcome, higher elo players I advise you however to take a **tutelage role **when playing these matches rather then destroying everyone in the game, If that behaviour is continuous **I will ban you**. No one learns anything from getting stomped on every game and it crushes their spirit *#elohell*. If I ban you please don't try doing it again with a smurf account, I will look you up and any trends common for smurf acc. Also, I ask that higher elo players **refrain** from playing a smurf account without a legitimate reason so we can have some trust for genuine improvement.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested I will be online 8:00pm onwards most nights on custom mode. If you wish to play send me a message and your ability + reason of playing and I will send you the password, dw it is not as strict as it sounds ill accept 99-90% of requests depending on how it goes.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to organise a game in advance for any reason just message me or post it on this board. I check here usually every 2-4 hours.\r\nIf for some reason I am un-contactable then message me on the client, state your intention and I will send you an email account when I get on (you can understand my restraint from posting what it will be on the boards).\r\nThe email account is not up today however, I will make an announcement when it is.\r\n\r\nIm looking forward to this, I hope it will help as much as I want it to.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-03-24T10:39:07.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm tbh, ranked queue is chaos, to get used to chaos, it's better for you to get matched up with random people, try to wrestle the odds with jungle katarina, AP draven and the lot on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-24T22:34:28.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Your Neighbour,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1bZwGr1c,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-24T10:39:07.158+0000)\n>\n> Hmmm tbh, ranked queue is chaos, to get used to chaos, it's better for you to get matched up with random people, try to wrestle the odds with jungle katarina, AP draven and the lot on your team.\n\nAP draven is quite impossible but as to the chaos I am talking about in game dynamics, builds and counter builds, objective control, communication ect the match ups do not matter so long as you can hold a lane and contribute to the team","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-24T05:55:37.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-03-24T07:58:10.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, just trying to be productive although not everyone shares my views it seems\n\nMaybe learn some respect because one day someone is going to go ham on you for being a smartass...","replies":[{"poster":"EbolaEveryday","date":"2015-03-24T08:08:44.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sorry to bring bad news but the only people that regularly visit this board are either people that complain (myself) or people that come to troll the people that complain.
