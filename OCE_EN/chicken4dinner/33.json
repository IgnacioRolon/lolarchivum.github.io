It really sucks to just give up when things are not going your way because you are shutting down opportunities for a really rewarding game and it results in a terrible outcome that you seethe about for days.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone else face this issue? \r\n\r\nIf so what are some things you do to get over it?

Seriously, do you think that anyone can remember whether they won or lost 50 games ago. You could guess, but you couldn't be 100%. Also, you aren't going to become Faker overnight (or perhaps at all but shhhh... dreams and shit), because neither did he (in a metaphorical sense, because at some point, he type Faker into a summoner naming box and then boom! Faker). Also you can't win every game. You just can't. No one can. So don't try to.\n\nWhat? Don't try to win. No, that's not completely true. Of course, try to win, but don't make then end goal of every game to win. Make it about improving ONE area of your game. For example, if you are bad at last hitting then every game make the goal of being above a certain CS at a certain time rather than putting it on the win/loss. Then at the end of the game, regardless of the result, you can say either, No I didn't make it, I need to continue focusing on that or I did it! Awesome!

Who proceeds to really kick top's ass, now its not that I am not confidant in beating him but I am not confidant that the game is winnable as a whole.\n\nI am not complaining that I lose games and getting mopey about it, I get into the mindset of \"this game is over already\" sometimes by 7 minutes and that is my issue.\n\nNot some confidence nosedive because I have some easily identifiable problem that I need to work on but don't before it becomes an issue... I choose to self improve m8 all the time.\n\nEdit: If you are going to call me a hypocrite guys about my last paragraph just think as to why I posted on the boards for help in the first place\n\nEdit#2: it's called self sabotage ","replies":[{"poster":"Quayer5","date":"2015-05-26T14:30:13.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I am not confidant that the game is winnable as a whole.\n\n> I am not complaining that I lose games and getting mopey about it, I get into the mindset of \"this game is over already\" sometimes by 7 minutes and that is my issue.\n\nMy advice was to not make games about winning, but improving YOUR play and you have chosen  to completely ignore me and continued to complain, therefore you are being mopey about it and you need to get over yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-28T15:11:22.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for my bullshit comments, I have a habit of saying shit I regret sometimes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-26T14:48:52.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Quayer5,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bEEBZpK5,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2015-05-26T14:30:13.577+0000)\n>\n> My advice was to not make games about winning, but improving YOUR play and you have chosen  to completely ignore me and continued to complain, therefore you are being mopey about it and you need to get over yourself.\n\nI know what your advice was, it doesn't help because I don't need to be told to make games about self development as I already know that.
