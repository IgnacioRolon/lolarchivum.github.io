Otherwise If the enemy wont auto you because they know you're trying to get your wave pushed, run in to the wave as it comes towards yours and attempt to drag it out and tank it so that the Ranged minions catch up to the melee ones then watch it smash your wave, to the same effect.\n\nIf you don't feel like forcing the wave to your turret so that he can try and farm and get poked while you don't have to overextend with a support that is trolling and likely to let you die in fights and you don't feel like forcing the wave to their turret so that the troll gets ganked or has to overextend to farm and most likely gets poked out of lane or has to sit back with you while you now both cant farm, be happy you have a support because the 0 cs support isn't actually always the most gold efficient, considering the there are about 23 Quadrillion blind pick matchups I'm sure there are situations you haven't mathed out where a support with a small amount of gold is actually as useful as an ADC with all the gold or even not more useful having taken farm.\n\nI personally prefer non 0 cs supports and have also had awesome lanes with Bruisers etc and shared farm lanes and with farming supports. Farming supports aren't actually terrible, metasheeping is.","replies":[]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-07-22T15:56:44.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this happened to me once at early game after dorans blade i just got ancient coin so if it got taken i still could make some gold off of it not sure if smart or not but didnt take long for me to recover the money lost on ancient coin and then some","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-07-22T11:51:04.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you're the ADC you should have more AD and more AS than your supp, so you're more likely to get the last hit anyway, just always attack the minions they are trying to kill, sure you'll get a few less CS than usual but its not going to break the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-07-22T11:47:42.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember a while ago some jungle guy decided to switch to toplane at the last second and decided i should've went mid instead (what our mid should've done, i have no idea).\nI shrugged and went top.
