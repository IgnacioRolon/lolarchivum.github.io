Otherwise for most people down the lower tiers its gg your stuck there because **who** can figure out what they are doing wrong when their teammates are doing 20% worse then they are screaming obscenities at them... (If you can get the chat data from my last game you will know what I am talking about.) The reason I want this new \"rank\" to be the silver bullet for this problem is simply this: you can tell people to do all sorts of things but only 1 in 5 will listen to the advice and really get serious about helping themselves.\n\nThe rank is like master tier is to fix cycling immunity in challenger, a limbo of sorts that cycles them down from bronze into this one tier rank that isn&#039;t at all competitive but actually a learning curve for them to start walking properly if you get my \"drift\" in a sense. It isn&#039;t just \"kindergarden before school\" or not suitable for ranked but a springboard where they actually have the ability to play at their full capacity in ranked after some basic lacking principles from their game in general have been \"self improved\". The community much remains the same and you can&#039;t tell it to be different but at least separate the aspiring from the people who don&#039;t give a shit about genuinely helping themselves improve, maybe help them to give a shit.\n\n\n\nP.S. Also this affects normals where you wont actually get matched with them unless you were very much the same.\n\n\nThis system is very disjointed and hasen&#039;t been \"designed\" -_to prepare the preliminary sketch or the plans for (a work to be executed), especially to plan the form and structure _ at all, it is just an idea to be picked up or lost in time (hopefully the first). To put in perspective, a system like this without huge amounts of market research and data/ work will destroy league but eventually everything will get smoothed out and it will start working. Unless you do do lots of work on it (if so then I would be very humbled to meet you ;)) then you have a functional system (of course rough starts are expected)\n\nPeace\n\nEdit: For those who don't understand why I think this; _The rank would not function as normal, its not considered even a placement in ranked but like \"processing\" where you are in the middle of a transition between places. The rank is made just so you can get out if you are ready (I mean the rank will function sort of like intro bots with tips and guidelines but much more advanced. the end of match screen should have a summary of where you went wrong, how you could improve, and why.)._\n\nEdit 2: This is probably not the greatest idea but the lower tier could mostly be placements with goals to reach (The client sets the goals, lets you write down steps in client that show in game how to get there and then gives you a summery of how you are doing and suggestions for improvement)","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-05-23T02:05:53.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think so too.
