I reckon you pick a champ, having more than one could encourage suicide, then each time a player dies the enemy team gets the person that has been dead the longest gets to respawn. People who are dead could have their summoners changed to Garrison and Clairvoyance. Clair having static 50 second CD and Garrison which has a five minute CD but can only be cast on a specific tower, nexus, or inhib. This way even if you're dead you can still have an impact on the game, which would encourage teamwork, communication and make sure that you aren't doing nothing when you die. I think an objective like Baron and Drag bring back the whole team while killing a tower brings back two members. Kills bring back one. That way there is more encouragement to play objectives and stuff. Anyway that's just my take on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-23T20:23:08.256+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"You'r right, it sounds stupid.\n\nBecause it is.","replies":[]}]}
