If there can be a feature for clarification (aka a copy of the post removed) I would be very grateful as I feel it is a waste of everyone&#039;s time following it up in support which process a lot of requests already...\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration ;)","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-10T08:54:29.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why were you counting your posts. that's weird.\nalso are you saying you send a support ticket every time one of your posts gets removed? jesus, if I did that they'd have their hands full answering my tickets alone.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-10T09:14:35.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Z2iIsbhj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-10T08:54:29.742+0000)\n>\n> Why were you counting your posts. that's weird.\n> also are you saying you send a support ticket every time one of your posts gets removed? jesus, if I did that they'd have their hands full answering my tickets alone.\n\nActually it keeps count for me :p\n\nAnd i did only once, i simply said i did not want to continuously do it","replies":[]}]}]}
