Do you feel you are actually good at a champ if you play them a lot like the mastery system says? Because I don&#039;t think that, in fact I think it is quite misleading to people (especially if they just mindlessly grind for it). Which leads me to my final part of this thread\n\nWhy do YOU play league?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-01T03:30:26.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the mastery system is flawed in the fact that winning gives you more points than actually doing well, so you can just slog a champ and win 50% of the games through luck and get to lvl 5, the actual number of games you need to play to get to lvl 5 is enough that once you've got there you will be a lot better with that champ anyway because of all that practice, even if you were just slogging it so its more of a teaching method than a rewards system. \n\nI personally don't care if i win or lose (unless its ranked) as long as i do well and have contributed a lot to the team. \nand i play lol for 3 reasons,\n1. i love the visuals and lore of the champs i play, plus i enjoy working with my friends as a team\n2. i have too many skins now to just give it up even if i wanted to\n3. these games are designed to be addictive theres a whole science behind it, so I'm sure that contributes a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-01T10:04:52.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1 for the in depth answer, cheers m8 for good discussion","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-07-31T17:29:48.932+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outplays.\nDoesn't matter if I lose a match or win one.\nIf I make epic plays or do something match changing, I'm often happy.\n\nMy favourite games are where everyone contributes close to the same amount into trying to win the match. Including every member of the enemy team. I don't like DCs on either team or trolls/ragers because the game becomes uneven and doesn't represent how well you actually play. \n\nSometimes I get wrecked really hard by the enemy team and actually end up admiring and appreciating their epic plays. It's not too bad when you lose to really good players who aren't douchebags. \n\nI play for {{champion:62}}.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-01T10:07:15.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well for one I am nearly speechless, that was pretty awesome your breakdown on how you value league.\n\n+1\nNice job","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-08-01T10:27:28.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teamwork all the way!\n\nI play the game since I have nothing else to do, I enjoy trying to help people get better at something and if I'm good at this game then I can help other's get better at this game. I think the champion Mastery System isn't a system to say how good you are at a champion but to say how time you've put into getting better although if that's it's goal it's failed. The reason I think that is because it made it a goal that you just need to grind for without to much effort.","replies":[]}]}
