I just go for vital greens and turmeric with an assortment of other stuff I feel I need in the morning and put it all into a blender","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-05-26T11:03:48.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use a health shop called neways..

Everything starts in the gut\n\nActually the best thing that a gut can get is greek yogurt (unsweetened of course, sugar overworks the immune system so bad bacteria doesn't feed off it) because 80% of any greek yougurt you buy is natural it is the safest option in the supermarket for you to have.\n\nThe reason its good? Bacteria in your gut reproduces like mad in it.\n\nAlso I shop at a few places, chief among them is a farmers market 2 hours away which can sell all kinds of stuff depending on the day and go vita. I mainly hit go vita just because of the gluten free options of stuff that is never gluten free but also I get vital greens and fish oil there (the big brands' stuff that I can't get at the market). All my vegetables and greens I get from the market\n\n\nCocconut icecream is sold everywhere really but best places are natural health food stores that are allowed to stock them","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"shalexade","date":"2015-05-26T00:56:40.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once ate out Icecream, but never off Icecream.\n\nAt least, I think that's what she said her name was.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-25T10:54:41.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did that once, spent the day on the toilet, goodluck OP.","replies":[]}]}
