I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n> \n> I'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n> \n> **Attitude**\n> When you are playing Ranked focus on your own gameplay, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n> \n> Always stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n> \n> **Gameplay**\n> You've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n> \n> Check out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n> \n> It will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n> \n> Hope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-06T04:42:24.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=i0iPcGfv,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2016-01-04T00:44:10.646+0000)\n>\n> Copy pasting this post, if you're interested in investing a bit of time and effort I'm sure you can improve!\n\nIdk how many times I've seen this post already:P","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-06T04:43:46.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it seems like a lot of players tend to ask the same questions =)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2016-01-05T06:08:36.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Chicken,\n\nBest advice I can give is always question your play. Why did I die? Why am I at this part of the map? What item path will I take this game and WHY?\n\nThis will make you aware of more things. Once you are aware focus on something, it can be anything. This game I want to NOT die in lane. once you work on that be like now I want to win. Or if you are winning lane focus on helping your team mates. This way you will notice different parts of your game slowly improve and hopefully overtime the whole thing gets good.\n\nAnother good way to do is spectate friends/players higher elo and ask why they did things. \n\nHope this helps, let me know if you have any questions or add me in client.\n\nCheers, Spawn","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-03T09:50:56.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how much do you know about the game? i.e champions and there abilties, mechanics of the current metas you will probably lane against (ie if mid yasuo,zed,ahri) lane against,good matchups and bad matchups, which matchups to go hard on and which matchups to stay safe against? spotting a good oppurtunity and when to avoid a bad one, when to chase and when not to chase,when to initiate/when not to initiate? i have learnt i bit , but when i get that losing streak i often think what am i doing,why am i this role, why am i playing these champs and my confidence usually gets wrecked. its a hard game.\n\ngetting good cs just takes practice, when i started i used average 3-4 times under what my opponent could get because i would just auto or throw abilities and hope for the best. now i usually got 10-20 behind and can comfortably juggle farming and harrassment.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-04T10:00:26.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"everything...?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-04T11:56:59.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2016-01-04T09:04:54.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ability to juggling harras and farming is a godsend to have, my knowledge is ok (I believe so anyway) but I shut my thinking out when I play and act like a total dumbass","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-03T09:39:33.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly bruh, I'm all for breaking the meta for fun and all, but if you want the best way to win, going Meta is the best thing to do.
