I know there&#039;s something not connecting with the new updates as even the worst player can get fed to absurdity every game or so, maybe the update on my previous main rengar threw me off but I&#039;ve been dying quite a bit on other champs too. \n\nSomething is not quite like I remember it, but nobody seems to know when I ask. It can be very frustrating and crushing to know your efforts are generally in vain, the few games you win being the ones you were carried. I was never particularly that good but I had my moments, now it seems like I&#039;m an outsider to something people just take for granted\n\nIt&#039;s notoriously hard to get help in this game so I thought just putting it on the board might help (there&#039;s not a whole lot of information here and that&#039;s in the hope a suggestion can get the ball rolling)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-01T15:31:44.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing that would stand out to me would be the Rune/Mastery merge/changes. Old runes basically gave you some base flat stats, new runes are basically super masteries. The result is that you're a generally a little squishier in the early game (so is the enemy) but you have a clearer mini goal (play around whatever your keystone is) to get stronger.\n\nGetting used to those stat changes (and consequently the difference in where your strength is) is my guess as to what's causing you issue.","replies":[]}]}
