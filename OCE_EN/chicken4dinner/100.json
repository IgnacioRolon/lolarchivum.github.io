Daffy duck is completely legitimate (except how he gets into league of legends, I only thought of this 5 minutes ago upon writing) \n\nalso he is a fighter, tank? anyway, you read it and tell me.\n\nPassive: misadventurous: Whenever an unfortunate incident befalls Daffy that causes him to take damage, he builds up a \"temper\" stack all upon which if filled to 20 stacks every enemy nearby is knocked back a considerable distance from Daffy with his rage. Daffy also gains a 10% bonus ad boost on top of his normal attack damage and 20% tenacity (whatever 20% of tenacity means) for 2 seconds\n\nQ: CD: 16 secs, Big pockets: Daffy pulls out an obscenely long weapon from his imaginary pockets that he can use once, a blade deals damage in an arc 50 (10% AD), a bludgeon stuns an enemy 30 (40% AD) (1.25 seconds) and slows in an area 30% and a rocket launcher backfires and sends Daffy flying the other way dealing damage to enemies caught in the blast 10 (80% AD) and reduced damage (6% of current health) to Daffy himself. A rummaging sound indicates what weapon is about to come out (for teammates and enemies notice) your tool bar shows to you what weapon is about to come out.\n\nW: CD: 18 secs, Impersonation: Daffy sticks a not very convincing cardboard cut out of himself into the ground complete with sound effects whenever enemies walk near (helpful to stick in bushes) that lasts 14 seconds. When the cardboard cut out is detected and dealt damage, Daffy can re activate w (from where ever he is) to jump out of it and hit the closest enemy over the head with it (also destroying it). Daffie's passive is also doubled for the next 5 seconds upon re activation of w.\n\nE: CD: 5 secs, GET OUTTA HERE!!: Daffie's foot grows insurmountably big and kicks out in the general direction of the mouse. upon connecting with an enemy he knocks them back and deals 20 (110% AD) complete with a ministun 0.50 secs. however, Daffy stubs his toe taking 50% bonus AD and cant attack for 0.75 seconds. \n\nR: CD: 130 secs, Loony tune: Daffy dons the Duck Dogers costume with a live jetpack and massive hammer with delusions of being a super hero for 15 seconds. Daffie's movement speed is tripled, cant be slowed, takes 9-14 damage every 0.2 seconds as it (the jetpack) cooks his tail and every attack stuns for 1 second.\n\nTell me this isn't justice for trolling {{champion:17}} {{item:3151}}","replies":[]}
