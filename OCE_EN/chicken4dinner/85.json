SEE POINTS ABOVE!\n\n> I kinda feel outta my depth sometimes, what kind of advice can you give me when going against a lane enemy who is better mechanically or strategically?\n\nAgain, your not ready for ranked, if you were you would have a general idea of both your champions S&W's and you own. ( Play at least 200 more normal games before playing ranked)\n\nOnce you have a general idea of how the play, you can research your favorite champions and also review guides from a number of sources.\n\n\n> P.S, at 10:00 I average 65 cs and ward maybe 7 times...\n\nyou avg between 1.3 to 3 cs per minute. THAT'S WORSE THEN SUPPORT LEVEL! and they don't even farm minions unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\n\n**TLDR:\nYour too inexperienced for even bronze players, you have no idea what your doing. play more normal games and improve, until then your game play is toxic and counter productive to the ranked system, you will be a heavy burden to your team-mates**","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-21T10:41:08.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When doing your pre games or what ever they are called, how does your matchmaking compare you?\n- your MMR goes up significantly or down significantly based on your 10 placements\n\nWho will I vs\n- people at placement mmr and then it depends on which way you go up or down, either bronze/silvers/golds/plats\n\nWhat level am I expected to be able to play at\n- your best is all you can do, it is expected if you want to be higher than silver you have ok-ish mechanics and you generally have a slight idea of how to play\n\nHow do I not get dropped into bronze\n- by actually being good at the game\n\nWhat can really hold you back when attempting the wide world of ranked match ups?\n- being bad\n\nI kinda feel outta my depth sometimes, what kind of advice can you give me when going against a lane enemy who is better mechanically or strategically?\n- don't feed and hope someone carries","replies":[]}]}
