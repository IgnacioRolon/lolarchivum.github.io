Hope that helps.\n\nI generally build the same albeit a little different toplane, I get dorans first combining snare/heal for harras and or sustain and don't back until I can buy tiamat outright or low on hp.\n\nThen I rush hydra and mobi boots for roaming (cuz I get tp top), start taking objectives and build towards a bortk or ghostblade (depending on their teamcomp) after a few objectives I head back up top to push another tower and then back again. After that it is legit anything that I may need, lifesteal or crit or even high resistances (maw) and a little tankyness while I lock down targets for my team\n\nIf I am behind early game I will stack a second dorans blade, helps alot","replies":[{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-09-05T09:56:31.394+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use to stack Db's as well but I realized generally as Rengar the long sword + 3 pots gives you enough sustain for the first 10ish minutes. Also Rengar has one of the strongest lvl 2 engages and if you get a kill early on by using his early dominance then you can by pass the doran/ sustain phase. Also I prefer ignite over TP just for kill potential especially if you're buying mobies just because your movement speed is already increased heaps once you get three stacks on the bone necklace. \n\nWith regards to bork, I highly recommend you never rush it because Rengar doesn't use most of the things it gives, I normally purchase it as a last item (if i even bother buying it) because Hydra provides plenty LS and you shouldn't need attack speed to nuke a target. Also GB rush means you have additional armor penetration + CDR and an amazing active that makes you really scary early on, not to mention it's much cheaper as well. \n\nAlso Rengar is an assassin, your job is to go in, delete a squishy or two and get out, I find building items that don't follow that theory to be a waste on him. \n\nAnyway this is just my personal opinion to playing him, if you want to add me in game we can talk about it more. Have fun !","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-07T00:26:46.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for an earlier powerspike, don't upgrade tiamat into hydra. Lifesteal doesn't help you assassinate people and delays your other items. If you are going for a more sustained damage build with lifesteal items like hydra or botrk, dont get mobility boots, you need boots that don't lose all their movespeed in combat so you can actually keep up with people and keep aaing.","replies":[]}]}
