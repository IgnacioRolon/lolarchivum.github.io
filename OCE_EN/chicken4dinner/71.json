I could suggest yes but unfortunately not for those who would use her like a right click button on their desktop and delete stuff, to be fair it is a heavy gut punch to Lb players but there is still viability in picking her.\n\n- Play safe, I know this is the number 1 thing not to do with an assassin as quick as LB (and as safe) but she is still able to burst when the opportunity comes. You simply can&#039;t rocket through their cc anymore.\n\n- Don&#039;t think you can still secure a kill in a gank, unless you know her very well **and** what you are doing of course. They now have more time to react and close off your escapes.\n\n- Don&#039;t lead in with W, this was stupid to begin with (unless you had the damage) and now its made even worse where zed has the time to ult you back over to your return pad. Lock down your target **first**.\n\n- Don&#039;t listen to me if you are in a high elo, know what you are doing and know how the nerf affects you.\n\nSomething to think about for those who think she is dead","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-06-10T22:32:21.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shes still very viable, her damage hasn't changed, and she can punish you if you out of position.\nwhat the change does allow for is counter-play, if she W's into a turret while your under it you have a bigger window to CC her and keep her there. **(READ: Risk vs Reward)**\nif you have a knock up or displacement ability you can completely cancel out her W damage.\n\n\nHer E was just stupid, you could completely miss your opponent and still hit the damn thing, it needed to be fixed. \nnow with the change, its more in line with what the projectile is **\"a thin fuking chain\" ** but it now updates more to prevent \"rubber banding\" \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-11T10:16:59.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FruitSalad,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=eILw1tN5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-10T22:32:21.067+0000)\n>\n> Shes still very viable, her damage hasn't changed, and she can punish you if you out of position.\n> what the change does allow for is counter-play, if she W's into a turret while your under it you have a bigger window to CC her and keep her there. **(READ: Risk vs Reward)**\n> if you have a knock up or displacement ability you can completely cancel out her W damage.\n> \n> \n> Her E was just stupid, you could completely miss your opponent and still hit the damn thing, it needed to be fixed. \n> now with the change, its more in line with what the projectile is **\"a thin fuking chain\" ** but it now updates more to prevent \"rubber banding\"\n\nTrue, like I said.\n\nI'm confused as to why I got downvoted while you got upvoted?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-10T23:36:03.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this change, I don't play LB very much but her ban rate is a lot lower now, this makes her a viable champion to master without much fear of it being banned in ranked.
