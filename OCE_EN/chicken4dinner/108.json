When Reinkoo is slain every enemy is temporarily slowed by 15% and revealed for 1.5 seconds, the slow being increased to 30% for the enemy who killed him. If that enemy is killed within the next 4 seconds then Reinko gets a gold bonus. Enemies hit with Reinkoo&#039;s basic attacks get gathering flames stacks that cap at 5, if one of your abilites hits an enemy at 5 stacks it get&#039;s a bonus. these stacks decay every 2.5 seconds and are reset per new stack\r\n\r\nq: Stoke the flames, 80/90/100/110/120 mana, 6 cd: Reinkoo carpets an area in fire dealing damage based off gathering flame stacks on each enemy hit plus 20(35%)AP, after this allies can also add gathering flame stacks with their auto attacks to affected enemies also giving the same bonuses for corresponding abilities that hit them for 3 seconds. ie your q bonus = their q bonus, your w bonus = their w bonus and so on. At 5 stacks enemies hit by your q are stunned for 0.8 seconds\r\n\r\nw: Silence the prophecies, 40/60/80/100/120 mana, 10 cd, 1 in between uses with 2 stored uses: Reinkoo grant&#039;s himself and one allied champion a flaming spell shield for 4 seconds that deals 10/20/30/40/50(+50%)AP per second to surrounding enemies, if an enemy spell hits a spell shield then it explodes dealing 80/110/160/220/280 (70%)AP and slows them by 35% for 2 seconds. If an enemy has 5 gathering stacks then they will be revealed and will burn the earth behind them dealing 60(65%) AP each second to enemies that walk over it for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\ne: (insert better name) the eye of gondor, 90/140/220/260/300 mana, 22/15/10 (scales with ult) cd: Reinkoo, reveals the area around him for 9 seconds slowly adding stacks of gathering flame to nearby enemies that can be utilized by ally champions (like q), 1 stack is added each second. Ally abilities can also leave crystals from where your allies where when hitting an enemy who has 5 gathering flame stacks, Rienkoo can teleport to these by right clicking , the crystals last 30 seconds, breaks on use and 10 seconds after an ally has left the radius and also it has no cast time to move to. Revealing/ hitting an enemy with 5 stacks gives ally champions and minions in the radius of the champion who used the 5 stacks a boost of movement speed 15/25/35% (scales with ult)\r\n\r\nr: Unravelling fate, 100 mana, 140/120/100 cd: Rienkoo fires a molten flaming laser from his palms that lasts up to 3 seconds, searing enemies and doing 100/220/400 (90%) AP total damage. Enemies hit get 5 gathering flame stacks and allies gain health and mana from dealing damage to them based of 4% of their missing health/mana and 30% of Rienkoo&#039;s ability power for 10 seconds. If the enemy has 5 gathering flame stacks then this ability deals 100% extra damage. Rienkoo can aim and move at the same time.","replies":[]}
