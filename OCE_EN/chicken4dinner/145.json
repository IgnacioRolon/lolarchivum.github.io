When coming within range of an ally, You are able to right click on them to spawn a lesser deamon (melee) that has 40% of their max health as their own, as well as 25% of their AD and 30% of their AP as attack damage, 90% of their armour that decays over 6 seconds and 100% of their move speed. The deamons will follow you around and will prioritise champions (but can be controlled by holding alt and right clicking), if they leave you for a certain range they will die (they will also die from timeout after 7 seconds). right clicking a deamon you will sacrifice it, empowering your next ability and absorbing what heath they had left.\n\nQ: Body shift: CD 9 secs: You will inhabit the body of a targeted minion or monster, your presence donated by a glowing red aura around it. pressing Q again will cause you to burst forth. if you sacrificed a daemon then you will also cause an explosion around your arrival dealing 30 (40% AD) damage + 20 damage per sacrifice (don't worry this will scale with level) to surrounding enemies. Deamons will hide with you. You can also hide in deamons lol. Disclaimer, you still take combat damage while hiding but the creature you are hiding in takes none.\n\nW:  Soul thirst: Innate: When an enemy unit dies around you, you and any living deamons gain a 5% movement speed boost and 2% lifesteal ( nearby allies gain half of the bonus if they killed the unit, nearby minions get it to) that last 7 seconds, this effect stacks infinitely and resets the timer per new stack. stacks are doubled for 5 seconds if you sacrifice a deamon.\n\nE:  Siphon hope: CD 12 secs: You get a burning sword for 7 seconds that deals damage based on 3% (this also scales with level) of your enemies' max heath over 3 seconds that heals nearby ally champions based on burn damage done. Per sacrifice another nearby enemy will get the burn effect per attack at random (say there is 3 enemies, you sac 1 deamon then while attacking one the other two randomly also get burned). \n\nR: Curse of the red eclipse: CD 90 secs: You call upon the terrible power of the blood moon to take dominion over the map for 5 seconds. During this period allies gain vision of enemies near them and when you are nearby they are slowed by how close they are to you, also their life is drained by 10% of their max health + 1% max health based on your proximity per something units (I haven't stated this exactly because I want to make sure it is balanced) (it increases from 10% when you get closer) and + 50% bonus AD for how many deamons you control (more deamons, more +50%). Deamons don't time out during this period.\n\nMake suggestions as you see fit! looking forward to it\n\nTips for the vexed:\n\nIn skill order:\nHiding in the brush with an ally nearby before a gank will allow you to maximise deamon spawning before going in, or you can just do it to pump up your next ability for a powerful attack.\n\nIf jg, try to gank as often as possible as a means of creating deamons to help with your jg farm, remember, no matter how hurt the deamon is you will still get a full ability boost when you sac them (they are also safer to use for checking brushes or scouting enemy camps)\n\nQ: is potent for when your lane partner goes in for the kill, allowing you to catch up to fleeing opponents or assisting your jg in a gank when they turn to flee, you will be there.\n\nCounter jg is made easier with this ability, check a buff or jg camp with a deamon if your opponent is there quickly sac the deamon, jump in one of the smaller monsters and then emerge with a bang\n\nW: Simply being by your ally and using deamons to help them get cs will maximize their benefit and yours, if the going gets rough consider using your deamons to peel off an opponent (they can get quite strong if your lane partner does) before sacrificing them to give you and your ally extra sustain to hold lane that little bit longer before your jg comes to lift the siege.\n\nSacrificing deamons before taking on a camp and killing the lesser monsters first will allow some early sustain keeping you farming and ganking longer.\n\nE: Is a tough one to consider as it is very aggressive and requires you to commit quite heavily to your harras or when you attempt to kill them. Note that your lane partner is very unlikely to get the kill so stopping your assault when they have about 1/5th of their health will give your lane partner the power to finish them off. Sacrificing deamons is also a risky play as the random burn might clear waves.\n\nThis is a duelists dream however it is slow, you will need caution with mobile assassins so make use of deamons and q before you make your major move. It is the best ability in your kit for clearing camps.\n\nR: Teamfights and ganks, this button should always be on your mind for one of those situations, however make sure you are not in the middle of a firestorm tanking all of the damage otherwise the ability is next to wasted if you get popped the moment you ult. the health drain works like a charm for enemies you cant quite get a bead on or evasive effects like with fizz and vladmir, where the health gain is equal to the amount drained it will refresh you while they stop doing anything at all. Having 5 Deamons out at the same time is still unlikely even during the ultimate however it is near instant death for surrounding enemies.\n\nCo operation is the key to this champ, it is ok to use laning partners as \"deamon pumps\" or as a jg using laners to pump deamons for jgling, just make sure you give them some help in return with them. \n\nMake sure to remember that each ally champion has their own individual cooldown for spawning deamons.","replies":[]}
