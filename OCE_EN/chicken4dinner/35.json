No to the BOTRK because you have high ad scalings from your Q and E and your meant to be bursting squishes not tanks(so the percentage damage from it is not put to use). The triforce is also a no because you can only proc the spellblade passive once when bursting down a squishy(since it has a 2 second cooldown and they should be dead before that). Spirit visage no because if you need magic resist you get a maw of the malmortius, which gives you ad, magic resist and a shield which will save you countless times, and it has a really good build path. Beserkers no because you get attack speed from your q, and your a spell based champion not purely an auto attacker.

Maybe swap out that BT for a LW and PD for Triforce. This gives you a tankier rengar that can still oneshot and can also deal damage to tanks quite easily.
