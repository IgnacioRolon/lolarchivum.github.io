For example, an opponent's hiding behind his minions, so i use zed's W to place my shadow behind the minions, and then cast my Q at him from around the minions. I dunno, something about working out angles on the fly and predicting movement feels like i'm outplaying my opponent when all I'm doing is getting some poke in.\n\nLanding the perfect combo with twisted fate. Ulting to bottom lane with a gold card ready, hitting the ADC, throwing a Q right in their face, getting the E passive trigger for extra damage and igniting to kill them before running back into mid lane.\n\nDoing an ult>Q combo onto an ADC to smack them back into my team as Vi, or usign Flash+Q to initiate a gank and killing the enemy laner in 2-3 hits.\n\nGetting a Darius multi-kill with the ult. Especially when I get ganked 2v1 or 3v1 and I can outplay them to score a double or triple.\n\nJust thinking outside the box and outplaying my opponents. Sure, being fed from a crappy lane opponent and steamrolling the enemy team is fun, but that doesn't make me feel POWER, it just makes me laugh at how much they fed me. What truly makes you feel great is knowing that you an your opponent were close to the same level of skill, and you won because you managed to outplay them and think of scenarios out of the box, or just great mechanical knowledge in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-05-26T03:46:49.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing a shit","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-26T03:17:28.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I can make enemies and allies use /all chat after the first min into the game.\n\nFeel the power!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-05-26T02:52:08.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Running a +20 penetration rune page on burst champs, them late game bursts sooo good!","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-05-26T02:13:45.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel powerful playing Udyr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-26T02:08:18.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel I've got pretty good knowledge but Wet Paper Bag 5 mechanics.
