This requirement alone is enough justification to retain blind pick.\n\nNot allowing new players to test their mettle against other players is going to alienate them even further with even longer grinding required for level 25 via bots on top of the feeling of drowning they get once opened up to a player vs player queue.\n\nPersonally I think the current selection is fine. I prefer not to have to wait 5 minutes in lobby each game I start and would also prefer too have an unrestricted champion pool. Additionally draft pick adds an aura of seriousness to the game that casual gamers like myself don't appreciate.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-18T12:47:47.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We should atleast have Draft Pick Weekends or something.","replies":[]}]}
