She is a very fragile champ. This lasts 5 seconds, all abilities become magic missiles (that you can aim) and she is immobile. She also has no cooldowns or mana costs over this period.\n\nq: cooldown 6, mana 40. hardened will: Nephra shields her mind allowing her to channel her massive amount of energy into a bolt that empowers another ability, when activating another ability a magic missile will fire off into the direction of a nearby enemy champ or minion or monster (prioritises champs that most recently you dealt and/or received damage from, other enemies it is proximity) she gains 20 life (%40 AP) over 4 seconds and 2/3/4/5/6 more for each point of damage she receives during that period (delayed to 2 seconds). The missile deals damage based on %2 + (16 x level) of Nephra's missing health and upon landing it re-activates hardened will. \n\nw: cooldown 12, mana 80. soul searching: Nephra floods a large area in a cone with life draining necromantic energy dealing 35 damage (%60 AP) every 2 seconds (cool animation to donate this) to her and any enemy within the cone. Inside patrols a ghast with 5 life that is invisible until revealed by proximity (champions only) where every time it is revealed it fears all nearby enemies for 0.2/0.4/0.8/1.0/1.4 seconds , when the ghast dies the flood lifts, the ghast loses 1 life every 3 seconds.\n\ne: cooldown 40, mana 40 each second. Exoterrestrial: Nephra calls upon a blood pact with a demon sacrificing half her life, summoning the demon (half of her life becomes it's life). While the demon is alive Nephara cannot gain life and takes no damage yet it deals %7 of any damage dealt to it to her, the demon has its own set of abilities and is uncontrollable (slash in an arc, slows and heals the demon. tail whip, minor damage and knocks everything back and flap, it flies a short distance and is untargetable when flying.) the demon will execute anyone under %10 health. Only targets champions and will go for the weakest ones first if it can, does not get targeted by towers (except fountain). The demon deals damage based on %20 of its max health, the slash deals 50(%70 AP) and tail whip is flat 40. The demon can be cancelled at anytime restoring what health it had left back to you, if you had empowered it with iron will any empowerments from the ability will activate after the demons departure.\n\nr: cooldown 160/120/100, mana 100. Aspect of the dread. Passive: every 4 times an enemy deals damage to her within 10 seconds they become feared for 0.2 seconds. Active: Nephra sucks the life from any fool who tries to come close to her, She loses %10 of her maximum health per second and deals damage based on %120 of her missing health each second to nearby champions. Other damage is reversed into healing over this period. lasts 4 seconds. \n\nSo\nIdeas?","replies":[{"poster":"Envidia","date":"2015-03-10T12:17:42.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just like karma, just saying","replies":[]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-04T10:30:26.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea mate, we should work together on champ designs","replies":[]}]}
