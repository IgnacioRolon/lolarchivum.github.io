His taunt and interactions would be different and his sword would resemble a serpent or dragon depending if he is in blood price or thirst (dragon theme for price resembling untamed power, but like the greed of all dragons the sword demands compensation. Snake theme for thirst would be vampirish in it&#039;s sword theme, biting for sustenance at the expense of others much like the personality of Aatrox himself.)\n\nWhen aatrox ults his dragon or snake ascends to a higher form as if it stopped being a shadow of greater power and grows in size to become menacing. The dragon/snake on the sword (which is really subtle before but still quite noticeable) would become the sword and mimic it&#039;s shape. Additionally every auto attack would look and feel like demonic power is ripping them up for price and a small green mist animation where after all blood you see spilled follows into aatrox every third proc.\n\nAlso the sword fills up in colour after every attack until it hits 3 so you have a visual indicator of when your next power-slap is coming (and when you hit the third stack the animal on the sword begins moving around the blade, snake slithering and dragon doing the same thing because Japanese dragons resemble snakes)\n\nWhen he finishes regenerating he will give an evil laugh because that would be awesome (also separate vo&#039;s for snake and dragon form)\n\nThanks riot because deep down you know it is a great idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-07-23T23:36:21.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So here the boards are filled with complaints about the new HUD and VO and someone wants a new skin for Aatrox.
