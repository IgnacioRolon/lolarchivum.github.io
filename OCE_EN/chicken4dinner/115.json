After 7 stacks Lundon will peform one of 3 actions; He will re-send 80% of that damage afterwards as magic damage, shoot a grappling bolt behind an enemy and knock them back 40 units or blinds and slow them for 1.25 seconds (30% slow). This is dictated by the last spell he cast before \"finding the punchline\" caps at it's 7th stack. the passive will indicate this through stating either \"cruel trick\" \"evil jest\" or \"mad jape\". Lundon runs on a toolkit system, where a certain amount of gold replenishes his ability casting potential. (aka 5 gold, 1 toolkit bar , 5 toolkit bars in total)\n\nQ: The clever impersonation: 3 Toolkit bars, 6 second cooldown: Lundon will attempt to imitate his enemies in an attempt to confuse them, able to produce a rough copy of one within allied vision that will start attacking allied minions and champions although dealing no damage. it can be healed and interacted by enemies in simular ways and can be controlled by alt click or re activating q. This lasts 6 seconds and if the copy dies it will explode in a cloud of smoke dealing minor (20 at lvl 1) damage and creating a smoke screen for 2 seconds (limits vision only to the inside of the smoke screen, if you are outside you also cannot see in).\n\nW: Devious ruin: 2 toolkit bars for each activation (the second only costs 2 if you re cast it) 5 second cooldown. Lundon will throw a grapnel rope with a bomb attached to a target location, if the location has an enemy the rope will attach itself to that enemy and you are able to keep them at the distance that you hit them with the rope. Re activating this ability will cause Lundon to let go of the rope and send the bomb hurtling at their face dealing 70 + 50% AP magic damage at lvl 1 and stunning for 0.5 seconds at lvl 1. The rope will automatically fly at 3 seconds.\n\nE: Jar of misery: 1 toolkit bar for each enemy hit on activation. 24 second cooldown at lvl 1. Lundon sets an adhesive trap that will explode into a cloud of foul gasses when an enemy champion walks over it, when ever champion damage outside of the cloud is dealt to them while the cloud is active it will prolong the effect by 0.4 seconds (at lvl 1). The gasses slow them by 40% while they are in the sphere of influence and deals 60 + 20% AP damage per second at lvl 1, this also reduces their vision to only within the gasses if they were not in the impact when it blew, If they were they take 5% (at lvl 1) increased damage from all sources for 3 seconds after they leave the cloud. This lasts 4.2 seconds.\n\nR: Magic act: 0 toolkit bars. 120 seconds cooldown - 10 per level. Lundon uses his lucky hat to pull out a portal that can be attached via aoe skillshot to an enemy champion or to the ground, re casting this ability allows Lundon to teleport to that location and creates a tunnel that allies can pass through by right clicking the entrance. Enemies can also do this but they take 200 + 120% AP magic damage (at lvl 1) and are feared and slowed for 2.25 seconds upon exiting. The tunnel lasts 15 seconds. If it is attached to an enemy then re casting the ability will send them to you and deal the harmful effect, while also creating the tunnel. Re-casting it on allied champions just makes the tunnel, the portal stick lasts 6 seconds before automatically activating the tunnel.","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-20T05:28:23.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol seems like he is one of a bitch (nasus get excited) {{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[]}]}
