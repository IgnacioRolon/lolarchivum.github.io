It shouldn't take that long. Maybe you are going about it the wrong way. Try looking up videos on YouTube about Rengar, or pro games where they play Rengar. That might help. Also, look up some guides on MobaFire or the like and you might learn something new there.\n\nIn general, just do some research.

I agree playing more aggressive lets you learn your limits faster. However a dozen is a bit low, not only do you need to understand how much damage your abilities do, but you also need to take into account the following details and to know all of the below instinctively it takes wayyyyy more games even if you play HAM every game.\n\n* Cooldowns\n* Ability order\n* Target Champions base stats\n* Target Champions items\n* Your own Items\n* Are you ahead\n* Are you behind\n* do they have Movement speed on you\n* do they have abilities that can block/avoid yours\n* Target Champions abilities\n* Target Champions cooldowns\n\nThese were just off the top of my head. But as you can see to fully understand at an instinct level a certain champions damage output in all the possible different situations in League of Legends means you need a lot of experience against a lot of different champions under a lot of different circumstances.\n\nHowever damage output isn't the only instinct required to master a champion. The 6th sense Chicken4dinner was talking about isn't just about damage, but also cooldowns, movement speed, enemy positioning (when you can and cant take a camp before recalling), vision control (glance at the map and know if you're safe or not). This is why I think mastery a champing on an instinct level takes 50-100 games.\n\nBut I cant talk for Chicken4dinner, I assume he meant all aspects of instinct and not just damage","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-04T06:13:53.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe i'm a different type of player, i can generally get a champion down in very few games (i wouldn't by any means say mastered, but knowing the champion itself.)\n\nSure different champions have different base armor/magic resist but generally depending on the time of the game (and of course their items) you can generally have a decent idea of your damage.\n\nAlso for the taking camps etc. i think that's more common knowledge even then actual champion knowledge (unless your on a really low damage champion)\n\nSure there are a lot of factors to take into consideration, but i feel you can have a decent knowledge of a champion after about a dozen games, by no means mastered, but you should have a good understanding of them none the less.\n\nThe biggest thing i'd say that comes from mastering over just knowing a champion, is knowing your limits when your behind over when your ahead.\n\nAlso then again i'm an analytical sort of guy that knows most champions fairly decently whether i have played them or not, so maybe i just have way too much knowledge for this to be relatable.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-04T06:58:19.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe you get the instincts faster than most!
