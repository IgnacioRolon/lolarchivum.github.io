Take TP on Akali which counteracts your weak early game for going Blasting Wand then Pickaxe and only buy it versus non-tanks (unless you are fed/farmed) which may seem contradictory because it is a sustained damage item however you need to be able to trade and bully because its main use is to smash their turret and its easier to bully non-tanks/sustainers/bruisers out of lane (So its a 1 in 10 item because these Champions are mained top) and while it might seem nice to be able to deal sustained damage versus these Champions and aim for that rather than use it as a turret smasher (it is really good for taking turret) Gunblade and its build path will give you an earlyish advantage which is often needed versus other sustainers (like yourself) and Gunblade and its build path will help you trade better with bruisers for level 7ish aggression which is often when they are considering retreating to buy so you're better off being able to trade early with Gunblades build path and versus tanks you need really early aggression and Gunblade and its build path are better for this.\n\nIt's ok with flash ignite but again mainly versus squishies and only if you can farm or are fed.\n\n2. Jax is great with it in theory however it comes as a late buy and Health items provide more for him as they scale more effectively with his stat boost from ultimate rather than the benefit of gaining more armor & MR With the AP and AD into MR and Armor (Adding health and using his passive stat boosts to protect it works out more beneficial in almost all cases than adding to his MR and Armor while he has little HP to really back up the defensive stats) and Jax's already weak early game is often set back too much in lane by Guinsoo's build path and it doesn't synergize very well with his earlier itemization in many cases (if any) because he will often be either Tanking or Bursting and adding sustain to his Tanking is usually more effective with his common builds by adding HP and adding Bursting to his common builds is often assisted by building AD items like Hydra etc.\n\n3. It's great on tryndamere but again he faces a similar problem to Jax in that if he has gone more bruiser he gains more from a defensive item (he has a weak early game so again the build path fails him) and if he has gone more carryish the sustain is outperformed by adding a defensive item instead).\n\nAp Tryndamere is still good with it.\nKayle is good with it.\nXin Zhao (AP) is good with it.\nTeemo can do OK with it but it is often outperformed by other items favouring more defense or offense to synergize with his builds than the item provides.\n\nAhri is OK with it as she has good escapes so can push, keep the passive up and often gets chances to DPS turrets.\nKatarina is OK With it because she has no mana costs so can passively keep it up with her W however she isn't as good at utilizing it in other areas besides bullying squishies etc.\nCho'Gath is actually pretty funny with it but an overextending tank with 0 escapes is not so good and its a push item on him.\nEve's actually pretty ridiculous with it however she powerspikes in mid-late game and the build path often doesn't synergize well with builds oriented towards her mid-late game spike as if you purchase it mid game you often can't finish it until late game is fully flourished and the build path sets her back more than she'd like if she builds it early - compared to other items that make better complete builds.\nDiana lacks defense which is why a lot of builds have at least some form of defense and she has high base damage so building flat pen works well and sustain items don't often work well with this because given the option of a sustain damage into her kit so she has a little sustained damage - Nashor's synergizes better with her Kit because of her burst nature and the CDR aids this and adding both the items she misses out on what is often a late game raw AP item or Void Staff which complete her kit much better than more sustained damage and because she lacks defense aside from AP scaling - people tend to build raw AP or spell pen focusing on pure DPS and a scaling shield or heavy burst and a little defense and if you are going for a heavily sustained build adding HP to a nashor's or Lich Bane works out much better because of their better build paths.\nFizz: Snowballs early and it sets this opportunity too much.\nKennen: Has free farm and raw AP often works out better with his kit than sustained damage because he is more often poking than engaging and if he goes for a sustained damage build other options provide better synergy with his kit (Rylai's and Wota etc).\nLulu: has better AP Ratios and is better off scaling shield than going for vamp because she only has 1 skill that benefits fully from it and without mana items she quickly loses out on harass and tends to do better as a passive zoner than an aggressive auto-attacker and hence wont really be able to keep its passive up without pushing lane and E - Q'ing people is usually more effective and E'ing minions and Q'ing for huge ranged zoning or harass also works out much better.\nI used to rush it on Nidalee however now that she has no defensive stats its not as nice being able to go super aggressive with it early like I used to be able to because of her Cat form defensive stats so I don't take it anymore.\nYi's AP Ratios are way less than they used to and the build path is bad for him so often other items taken later in the game synergize better with items he favors and will most likely build early.\nPoppy's pretty crazy with it but again the same problem of other items are better early and then mid-game other items synergize better with her early game items.\n\nMaybe I'm underestimating the item but most of the time I go other items early because they provide more early game strength then I don't consider it because other items synergize with my early bought items better than it does however I do love buying it on Akali and I think Poppy and Tryndamere as the lolwiki states or even Aatrox are good champions to consider buying it on although I think it is a crazy good item for Kayle and its good on AP Xin Zhao too.
