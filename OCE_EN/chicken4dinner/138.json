Prevents scuttle crab from reviving team constantly causing stalemates)\n> **Best** out of 3 games\n> **Game** ends automatically after 20:00\n> **Winners** are the team with the biggest life pool (draws, well the game continues until one team dies. All life totals for each player on both teams is reset to one, can&#039;t gain lives in this situation) or if the enemy team has no lives before 20:00\n> **Baron** is illegal\n> **Dragon** is illegal\n> **Rift** scuttler gives extra lives (if the team has less then 5)\n> **One** support only\n> **One** assassin or multi purpose jgler only (ww, j4. To be a jg they have to have smite which is viable in this mode)\n> **Three** tanks max\n> **Two** adc max\n> **Don&#039;t** take towers\n> **1** slow per team (with items)\n> **1** stun/hook per team\n> _**Exhaust** ignite flash ghost_ and _teleport_ are illegal\n> **You** cant fight someone if they have two allies less in sight compered to you (if they attack first but disengage immediately after take it as they just saw your teammates, if they do this twice in 20 seconds around the same area they last did it you are free to engage) if they engage, weapons free!\n> **You** cannot engage blindly (sorry Malphite and Yasuo)\n> **You** are only allowed pink wards for proof of vison, clearing is illegal and costs 1 life\n> **Takes** place in the JG, it is encouraged to ward everything (including bushes)\n> **After** 10 mins of warding the game starts and no one can B\n>  _Feel free to suggest any rules or improvements!_ ","replies":[]}
