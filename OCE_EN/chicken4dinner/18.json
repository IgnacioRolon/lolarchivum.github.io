You'll find he gets kited really easily in teamfights (his q is slow, easily canceled, and on quite a bit longer cd than most other bruisers gap closers) which is a pretty big problem when he doesnt have much burst or utility.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-29T11:43:55.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers that helps heaps","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-29T11:30:42.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you only have enough for one champ. \n\nPlay more sonny jim jams","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-06-29T09:38:31.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vayne for sure.","replies":[]}]}
