There is a catch 22 in league for this issue, League is a team game where you actually have to take responsibility for what you do as it has real consequences yet people still try to use it as an excuse remove responsibility from their lives... One way I respect league is that it actually makes you face up to your actions and pull your head out from your ass which is great for real life, but not so much for anyone who doesn&#039;t want to do that.\n\nI have come back from that kind of attitude myself, realizing that the only thing that was holding me back in my team was **my** teamplay, feeling discouraged each game by some guy in mid/bot/top calling me bad and in turn doing the same to others.\n\nThe ultimate confidence crusher is the one that you can&#039;t recover from, but sticks to you again and again like accumulating luggage in this suitcase that gets increasingly heavy with self doubt. Every game I see now people with this excruciating weight of doubt, veiled by arrogance and anger and they try to hide from the accusations that they feel define them by not taking responsibility for their actions in games. \n\nAt least one of you will know what I am talking about, if you do speak up and shake off the weight.\n\nI know I did\n\nedit* if you are going to downvote, at least tell my why first...","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-05-24T11:59:16.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"no","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-24T12:00:39.951+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corki did 911,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-24T11:59:16.129+0000)\n>\n> no\n\nOh god chicken dont even worry bout this fuck wit, hes a trol everywhere","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-24T12:13:57.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T12:00:39.951+0000)\n>\n> Oh god chicken dont even worry bout this fuck wit, hes a trol everywhere\n\nit's not even this guy lol, I was talking the game but thanks for the comment","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-24T12:14:59.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chicken4dinner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T12:13:57.222+0000)\n>\n> it's not even this guy lol, I was talking the game but thanks for the comment\n\nOh i know hes just a prick who does what he wants (expecting no repercussions)","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-24T12:18:16.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T12:14:59.981+0000)\n>\n> Oh i know hes just a prick who does what he wants (expecting no repercussions)\n\nNemesis detected -.-","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-24T12:19:31.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chicken4dinner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T12:18:16.069+0000)\n>\n> Nemesis detected -.-\n\nlol","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-05-24T12:24:35.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"no","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-24T12:35:59.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corki did 911,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=7cdBAj83,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-05-24T12:24:35.358+0000)\n>\n> no\n\nYou should probably leave","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
