To make two standard/simple rune pages once you hit 20, one for AD and one for AP, I have calculated the costs below. Note that these are variable and interchangeable for your own wants, but these are the ones I use.\n\n**AD Page**\n_**Marks of Attack Damage:**_ 1230 (6x205)\n_**Seals of Armour:**_ 1230 (6x205)\n_**Glyphs of Scaling Magic Resist:**_ 1230 (6x1230)\n_**Quints of Attack Damage:**_ 2050 (2x1025)\n_**Total:**_ 5740IP\n\n**AP Page**\n_**Marks of Magic Penetration:**_ 2460 (6x410)\n_**Seals of Scaling Health:**_ 2460 (6x410)\n_**Glyphs of Ability Power:**_ 2460 (6x410)\n_**Quints of Ability Power:**_ 2050 (2x1025)\n_**Total:**_ 9430IP\n\n_**Total of Totals:**_ 15,170IP\n\nAs I said you can switch the runes around, especially the Quints since they offer the most utility out of the bunch of them. Here is a link to the list of Runes I used. I don't know if the stats are up to date, but the prices seem to be. It is just to the LoLWiki.\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_runes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-08T12:08:15.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like every once in a while I build up a large amount of IP only to have it disappear on new pages and runes.","replies":[]}]}
