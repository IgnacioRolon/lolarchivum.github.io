So what do you do?\r\n\r\nPlay intro bots.\r\nFirst its relaxing, meaning you don&#039;t get salty easily when playing with _fucktards_ individuals with sulky behaviours.\r\nGames finish most of the time before 20 mins meaning it adds up to a 40 min game\r\nThe punishment is that you don&#039;t get to play normal or anything you ACTUALLY want to play and it takes a solid night of grinding to work off, which still sucks because you are putting in the time for any normal game without the enjoyable experience or ip rewards.\r\nAlso because of the low skill cap, league stops becoming so much of a frustration factor and you are less likely to finish on a negative note when playing a game. No flamers or anything either just pure and simple co operation. Stress relief, because we all really do need it.\r\n\r\nMake something negative (aka leaver buster) into a positive experience (playing intro bots with a good reason, less of the general low-elo bullshit all round)\r\n\r\nPeace","replies":[]}
