If you lose the motivation to play your best in League as with any activity it's usually due to the fact that the excitement has gone out of it which could be due to a number of reasons such as poor results. What I would suggest is try spicing things up with your game play for a while instead of taking the game seriously like you're in LCS. Maybe try some different champions in weird roles e.g. anivia jungle. Once you've got the enjoyment out of playing the game again should you start trying to play seriously again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-03T12:18:54.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not all games, I definitely start with a good attitude, but if I get trolls, bad players, AFK and the usual mob of 12 year olds who ruin your game, the motivation stops.\n\nI have gone from scores like 6/0 in the first 15 minutes to 6/12 because I decided to look at the map and scoreboard... and actually see what mess the rest of my team was in.\n\nI can get de-motivated very quickly if my team starts shit, I couldn't actually care less if my team was bad, but if they have a bad attitude, even if they are great and we are winning, I will give up and would rather see the ass hats lose.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-03T19:23:35.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer im the same il go top or jg go 20 0 0 but all my team mates gone 0 20 0 so yer cant win this game or wen a pleb on my team ses im a bad player for going a ezy champ at 12 pm lol shut up mate if I do good in lane go f your self worst time about lol is it is too snow boll if the enemy has 10+ kills on your team its gg that's y I like hearos of the storm it has a under dog mechanic if your a lower lv you get more xp then them I like it means if that pleb in the mid lane feeds its all g we can still win cos the yas wont 1v5 ow team with just a {{item:3087}}","replies":[]}]}]}
