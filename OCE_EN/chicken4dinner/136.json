Yet what I don&#039;t understand is why not make history as the game progresses into the future, I know it is called the league of LEGENDS (ie legendary means you _did_ or _were_ something great in the _past_) but it is a stale concept where some unknown hero/villain pops out of a forgotten bit of old, well-known history to join the league (ie yasuo and the noxian invasion of ionia). We could have temporary shifts in the rift (because no one plays the other maps seriously anymore, I mean has anyone waited 34:55 minutes to play twisted treeline in normals?) that donate upcoming or recent and sudden impacts within valorian history(?) that can shake things up and make the game more engrossing for everyone.\r\n\r\nNow I don&#039;t mean to be a preacher but instead of a rushing river finding new ground, league is like a pond. Slowly expanding but still stagnating.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-13T07:15:00.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that the lore for league was deleted like 7 months ago and that the only canon lore is the videos they have released within that 7 month period yes?\n\nLeague of Legends doesn't exist, we should start a thing for a new name honestly.","replies":[]}]}
