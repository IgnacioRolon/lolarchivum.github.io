This doesn&#039;t happen often and most of the time I think far too much and not enough of what is happening in front of me.\r\n\r\nFor those on my friends list who can see my last normal match this is the case, that and having stiff fingers... but the point is that I don&#039;t know how to focus and shut out my thinking. Is there a process to occupy my mind with in game so I am at least addressing something rather then letting my mind wander?\r\n\r\nIf anyone would be willing to take some time to help I would be very grateful","replies":[{"poster":"Thrill3r","date":"2015-06-26T03:56:14.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"twitch.tv/thrill3rrrr\n\nFollow my stream and ask me any questions so I can help! :)\n\nThrill3r","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-06-20T08:29:26.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get some headphones. This will help you focus on your game more, it happened to me too when I didn't have my headphones and I had to use my speakers I wasn't used to it because I couldn't focus well because of my surroundings and what other things I hear. So get some good headphones that will block out sound from the outside. Hope this will help you focus.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-20T09:24:24.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sound card is broken, I use Bluetooth speakers","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-06-21T21:51:45.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm then I am not sure then but sorry I couldn't help though I think you just need to get used to the sounds you hear a lot.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
