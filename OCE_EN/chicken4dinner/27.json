I see it in bullies, it is a coping mechanism to become accustomed in any way they can to a hostile environment and that coping mechanism is to be a part of the environment. Those who are a part of the machine don&#039;t get processed by the machine if you get my meaning and It is sad because it can bring out the worst in people in a really petty way.\n\nAll of us have much more integrity then this in our day to day jobs and lives, but in league its a whole new universe separate from your life where the culture is different and it influences everyone sometimes gradually and/or alarmingly fast. We can all be victims of this shit if we allow it but that is up to us; like it is to bipolar, to decide that.\n\nEDIT: Grammar check on my last sentence please?","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-06-05T01:39:04.269+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing since beta and still bronze?

Honestly I don't want to make people feel bad, because that's a bad feeling, I don't say things that I do to hurt, I saw it out of fun or frustration, the two seem to merge with me.\n\nBut yeah, thanks but I wouldn't bother, people will hate on me because of who I am, I cannot say I don't deserve it.\nI was one of the first few GD trolls on OCE, that reputation sticks with you, I guess I'd rather be hated then unknown.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-04T14:26:01.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bipolar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gZf7sEEA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-04T12:56:21.751+0000)\n>\n> I was one of the first few GD trolls on OCE, that reputation sticks with you, I guess I'd rather be hated then unknown.\n\nBut why hated? That negative attention seeking is going to stick worse on your reputation then burning napalm. People accept change, you don't need to give them what they want from a stereotype like yourself (as you admitted). Are you scared of fading into obscurity? That's nothing, most people don't care half the time about what you have to say (sticking to the stereotype) and I only read your posts to see what trash people respond with to you.\n\nYour not a legendary troll\n\nNo one even talks about you\n\nI did this post because of the general attitude aimed in your direction.\n\nBut why did I use you? One thing, like your condition you are two different sides to the same coin (person) and even if you troll mildly you reek of potential. potential for redemption.\n\nI'm not being some fag who fantasizes about epic rescues of people in bad places, This post was not about you...\n\nYour guinea pig so I can explain the fundamental impact of being an asshole in every game to strangers you don't know, who you would normally be respectful and considerate towards in real life.\n\nYou are just an example, (though laced with compassion because I do feel for you) to prove my point that in league people get toxic and how ridiculous that behavour is for some people.\n\nI am putting a face to the age old demon of toxic players.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-04T12:32:40.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He has some relation to that sackboy faggot so he's a shitcunt in my books. luckily i have both of them blacklisted so i don't see any of their posts.","replies":[]}]}
