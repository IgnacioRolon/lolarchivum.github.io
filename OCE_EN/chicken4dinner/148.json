But I hate the way the game is at the moment.\n\nI want to climb high like anyone else not because of personal hubris that I used to have but more because the community is so centered towards &quot;status&quot; and how you are viewed depends on your rank.\n\nI am so fucking sick of being judged, excluded from my friendship groups and just constantly bombarded with negative shit from plats and higher (even other bronzies who don&#039;t trust anyone on their team and think everyone is a lost cause from the get go, gg tilt)...\n\nI am just losing the passion for the game I had back in s3 when I started playing and s4 when I came back after a year, even though the game is fun as fuck. It is kinda scary to think about but I don&#039;t see much point in playing when I am missing some really basic concepts and that means the social death of me in league. \n\nI don&#039;t want to dump my plight on anyone really but my attention on what I need to do to win the game is in the wrong places so I prioritise wrongly, makes me pretty frustrating to play with lol but because I am just &quot;another bronze scrub&quot; no one bothers with me and just calls me bad, blocks me and moves on :(\n\nThis is where I stand\n\nI have no in game success and no enjoyable community to interact with either, who would rather alienate me based on rank then get to know me\n\nI am always on the boards because at least here discussion is civil","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T17:05:42.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have better thoughts and you'll get ahead in life","replies":[]}]}
