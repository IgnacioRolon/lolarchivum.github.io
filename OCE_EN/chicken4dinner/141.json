So I press play a minute later and somehow end up in matchmaking with the \"misconnection\" icon. Everyone was not picking a champion and to test if I could I clicked on Soraka, the icon didn't go away.\nThe timer ends with no one picking a champion, the number timer was gone but i was still in the champ select. I decide to force quite League through the program bar down the bottom and restart the client. I log in an it says that I'm in a game. I'm really confused so I question my friend who I was queuing with and he says that I picked Soraka and am DC.\nI pressed reconnect (even though I never connected to the game) and wait for the loading screen to get me to the match. This time I'm stuck at the loading screen. Ping was moving between 100 - 110 so that was fine, but it said 100%. So I wait a minute more and nothing else has happened.\nSo for the second time I restart the client and reconnect and within 10 seconds I'm in the match.\n11 minutes had passed and it was a 3v5 bcz the vayne adc decided to AFK.\nSomehow we won by a landslide and I didn't even have the right runes and masteries. I had my top AD Quinn masteries and runes... and I've never really played Soraka besides once in a custom made match.\n\nLook up my matches it should be there.\n\nP.S. Her heals are OP, wtf.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-01T11:20:58.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't be worse than my last game - one instalocks Ekko and screams mid.
