Part of the night angel trilogy.\r\nAzoth\r\nThe night angel\r\n\r\nPassive: The Devourer. The source of Azoth's power, the devourer has two stages, reaping and sowing. During reaping, killing units (minions and small monsters will stack up to 3 times before filling a point) will fill one point (out of 5) of talent, after the max 5 of talent is filled then the devourer goes into sowing stage. During sow, Azoth is covered by the devourer and becomes the night angel, the absolute pinnacle of justice without mercy. Enemies who come too close are feared for 0.6 seconds (this does not happen twice to the same champion within 8 seconds) and all abilities are modified yet consume a point of talent once used.\r\n\r\nQ: Lethal etiquette: CD 8 secs: Reap: Azoth never lets justice evade him, his next attack cuts a critical spot (60% AD bonus damage) on his opponent reducing their damage by 8/10/12/14/16% and Movement speed by 20% for 3 seconds\r\n\r\nSow: Azoth does not reduce their movement speed with his cut, instead he chains his enemy to himself and drains their life by 6% of your maximum health over the duration and you gain 3% + (110% AP) as health\r\n\r\nW: Battle flow: CD 20/16/14/11/8 secs: Reap: Azoth tunes his movements to the rhythm of the battle for 4 seconds increasing his attack speed by 30% and his critical strike chance by 20%, Azoth gains 25/30/35/40/50% movement speed when chasing enemy champions.\r\n\r\nSow: Azoth gains all the benefits from reap without the movement speed bonus however critical strikes will cause electrical surges from his enemy for 2 seconds dealing 20% AD to nearby enemies every 1/8th of a second (note that the range is quite small). Critical strike chance during this period is increased by 150% for every successful critical strike. \r\n\r\nE: Death prowess CD 12 secs: Reap: First cast, Azoth is unable to be struck by the next 3 basic attacks from any enemy champion or large monster. Second cast, within 5 seconds after the first cast Azoth can leap a large distance up to 3 times, if the cursor is over an enemy champion or large monster Azoth will instead dash the distance and deliver a powerful blow (120% AD), pressing e again upon contact will kick the enemy away (80% AD) a shorter distance at the cost of 1 jump/dash. \r\n\r\nSow: First cast, Azoth instead of dodging basic attacks will return 80% of all damage dealt to him back to his attackers for the next 3 seconds. Second cast, Azoth will teleport the same distance as reap in a flash of darkness and turn invisible for 1 second, this can only be used once. If the cursor is over an enemy when he teleports they will take 140% AD and become stunned for 0.95 seconds.\r\n\r\nR: Found wanting, innate: Azoth cannot die during sow however if he takes lethal damage all talent points are consumed (ending sow) and restoring his health by 5/10/20% max health per stack\r\nActive: CD 130/110/90 seconds Azoth becomes briefly untargetable as he emits a roar that fears (0.8 seconds) and marks nearby enemies for death, upon this period all damage dealt against them is increased by 1.2/1.5/2X and causes an over time burn (4 seconds) that deals damage based on 40% of the damage dealt to them. this effect lasts 3 seconds\r\n\r\nLove to hear of your LOL take on your favourite characters from movies/tv series'/ books/ other games ect","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-02-10T20:47:05.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sanic.\nPassive ~ GOTTA GO FAST: Every 5 seconds the game goes on, Sanic get's +20 speed.\nQ ~ SANIC SPEED: Sanic teleports with 2X distance to flash.
