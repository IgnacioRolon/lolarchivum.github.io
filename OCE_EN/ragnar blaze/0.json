In order to achieve this I am willing to spectate your games and play normals will you so that I can see you play in real-time and offer criticisms and advice on areas in which you can improve. I will, however, NOT play ranked with you or on your account so please do not ask. I am only looking for someone who has a genuine interest in getting better at the game and fully accepts and understands that they are at the rating they are at because they belong there; I cannot help you if you think your teams hold you back.\n\n**Who am I? What makes me capable of helping people play better?**\n\nTwo-time diamond this season with a current rating of diamond 4 and a peak rating of diamond 3. I've played this game since Season 2 when Xerath was released. I main jungle but am capable of playing every role (although mid is my weakest). I have a deep understanding of risk versus reward, objective prioritisation, shot-calling and more which I believe would be a great asset to have as a new or struggling player.\n\nIf this seems interesting to you, leave a message here and I'll get in touch with you to decide if you're someone I feel I could help.","replies":[{"poster":"HeRoHeiDi","date":"2015-01-03T09:34:35.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I often play either ashe{{champion:22}}  or zyra{{champion:143}} and im only level 11.
