My chat scale is on max and I can&#039;t move it. I&#039;ve tried changing resolutions and it doesn&#039;t help. I can see part of the chat box if I press Z after enough messages have been sent, but I can&#039;t move it. I tried opening a ticket but I think I got an automatic response asking me for myriad tests which didn&#039;t seem necessary to me. How can I move my chat box back? I found an old thread from a few years back where a Rioter mentioned deleting the chat.ini fine (which I tried, didn&#039;t work) and clearing the global properties file to no avail.","replies":[{"poster":"Boyce","date":"2016-02-26T06:54:20.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After some trial and error I found out how to fix it! You have to go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config (but be sure your account is logged in to the client to ensure you are changing your own settings.) Then go to the persistedsettings (it should be a JSON file) and open it up using notepad. Then find the chatx & chatY settings. They should be at the top of the page; at least they were for me. Set the value to zero on both of them. Save and your chat should appear as normal. Hope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boyce","date":"2016-02-26T06:29:50.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please Riot! I'm experiencing the same problem.","replies":[]}]}
