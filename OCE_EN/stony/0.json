But now whenever I play lol with my girlfriend on the same connection, we get random lag spikes. Our ping is normally around 10-15, but the spikes make it go up to 300-1000+. I noticed that when lagging and I close my LoL and reconnect, the lag is gone for her. Sometimes it randomly comes back. Not sure what is going on because opening a browser and using facebook or downloading pictures almost comes up instantly with a bit of a delay, but the download speeds itself are fine. Please help me!! I've tried everything.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:33:53.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I've tried everything.\n\nTo make sure we don't go over the same thing, could you provide a list of 'everything' you've tried?","replies":[]}]}
