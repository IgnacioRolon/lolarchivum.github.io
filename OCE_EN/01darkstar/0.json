This was a silly time yet and fun one too and this was a time of wonder and laughter.\nLearning the meta, practicing the roles and loving the fun and satisfaction of improving.\nAnd the thrill of victory, the ability to hold their head high and say, \"Yes I held my lane, I fought and I won, Leading the charge to victory!\"\nEven to go so far as learn tactics and plays, when to push, how to bait out an enemy and reading the map like they could see the very code of the game.\nThey even learnt the value of vision, a truly wondrous day which they shall never forget. Warding is not just for supports.\nBuy a pink. See a gank. Save a life.\nThen after a year of play the summoner looked back on how far they had come. \nAll those battles wins and loses, good times and bad, lessons learnt.\nAnd decided yes now is the time to step into the legendary ranked queues.\nNow their time had come.\n\nThe summoner was not prepared for what they found.\n\nThe competitive scene, the higher level of this Legendary League was no civilised contest of skill and teamwork.\nIt was a brutal, violent arena home to the aggressive and the angry.\nTo the summoner this came as a shock and shattered their belief. \nThe ranked arena was full of abuse and hate, harsh words and the infamous troll. The afk player and the feeder.\nNo one seemed happy or even to respect each other regardless of teams. \nEven in victory most were aggressive and taunting. \nVerbal hate flowed thicker than the blood that stained the rifts soils.\nTeam work was but a distant memory. \nAll the tactics and lessons the summoner had learnt seemed pointless in the face of a fight not only against the enemy team on the rift but his own allies as well.\nFresh faced level 30's greeted this summoner.\nPlayers who apparently knew everything there was to know about this world, so any advice and calls for logic were meet with abuse and flame.\nThese same players who choose to bring a champion they had never played before into the rift...\nThe summoner was plagued by the afk, the troll, the flamer and the feeder.\nThis summoner now stands 2 and 6 knowing that though they could have played better and did make mistakes they didn't flame didn't troll didn't feed and didn't afk. \nThey fought and struggled never giving up trying to make good on their dreams of some respectable rank, silver would have been a dream come true.\nNow this dream, has become a nightmare.\nThe summoner called out to the game masters and reported the players who did not live up to the summoners code.\nBut not a word was heard.\nNo action was taken.\nThe young hopeful summoners voice was lost and the cries for some action any action to be taken to fix the worst kind of players was ignored.\nIt was with a heavy heart the summoner realised that even if they had the best of intentions they were only one and no one could hear their call to judge the guilty and punish the abusive.\nTo fix this system of hate of a toxic community which lets the wicked prosper.\nSo the summoner now stands at a cross roads.\nShould they continue on into this ranked world, full of hate and hope to pull through? \nOr try to return to the normal queues with the hope to find the fun and joy they ounce knew.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-16T20:27:27.084+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Join a ranked team.** You get a ranking, rewards, and you won't have to put up with the toxicity of solo que.
