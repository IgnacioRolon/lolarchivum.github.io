My main point is on Mordekaiser, What happened to a ranged ad and a support. Mordekaiser has ruined bot lane; he just takes relic shield and gets solo exp with his W. Riot needs to fix morde its ruined the whole point of bot lane.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2015-08-22T07:33:19.009+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its amazing that you can now have an AP bot laner. Its allowed new comps to form and try out. The whole idea of it HAS to be a support and ranged AD bot is literally what the meta means, its just the current IDEA of what is best. Riot is trying to allow new things to form with the changing meta.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-22T09:06:49.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically the meta is \"the current strategy that, given equal skills, grants the best chances of winning\". \"Ranged AD + Supp with dedicated jungler\" was beating the hell out of every composition back in S1, and it established itself as the only meta. So far, it is almost unchallenged (small changes happened to the midlane over the years, but the structure stayed. You never see ADCmid and Duo MageTanks anymore).\nIf AP Bot can be turned into a valid meta option, so be it, i'll love some new challenges.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-22T12:49:27.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no the meta is what works best wile giving the best out of the map aka cs kills xp so on that is the meta like duo bot 1 mid 1 top 1 jg gives the best xp cs and kills hence the meta if there were no meta it would be like one game its duo mid and top with 1 id and no jg get it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"just2jiG","date":"2015-08-23T09:56:23.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of us welcome the change, RIOT is adding another possibility to botlane, cause Bot lane picks have pretty much been stock and predictable over the last few seasons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-22T14:28:04.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvan and Leona bot meta is best meta.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la2aaann74U","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-22T13:50:57.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"m8 were you born yesterday? do u even meta bruh?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-08-22T07:28:07.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, its good.
