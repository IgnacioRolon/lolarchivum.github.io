We aim to play 1 (maybe 2 if everyone wants) nights a week and try our best not take it too seriously but aim to rise up the ranks and eventually improve in team synergy as well as improve our own skill. This will be a long term team we will play weekly and have fun and get to know each other better as time goes on! I have played with the 3 other members on the team we are all relaxed solid and consistent players that have a good time. No ragers please. We would also prefer if your confortable making early game calls to work with the lanes in achieving ganks/calling drag when you feel its suited etc. We will be using teamspeak.","replies":[{"poster":"RageBlade","date":"2015-08-04T22:59:36.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Seethingsin\nRank: Diamond 5\n\nI would like to try out as your jungler!","replies":[]}]}
