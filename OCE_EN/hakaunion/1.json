I've followed other regions before, but this is the first season I've really being following opl, and it's mostly because this podcast makes it much more digestible. I don't have time to watch every game, but I often choose the games to rewatch from what you guys talk about here.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Benji","date":"2017-02-21T06:45:13.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would recommend checking out Dire Wolves vs Legacy from Week 4 in that case! Probably the best series of the week.\n\nWe're back next week with our Week 5 recap and Week 6 preview!
