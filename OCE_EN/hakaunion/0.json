Jake's Roast? That was great!\n\nUnfortunately though we discontinued the show because it was just too resource intensive. The same team who runs the broadcast was putting together the pod which meant they were working on their weekend to get it done, which wasn't sustainable.\n\nThat said something we're seeing more of this year even though it's early doors is content created by 3rd parties. There was a 3rd party podcast last year and I hope another starts this year as well. \n\nThanks for posting and keep supporting your OPL club!","replies":[{"poster":"gangsha1ger","date":"2018-01-23T00:12:48.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hire some more people then to help out? No more podcast or Ocean week?\n\nCmon man, Riot are just cutting costs. If you need more members for the shoutcasting team, take the guys who cover the OCS, they do a better job anyways!","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2018-02-15T09:13:35.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry i missed this comment!\n\nIt's not as simple as hiring more people and I can assure you our investment into esports has not been reduced. The fact of the matter is that as esports evolves everything is more complex and requires more people or higher expertise (more expensive) operators.\n\nFor example, the broadcast control room now has an expensive yet powerful piece of equipment which allows us to record every video channel (10 player cams + 2 in game observers + 2 shoulder cams), tag them (so we can recall later), store them, play replays, etc. This is the sort of equipment that fits inside a Fox Sports broadcast control room or a channel 9. It's expensive, and complicated but helps us deliver a higher quality broadcast, archive our footage for later use and create engaging content. \n\nThis is a good thing because it enables us to create a much higher quality broadcast, but it means we need to focus our efforts on the things we think are most important and make tough decisions not to do some projects, even though we love them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wray Z","date":"2018-01-24T04:19:08.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Hakaunion,\n\nI've launched my own OPL content site snowballesports.com\n\nEvery friday we are doing the \"flash forward\" podcast via twitch at 8.30pm which we will upload to our youtube/website.\n\nHope you enjoy our content!","replies":[]}]}
