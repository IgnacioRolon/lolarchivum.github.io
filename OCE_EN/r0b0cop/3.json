Everyone at some point was dced, usually 6-7 people were completely dced I think. The game dragged on for ages since no one could do anything, eventually our Zz&#039;rots beat theirs and we won just by spamming abilities on stationary champions and dc pushing. Ping flatlined on any random number like 1039, and I even got a weird cursor bug where the sword cursor hover turned turquoise blue.\n\nOh and we won (bittersweet victory). \n   {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}
