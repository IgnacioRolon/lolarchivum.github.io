Champion idle animations repeated, minion attacks repeated, but nothing moved. Ping and fps moved. Reconnected, within 2 minutes, same thing. Relog + reconnect, same thing, but this time with the fucking horrible windowed / fullscreen mode bug whenever you press any key. Restart comp + relog + reconnect (after freezing at 0% and having to relog, on windowed mode) get into game, within 10 seconds it freezes again. The game ended a few minutes after. \r\nThe game had enemy Jhin in it... I dont know if that had anything to do with it.","replies":[]}
