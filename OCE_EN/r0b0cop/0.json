You do not own the champion you are playing\n2. You have already received a chest on that champion for this season (In your profile under champions it will show a gold border around their portrait)\n3. The S grade was not in your premade\n4. You are on or have had a recent restriction of some kind (though I'm fairly certain you can't get key fragments either in this case so I do not believe this to be your issue)\n\nFrom your match history it's looking like all of those S grades you got were on Ryze, and since you can only earn one chest per champion per season, that's why you aren't getting more chests. \n\nTry playing some normals with a premade every now and again to get chests on other champions. Remember that you don't have to earn the S grade, as long as the S is in your premade you will still receive a chest provided you own the champ you are playing and haven't received a chest on them already.","replies":[]}]}
