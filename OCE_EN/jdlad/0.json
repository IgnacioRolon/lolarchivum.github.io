All of the i have disconnected were due to my mum turning the internet off and my internet not working. I haven&#039;t done anything wrong, i haven&#039;t left a game on purpose yet i have to deal with being on the low priority list. Most of the time when people are put on this list its due to internet problems and has nothing to do with people quitting. i plea that this list be taken down because it does more harm than good.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-29T04:51:10.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">my mum turning the internet off\n\n:3\n\nThat's still technically leaving a game intentionally. Your mother is a person you can talk with. Do that. At least find out *when* she turns off the internet so you don't find yourself in the middle of a game when she does it.\n\nLow priority queue has done wonders in regards to removing intentional leavers. I would not want it removed, but adjusted a bit so that you can't be so easily punished by it.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuwazza","date":"2015-03-29T19:48:39.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. It needs to be stricter, and i wish it would group afk'ers togeter in games so those of us who don't afk don't have to worry about getting our game thrown.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-30T07:44:54.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prisoner's Island is an idea that was definitely considered by Riot, but they eventually agreed on the fact that you can't solve negativity by surrounding those players in negativity. It's kind of counter-intuitive when you think about it.\n\nWhat would be the ultimate solution is to have moderators monitoring games and handing out punishments/bans appropriately. I wouldn't mind someone spectating my game for that purpose.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
