The selling point for me with mages has always been the massive ap you could have. the mage items have shifted to now giving more utility stats like CDR or Mana. To reach those numbers you need infernal drakes and baron. Can&#039;t say if this is better for the game but just wondering if im alone in this thought.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-06T01:13:56.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MANA BUILD MAGE \n{{item:3040}} {{item:3041}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3907}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2139}} \n 50ap+1400mana(3%=ap)+145ap+200mana+120ap(+40%)+100ap+400mana+120(200ap)+50ap = 945AP before runes\nthe scaling mana build gives you very close to 1k ap with the spellbinder active,\nalso gives some hp and 30% cdr and still has sorc boots, \nyou could also swap the RoA for a Ludens for a total of -6ap +10%cdr\nalso if we factor in a typical mages's lvl18 mana pool of about 900mana, a total of **983 ap**\n\nGENERIC MAGE\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2139}} \n120ap(+40%)+80ap+90ap+75ap+70ap+50ap = **679ap** before runes\nthe 'generic' mage build still gives you a decent near 700ap\nand is far from optimal since Ludens offers 30 less ap than spellbinder in exchange for mana and cdr, \nzhonias is mostly about the Hourglass and a little armour, as a defensive item, it's ap is meh,\nsimilarly the magic pen items aren't great for ap 70ap or 80ap respectively,\nbut has all the typical mage features such as full magic pen, 30% cdr and Zhonias Hourglass.\n-----\n\nand now for the curveballs\n\nAP ATKSPEED JUNGLE\n{{item:1402}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3907}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2139}} \n80ap+25ap(+15%)+80ap+120(200)ap+120ap(+40%)+50ap = **860ap**\nstill has a jungle item, has mad atkspeed and onhit, has good cdr and could probably solobaron if you used Elise or something.\n\nSHIELD SUPPORT\n{{item:3092}} {{item:3504}}  {{item:2065}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3020}} {{item:2139}} \n35ap+50%m+60ap+50%m+40ap+100%m+30ap+100%m(25%=5ap)+120ap(+40%)+50ap = **483ap**\nthis a shield support, who has 1 ap item, with around '500ap'ish did you perhaps confuse this with a mage building mage items?\n\n----------\n\nAP still lives, none of these calcs considered Ornn items, these builds are hardly hyper optimized for massive AP, all of them had boots, none counted champion passives, Dragons, Barons or even Runes.\n\n**Bonus dumb round**\n{{item:3907}} {{item:3041}} {{item:3374}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:3089}} {{item:2139}} \n120(200)ap+145ap+175ap(+40%ap)+120ap+120ap+120ap+50ap = 1302ap\nof course this build is stupid, but if you wanted to do something like Base Karthus you could swap out the last deathcap, reduce your ap by 70 and get a Voidstaff, and end up doing 1474magic damage with 40% pen to everyone which would do a little more than half hp to a squishy and still chunk a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-10-06T01:32:24.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that said, these numbers sound big, but ap ratios have been toned back, so there isn't really much point to having 'nuclear ap' anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-10-06T05:48:47.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its all about on-hit and other 'hidden' effects these days.

And even then it doesn't stack with Gunblade or GLP, _(where as AD related items like Static Shiv and Rapid fire do)_.\n\nThey are actives too, not passives like with most AD items.\nThey dont just happen on the enemy during a fight, you have to target and aim _(and maybe miss, or click the wrong target in a team fight)_.

And champs who build Gunblade and Lichbane, probably aren't the champs that have a use for Liandry's.\nUnlike AD items, the AP ones are much more situation and specific to champion type. So mages are much more restricted.\n\nMeanwhile theres nothing from stopping MF or Vayne from building duskblade, even though its a item not even intended for their class.\n\nIm not saying mages builds are weak, I'm just saying they have to make more sacrifices to get the same advantage.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-10-06T01:52:14.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you only getting to 500ish, i can break 750 with deathcap and 4 other items...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-10-06T00:34:14.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember the days when hitting 300 AD was just a myth, even on carry champs.\nAnd because it was easier to build AP than AD, AP scalings were low, and AD scalings where high, to account for this strange concept called 'balance'.\n\nThe tables have completely flipped now, the shopkeeper basically hands out free AD on almost every item, meanwhile steadily slashing AP items.\nBut funnily enough the AD scalings haven't really been lowered.
