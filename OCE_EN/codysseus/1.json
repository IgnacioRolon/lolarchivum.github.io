I have become ever so lonely since the flames of my exalted comrades and treasured allies were snuffed out abruptly by the cruel vice of war. Some nights I can&#039;t even bring myself to enter the rift, the land I once called home, my hands tremble as I imagine one again having to traverse the harsh realm of Runeterra, unaided by the cherished allies I was once proud to call my family. Without them I feel nothing but the  unrelenting brunt of the shallow and crushing void that has consumed me, help free me from this endless torment, add me in game- Codysseus\r\nSee you on the rift :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bronze 6 Yasuo","date":"2017-10-28T03:54:00.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should be looking to add some friends in real life instead of adding people in a game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-10-28T02:07:55.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played League of Legends for more than one year (less than two years), I have good number of wins in normal games, but I lose a lot in ranked currently.\nFeel free to add me if you wish.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonnyeps","date":"2017-10-28T01:55:57.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Esteemed summoner Mr Codysseus, first of you have my utmost condolences for the comrades and allies you've lost. I too am unfortunately in the same situation as the sole survivor of my former battalion. I heed your call to arms and rallying of new men, however, I fear the elo gap between us may wither the possibility of new frontiers and subsequently divide us in the long run. If you so desire quell this loneliness, re-enlist an alt and meet me down in the trenches where we are but mere cannon fodder. Maybe we could form a whole new team and together, share the amplified glory of victory and lessen the pains of defeat. \n\nign: Jonnyeps","replies":[]}]}
