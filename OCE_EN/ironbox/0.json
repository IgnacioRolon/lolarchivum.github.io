I am currently working towards becoming a support main. As a whole I feel that I have quite an edge when it comes strategy not only for myself at a given situation, but for the whole team.\r\n\r\nLooking for a team that is willing to work hard at building synergy. I currently am gold 5 though I do not play much Solo Q. I tend to avoid it as i&#039;m generally a chilled out person but SoloQ gets me going in all the wrong ways. However these traits don&#039;t follow me when i&#039;m playing in a pre made group. \r\n\r\nThis all being said, if there&#039;s an ADC out there that wants to mess around give me a yell! I&#039;d be happy to play a few games. \r\n\r\nIGN: Ironbox","replies":[{"poster":"hardog007","date":"2015-06-07T00:54:06.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was gold 5 last year and am a adc main.. this year im still only in bronze because promo logic.but im happy to join any team u find or just have some fun duo games ... send me friend request if interested :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ironbox","date":"2015-06-06T03:12:56.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
