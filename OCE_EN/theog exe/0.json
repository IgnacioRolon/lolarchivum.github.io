I see patterns in the game that others dont see, can dodge abilities, have practised crazy adc mechanics and go positive nearly every game ( 3 negative ranked games on match history atm). \r\n\r\nHowever far ahead i get in games, i always find myself losing, im always encountering trolls, and for some reason even my wins are very close games. Im an adc main and i usually get ahead early, often 5/0, 7/0 10/0 but despite my dmg output and mechanical skills i always find myself relying on my team who struggle to observe team fights, maintain map awareness and game sense as well as i and they more often than not, let me down.\r\n\r\n I want to ask if you guys could take a look at my stats, check me out, maybe add me and we can play a game and give me some advice. Really looking to improve so please help a brother out.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-30T15:10:59.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say you need to find a duo support main and most importantly focus more on objectives rather than kills, I see you are getting ridiculous kdas due to your mechanical advantage, however looking at your objective involvement it's slightly below your team's average which is odd considering how strong you would be at that point with that much of a gold lead.\n\nYou should try to more actively turn that huge gold and level lead you've gotten from your mechanics into map pressure and control by forcing towers down more and taking dragons. If you are 8-0 as an adc, you should realistically have taken the enemy botlane tower and should be looking to do things like take dragon or roam mid to take that tower and then rotate top to take that tower and then start grouping as a team to then push down 2nd tier turrets and teamfight. Or if you see the enemy jungler and midlaner either dead or up in toplane, you should maybe try damaging the 2nd tier turret really early if your support can manage wards. You should realise that the biggest bonus of killing an enemy is not the shutdown gold you get, but the fact that with this you are putting them behind in gold and experience and to further compound this, you should do things like pushing minions under the enemy tower and then forcing objectives such as dragon whilst they're dead and cannot contest it. In alot of your games where you lost, things just went on for too long and you weren't pressing your lead enough and you ended up losing the lead because of it, especially on early game champions like draven.\n\nOther things I'd suggest are trying to poke harder in lane without going all in, since I see that in games where you dominated the enemy adc still had alot of farm which in bronze games that drag out, means that in the end they'll have almost as much gold as you. Pushing minions under tower or freezing the lane near your tower and zoning the enemy from their cs are two ways to capitalise on being stronger. \n\nFrom what I've seen you can get out of bronze with some changes to your decision making since you have the mechanics and skills to do it. In alot of the games you lost, if you had pressed your lead harder and used it to gain map control though taking towers early you could have probably won very early into the game. When carrying in low elo (and looking at how well you play I'm almost certain you can) the most important thing to focus on is pushing objectives as soon as you kill your opponents and forcing the game strongly in your teams advantage as soon as you get that lead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-09-29T06:56:16.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look honestly the best way to get out is duoing with a mate, Either One ADC and the other JG or Sup\n\nBelieve it or not Last season i started at Bronze V 0LP and made it to Silver II by duoing with my mate, \n\nSome games he went JG and i went Vayne ADC, Most of the games i was his support and he went ADC. \n\nMost players are good in bronze but they just dont work as a team, you need to band up with people you know in order to win. Other things you can do is practise warding, **NEVER RELY ON SUPPORT!** because if you rely on him to sightstone and he decided to go full AP or AD then you're screwed Buy heaps on Pink wards, occasionally have a look at other peoples lanes see if they need a gank **AND ALWAYS (I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH) ALWAYS PING** it helps you and helps the team! \n\nBest of Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-30T14:47:27.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have heard of full ap supports like annie, zyra, morg deciding to not bother with a sightstone (sightstone is my fav item in the game) but I've never seen a full ad support aside from that one time in normals I had a master yi support and he was super useless.

It gives good early game bonus damage and offers high gold value in it's stats. Phantom Dancer is good if you need to play defensive and outduel divers, Rapid Fire Cannon works great in poke team comps and Runnans is good if you need to waveclear or if you have alot of tanks that can reliably peel (which in bronze is a nope).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-29T08:34:12.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just get a friend to boost you to silver 2 so you have teams that are like you.","replies":[]}]}
