It may suck to get champs you already own, particularly low-cost champs like Ashe, but there's not much to be done about that short of a revamp of how capsules give loot, but then we'd be talking about a potentially negative impact top Riot's monetisation, which is an important aspect to keeping the game going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-09-07T10:04:35.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i havent got a single honor capsule and im level 4, so much for being a good player","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-09-07T14:21:20.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Willy Donka,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=n4TLGsqZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-07T10:04:35.741+0000)\n>\n> i havent got a single honor capsule and im level 4, so much for being a good player\n\nIf it makes you feel better, I got 2 capsules, both contained champ shards and ones I already own (I forgot what the first one was, the second contained Gragas shard).","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2017-09-08T09:43:59.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update: got a capsule, had a champion shard, lee sin.
