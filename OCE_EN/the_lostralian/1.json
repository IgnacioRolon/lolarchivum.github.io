At a guess id say its probably by about the amount of health his passive would give him, because it gets slightly bigger as the game goes on. I thought it might have been from running health seals on my rune page or something, but I&#039;ve used a different rune page with armour seals on the second game and still had the same issue.\r\n\r\nJust thought i should let you guys know, cheers","replies":[]}
