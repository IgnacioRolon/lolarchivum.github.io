Sure it's bm if you have it intent picked, but often it's just they don't want to play with it. \n\nI hate Ezreal, I hate versing him and I hate playing with him, and he regularly sees the business end of my ban hammer. While personally I don't ban intent picks no matter how much I might want to, some people make the choice that the fun they lose isn't worth a second pref pick from someone on their team. \n\nTo be immediately labelled a degenerate for that? In a normal? That seems rather harsh.\n\nRegardless, there isn't much feedback the community can give you without your actual chat logs, so if you want anything specific, I'd recommend posting them. If you want to appeal your punishment, you can submit a ticket to Player Support and they'll review it: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
