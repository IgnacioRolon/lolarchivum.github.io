AV's registered roster, including subs: DDD, Paradise, Chelby, Triple, Chenyboy, and Jakey.\n\nThe team made the decision that since playing with a sub anyway, it was better to keep DDD in the top position - my speculation is that he was more comfortable with his native position and since he's the newest member of the team that his focus should be just about meshing with the team and not meshing with the team AND an off role.\n\nSo because DDD was the acting top laner, Paradise stepped up and covered the position until Chenyboy was able to play the second game in which AV swapped their roster back to standard.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-07-16T03:17:57.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daemonkz","date":"2016-07-18T00:46:33.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-28T12:19:03.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Daemonkz","date":"2016-06-29T03:27:30.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This was posted on the Esports Board because I am asking a question about a professional player.
