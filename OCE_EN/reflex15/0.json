I understand there is practically no protection and you would require some decent tanks within game but considering Kassadin&#039;s mobility and cdr potential it could be a possiblity???","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-12T01:14:13.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's fine. But, Zhonya's is really really good on Kass since he can jump in, blow a target up, go in stasis to wait for cooldowns, and then ult out or onto another target to avoid cc.\n\nAlso, Void Staff is important for killing tanks, and even some squishies as they start buying Maw and QSS.\n\nYou generally don't need BOTH RoA and Tear on Kass, generally one is enough and RoA is the way better option since it's more immediate power and provides you with a bit of tankiness. I've seen some people go RoA+Athenes which isn't bad either, you could get your CDR that way. Generally, everyone just runs 10 or 15% as glyphs in your rune page, more than enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-11T05:50:21.812+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wanted the 40% CDR you could run an Iceborn, but i see no real problem with this build if you understand how to play the build out.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-11T21:31:21.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**40% CDR**\n\na.k.a how to go from 3000 mana to oom in under 10 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-12T04:39:05.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm assuming since his asking for build information he understands how Kassadin's ult works.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
