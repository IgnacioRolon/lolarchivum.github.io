We are currently ranked Plat 5 and Gold 1, currently climbing as we both were plat last season. Not a big achievement for solo que we know, but we work well as a duo and can&#039;t see any issues with a team aswell. \r\n\r\nI myself have coached and played in a team before consisting of a couple diamonds and a master player, back when team ranked was a thing. So I do know the in&#039;s and outs of the strategies and communication neccesary. We are after a team that is determined to climb higher and gain more skills and knowledge. But also a team that will be regular, instead of not just a one time thing. \r\n\r\nWe both have discord and are willing to start whenever. As a duo we play a fairly decent botlane, but we can also jungle and mid with a variety of champions.\r\n\r\nAdd me in game if you wanted to discuss more or if we are able to join the team, or you want a trial: **Cant Be Slowed**","replies":[{"poster":"LordBigKent","date":"2018-03-08T02:32:20.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, me and a few boys have been looking for two players to join our team.\n\nWe have two gold players and a plat and need a good duo bot to fill out our team.
