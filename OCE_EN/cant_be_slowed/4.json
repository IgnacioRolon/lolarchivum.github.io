Did you know that an update was being scheduled (top left of the client there's a !), did you knowingly go into ranked queues last minute, and did you get a bugsplat? They do have [loss prevention measures](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014-Loss-Prevented) in place when major problems arise with bugs or anything that can disrupt gameplay for large sums of players. I wasn't aware of a major bug that did this, but I could be incorrect. If you could please get back when you're next available, I can help you further.","replies":[]}]}
