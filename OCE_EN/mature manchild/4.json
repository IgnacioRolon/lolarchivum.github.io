I did disconnect from a game earlier today. I am glad that I didn't get banned or something shitty like that. But this is just to have a disclaimer myself.\r\n\r\nFor the last 8 months, there have been a continuous string of problems with my house's internet. It would either be extremely slow (we should get about 2mbps, but we sometimes only get 0.3mbps) or it would disconnect at random intervals and then take its sweet damn time to reconnect.\r\n\r\nToday was one of those days. It refused to connect for a whole 90 minutes. I love playing LoL and I don't want to get banned. So this is for when I do get banned when I am AFK or disconnect. It's a disclaimer that I never disconnect or go AFK to put my team at a disadvantage. It's always because of my shitty connection to the exchange on Telstra lines that have been there since they were originally put up around 1969. Go Telstra.","replies":[]}
