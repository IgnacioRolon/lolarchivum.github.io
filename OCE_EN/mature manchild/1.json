If so could you please do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP. (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes)\n  * 103.240.227.5\n* Once adequate time has passed, stop the traceroute, export your results as text and reply back with them here (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this)\n* Run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results here.","replies":[]}]}
