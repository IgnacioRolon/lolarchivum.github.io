Over this time, i have left only a couple games, and AFKed in a handful of them. I am now the proud owner of a 20 minute low priority penalty. This means, i have to wait 20 minutes, before the queue to find a game even starts. The majority of these leaves have been due to internet problems on my end and little siblings that like to press big flashy power buttons. I find it unfair that i should be punished for something out of my control, such as the internet.\r\n\r\n(Ideas for improvement)\r\n\r\nInstead of penalising players who leave. Why not reward players who don't? For example: Players who don't AFK/leave in a set amount of games. Get rewards, such as IP boosts, and free RP. While players who do AFK/leave, get ACTUAL Low Priority. By this i mean, they are placed with other AFKers/leavers for 5 games. And can only be matched with other players who are also in low priority. Players who do not AFK/leave in these matches are allowed back into regular matchmaking. However those who don't, remain in Low Priority for another 5 games. Good players that continue not AFKing/leaving during games, begin to get even juicier rewards. Such as Summoner icons, displaying that these players do not AFK/leave. And possibly even skins. I feel these changes would help reduce leavers/AFKers. And give an incentive for them to stop AFKing/leaving. Other than frustrate them further. And provoke more AFKing/leaving.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-19T03:49:04.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">little siblings that like to press big flashy power buttons\n\nThat's something in your control. Man up and tell them not to, presenting them with consequences of it. That is, of course, if they decide not to comply.\n\n>By this i mean, they are placed with other AFKers/leavers for 5 games.\n\nPrisoners Island never has good results.\n\n>Good players that continue not AFKing/leaving during games, begin to get even juicier rewards.\n\nBribing is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"ilikecombat","date":"2015-01-19T07:01:57.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is reinforcing good behaviour wrong? Is not having to play with leavers a bad thing?\n\nAll i'm saying is that low priority encourages toxic gameplay. By frustrating players who may or may not have control over whether they leave games.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-20T05:03:43.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you're a leaver yourself, you can *only* play with leavers? How's that meant to encourage you to be better? You'd just get more frustrated, and possibly might do worse stuff (like, immediately make another account if they ever get into the island and start trolling in game).\n\nAnd hell, if you want such a system in place you'd be worse off, as instead of just having low priority queue, you'll be chucked onto the island and you don't even intentionally leave! That would be so unenjoyable.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
