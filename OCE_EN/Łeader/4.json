Is there a reason? Of course! To chill and have fun! If you&#039;re interested in joining this club, please add me in-game. Due to the new rework of Azir, many more people are looking into him and playing him more. We are interested in helping you out and listening to your opinions of Azir&#039;s new playstyle and builds. Feel free to ask us in the club chat if you need any help. You&#039;ll also be able to use the \r\nRoyal &quot;Azirs&quot; Club tag :P.\r\n\r\nIGN: Azirious Bird\r\nCheers, {{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-10-17T00:00:47.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This speaks to me on a personal level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-16T22:47:41.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure Lord Sesshomahru would be interested, if not already a member xD\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
