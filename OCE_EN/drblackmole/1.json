And after the positive feedback on the previous cinematics, I was thinking they should create a short 2 - 3 minute cinematic for each champion, showing off a small part of their (new and improved) lore. I know this would be a huge project, and may potentially take many years. However I think this would bring back the hype for league lore. I know I would want to see this, and I would love to know what others think. (Another positive for this idea would be a bunch of job openings at Riot for animators and artists to work on this project).","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-25T23:16:34.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A moba isnt exactly the best environment to tell a story unfortunately..\n\nI think they are stuck at the moment with reworking all the old champs lores so they fit with the new narrative, once that has been achieved we will likely see alot more in the way of content regarding lore.\n\nAnimated shorts would be awesome, but they can be quite time consuming, and especially if done for every single different champion in league. \n\nI think once the factions have been established, a brief short for each faction would go a long way, just something that shows the culture, climate, politics and players as a good way to get a quick idea on how each functions\n\nAlso the problem isnt the quality, its the quantity, if riot just did web based stories they would be able to get alot more out alot faster, unless they hired a bunch more people to handle the animations then we would likely be seeing less lore overall, so i think unless they dedicate real resources to animation and make it a project that can stand on its own, then it likely wont really happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-06T09:36:36.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or make an anime styled season of things which sums it all up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-26T06:06:42.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah we are definitely at the beginnings of building our world.

Would really like to see a follow up to the freljord event.\n\nOut of curiosity, the animation style has differed quite dramatically between the different videos, between bard, reksai, taliyah, jynx and ekko, do you guys make these videos in house or do you get an animation studio to do it? and if it were an animation studio, do you use the same one or was each video from a different one?\nAlso, is the use of different styles intentional or is it just what happened to be available at the time? seeing one video in 3D animation (kalista) then another in 2D (bard/taliya) isnt bad at all, but it is inconsistent\n\nAnd lastly, a personal question, if riot were to make an animated series would you want it in 3D or 2D animation :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2016-06-06T08:46:49.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like a book, that tells the \"whole story\" from begging to end, like if {{champion:268}}  kills {{champion:101}}  in the end, or if {{champion:75}} ever cures {{champion:58}}'s madness","replies":[]}]}
