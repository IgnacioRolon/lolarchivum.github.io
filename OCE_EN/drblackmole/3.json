Wears long flowing white robes, and hovers above the ground. (Meant to look like a male model cosplaying as a mage). Does not hold a weapon.  \r\nPlaystyle:\r\nMage/Support. He should be playing quite passively, using his high utility to avoid enemy all-ins. He would be a bit like Lulu, that he works in most roles. In teamfights he should dash around, helping out low health allies, while also giving them a damage boost. His heal can be used as a huge chunk of health for just himself and an ally, or a large AOE heal to top up his frontlines after being poked. His Q should be used early as a discouragement for the enemy to trade, as it will increase their mana costs dramatically, and late game should just be a good poking tool. His heal has a high mana cost, but can change gthe outcome of a fight, especially if he is building AP. His E also should be used to scare off tanks trying to engage, early game and late. Once he has some attack speed/CDR, the true damage could arrive in just 2 seconds, leaving another 2 where all sources are bypassing their defences. While this champion has no direct disengage tools, he can be quite punishing if the enemy misplays at all.\r\nStats:\r\nHealth\t553-1798\tMana\t430-1382\r\nHP Regen. (Per 5)\t3.5-10\tMana Regen. (Per 5)\t9.5-14.0\r\nAttack Damage\t47-112\tAttack Speed\t0.684-1.088\r\nArmor\t21.5-64\tMR.\t30.0\r\nMovement Speed\t340\tRange\t600\r\n\r\nPassive:\r\nAllied champions nearby to Bellon gain (25/50/75/100 [at lvls 1/6/11/16]) additional attack range, and their basic attacks deal an additional (5/7/9/11 + 5% AP) magic damage each hit.\r\nAura range: 350\r\nQ: \r\nBellon directs magical energy in a narrow line, dealing (70/110/150/190/230 + 45% AP) to the first enemy target in the line, increasing their mana costs by 100% if they are an enemy champion.\r\nRange: 850\r\nWidth: 55\r\nSpeed: 1350\r\nMana Cost: 50\r\nCooldown: 9/8/7/6/5 seconds\r\nW:\r\nBellon releases a set amount of friendly magic in an area, healing himself and all allied champions in range. The total heal is split between each champion, and the total heal cannot exceed (120/165/210/255/300 + 120% AP). A champion may not be healed for more than 60% of the total heal.\r\nRange: 450\r\nMana Cost: 120\r\nCooldown: 18/16.5/15/13.5/12 seconds\r\nE: \r\nBellon marks an enemy champion, reducing their magic resistance by 10/15/20/25/30% for 4 seconds. If Bellon damages them with 3 separate spells or basic attacks in the duration of the mark, the target is snared for 1.25 seconds and takes true damage from all sources for the remainder of the duration.\r\nRange: 675\r\nMana Cost: 70\r\nCooldown: 21/18/15/12/9 seconds\r\nR:\r\nBellon dashes to an allied unit, granting him an empowered basic attack within the next 4 seconds that deals an additional (60/125/190 + 50% AP) magic damage. If the target he dashed to was a champion, they also gain the empowered basic attack. Bellon may use this twice within 6 seconds before it goes on cooldown.\r\nRange: 700\r\nMana Cost: 100\r\nCooldown: 120/100/80 seconds\r\nLore:\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the concept is nearly complete. I will need to put some more thought in to get his lore nice, but my naming skills are rather lacking. If people who want to see Bellon come into the game have any ideas of what to name his spells, and also what a suitable title should be, feel free to share. Any feedback is appreciated, but if its negative, please make it constructive, telling me how I can improve the faults. I should have a basic splash art available sometime soon. Thanks for checking my idea out :D","replies":[{"poster":"Astanio","date":"2015-11-10T20:36:55.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty nice idea, but as a sup main, I would like to have a champ with cc or strong healing which can sustain in lane, there is some feedback\n\n1. i like the mana cost increase idea, its really funny, but it doesnt seems like work well with his other spell, i dont really the interaction between spells, and besides im not sure how long will the mana cost effect last.  IMO, if it can be affect in an area like empowered karma q, it would work better at team fight.\n\n2. seems like Bellon is a champ that buffing ally by standing there, its like the reverse Taric, if Taric is a castle that ally can get def buff from him, Bellon is the champ that can get att buff, I really like this idea.  However, IMO, there should be a debuff like Taric w active, otherwise the game play and this champ will be a little boring and un-balanced as all u need is to standing and keep not dying, occasionally heal ally.\n\n3. like I said before, I dont really see the interaction between spell, the ult is kind of like shen ult, but after shen ulting, he can taunt people with his e, but in Bellon, Im not sure what can he do after dashing to ally as he has no cc, if Bellon is just dashing to ally and heal, I think its kind of overlap what soraka do.\n\noverall, I like the concept of Bellon, but the interaction betweens spells is important, otherwise this is not really a good sup champ as it is a bit confusing in what he can do as a sup\n\nbut anyway, just personal idea, no hate. peace","replies":[{"poster":"DrBlackmole","date":"2015-11-11T06:06:00.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How he fits into the game-  So he's essentially meant to punish engaging. In a mdeta where a good support will focus on diving the enemy adc over and over again, there is no support, aside from soraka that really punishes a bad engage. This champion is meant to do that. If he isn't cced, he can make total use of his e, effectively making a tank diving on an adc useless. \n\nSell interaction/Kit- He isn't like azir, where all his spells interact, but his ult means that he can get to where he is needed. The heal makes up for its low range in a high heal if its just Bellon and another champion, so lets say an enemy dives on your adc. You ult to them, giving them a damage bosst, and your passive. You then heal to turn the tides of the engage, and put your e down on the closest tank. A garen type champion is essentially useless now, as he has no defences, and is snared unless he runs out. His q is kind of awkward, but can be game changing if used on a mage like veigar at the end of a fight. Lets say veigar has been spamming skills all fight, but sees an opportunity to flash ult your backline, he has 200 mana, giving him enough to get a q ult (or something), but flashes straight into Bellon's q, which increases his mana cost for his combo to 400. He now cannot do anything for the duration (which was meant to be 4 seconds sorry, ill add that in).\n\nI hope this answers some of your questions. Thanks for the feedback though :) Ill see how I can make his spell interactions more unique.","replies":[]}]}]}
