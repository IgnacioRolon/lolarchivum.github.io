Because in other server like TW server and China server they just put all the things in a folder called data&gt;sounds&gt;Wwise&gt;VO&gt;en_US&gt;and two folder Champion and Shared and all you have to do is just copy and paste the Language pack VO in there and that&#039;s it and the players are happy and also increase the game experience! So please Riot FIX this we really like the Japanese sound effect! Do it for us please FIX! Riot I really do like your server so please Fix this for our gamer.

Currently, no one but Riot knows when this will be, however I've also been highly anticipating the Japanese voices, so you can expect the software to be updated around the same day.\n\n**NOTE: as with any other method of tampering with the game files, this can potentially break your game/launcher.
