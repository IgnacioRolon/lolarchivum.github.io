It has removed vital mechanics such as being able to stun a champ then proceed to devour them. In previous patches they have attempted to kill the champ with grounding him when he devoured anything in the game. 9.14 has also turned Tahm into a troll champ with the addition of being able to devour allied blue/ red buff. I predict that in future patches Riot Games is planning to just delete the champ in general at this rate.

(My friend plays kench, and I play Sol.  I’d extend my stars then he’d eat me and run under tower.  The tower targets me because it’s my stars doing the damage, but it can’t fire because I’m inside kench.)\nThat’s an extreme example (that probably shouldn’t occur anyway) but you get the idea.  He’s basically a containment unit now,  he pauses the fight for you, but doesn’t save you from it.\n\nIf you ask me, just kill all his damage, and make him great at what he was meant to be: A support that excels in pulling people from the fire.\n\nThere are plenty of cool top laners with neat kits.  Why take away a cool support to add to the already large roster of top lane juggernauts?  It doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nI think the stun consuming stacks is fair enough.  It’s a LONG time of being useless when he can both stun AND eat you.  But I’m not a kench player, so I can’t comment too much on how this affects him.\n\nI am a fan of him being able to devour red and blue though.  It’s no more troll than Syndra’s ability, and I’ve often seen cool plays make by her stealing it and throwing it into her own team.\n\nAnything that encourages interesting and unique plays, that require some thought/planning,  should be encouraged imo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlueBilberry","date":"2019-07-21T04:49:52.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kench is still fine in the right hands - notice that he is sitting at nearly a 55% winrate as a support right now.","replies":[]}]}
