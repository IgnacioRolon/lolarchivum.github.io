This makes it a bit of an exception to the rule.\n\nI agree that there could be some clarity given to this, however you can also just ping the angle/area you've prepped it for while its charging. This helps a lot to communicate that you're looking to go in on that when the enemy crosses that path.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-15T23:27:28.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually agree with this, we have markers and warnings for every other champ and situation.\n\nJanna's tornado should have a friendly team indicator which direction its going and how far it will travel, would improve her synergy and play-ability with team quite well. \n\nAnd in a way, i think there should be maybe a .2-3second animation which gives a quick prewarning as to its direction for the enemy, not before it moves, but like some extra graphics just ahead so people have a bit more chance to avoid, in a hectic tense situation it'll rarely get noticed, but a quick flash of its direction as it launches would make it a more viable skill, rather than a charging tornado, sitting there, where does it go? 75% of the time the direction she was traveling in but hey... its not that great a skill considering its mana cost and CD compared to other supps...\n\nI've just started playing Janna leveling shields first and rushing ardent censer with a frost queens blade and spec resolve tank dmg reduction and 12 points in cunning to sustain mana. I can actually live whilst running behind lane lines and knocking back with ulti and a tornado knock up, rather than defensive play till one lands and something can be done, whilst hoping i have taken 2 hits which takens 1/3rd-1/2half hp away pre6","replies":[]},{"poster":"BrotherCaine","date":"2016-06-15T08:31:54.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno.
