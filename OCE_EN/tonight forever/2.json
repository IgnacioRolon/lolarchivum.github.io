I was once on euw for about a month and i&#039;ve gained more elo in that one month on euw than in 3 years on oce because its not a shithole. eune is looking better than this right now. you say the tribunal will be up soon, but you cant take the fact that player voted tribunal bans are more effective than your shit systems. you dont seem to understand that the more toxicity that plagues this server, infects us normal players and drives us to lose our mind. any normal person would lose their shit if they get a support who takes all the cs in ranked. after asking a few times nicely to stop, and without results, of course im angry. im going to get toxic, because initial toxicity has driven me towards that. right now your game is torture, and i&#039;ve been waiting three FUCKING years for you to do something about it. also, what the FUCK is your matchmaking? aparently im silver 2 and getting 2 unrankeds and a bronze 3 and 5 on my team vs silver is ok? do you even have people looking after the server?\r\n\r\nget your shit together","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-21T21:38:05.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey phantomz,\n\nThe Player Behavior & Reform systems that are in place on the other servers are also in place on Oceania. This means that punishments still rely on reports. If players don't consistently report negative/toxic players, these players may not be punished for some time. \n\nRegarding matchmaking, Matchmaking Rating is a bit different than visible rank.
