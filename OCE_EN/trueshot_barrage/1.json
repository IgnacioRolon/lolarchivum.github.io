Additionally after rearranging friends groups in the friends list, these changes did not appear in the invite list (reported as bug).\n* Having to be in a lobby to leave the play menu is not intuitive, as the &quot;x&quot; beside confirm is misleading, in that it takes you back to lobby, rather than leaving the play menu. Perhaps it would be possible to add a &quot;Home&quot; button, which has the same functionality as the one on the home client in lobbies.\n* The displayed queue time is not in an easily visible place, in relation to the old client. While it does look streamlined, and looks well co-ordinated with your queue status on the sidebar, it leaves a lot of empty space in the main body of the client, when in a solo party. Queue pop-up sound is easily noticeable.\n* Aram champ select looks great, and in champ select masteries modification seems good as well, however it lacks the ability to see the champ select chat while modifying masteries.\n* The trade champion button being the one which is currently being used in dynamic queue does is not easily visible, while the UI for the trade is much improved on the one in dynamic queue. I would suggest making more use of the space next to the player names to show tradeability (whether you can, or cannot).\n* Post (aram, so no feedback on mastery points) game, there is obviously no damage statistics etc. in the client yet, only a link to the online site. End game screen colour palette is hard to notice, i.e. there is not much distinction between features of the end game screen. Noticed that friends groups had been rearranged after coming out of game, may or may not have been a result of pushing &quot;Play again&quot; in end game screen. (bug reported)\n* Chat works well, the ability to cycle through message is nice, as in the messenger app, not clogging up the bottom of your client, however the functionality of the old client being able to click on the chat banner to minimise it would be appreciated to have once again. \n* On the same note for chat, I do not like the feature that if you open chat with someone who you have not sent a message to before, or the saved chat history is blank, and do not send anything, it leaves a blank message history, and does not auto delete the &quot;history&quot;, which has nothing in it.\n* Champion select in SR is crisp, only bad feedback is not being able to see chat when editing masteries.\n\nLooking forward to seeing this develop, thanks.","replies":[]}
