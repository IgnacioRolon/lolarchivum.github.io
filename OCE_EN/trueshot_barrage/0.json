If I remember correctly, the mode was disabled due to people preferring Normal Blind Pick, and that Draft Pick was significantly less.  \r\n\r\nNow that the server population has grown, I think it would be worth another trial at having the Draft Pick mode re-enabled. It&#039;s been nearly two years since the server was opened, and we are still yet to have another permanent play mode aside from ARAM and Summoner&#039;s Rift Normal Blind Pick, Ranked solo and Ranked teams.","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-06-19T03:36:12.678+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get rid of blind pick and replace it with draft..
