I worked hard last season climbing from B5 to S3, ended in S4.\n\nI just won 8-2 placement matches and got placed in B4. I was even checking all my game ratings and I averaged an A. No less than a B+. I had 3+ KDA average, most ward plaements in almost every game.\n\nI dont know what riot is using to calculate the new placements, but they have made it near impossible from what ive seen to improve on ranking from last season..\n\nI have poured hundred of hours and money into this game and tbh I dont even feel like playing anymore after this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparkking","date":"2016-01-21T16:28:13.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was gold 5 at the end of the season i did my placements 5/5 and i get into bronze 2 how can this be how can i drop 500 elo and i dont even lose more then wath i win this is a huge bug most be OMG..","replies":[]},{"poster":"LostMind","date":"2016-01-21T14:52:36.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where were you both before season ended? (Be honest) I'm seeing a lot of my friends complaining about being put into B5, but they were B4 before the season ended... Maybe it's not same for you, but it's what I've noticed.\n\nEdit - The season is not a hard reset, you don't start with a blank slate. Your MMR is averaged to around where you were in the previous season and are placed according to your placement matches, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe it's quite rare to be placed in a higher rank than where you finished the season. At least, I've never seen it happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChickenArmy","date":"2016-01-21T12:28:18.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain bro i had tried so hard and won 6  games and get put in bronze 5. idk if thats a bug/glitch or something else","replies":[]}]}
