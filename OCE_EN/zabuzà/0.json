I just feel that after only one slip up, a 14 day ban is unjustified as i have had no warning or anything, plus straight to the 4 day ban, stripped of my honour, free rewards, and the end of year rewards i have also been working hard for this past season.\nPlus with this one slip up from last night, the person i raged at was provoking me throughout the whole game, even though i was trying my hardest and this really got to me on an emotional level.\n\nTbh I'm completely shocked and don't know what else to say,\n\nSo does this mean there's no point in my ranking as i will not be recieving anything from it? And when i return I guess I'll have to utilise /mute all\n\nAnyway, thanks for the help, Hope i will be able to continue in the next 14 days without responding to people provoking me and expressing my anger in other ways, \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-21T04:43:19.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"all im reading is bullshit.\n\nyou got caught doing something wrong on your account.
