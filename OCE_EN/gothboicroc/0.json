It&#039;s a bit annoying having team mates who you can speak to only via pings because they don&#039;t speak the same language as you, and I am sure they feel the same way. \r\n\r\nI think it&#039;s a bit of an unfair advantage when 5 people are all speaking the same language and can suggest each other builds, ask questions and so on, and the other team can have a mix of 2/3+ languages","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-08T04:53:22.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point is there shouldn't be a problem. Riot shouldn't have to cater for something like this as it's not something that should be a problem.
