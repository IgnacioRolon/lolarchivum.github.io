Another reason is don&#039;t you get chat restricted first before a ban and I have never been chat restricted at all, so i&#039;m wondering if I got banned for racism/toxicity then isn&#039;t chat restrictions first before the ban punishment for these reasons? \r\n\r\n(Game 1&#039;s reason) I wasn&#039;t even toxic to anyone this game other than the Yi which I said he doesn&#039;t deserve silver and I made some pink ward jokes towards the Shaco but I didn&#039;t think he took them seriously and the rest of the toxicity/racism was me speaking to the enemy Tahm Kench and me and him were just messing around typing random things in the chat. The end result of this game was just the Shaco reporting me and the Ivern/Yi who were most likely duo the way they were backing each other up but if anyone else reported me I don&#039;t know. Another thing that might&#039;ve confused my team was maybe because my mic was broken so I was responding to what my friend was saying over discord with in-game chat.\r\n\r\n(Game 2 chat logs) https://gyazo.com/c269c4ce73a330ff4a44170fd09bb288 \r\n \r\n(Game 2&#039;s reason)  I&#039;ll admit I said some harsh things in my chat logs which I shouldn&#039;t of but EVERYONE was mad at this Sona because she left lane 5 minutes into the game because apparently Vayne wasn&#039;t listening to pings and Sona was like lvl 4 when everyone else was lvl 10 but then put her head somewhat back in the game when it was already to late and I didn&#039;t further flame her except for after the game like once more where I... might of told her to kill herself and i&#039;m sorry for that. One more reason I should be unbanned in game 2 is I don&#039;t know who reported me if it wasn&#039;t Sona because I was sportsmanlike the entire game other than the things I said to Sona and I was encouraging my team to not give up but if anyone else reported me I can probably explain if you just reply and tell me the reason / who it was.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I wouldn&#039;t care if I got unbanned with chat restrictions because that way I can&#039;t be toxic and I have to make my messages count if I play ranked instead of just unnecessary and unneeded words. I wouldn&#039;t even care if I couldn&#039;t speak in chat at all just please unban me as soon as you can and thanks for you time if you read all this. \r\n\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-11T21:36:00.852+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nBased on the pictures provided, I could see you called at least 2 people autistic, said the \"n\"-word at least twice, used one of the \"f\"-words, and called someone the \"w\"-word. And that isn't even showing us the parts of the chat logs that weren't screenshotted.\n\nI understand that sometimes your teammates (and opponents) can be complete buffoons that you either want to rage at, or who instigate the initial argument. For situations like this, we have \"mute\" buttons. If you still want to rage at them, you can reduce to urge to by shrinking the chat as small as possible, and moving it *off the screen*. And if that doesn't work? ...Well, I always keep something punchable near my PC at all times xD\n\nIf you look at the chat logs and your counter-arguments, it looks like Riot were spot on with issuing the 14-day ban. At least it isn't a perma-ban :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-11T06:03:55.705+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Straight away I can tell why this happened. Your repeated use of terms like \"n\\*gger\", \"f\\*g\", \"w\\*nker\", and probably also the way you've used \"autism\", would have escalated the case, causing you to receive a higher tier punishment than if your \"behaviour\" were a bit more \"benign\". As a general rule of thumb, terms with seriously negative connotations (like those I've mentioned) are taken pretty seriously, and are likely to cause a player to skip punishment tiers if used repeatedly.\n\nIf you want to appeal the ban, you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), though I can pretty much guarantee they'll tell you that it's a rightful ban, and that they wont revert/reduce it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-08-11T08:15:43.570+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I give you a zero percent chance of getting off the ban. Totally Justified.Just stop calling people names and asking if they have Austism which is never okay in any situation. If you think that is okay you may need to have a hard look at yourself over the next 14 days. Good to see the ban system working though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FoulFumes","date":"2017-08-11T18:35:31.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically u summed it up yourself, in the last sentence\n *Overall I wouldn't care if I got unbanned with chat restrictions because that way I can't be toxic and I have to make my messages count if I play ranked instead of just unnecessary and unneeded words.*\nbasically saying you have learnt your lesson, and the ban has made you upset\n (going to the point to post an appeal here)\n i think the system is working and its done exactly what it is meant to","replies":[]}]}
