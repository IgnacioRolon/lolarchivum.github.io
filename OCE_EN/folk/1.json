Permanent means permanent.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Firstly I&#039;d like to ask, who actually reads the terms of service? I just press agree and move on because I&#039;m not reading 50 pages. \r\n\r\nThe quote &quot;Permanent means permanent&quot; has been something Riot has thrown at me multiple times. If you&#039;re still confused as to why, then read on.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started to play the game, I loved it. Later I convinced one of my friends to come along and join me on my journey in the ladder. Clearly I didn&#039;t climb very far, but that&#039;s besides the point. After a few months my friend got hit with his first punishment, a mute. After a few more months the rise of toxicity in his behavior was more and more clear to me as the punishments kept rolling in. It started with a mute, another mute, a 14 day ban, then finally he got permanently banned. A while after he was permanently banned, he made a new account but I could tell the game wasn&#039;t the same for him. All the skins, champs, and time lost. He then took off to CS:GO and in that time period I got hit with my first punishment. It was a 14 day ban, and this confused me because my friend got hit with all the punishments in order, yet I skipped straight to the ban. I contacted support, and they told me if I didn&#039;t get punished for a long enough period of time then I could go down in punishment tiers. This made me happy and stop worrying because I wasn&#039;t that toxic at all and knew I could go down in punishment tiers and reform.\r\n\r\nAs someone who has spent probably over a $1000+ on the game in skins as well as obtaining all the champions, my friends begged to have a go on my account. Sharing my account was always something I was against, especially if the person I knew was toxic. However, my family had planned a trip overseas and one of the friends who asked to go on my account was someone I knew in real life as well. I then went overseas while my friend had played the entirety of December and a portion of January on it during the holiday. I then came back and saw my account wasn&#039;t banned. This led me to trust the person even more with my account (mistake). I cannot precisely remember when my account got banned but I believe it was near the end of January this year due to toxicity. As someone who is greatly addicted to league, even a week feels like a month. Even my friend came back from CS:GO because this game is a drug that you cannot quit easily. I tried getting into other games but me and my friend kept coming back on our newly created accounts. I then decided to make a ticket because the lack of champions drove me crazy. The reply was something along the lines of &quot;Permanent means permanent&quot;. Soon after using the excuse that a friend was on my account, I found out that it was against the terms of service. As someone who never reads the terms of service I was very sad and begged them for a compromise. \r\n\r\nThe compromise was that I get permanently muted and get unbanned. However, this is not an option to Riot and that was when they hit me with their favorite quote &quot;Permanent means permanent&quot;. This was when the BE system first came about. This meant I got 1 champion a month. Why would you combine blue essence with IP and then remove the re-roll for a champion option? I have to level up like 20 times before I can buy a champion I actually want. Having fun on a new account was near impossible because of this so I tried to dig into anything I could in order to get unbanned. I then remembered how fair the old IFS system was. The old IFS system wouldn&#039;t really do anything unless at least a few people reported. The old IFS system was fair because if one person reported you wouldn&#039;t get punished just because of one report. You couldn&#039;t be told &quot;You ruined the game for others.&quot; It would just be one guy having a bad day when in reality everyone was okay except for him. Today&#039;s IFS is extremely flawed. You can see people getting reported by 1 guy and get punished because they said &quot;fuck&quot; (Not directed at anyone). The F word wouldn&#039;t even be directed at anyone but rather when they make a mistake. For example: &quot;Fuck me, I&#039;m bad&quot;. Some people just like to report you based on your performance in a game if they get salty. \r\n\r\nNothing worked, I tried, and tried, and tried to get unbanned... Nothing! I then resorted to hopping in the bandwagon of complaining about players such as Jensen who were **PERMANENTLY** banned in the past. I understand that he didn&#039;t get his accounts back and it was a ID ban due to it being &quot;more serious&quot;. Even though I like Tyler1 and am happy he got unbanned, I am kind of mad that suddenly the word **PERMANENT** doesn&#039;t mean permanent anymore. The whole idea of an ID ban being more serious annoys me because, it just isn&#039;t in some peoples cases. I&#039;d rather lose my privilege to create another account and get my $1000 back. I do understand Riot wants **EQUALITY** regardless of how much money you spent on their game, but come on now... I thought permanent meant permanent? \r\n\r\nOverall I&#039;d like you guys to stop telling me permanent means permanent whenever I make a ticket please. I understand, I get it. My fault for not reading the terms of service, it&#039;s just common sense anyway that I&#039;m responsible for anything that happens on my account. It&#039;s been nearly a year since I got banned and just hope you guys can consider some sort of compromise for players such as myself to return to the rift on their accounts. Players like Jensen and Tyler1 live off League of Legends, so making a new account and spending a bit of money to gain things isn&#039;t hard for them. \r\n\r\nI guess what my main message of this forum post was, is that **ID BANS ARE NOT MORE SERIOUS** and **PERMANENT MEANS PERMANENT**\r\n\r\n\r\n**MY FRIEND PLAYS FORTNITE BECAUSE OF YOU GUYS, IT&#039;S SO SAD.**","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-09-10T09:06:22.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When a relationship has run its course.

That one specific game I guess I got a little out of hand. However, I did claim to be undeserving of the 14 day ban in a ticket like a year+ ago, but I didn't say that here. I guess when I said **\"I wasn't toxic at all and knew I could go down in punishment tiers and reform\"**, I was meant to say: \"I wasn't that toxic in **general** and knew I could go down in punishment tiers.\"  I was definitely deserving of that 14 day ban based on the chat logs. But I would like to point out one thing. I do remember that game somewhat, and if you were there everybody in the chat was joking around with racist jokes and insulting each other in a joking way. It's really not as toxic as it seems when you place yourself in the game. One thing I cannot deny about that game is, I got reported. In that case I guess it gives Riot a reason to say \"I ruined their game\". This brings me back to my point on how I miss the old report system. The IFS only requires one requires one report. Now I guess Riot will say I ruined the game for \"others\" when I bet it was just an \"other\". The old system required many reports.

Account sharing is something that is against the ToS, but not typically punished, but the account (and therefore account owner) still takes responsibility for any actions on that account.\n\n>The compromise was that I get permanently muted and get unbanned.\n\nBut what reason is there for taking this compromise? The account was justly punished for actions negatively affecting the experience of others, you have not disputed this fact. The account was not compromised, but willingly shared, so the actions taken on that account are still your responsibility. You also would have been aware that any slipups could well result in a permanent suspension, because it is explicitly stated in the 14 day ban reform card.\n\nYou said yourself: \"it's just common sense anyway that I'm responsible for anything that happens on my account\".\n\n>This meant I got 1 champion a month\n\nYou earn BE faster than you did IP in the old system. The level gains *alone* are higher until about lvl 150, and you also have the added bonus of the resources from hextech chests adding to that one resource pool instead of a separate one, as well as getting more shards (more likely to get one you want) and again that one resource pool to draw from to activate them instead of separate ones. The execution is different, but the gains themselves are significantly higher than in the old system.\n\n> You can see people getting reported by 1 guy and get punished because they said \"fuck\"\n\nI'd very much love to see evidence of that, because in all my experience with the system, that would be beyond an outlier, and certainly considered a false positive (and thus revoked). Generally speaking the only thing that will get you punished after one report is incessant toxicity or 0 tolerance behaviours like hate speech and suicide encouragement, though it is true that only one **valid** report is necessary to trigger a punishment. Profanity alone is *not* punished.\n\n>Some people just like to report you based on your performance in a game if they get salty.\n\nGood for them. If you haven't done or said anything that would result in a punishment upon review of the game, reports against you mean absolutely nothing. In the unlikely event of a false positive - because they do happen, if only very rarely - a ticket to support is enough to see a manual review and the punishment revoked once that false positive is confirmed.\n\n>I'd rather lose my privilege to create another account and get my $1000 back.\n\nI think you have thoroughly misunderstood the premise of Tyler1's ban. He didn't get his $1000 dollars back. All the accounts that he had permanently banned are still banned *permanently*. Those accounts are never coming back. The only thing that changed was his ban on sight status. He is allowed to create new accounts, he has not and will not ever get his old accounts back.\n\n>ID BANS ARE NOT MORE SERIOUS and PERMANENT MEANS PERMANENT\n\nHow? An ID ban means not only is your account permanently banned, but any new ones you make will be as well regardless of the behaviour you present on that new account, while an account ban means that only that one account is gone, and new ones you make will only be banned in the event you break the terms again.\n___\n\nIf you're making the effort to reform your behaviour, great. If you've realised that trusting *anyone* with your account security is a bad idea, great. Unfortunately the fact remains that you are responsible for the actions that were taken on your account, regardless if they were made by you, or someone you willingly shared the account with, and an account that has been justly banned will not have that punishment revoked.","replies":[{"poster":"Folk","date":"2018-09-11T05:32:00.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Firstly, I've been holding off on this forum post for a while. I've been holding off because I tried to find someone with a similar discussion instead of just repeating what everyone else says. Whilst trying to find a game to play for the past few months, I did indeed come across some forum posts that had chat logs included. Some of these chat logs were nothing to get a ban about and it just made me sad. One of them did indeed have a chat log very similar to the \"fuck me, I'm bad\" example. Also, I'm not gonna go ahead and waste my time to find a forum post I viewed a couple-ish+ months ago unless there is actually a gain. The only gain I'd get is proving you wrong, I'm not doing that. It's immature.\n\nSecondly, I never said Tyler1 got his accounts back or a $1000, I was relating to myself. That was because I was making my point on how ID Bans aren't worse than account bans. I did include the part where I said \"in some peoples cases.\" I'm genuinely confused how you can read my post and say \"I think you have thoroughly misunderstood the premise of Tyler1's ban. I clearly showed an understanding of his ban. **I understand that he didn't get his accounts back and it was a ID ban due to it being \"more serious\"**\n\nThirdly, why do all Rioters avoid the compromise of a permanent chat restriction or mute in exchange for an unban? Yes, I negatively affected players. Yes, I deserved my ban. **BUT**. Ask yourself this: \"Why did he get banned?\". **TOXICITY!**. This involves using the chat. If I'm unable to use the chat then isn't that problem solved? If that's a no because of communication reasons then why isn't a permanent chat restriction an option? This limits your messaging to the point where you have to use every message wisely and still communicate fine. During the time my friend was chat restricted he wasn't toxic at all and he is **VERY** toxic and **VERY** deserving of his ban. So am I.\n\nI'm sorry for bringing Tyler1 into the equation. It clearly created misunderstanding.\n\nLastly, to give you a better understanding of why I hate the new system, here you go:  https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/8khdq1/is_blue_essence_ment_to_be_this_slow/\nand\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTC4LMSW6jc\n\nThe video is just to support a little bit of what I'm saying on there being an average of 990 BE per level up. This is nothing, let's be honest. It's laughable. You have to play so many games to level up and once you do it's still not enough for what you might want to buy. Maybe you're a little bit short on BE? Well you can't get paid after every game anymore.

If you truly saw such a post, and that was the only reason they were banned, the gain would be a false ban on an innocent player being revoked.\n\n>I understand that he didn't get his accounts back and it was a ID ban due to it being \"more serious\"\n\nI know you were equating it to yourself, you were saying you'd be happy to trade the ability to create a new account for your old one back, but there is no precedent nor reason for such an action to be taken in your case. You went on to talk about Tyler1's punishment, the implication being that was what you thought happened to him.\n\n>ID Bans aren't worse than account bans\n\nJumping back a bit, I still don't understand how you feel this is the case. A permanent ban is just an account ban. An ID ban is an account ban AND a ban of any alternate and subsequent accounts. How is that a lesser punishment?\n\n>Thirdly, why do all Rioters avoid the compromise of a permanent chat restriction or mute in exchange for an unban?\n\nBecause they don't work. Permanent chat bans do nothing to change the behaviour, and those that are lashing out will simply continue to do so in other ways. The negative behaviour persists, so ultimately it's an ineffective punishment. It might work for some players, but most repeat offenders will simply find a different way to offend.\n\n>The video is just to support a little bit of what I'm saying\n\nPerhaps you simply don't like the execution of the new system, but you still gain currency faster than in the old system (pre lvl 150) *just from levelling up*.

I don't know how many times I have to throw my point of view at you before you can understand my perspective. I'll try one last time. Let me put it like this:\n\nAccount ban:\n* I spend thousands of hours on the game\n* I spend a lot of money on the game\n* I lose a lot of friends\n* Limited availability skins lost as well\n* Every Champion in the game\n* High Mastery on all my champs = flexing\n* I quit the game because level 1-30 is so tedious and so un-rewarding. 450 BE per level it's a joke. The higher level more rewarding in BE. \"fun\". Maybe for new players, but nah. Not me.\n* 0 champs when you make a new account/takes forever to get champs BE = \"good system\"\n* Leveling up only way to get BE and you already know I ain't leveling up very fast unless I dedicate myself to this account as I did the previous. That's just hard to do when you've lost what you've lost.\n\nID Ban:\n* I don't care because I'm not making a new account, it's just so boring once you've lost everything.\n* Rather get my time and money back (my account) than decide to play again. I'm sure many feel the same. Thus it is an equally bad punishment if not worse. Especially since many in the same shoes as me have lost all their money and time spent on this game.\n* I'm sure lots of people would trade the ability to make a new account for let's say... a $1000? Any day.\n\n\nAnyways, about that compromise. Why not a year wait + permanent chat restriction? I mean, I'm sure there's room for debate whether or not an ID ban or account ban is more serious. If that's the case then... permanent doesn't mean permanent for account bans as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-11T08:05:30.345+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the example seems suspicious sure, but it's on EUW and therefore beyond our means to get more information on. I would imagine that case was sent through player support, but given there's no Rioter input it's impossible for us to know if the OP was giving the full story or if there was more to it. It's the kind of thing I'd push to get double checked, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was a false positive.\n\nIf I'm understanding right, your point about trading the ability to make a new account, and your comments regarding Tyler1 were separate? It didn't sound that way to me, but that's irrelevant. To take them on their own:\n\nThe reason Riot flipped the decision on Tyler1's ID ban is because it ultimately conflicts with their policies on reform. The idea is that while punishments have to exist, players should always have the chance to reform and return to the game as neutral or positive players, which ID bans prevent. Permanent account bans are still permanent.\n\nRegarding your trade idea, it doesn't work. Methods involving periods of good behaviour to have old accounts returned were attempted, and they just didn't work. The negative behaviour was only mitigated for a short amount of time, and account suspensions lost the weight that they had. It didn't encourage reform, and it didn't improve displayed behaviour beyond the short term. This is the purpose of having warning punishments, Everyone gets at least one (outside of special circumstances like cheating, which is obviously and indisputably wrong), and everyone is warned that continued behaviour will result in permanent loss of their account.\n\nRegarding ID bans, I don't think we're on the same page here at all. Your options are 1. Punishment A (permanent account suspension), or 2. Punishment A + B (permanent account suspension + inability to create new accounts). How is option 2 a lesser punishment when it's option 1 + an extra punishment?\n\nCompromises or alterations don't exist because they don't work. If you have the means to remove a permanent suspension on your account, it makes the punishment relatively meaningless, which entirely defeats the purpose of a punishment. A permanent ban isn't something you just get, which is why it has so much weight.","replies":[{"poster":"Folk","date":"2018-09-11T10:03:52.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can you say that the methods didn't work? Riot always brags about their low percentage of banned players. Is Riot just full of lies or something? Firstly the statement \"Permanently banned from league of legends\" doesn't mean that anymore? Now, apparently Riot has a shit load of banned players? I don't buy it. I remember seeing someone in a different forum post on this very topic, I'll try to find it, but I'm not sure if I will be able to. Basically what he said was that apparently Riot claims that only 0.006% of their population is banned (I think it was 0.006% but not sure). His results were around 6000-ish banned players according to the percentage which Riot claimed was there amount of banned players. Even if I'm not exactly spitting facts, if these stats are even close to correct then that means Riot is overreacting. If these stats were correct, and aren't anymore because of the new IFS, then that means Riot didn't do a proper investigation back then on the so called \"compromise\". If you're confused as to what compromise I refer to then, I'm talking about this one: \"demonstrate good behaviour and we'll give your account back\" type policy\"\n\nRegarding the ID bans. I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you take away my account, you take away my game. It's just such a painful experience of upgrading a new account in order to have fun again. It's so painful in fact, I'd rather quit. It's too damn slow of a process to gain champions, thus I cannot play the game to it's full potential. In the end an account ban is equivalent to a ID Ban because of the fact that I'm not creating a new account anyway. The only difference which makes an account ban more serious for me is that I lost all that money, every champion and all that time. Regardless whether or not an ID ban is more serious or not. The word permanent remains in there. I think remove the word or follow by it. Yes, they don't get their accounts back. Yes, they make a new account. **BUT** \"Permanent means permanent\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-11T11:47:27.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">How can you say that the methods didn't work?\n\nBecause they were attempted, and the philosophy, while sounding good on paper, just didn't work out in practice. Those players that had their accounts returned for good behaviour, almost always were very soon banned again. It has nothing to do with number of players. The majority of punished players never offend again, but there are who those who continue their negative behaviour anyway. It's not a high number, but those players exist. \n\nPermanent account suspension is the highest punishment there is, simply because beyond ID banning (which is extremely uncommon and not something that will likely continue except in exceptional circumstances) there isn't anything worse Riot can do. Any compromises that were tried, any means of returning a permanently banned account, failed because it undermined the weight of that punishment, and didn't result in any greater degree of reform. It was a lose lose.\n\n>Riot has a shit load of banned players? I don't buy it.\n\nWhere did you get this impression? I said nothing of the sort. To the best of my knowledge that 0.006% is still accurate, though the specifics of the stat aren't known. It's also worth noting that players and accounts aren't one and the same. Players don't get banned, accounts do. If a player gets 10 accounts banned, they aren't changing their impact on that stat beyond the first account.\n\n> if these stats are even close to correct then that means Riot is overreacting\n\nOverreacting to what? Players that get permabanned are generally those with either a severe and/or consistent negative impact on the community. Why should they be allowed free reign to ruin the experience for hundreds of other players? Their numbers may be small, but the impact they have isn't.\n\n>The only difference which makes an account ban more serious for me is that I lost all that money, every champion and all that time.\n\nIf this is what you are judging it by, then there *is no* difference for you. An ID ban would only ever result becasue of a permanent suspension of your account. It is not one or the other, it's *both*. If you got ID banned, you would still have lost your main account, just with the *addition* of being unable to make a new one, whether you want to or not. By definition an ID ban is worse than an account perma, it's not a subjective matter.\n\n>The word permanent remains in there. I think remove the word or follow by it.\n\nIt *is* followed. As far as accounts are concerned, permanent means permanent. ID bans were not an established policy, and they have since been adjusted. They were a special case, and as outlier as it gets. Basing your definition of a permanent ban on something used under such special circumstances is not a good idea. The *only* time a permanent account ban is not permanent, is if the ban was made in error, or the ban was for a chargeback that has since been resolved.\n\nBehaviour based permanent suspensions that were not made in error will *never* be revoked.","replies":[{"poster":"Folk","date":"2018-09-11T19:42:50.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be honest, I don't know where I got the idea an ID ban isn't more serious than an account ban. I guess about the closest an account ban gets to that is if you decide to never create another account because of the account ban. But you can also buy accounts if you're ID banned can't you? Or, how was Tyler1 still able to play on LoL? \n\nI got the impression there were many banned players because I assumed they would run a more thorough investigation. You're telling me majority of the players returned to good behavior? If this is true, then isn't it a successful reform method? The numbers sound so damn small at this point I find it hard to believe that this led you guys to the conclusion of it being unsuccessful. There are always going to be outliers. \n\nAlso, you say the impact they made is so bad? Let me summarize what happens in everyone's head as they report: Gets mad, reports, and goes into the next game fine. By the way, this generalization isn't a generalization, it's me running my **THOROUGH** investigation. I was the guinea pig and this is me whenever I decide to report someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-12T04:28:34.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Riot can't stop a player from creating throwaway emails and using false info to create a new account. They can only ban it once it's become apparent that the account belongs to the banned player.\n\nI didn't say the \"good behaviour and you'll get your account back\" resulted in a return to good behaviour, the opposite is true. The *current* system results in most punished players not receiving a second punishment. For most players, that first punishment is enough of a \"hey, this isn't ok\" to get them back on track. That statement had nothing to do with any speculated or attempted compromises, that is the current state of things.\n\nThe only person who benefits from such a compromise method, are those players that are permanently suspended. That's fine if there is a genuine attempt at reform, but think about the kind of players that are permanently banned. \n\nIf most players return to good, or at least neutral, behaviour after just one punishment, then those that continue through to permanent suspensions are those that don't care about the effect their behaviour has on others. When the compromise was attempted, there was an almost universal return to bad behaviour from those players, which is why it was scrapped. \n\nIf a system is designed to solve a problem with 100 people, and only results in success with 1 (that is a fabricated stat for example purposes) clearly your solution has fallen flat. The numbers may be small, but it was only designed to help a small number of players.\n\nFrom the perspective of the average player, you encounter a toxic one, who ruins that game for you and you move on, that's true. But from the perspective of the wider community, that toxic player is ruining 4-9 peoples games, every game they play. If they play ten games, that's 40-90 ruined experiences, from the actions of one player. \n\nIf those players are not punished, or allowed to return to the game, their numbers increase over time, by virtue of the fact that their numbers aren't decreasing and new people are always joining the game. If there are 100 toxic people who play 10 games, that's 4000-9000 ruined experiences, and that's just over 10 games. You see how the problem just scales higher and higher? So yes, the impact of a small number of negative players is substantial.\n\n> Gets mad, reports, and goes into the next game fine. By the way, this generalization isn't a generalization\n\nIt's not generalisation, but it is *subjective*. That is your reaction, not everyone else's. For the most part yes, players can just shrug off the negativity, but when it's really bad, or maybe you were already stressed, it can ruin the game for you for much longer than the time it takes you to get into a new game. Negativity has a huge impact on the average players, relative to the amount of people that actually cause it. \n\nNot to mention, the behaviour shouldn't be allowed just because most players have the capacity to be the bigger person. If someone steals from you and you don't press charges because they stole something you didn't care all that much about and it's just too much hassle, doesn't by any stretch make the act of stealing ok.\n\nEven if you ignore the moral and psychological arguments for removing such behaviour from a community, it's not good business practice to keep them around. The more negativity you have, the less people are inclined to stick around, and certainly the less people are inclined to support you with their wallets.","replies":[{"poster":"Folk","date":"2018-09-12T08:05:47.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's true that one player can ruin many games, but it's also true that your stats are exaggerated. You're telling me 4 people are guaranteed a bad experience every single game a \"toxic\" player enters the scene? You're also telling me every game, that this someone, is guaranteed to be toxic? It only requires one report, and most of the time it's only one triggered player. Let's be realistic here, people care more about your performance than your words in the chat. This is subjective, but take it from a \"toxic\" person. Every single time I've said anything remotely \"toxic\" people didn't care, unless if I was under-performing as well. If I was carrying the team they would ultimately forget you were ever \"toxic\", and move on.\n\n Many forum posts claim they only had one or a couple toxic games out of the thousands they played. Meanwhile this is certainly false, I'm sure they only had a few toxic games out the thousands they played. From personal experience I believe them because I'm definitely not toxic every game, but I'm also definitely toxic sometimes. This game is too strict on the chat and is evolving into club penguin. It's such a simple solution, but such a urge to skip punishments into the ban. It's almost as if chat restrictions or mutes don't exist. You can still talk with a chat restriction, it's just limited.\n\nEven if these people found a new way to ruin the game outside of the chat, it wouldn't matter because toxicity would be fixed. I'm not just directing this solution towards players who want another chance on the rift, I'm directing it at everyone. I think skipping straight to a ban is stupid. However skipping straight to a permanent chat restriction isn't. If this is such a troublesome solution because of people finding creative ways to troll, then why not skip straight to a permanent ban if they do this? Why not become super strict on actual ruined experiences rather than some snowflake outlier's experience when someone told him he's bad once? \n\nYeah sorry, I took the words out of your mouth when I said the part about \"good behavior and you'll get your account back\". I misread and somehow thought you said majority of the players reformed after having their accounts returned and a few just went back to their old ways. Regardless I'd be very keen to seeing the ACTUAL results on that experiment. I keep getting the feeling that majority did indeed reform.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-09-10T09:32:35.977+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, its also in the ToS last time i checked, that after showing reform riot would consider your account for unbanning (ie, T1, carnation etc.) howver they only needed 2 years, because they gave riot free advertising, by playing constantly, im pretty sure after 5 years of no bans, and proved reform the account can be regained via ticket\n\nor at least that was my intention as of my perma last year, now idrc, this game is dead af, i play for first win, or when friends are online\n\nTencent fucked this game royally, with their pay-to-win attitude towards skins, champs and the essence system","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-10T09:45:12.029+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There used to be a \"demonstrate good behaviour and we'll give your account back\" type policy, but it was removed quite some time ago because it simply didn't work.
