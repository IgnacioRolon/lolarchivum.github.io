This is my first time participating in a contest like this, and also my first time giving League of Legends fanfiction a try. It takes place after the battle shown within the Elementalist Lux cinematic, and draws inspiration from a lot of Lux&#039;s old lore, but I hope you&#039;ll enjoy it. Each element represents a different stage of grief. {{champion:99}} \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Brother?&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Yes, Luxanna?&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n_For once in her life, the prodigy remained silent, crystals as bright as the Demacian sky above as they stared curiously up at the soft gaze of her brother. She understood little of what was going on; all she had been told by her parents was that he was to leave for a short while for the sake of their homeland. That much she could understand. And yet, naivety took hold; a characteristic unknown to her before that day. She grasped for the material of his shirt, wrapping her arms around him tightly for as far as they could reach, a frown now presenting itself._\r\n\r\n_In that moment, the younger Crownguard was vulnerable. That in itself was unacceptable._\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t leave.&rdquo; She spoke in a whisper, biting down on her quivering lip._\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe image would be ingrained in her mind for the remainder of her life.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Garen&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt was the name of the brother she had lost once before, for a long, long while, and now, the one for an eternity. Shadows streamed down either cheek before landing on the chestplate with the Demacian crest. The illuminated violet staff fell to the ground with a quiet thud as it rolled to the side. Lux followed closely behind, although she managed to catch herself. She refused to believe the sight. At last, the battle was over. Justice had been served, but at what cost?\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Death is inevitable; one can only avoid defeat.&rdquo;_ A phrase repeated throughout her military training had been on the edge of her mind since the battle. Yet, so was the image of the Might of Demacia being thrown amongst the rubble with a final, piercing cry.\r\n\r\nStreaks of blood stained the soldier&rsquo;s armor, some of it being her own.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Please&hellip;&rdquo; was all that served as a pathetic attempt of speaking through ugly sobs. A single hand reached out towards him, only reaching as far as his chest. Perhaps he was still alive! There was a reason that the girl was known for staying positive in a time of crisis, even now. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; she scowled, the gloved hand quickly retreating.\r\n\r\nBlood boiled at that point, eyes slammed shut and an overwhelming power took hold. To any spectators from afar, nothing could be seen as a blinding light took hold. She threw her head forward as the feeling passed, and stretched for her baton. Using the magical instrument for support, she managed to climb back to her feet, narrowing her eyes through the fiery locks as she stared at her brother.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have all day, dammit!&rdquo; And still, there was no response.\r\n\r\nPlumes of fire escaped from the instrument as it slammed against the ground, the burning gaze in her eyes flickering with the setting sun. The scent of scorched wood hadn&rsquo;t been as prominent until now, and her gaze swept across the fallen on the battlefield. With a final breath, darkness escaped from the mage&rsquo;s system, leaving not a single trace behind. She stumbled backwards, vision now somewhat disoriented.\r\nShe could have protected all of them. If only she had tried harder. Her training hadn&rsquo;t been enough to prevent the deaths of so many of her allies. It was all of their blood on her hands, not just Garen&rsquo;s. \r\n\r\nWithout a final look to the older Crownguard, Lux stormed off into the ruins of battle, leaving a trail of smoke in her wake as the staff was twirled between her fingertips. A quick walk quickly turned into a jog, and then into a sprint; it was as though she had another purpose, and soon enough, the smoke begun erupting into small sparks. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This is dream, right?&rdquo; She asked to no one in particular, a smirk creeping up on her lips. Each word was articulated with precision, and she even went as far as laughing in the face of death itself. There was no way any of this could be real; Demacia would never fall. How foolish it was for her to even contemplate it being otherwise.\r\n\r\nThunder boomed over the evening sky as the laughter continued. All she needed to do now was wake up. Deafening rays shot down in the surrounding area, but the Elementalist didn&rsquo;t care in the slightest, at least, until one bolt in particular flew astray from the now apparent clouds. Storm grey eyes widened at the realisation and the girl froze in her tracks.\r\n\r\nIt wasn&rsquo;t her time to die. Just as the lightning struck, what appeared to be empty air shattered into shards of glass, no, _ice_. The staff chilled her palm as hail began to rain down, cracks beginning to form in the barrier. Quickly, she moved towards cover, and she sought refuge within the walls of a fallen building.\r\n\r\nCold and calculating, her icy gaze scanned every inch of the scene, sweeping over most of it before locking onto the Demacian crest: a symbol that had become incredibly dear to her over the years. On any occasion, the sight would have filled her with a sense of patriotism of her great homeland, and still, she felt empty. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Her guiding light makes enemies wary, but they should worry most when the light fades.&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere was no light to be seen within the girl dubbed once as the Lady of Luminosity, but at the same time, there were no enemies to be wary of her. Puffs of vapour escaped her lips as her breathing grew heavier and heavier still. The only warmth to be found in the brittle air was that upon her cheeks. Tears rolled down slowly at first, but quickly grew in speed before falling, turning to ice in the moment before they hit the ground. She brought her legs in towards her chest, attempting to visualise life before the military &ndash; back when Garen was still with her. No matter how hard she tried, no matter how hard she cried, she couldn&rsquo;t remember anything aside from him leaving home.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_ &ldquo;Why are you doing this?&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGaren was still out there. What had she been thinking? Free hand leaning against the wall, she shakily managed to stand back up, eyes still welling up with tears. With another deep breath, she threw the staff out towards the hail before running back into the open. She desperately looked around, attempting to recall where her brother was. What an idiot she had been for not realising it all sooner. Warmth began spreading to her legs as her feet hit the ground, movements lacking any form of grace.\r\n\r\nThe ice beneath her feet suddenly slipped away and in a panicked struggle, left Luxanna reaching for support. A loud cry echoed throughout the vicinity as she made an attempt to pull herself back up. \r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_&ldquo;Our country needs me, my dear sister. Fear not, for one day you will understand. I wish for nothing more than for you to believe in me, for whatever happens, I will always believe in you.&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Control yourself.&rdquo; She muttered to herself, taking in a deep breath.\r\n\r\nIn that instant, everything went still. Her mouth was left agape as she finally saw the battlefield for what it was: ruins of war which reeked of death. Demacia needed its light now, more than ever. \r\n\r\nAt last, she caught a glimpse of the fallen soldier, now suffering slight bruising thanks to his sister. A quiet laugh managed to overcome the sobs as she knelt beside him at long last, trails of light streaming down from either cheek.","replies":[{"poster":"ThunderWielder","date":"2017-03-15T12:03:23.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">“This is dream, right?” She asked to no one in particular, a smirk creeping up on her lips. \n\nIf she was being delusional, as I understand from your writings, it won't be a smirk but a maddening smile or something along those lines.
