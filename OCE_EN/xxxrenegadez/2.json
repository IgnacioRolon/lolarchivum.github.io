When can we expect to see ranked 3's to be open full time for play?\r\n\r\nAn answer  from a riot employee would be much appreciated as i have been looking forward to having ranked 3's for the entirety of lol oce lifespan. \r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2014-11-25T23:26:13.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey xXxRENEGADEZ,\n\nyes it was an incident. We are still investigating the reason but my first guess it was due to us trying to update the script that define what time queues go up and down. \nIn fact, due to the growing popularity of teambuilder, we decided to keep it up at the same time we have SR ranked up (every day from 8am till 4am(+1))\n\nAs for 3's ranked, we are still not in a good place with Twisted Treeline queue health to be able to have ranked on.\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
