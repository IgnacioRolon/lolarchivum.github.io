I think if Riot updated Miss Fortune&#039;s &quot;Bullet Time&quot; ability so that she could also move whilst using it like Lucian&#039;s &quot;The Culling&quot;, It would greatly boost her to be an overall good ADC like the others.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-02-20T16:01:21.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao if she moved doing that ulti it would look so dumb","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-20T08:00:41.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss Fortune's thing is kind of the immobile heavy hitter, kind of like Anivia or Vel'Koz is for mages. Since her update she is no longer all that weak, in fact I've found her to be quite strong. \n\nBullet Time is a high damage, massive AoE ability on a long cooldown. Tailored for not-solo fights and great for wombos. The Culling is more of a whole bunch of faster, bigger auto attacks that is designed for zone control and dueling.\n\nIn the present meta I would actually argue that with most supports (any that have decent cc) Miss Fortune is by far a stronger ADC than Lucian is, but they are difficult to compare because they are almost complete opposites in terms of playstyle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-20T07:53:52.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it has larger AOE then culling. movement is not necessary.","replies":[]}]}
