So pretty much it shows everyone has left the end game lobby but in reality, they are still there.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T13:02:56.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Vanellion,\n\nWhile we do appreciate you taking your time to report a bug, because this is the Help and Support boards, we try to limit posts to technical issues and general questions. As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
