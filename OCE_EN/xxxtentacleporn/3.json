I stay calm knowing I had 2 more games. The team seemed normal at first, but as soon as I spoke to one they cursed and intentionally fed. Then Anivia decided it would be funny to block off the exits of her own teammates so she took every opportunity to get us killed. There goes a fkn promo. Awesome matchmaking you got there rito.\r\n\r\nCan you like ban trolls from playing ranked please or do something about it. ffs","replies":[{"poster":"You Pick My Hero","date":"2015-10-28T01:21:48.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there Vanellion.\n\nThere is a section on the end screen that you can report these players. Please refer to that as your first option. Otherwise I can suggest to record part of your games as evidence and send it to support@riotgames.com they may be able to help there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Murdoch","date":"2015-10-25T09:34:28.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No they can't, they don't care.
