I have heaps of doubles that I received from friends and strangers gifting me and I don&#039;t use them so theres really no point having them. I&#039;m not asking for a refund, just a way to make use of these skins. Maybe like the old rune thing where they put in two skins and get a random one?","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-19T02:16:00.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never heard of receiving duplicate skins.

I believe he meant he has multiple skins for many champs.","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-19T02:47:13.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, a lot more sensical.","replies":[{"poster":"XXXTENTACLEPORN","date":"2015-11-20T12:51:14.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thats what I meant :)\nI don't see the point of owning two skins for the same champ because if you have 2, why would anyone ever want to play with the lower tier skin. What makes it even worse is if you don't even play the champion, yet you have two skins for the neglected champ.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-19T03:35:08.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are working on a system like this with the mastery chests/keys and the crafting.
