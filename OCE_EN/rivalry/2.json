The people playing during these times are playing because they want to play ranked at that time knowing what it will be like (queue and in game) don&#039;t take it away from a whole region. I mostly play in those times because of my sleeping pattern, removing the curfew was the best thing. pls don&#039;t bring it back","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-26T21:43:34.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing on the [Service Status Page](http://status.leagueoflegends.com/?en_AU#oce) about it.

They've been collecting the numbers and gathering feedback, and if they believe that matchmaking is problematic at specific hours, it's understandable why they would disable it at those times. \n\nIf you feel strongly that Ranked Solo/Duo Queue should be enabled at all times, I encourage you to post your sentiments in the [**Queue Schedule**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZzQR1haM-queue-schedule-updated) thread!
