Does it, in your opinion, feel rewarding for tanks, who is supposed to be the meat-est class in any game where their sole purpose and reasons why they even exist is to be tough and so they could continuously disrupt the opposition, to die to damage chucking in instants?\n\nYou're not supposed to solo skill tanks as squishies, a much simpler and generalised analogy would be that you aren't supposed to beat rocks with scissors.","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2016-12-31T13:16:35.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sigh, the point he is trying to make is that it is now pointless to lane against a tank as anything but a tank, which with some champs is spot on, it has caused a lot of tanky champs to become way too unbalanced ie, garen Camille, poppy, mal. to the point its just stupid. changing the armor pen has had too hard an effect.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-31T14:09:30.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=y u feed me,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yHeHVrFA,comment-id=0000000100000000,timestamp=2016-12-31T13:16:35.107+0000)\n>\n> sigh, the point he is trying to make is that it is now pointless to lane against a tank as anything but a tank, which with some champs is spot on, it has caused a lot of tanky champs to become way too unbalanced ie, garen Camille, poppy, mal. to the point its just stupid. changing the armor pen has had too hard an effect.\n\nTanks have almost no damage potential throughout the entire game, but they have monster tankiness and CCs. Bruisers have good early to mid game damage potential, but their tankiness are more situational and they lack strong and dependable CCs. Fighters' sustainability are either situational or specialised and used primiarly to negate damage during trades rather than focusing on soaking in damage as a whole, and they have much more offence oriented kits, and their CCs are weak and generally nonexistent in a team scale.\n\nMalphite is a Tank. Garen and Poppy are Bruisers. Camille is more or less a Fighter. While how you should deal with your enemies vary from champs to champs, but the general strategies for the 3 subclasses are also fundamentally different as a whole.\n\nBut 1 thing is common: All of these subclasses are very vulnerable to poking and are generally powerless to deal with enemies with ranged harass or other similar capabilities.\n\nIf you're trying to lane a melee assassin who can't ranged poke against any one of these 3 classes, or that you're playing a ranged AD character and still loses to them, you are doing something wrong, it's simple as that. \n\nYou are not supposed to be able to kill anything just because you have damage, you know. Tankers are not there for you to be there to rack up your kill count, they are supposed to counter damage, that's one of the biggest reasons to why they even exist. If you wanna kill someone, focus squishies, that's what you do, you could also clean up the tank sink once he's alone on his own with you have 4-5 teammates left.\n\nIf you've found yourself laning against a tanker with a squishy melee who can't poke, well tough luck either get better team comp next time, trade lanes, or just deal with it and farm+roam, not that hard. Throwing scissors into rocks and wonder why it's not working out isn't how one should be doing this.","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2017-01-01T09:49:29.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok so sorry to demolish your post but you completely neglected the fact that a lot of tanks are now able to build damage off of and with damage items making them both tank and be able to smash most types of champs, hence the ones I listed, lets add lee with 3 full ad items to it. garen with bt, cleaver, yomus, sv, sfcape. if tanks were built only as tanks then still some inherit damage from building hp armor etc.\nit is about what it was supposed to be it is about how riots ruined that. lol. try posting without being so closed minded cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-01T10:09:23.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So sorry to demolish your post but Sekai has literally explained that in his post with the use of \"subclasses\".","replies":[{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2017-01-04T16:14:57.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if they stick to \"meta\" builds,\nbut not even, its not hard to outplay a adc as a Camille or poppy, especially poppy.

Fighters do have certain advantages over typical ADC (rather, Physical damage based *marksman* champions) which allow then to do better. Put those same champions against other types of champions and they don't do so well (I believe Assassins do pretty well against Fighters).\n\n> The way someone is allowed to manipulate the champs role by build is whats at question\n\nSo, you're just complaining about a core aspect of the game then? Influencing the potential of a champion by choice of items, masteries and runes is a major part of the game and it's *intended* to work like that. It's called \"diversity\". Be a very lacklustre game if all we ever saw was tanks all using the same 6 items, mages using the same 6 items, assassins using the same 6 items etc.\n\n> the fact lethality is going to be changed \"tweaked\" w/e is proof\n\nIt's proof that there's an issue with lethality itself, not the larger item/champion relationship.\n\n> \"Malphite is a Tank. Garen and Poppy are Bruisers\"\nriot lists poppy as tank, hmmmmm.\nbut also lists j4 as a tank so...?\n...\nbtw garen is listed as fighter\n\nPoppy is also listed as a fighter (secondary), same as Jarvan IV. Garen is listed as a Fighter/Tank. Then again, \"subclasses\" are not listed in the champion descriptions. You'll notice there is not \"class\" for \"bruiser\" (which has previously been discussed). \"Subclasses\" are just an easier way to categorise various champions beyond Riot's \"Role\" system, which only has 6 distinct categories (and I believe they said they were changing it).\n\n> the line between the classes and sub classes is becoming very very blurry which is the point. most of that is from item changes. tank fizz anyone.\n\nIt's not about item changes, it's about what a champions abilities are based around. Garen, Poppy and Jarvan all have a significant amount of damage despite being categorised as \"Tanks\", hence why they are also categorised as \"Fighters\". They're able to work well either way, whether their focus is defence or damage. Then again, they also work better one way (Garen is a better tank, Poppy as well if I'm not mistaken, while Jarvan is a better Fighter).\n\nTank Fizz has nothing in relation to his abilities, it's simply a matter of items. That doesn't mean Fizz is categorised as a tank, it just means there is a way to play him as one. In fact, you can do that kind of this with basically any champion, and changing items wont impact that enough to make any significant difference. All you need to do is create an ideal item/mastery/rune setup and you can take a given champion out of their \"typical\" role. Thing is, though, it will work better if the items/runes/masteries compliment the champions abilities.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-30T01:18:03.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yHeHVrFA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-30T00:44:56.847+0000)\n>\n> Tanks are not supposed to be 1-shotted, you know.
