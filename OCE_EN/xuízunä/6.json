After 2 months of playing the new dynamic queue, I feel like it is who has better friends. This is what sums up the ranked system now. Can you please bring back solo queue and ranked 5&#039;s. Ranked should be about testing your limits, challenging yourself and improving as a player. Dynamic queue does not offer this because you can play with friends. Well that is what normal mode is for. To play with friends and have fun. But for my league experience I am a competitive player, I love to play to win and become better as a player. Solo queue offered this but as for dynamic queue I think it is overrated. Sure you can play with friends and all, but I think normal and ranked 5&#039;s is best for this purpose. We need solo queue back for the competitive side as there is a fun side to league. I want to climb based on my individual skill and carry my team and lead my team with my knowledge. In dynamic queue, you have premade teams most of the time, that barely use any form of communication and that are toxic because they are premade and it is always &quot;which premade is better&quot; I was able to achieve my goal last season and get Gold. This season I have been demoted twice  and the climb to Platinum is a real struggle. This has happened alot to my friends aswell. It is just not fair as a solo player that wants to win with his own skill and not rely heavily on the premade. I know Riot, I am only one person and I know for a fact that I am not alone on this. Please Riot consider for what the community wants. Thanks for your time Riot and community have a wonderful day/evening.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-03-25T18:06:03.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isnt this the script for that redmercy video?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-03-25T23:58:37.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some of it is yes, however, I agree with him 100% that is how I play league.

Granted there are some games where theres a 3-man premade on each side and you can tell because they group really early and gank a lot more than normal games but you just react to it.\n\nI honestly don't see how its TOO much different. I think people just have a very easy scapegoat for why ranked is hard this season. It used to be nothing but \"wahh feeders/afks\" \"waahhh DC RIOT! FIX YOUR SERVERS!\" now its \"WAAHHH Dyanamic Que is bullshit. I want SOLO\".\n\nWhen in actual fact, Dynamic is better in terms of what the game is actually all about. 5v5's. There is a different \"feel\" to this season with more people grouped together, but I don't really think it really affects you unless you are one of those raging anti-social assholes who pisses off one person and now that person has 2-3 friends you have to contend with too.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-25T21:30:59.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the same time, as a solo player it is incredibly frustrating when you get ahead in lane, and suddenly the nerd you were stomping gets a 3 man dive because he decided to queue with friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-03-25T23:57:29.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the worst feeling isn't it. :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}
