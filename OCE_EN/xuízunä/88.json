Inspiration came from Naruto Shippuden and there is a person named &ldquo;Garra&rdquo;, if you don&rsquo;t know who he is, I highly recommend searching him. He has a massive Gourd that sand emmits from and I think this would be great for Singed! I know he has a new skin already but this idea just came to my thoughts. Could name Sand keeper Singed or Sand Guardian Singed. His Q can just be sand coming out of him and his W could be like a sand pit or quicksand. Would love to hear some responses! Thanks for your time!\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nXenomazul","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-10-29T10:03:20.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Inspiration came from Naruto Shippuden\"\n\nNo.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-10-29T12:54:59.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Inspiration came from Naruto Shippuden\"\n\n*pukes *","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2017-10-29T11:19:56.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is wrong with that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2017-10-29T08:30:48.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Garra laugh or bm?
