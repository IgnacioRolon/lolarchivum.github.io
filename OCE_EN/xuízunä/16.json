I do recommend you don't try cleaning it yourself, you may check, but don't try clean it yourself, as you run a risk of damaging it, which will be worse than currently is. You can hire a professional to clean your comp and check everything is alright for between $30-$100 if need be.\n\nBut for all you know, the GPU might be fine, you might have a faulty connection or a corrupt processing file. You could have a badly fragmented HDD/SSD, one of your ddr could have come loose/disconnected/corrupted. A number of things could be wrong.\n\nBut ultimately i recommend rebuilding your comp with better parts anyway, parts are cheaper ad stronger now, it would be worth it, for example the 1070 and 1080, both stronger than a TitanX and cheaper(a dual 1070 is 140% the cost of 1 titan for about 230% the power).\n\nIf you need i could quickly put together a list of parts which would make a really strong computer for relatively cheap price ($800-$1500) or a strong as beast with high power, awesome cooling, LED lighting for a nice look, super quiet and massive processing for a few dollars over $3000, with plenty of gamer essential addons ","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-06-14T02:19:59.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I gave it a clean like a week ago now.
