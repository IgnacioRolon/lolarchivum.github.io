Is it just me or does everyone else feel the same about this? Riot will you do something about making the skins more vibrant? Hope to hear from you soon, thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-01-18T23:54:58.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your opinion on this! You did bring up some good points. I love how riot does the champion textures updates. The only problem I have are some of them just seem more dull then the older version. Take a look at skin spotlights when they do the videos on them and you will see the difference","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-18T23:23:46.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you'll find many people agreeing with you on this one. Season's 1 -3 were colour correction nightmares. Everything was unnecessarily fluorescent, and looked bad.\n\nRiot does texture updates to brush up some skins to look like the rest, but also for gameplay clarity. Abilities need to be the clearest, then champions, then minions and the background last.\n\nWhat was happening in earlier seasons is that, some skins and champions were mini stun grenades. [Here](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/beaUrQwDv-w/maxresdefault.jpg)'s a good example.\n\nEverything starts to look similar, and it's far too bright.","replies":[]}]}
