I suggest 3 things for a bettet gaming exerpience.\n1. Run a speedtest, make sure you are getting the correct speeds and ping. If not, call your ISP.\n2. Always use a Ethernet cable.\n3. Use a static IP address and not a Dynamic one. Multiple people on this thread are having issues by the looks of it. Let me know if you have tried these things out!","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-08-25T08:25:31.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you think you would know why Netflix seems to mess with my internet so much?\nI'm being serious when I say that the moment my sisters start a show of theirs, the internet starts spiking like crazy, eventually slowing down, but only a minute or so.\nThink you could help?\n\np.s. what's a dynamic and static IP address","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-08-25T11:10:09.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure! I will be glad to help!\nThe thing is nowadays, everything is connected to the internet. So when you are on league for example and lets say you get 5mbps download speed. Then your sisters want to watch netflix, this 5mbps will drop down to lets say 2 depending on what they watch and how much speed/data they will use. It is essential you have unlimited internet so you don't get capped and can share the internet with no worries. I am with NBN so the speeds are awesome! My brother can go on league and I can go on youtube or whatever and the ping is still 12! And the closer you are to the exchange. The better internet you will get. What modem do you use? And what internet do you use if you don't mind me asking :)\nA dynamic IP is a shared IP address that multiple devices can use for less fuss (to connect them) however a static IP is much faster as you create your own IP address which is great for gaming as it is better then dynamic IP. If you wan't, I can show you how to create a static IP address :) and always make sure you use a ethernet cable! It just mainly comes down to your internet plan and how close you are to the exhange. Hope this helps! Please tell me what else you would like to know :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-08-25T11:56:14.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm actually with NBN as well, but that's the thing. It might be that I don't have unlimited internet (I'm not exactly the age to make the rules in the house yet :p).

Yeah im on the 12mbps plan with unlimited. I can't wait to change to 100mbps download! Sure add me and we can go from there!
