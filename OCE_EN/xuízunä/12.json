Like I understand there is mage pen boots by why not armor pen boots?

BC shreds like 30%, and Youmuu's, Duskblade, Last Whisper duo, and I'm pretty sure Maw or Scimitar offer some more Armour pen. \n\nThere are enough items that together fit all the roles perfectly. BC for bruisers, Duskblade foir assassins, Last whisper for adcs, and Youmuu's for basically anyone","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-07-13T14:45:27.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I am already aware of that. I was just saying it would be extra nice to have. I feel with all the items it still Isn't enough against tanks. For me when I look at the old last whisper I miss it alot because of what you could do with it. Yes I love the new armor pen items loads, but I can't just build armor pen, my builds need to be situational","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-07-13T10:06:33.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There already _is_ a lot of Armour Penetration:\n\n- In Items\n                         - Black Cleaver offers up to 30% Armour Penetration\n                         - Youmuu's Ghostblade offers 20 Armour Penetration\n                         - Maw of Malmortius offers 10 Armour Penetration\n                         - Duskblade of Draktharr offers 10 Armour Penetration\n\n\n- In Masteries\n - Precision offers up to 8.4 Armour Penetration\n - Battering Blows offers up to 7% Armour Penetration\n\n\n- In Runes (Tier 3)\n - Mark of Armour Penetration offers 1.28 Armour Penetration each \n                                 - 9 marks = 11.53 total\n - Quintessence of Armour Penetration offers 2.56 Armour Penetration each\n    - 3 Quintessences = 7.68 total\n\n - (Total of 19.21 Armour Penetration)\n____________________________________________________\n\nFor Magic Penetration:\n\n- In Items\n                           - Liandry's Torment/Haunting Guise offers 15 Magic Penetration\n                           - Void Staff offers 35% Magic Penetration\n                           - Sorcerer's Shoes offer 15 Magic Penetration\n\n- In Masteries\n - Piercing Thoughts offers up to 7% Magic Penetration\n - Precision offers up to 8.4 Magic Penetration\n\n\n- In Runes (Tier 3)\n - Mark of Magic Penetration offers 0.87 Magic Penetration each\n                                - 9 Marks = 7.83\n - Glyph of Magic Penetration offers 0.63 Magic Penetration each\n                                - 9 Glyphs = 5.67\n - Quintessence of Magic Penetration offers 2.01 Magic Penetration each\n                                - 3 Quintessences = 6.03\n\n - (Total of 19.53 Magic Penetration)","replies":[]}]}
