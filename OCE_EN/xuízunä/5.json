I go good in my normal games trying to get S ranks and it just feels impossible. Does anyone know how to get S rank the easiest way? I have tried farming and getting heaps of kills and still no avail. I get objectives and still nothing either. What defines a S rank? And what is the best way of getting them?

You'll be dealing with a smaller % of the server, so unless all the people who play that champ in that position are gods, you'll have a better chance of getting in that higher %.\n\nOne thing that I have noticed as a big help is having a low death count, not necessarily a high KDA.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-05-26T13:33:43.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that, appreciate it :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-26T12:54:01.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly just start playing for fun instead of trying to focus on the numbers to get an S. \nI was tryharding when the system came out, and getting nowhere.
