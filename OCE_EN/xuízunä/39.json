I just want to know why we can&#039;t see enemy boarders in loading screen. Could you possibly implement in the next patch this feature? Because I would like to know who I am up against and I think It would be cool if we could see it aswell in general. Let me know what you guys think! Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-21T01:55:30.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you used to be able to, but they removed it because of the risk that your teammates might afk from the start if they thought the enemy was too good.\nlets say your team has 1 gold border, 2 without a border, and 2 with a silver border and the enemy has 3-4 gold borders and at least 1 plat border. there are some people out there that would afk from the get go cause they would think it's impossible to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2015-09-21T04:39:40.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah you do have a point. But when people afk, Riot can pick it up with their improved report feedback system after people report afk in general. Like  It's the same with the mastery emote. Enemies can see it now, so I hope Riot can implement it. If people afk because they are scared, then a simple report i think will do the job. I am not scared of people with boarders anyway. If it's a normal game, try your best and have fun at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-21T04:58:53.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xenomazul,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XjwyViU4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-09-21T04:39:40.029+0000)\n>\n> Yeah you do have a point.

I downloaded the app off iTunes and use my phone to check during the loading screens ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2015-09-21T06:52:08.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i do use Lolnexus alot to check players and stuff, i think its the best website to check player ranks. I thought people would afk because of team comp, toxic or lag lol. But I think that shouldn't stop Riot from implementing the loading boarders. I think it will do less harm then we think.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-21T07:27:17.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The borders change at the start of the season and wont be changed during the season, so unless you were bronze or unranked st the start of the season you should have a border depending your rank.","replies":[]}]}
