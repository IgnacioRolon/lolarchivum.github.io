However I'm not entirely sure because I couldn't find the amount of RP you get online, so I just used the amount that people get in the US for my answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-08-04T06:49:41.512+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"50 dollar cards have 5900 rp, same as buying in store with card.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/MXv9uHnL-rp-adjustment-in-oceania","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-04T08:27:08.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The US has different dollar to us use your head.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-04T11:35:39.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know...

There is just no logics. \"Specifically\" pointing out that you have made errors in your calculation doesn't make me dumb for correcting you.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-04T15:26:34.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a little confused?

I even said that I couldn't find the price for 50 dollar RP cards anywhere online...\n\nIf what I'm saying is stupid and you view my comment as not logical then why did YOU bother saying anything? Quite frankly I feel you are just saying this because you are the type who enjoy arguing with people. \n\nPlease do not reply to me. I never wished for you to come along and reply with a mean and nasty comment because your ego allows you to do so. If you do, I am forewarning you now that I will report you for harassment if you do so.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-05T00:14:06.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mean nasty comment? What kind of victim complex? How is this harassment? My initial comment corrected you by saying US has a different dollar, and I said \"use your head\" which is exactly same thing you send to me, don't pretend you are an angel.\n\nYes, you intended to help him out, but you were incorrect so I'm not going to let information go misinformed. You reply to me with a defensive/passive aggressive answer that doesn't make any sense because you just admitted that you were wrong and tried to make me sound dumb?\n\nI actually never said you were stupid, the most I said was that sentence was dumb. You are been so upset because I told you that the US dollar is like 1.31 AUS dollar, therefore they get more RP for $50, pretty basic.\n\nThe reason I bothered saying something when I think your comment is not logical is because it isn't logical. What if he bought 2 $50 RP and basically lost value for his money? Is that the intended outcome?\n\nAll I am asking is instead of posting an uncertain and not researched conclusion even if you INTEND to help someone, someone else who knows which one has more value is better off commenting, such as below.\n\nRiot or a moderator isn't going to acknowledge your report for harassment for several reasons.\n\n1. Your first reply said the same thing I did that you consider to be harassment.\n\n2. You have just argued with me and then used your last statement to make it seem like I am the only one arguing towards you.\n\n3. I stated an obvious fact about comparing regional RP value. If you don't want to be corrected, don't post an in-certain answer. This isn't yahoo answers or whatever, this is a forum. People are going to \"argue\" with you.\n\nDon't resort to the old \"Please don't reply to me\". \"I never wished for you to come along and reply with a mean and nasty comment because your ego allows you to do so\".\n\nIf we were in public I would say the exact same thing because if a guy goes out and wastes money due to misinformation there is no reason not to prevent that.\n\nAlso, when I said you should actually research, you claim you did, but you didn't. Researching doesn't mean if you can't find something you just put a random figure, it means you find out what you are looking for.\n\nYou ATTEMPTED to research, but if you couldn't find what you are looking for you should just continue along for your day. I thank you for your intent to be helpful, but stop putting on this defensive and passive aggressive shell when all I did was make sense.\n\nFor example, Annie Bot's Wife down there has what the OP needed to know, and posted it around the same time as you. Their answer explained about bonus RP and used correct numbers.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T01:58:14.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Harassment: Aggressive pressure or intimidation\n\n\"Use your head\" is both very aggressive and intimidating.

Either way his reporting it as harassment/offensive was perfectly valid, you can report what you like and we'll see it, and while he isn't an 'angel' he was understandably defensive.\n\nPersonally I try to be pretty conservative with removing content as OCE tends to have more... crass ways of saying things than say NA, so generally I will only remove things that clearly break one of the rules.

No. But was it really necessary to say it to him in such a way in the first place?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-08-04T08:50:47.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think 7200 was when riot gave bonus rp","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-08-04T04:54:47.897+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"$100 - 12,100\n$50 -  5900\nx2 $50 - 11,800.\n\n$100 you get more due to the bonus Riot points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Attysu The Poro","date":"2016-08-04T21:24:24.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE RP Prices: \n\nFor Credit Card\nBASE+BONUS=TOTAL\n\n50 AUD/NZD - 5200+700=5900\n100 AUD/NZD - 10400+1700=12100\n\n~_~_~\n\nTl;dr: You'd get 11,800 RP for 2 50 AU/NZD, but 12,100 for one 100 AUD/NZD card, so buying the 100 one is better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AceAkali","date":"2016-08-04T09:47:37.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"$50 2cards will actually cost you $70 or $80 bcoz of promotion in stores, so its upto you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-08-04T08:06:13.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen a $100 card in game stores near me for months well I'm not sure maybe they all go when i go in there lul...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-04T04:34:01.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure you get bonus Rp for buying it from the in game store","replies":[]}]}
