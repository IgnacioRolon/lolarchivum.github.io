I would like to know why the G-SYNC still tears in league. I set it on in control panel as well as Vertical sync on in Control panel and switch it off in game. If i cap the FPS to 144 or 60, game still tears. I cannot uncap the FPS as it will jump to 600 fps. And when I try to tick Vertical sync on in league it jumps to 600 fps as well and I can get that smoothness and i don&#039;t know why G-sync is not working. Can anyone help as I have tried absolutely everything. I have to use HDMI as that can work with 144 FPS with no stuttering at all but the Display Port plugged in the GPU is not working. Really need help. Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"relicCZ","date":"2018-04-03T22:27:06.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have exactly same problem.
