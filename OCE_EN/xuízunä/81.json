I am saving up for a pc build that is going to cost around $3500 and for the gaming monitor, I want a 144Hz refresh rate followed by an IPS display and with 4k resolution. Are there any monitors with such specs or am I just dreaming and have to wait for it? üòÇ","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-27T04:20:28.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly that just reminds me of the Scorpio announcement from windows, dumbasses think they can run 4k on an xbox.\n\nI'm certain there are monitors that can run it, your gonna run into 2 main problems though (with a third league related problem).\n\n1. Running it at that Frame rate from your PC, you have to have a really high end graphics card for that.\n2. Running a game at that high a resolution, your likely going to have to offset it by actually lowering the quality (i'm not fully up to date, but 3.5k i don't think can run games on high settings and at 4k, that said, you could easily just go ahead and run it at like 1920 x 1080 quite well, and honestly it's not that major of a difference)\n(3. and this is league related, League has the problem where running the game at 4k will actually cause the UI to be massively tiny, and i don't think this was ever fixed, so be aware of that)","replies":[{"poster":"Xu√≠zun√§","date":"2016-06-27T05:59:49.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will post you my build here and tell me what you think! :D\nDo you think I would save up $3500 for league? LOL this is for all games since this build has 2x 1080 GPU's in SLI. And\nI need names of the monitors please that have the specs I mentioned above! That would be really helpful!

And I don't think league can run in SLI anyway, prob would crash so I will use 1 1080 for league and 2 for battlefield 1 and all those games. No worries man, let me know what you think!
