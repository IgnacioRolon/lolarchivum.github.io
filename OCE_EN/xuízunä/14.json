Your _\"every 5 seconds is make a durrrrrrrr sound\"_ seems to indicate this. \n\n A quick graphics card driver update should do the trick. Player support has a really helpful walk-through about this, I recommend you check it out.\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jSQWa0cRVY\n\nIf that doesn't work, then try all the other stuff in the video and look through the rest of the troubleshooting tips [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).\n\n**SephirothSG** will be here in a bit if none of that works. It's just that he has IRL commitments and we want to get you back on the Rift as soon as possible :)","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-02-14T06:21:54.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do i check for updates on my graphics card? is it all in the video?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-14T07:21:04.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, that video covers everything you need to know :)","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-02-14T09:16:45.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey i need help on one thing!
