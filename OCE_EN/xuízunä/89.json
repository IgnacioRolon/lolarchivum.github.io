Please select the region in which your account was created in order to successfully login\". I created my account in NA so when i select the live patcher it comes up as NA in the settings on the client. It did used to say OCE before. Does anyone know how can I change it as it only comes up with 2 options \"Live (NA) or PBE. Thanks all!","replies":[]}
