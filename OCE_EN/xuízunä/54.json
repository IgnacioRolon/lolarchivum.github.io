Turn this feature off. What that does is it stops recording your games while you play which can chunk on performance. I never knew about this so props to Riot for telling me this! Hope this helps just a little bit guys! :)","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-18T05:08:05.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does this work to increase my LoL FPS tho","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-09-18T05:17:42.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It won't increase it, it helps stabalise it much better. The only way to actually increase FPS is to buy a high end graphics card and to be on the latest drivers.

Also, it looks like Xotic PC is American based and so the shipping would cost a fair amount, wouldn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-09-20T11:31:06.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes American based, Yeah prob with that you won't get a high end one.

Possibly doubled with Critical Thinking. On my MacBook Pro I get 15-35 FPS. It's not too bad, but if I ever wanted to get into recording I'm going to need more RAM and CPU power, because at the moment OBS uses over a third of my CPU whenever I open it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-19T00:30:29.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U mad bro, I don't even...","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-18T21:24:38.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dafuq dood, I'm not recording games to begin with.\nPut the crack pipe down bro.\nI don't even Xbox.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-09-18T23:35:04.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you misunderstood the point.

Log in either with your hotmail or xbox account. Then click the settings on the left hand side. You should see a tab called \"game DVR\" go into that and make sure you click it off. This will stop recording games you play as it chuncks on performance as I said :) it will help stabalise your fps. The only way to increase your fps is like I said is to buy a high end graphics card!
