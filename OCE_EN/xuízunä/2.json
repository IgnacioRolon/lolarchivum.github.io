They are such better value and I would like to say Riot, you have done an outstanding job with this system in place. Worth every RP doing it. Are these boxes permanent? If yes I would like to make a suggestion. I have so many project cores left over and they have no use since I have the project skins. Maybe implement a dis-enchant for some Essence or something like that. Otherwise they are sitting ducks. Are these project boxes permanent?
