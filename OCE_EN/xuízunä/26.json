I will not put the names here. I was in a ranked game and 2 people were very toxic to me because they were friends. I reported them in game and I feel like nothing will be done. Is there a way I can get my chat logs for my game? I do not record, so I think it will be hard. I am sick of getting flamed at for no reason at all and I was not even the worst person &quot;feeding&quot; on my team. I don&#039;t flame others anyway as I am graceful in defeat and give constructive criticism. But I feel very upset as this happens alot and nothing gets done with these players. I need help punishing these players so that when I come across more. I can do what is right for myself and for the community and that is to make league a happy and enjoyable experience.

After reporting someone on my other account that I rarely play, (so few reports) the first report I did instantly got the notification that they were punished.

I could go on and tell you that [Instant Feedback](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) is one of **Riot**'s best performing report systems ever, but it wouldn't actually help. \n\n_What you're looking for is **report feedback.**_\n\n+ We do have a small [report feedback notification](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFN-7pWWYAAMdnX.png) right now, but people hardly see it because it only triggers in very specific situations. It's not really working properly and it's not enough TBH.\n\n+ The Player Behaviour team has been looking looking into a solution since late last year. **Lyte** wanted to get better report feedback into the new tribunal, and that idea has stuck around. The old tribunal had some pretty good [feedback](http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/ac/45/1362433030_6392_score.png) already, but the goal is to expand on that even more.\n\nWith the new tribunal being worked on right now, we'll hopefully see these features coming very soon.\n\nI know it's hard, but try hang tight until then! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-06-28T07:43:26.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, your logic is correct.
