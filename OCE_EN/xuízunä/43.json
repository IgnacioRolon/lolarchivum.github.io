Just a quick rant about the teleport nerf. I hope I am not the only one here but I hate the teleport change. It takes so long to tp now and especially when you want to tp bot for a play. They have so much time to run away and it is such a bad change. That one second longer feels like forever. Can you change it back to how it was? Like it is so frustrating for me to use it now. Thanks for reading and have a wonderful day!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-30T05:07:09.643+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was the whole point of nerfing teleport, was that it was supposed to give bot lane a chance. \n\nBefore, it was basically a free gank, its not supposed to be a free gank.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-06-30T05:43:47.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know. How about when your team is behind and you have to make that play to come back in the game? Now they have all the time in the world to run away and same if you tp anywhere else","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-30T05:57:59.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about when your team is ahead and you can smash them without any chance of escape?","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-06-30T06:22:49.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well someone has to win now don't they?","replies":[{"poster":"eLy Harvey","date":"2016-06-30T06:45:41.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you went from the logic of TP's being used as a teams only option to get back in the game, to, well one team has to win and therefore when a team is ahead they deserve to be able to TP bot with no repercussions. You need to choose 1 side of the argument, and stick to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-06-30T08:10:13.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you read my thred or just part of it? I suggest you read it all. I am talking about the time it takes to tp in aswell and just in general as now enemies can run away more easier. Even just going to tp in lane, that can cost a tower, a kill or even minions with 1 second longer. I am sticking to my argument? I think you do not know what you are saying. Tp has multiple uses, with that being said, most of those uses have been extremely restricted due to this one second longer. Understand what I  saying?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
