I have tried every possible build on her and watch all the youtubers who play her but i feel she is struggling to vs alot of top laners. What does everyone think? Am I crazy or is this a valid point that needs to be addressed? I hope riot sees this so we can have a friendly discussion!

Customs? It's not trying to be nasty mate, it's actual curiosity. I can see that you did not play her at all in ranked S8, 3 games in S7(1 win, 2 loss), 2 games in S6(1 win, 1 loss) and 9 games in S5(9 wins). In normals, it's still only 16 games. Mastery doesn't mean much. Are you playing her on a smurf? That would make some sense.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Catski","date":"2019-01-04T10:00:20.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-12-24T08:08:13.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that Riven needs buff too, some time during Season 8, when Darius got buffed, but I knew that at least for me, she may not necessarily need buffs right now, not with the new rune system.\nJust take Electrocute, or Lethal Tempo. If you take Conqueror it would be too hard to proc since Riven is not autoattack based, even after you used your third Q, it takes a bit more time to proc that keystone, take it at your own risk. Electrocute works better because it is both autoattack and ability based keystone. With Adaptive Force you shouldn't be weak at all, though sometimes your opponent may be stronger than you.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2018-12-24T10:53:07.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that wean!
