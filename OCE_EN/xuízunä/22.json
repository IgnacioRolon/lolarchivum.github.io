I feel like there should be no sound. If a player walks past a pink while not looking they shouldn't get a helping hand imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-31T07:10:59.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wholly disagree with you, my only argument against no sound would be that it rewards looking at the map more.

You had to know when the camps spawn, where the enemy jungler is, how long of a window you have to take the camp and how much deep vision you had. With the timers that periodically tell when the camp will spawn it helps a bit. \n\nAlso it only trips when you walk past the camp and see it empty and it doesn't say if it was taken yet so you can still go an entire game counter jungling to only find empty camps. \n\nAlso skilled summoners use pink wards to skillfully ward enemy camps such that they won't be detected unless the jgler walks through that bush so making a sound effect would kinda ruin this for the jglers that use counter jungling quite often.\n\nIn the end Riot games wants a balance of clarity denying knowledge (like not knowing the range of a turret so you can actually bait and turn fights around) when appropriate and giving knowledge when necessary (like knowing the range of some champion abilities eg. Jhin's ult)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-31T12:06:40.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Actually I have to disagree it promotes counter jungling a rarely used skill that most don't use.\n\nYes it promotes being able to counter jungle without ever actually having to set foot into the enemy jungle until you are counter jungling, THIS is the problem, the timers are fine, but being always able to know when they spawn is not a good thing.\n\n>Also it only trips when you walk past the camp and see it empty and it doesn't say if it was taken yet so you can still go an entire game counter jungling to only find empty camps.\n\nWrong, as soon as there is a minute left BOTH teams know when the camp is spawning, meaning you have a good long minute to prepare for a counter jungle, when you used to have to know when it was roughly taken to be able to do this.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T12:42:46.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so a bad on my part and something riot can fix however I don't think that these timers are entirely bad and since both teams know about it and the enemy team can prepare for it doesn't that logically mean that the jgler can prepare for it to not be taken by warding? and in turn make it not worth it by killing the person trying to steal the buff with a few  buddies to help? I mean it's just up to opinion but i think Riot probably put it there for a reason. And like i said there's probably a delay b4 the person actually steals it so you can still try to steal but come up with nothing. Also this information is available to both teams about both buffs so in all it's an even trade. It can also serve as a way for the jgler to catch up if and when the enemy jungler is counter jungling hard since you can see when it spawns. I mean an entire game without the exp and gold of the large jungle camps would seriously make you useless and probably a point the enemy team can exploit and farm you for the gold and exp lead.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-31T13:14:27.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I mean it's just up to opinion but i think Riot probably put it there for a reason.\n\nIt's there for the people who don't understand how to counter jungle or time things properly, this is very simply obvious.\n\n>Also this information is available to both teams about both buffs so in all it's an even trade.\n\nIt's not an even trade, back before this update, it took time to actually find out when enemy buffs were coming up, and prep a counter jungle, now it takes nothing, the fact that both teams get it means nothing, because if an enemy jungler got caught out warding to find out when the buffs spawned, then you would know they plan on counter jungling, and this was meant to be the case for a reason.\n\nNow they can prep for a steal with nothing but a walk in when it's spawning.\n\nBasically it's just another version of riot dumbing down the game, and as a jungle main i HATE this change.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T13:38:03.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the enemy Jungler can do this to you that would mean you could do the same to the enemy jungler that's kinda what I mean by both team knowing also good warding and prediction can help stop the counter jg in a way since you could ping the other lanes to point out an easy kill. The danger of counter jungling it the fact that it puts you waaaayyy out of position and anything in the way of safety. If mid, bot or top come in from the river he's pretty much trapped in there as he can't escape through the lanes and can pretty much only wall hop out with the flash ... I get it you're not happy with this change but there's always a way to play around it. I know Riot sometimes does Riot things but Riot's not stupid in making it unbalanced... they have sound reasoning (execpt in the case of Teemo and fizz) and instead of focusing on how it is bad try thinking about how you can use this to your advantage and minimize the effect of the negatives from here you can try something new like waiting at the buff that's about to spawn smite steal free kill. Admitingly it does kinda make it stupidly easy to counter jungle but as the players there really isn't much we can do about it so we just have to play around it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-31T14:39:10.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use it, that doesn't make it a good thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-30T08:28:25.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its like that.
