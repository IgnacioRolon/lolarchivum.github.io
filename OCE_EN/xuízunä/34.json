Even the best ganking junglers struggle to hit every lane unless they are snow balled. To hit up every lane and keep all lanes happy is near impossible, plus some times the time isn't right to gank, like people asking for assistance when i am 10% health, then die when i back to heal up and they blame me when they should be more observant and see my health or back them self. \n\nExpecting people to hit all lanes is just absurd certainly when most OCE players don't know how to slow the lane push down and just auto/blow all skills on minions into a hard push on enemy tower. Sure some champs work well pushing their enemy under tower but not all, so it isn't junglers fault you have crap all clue how to pull the lane toward you to make ganking much more viable.\n\nAs a mid main i can say for sure it isn't the junglers problem, it is the other lanes for forcing the lane to hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-07-28T05:23:14.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you to a extent. You are wrong because EVERY lane is gankable early game. Top must be ganked in 3 mins. And my jglers don't do that. Most of the time the enemy is pushed up they still don't come. I have even been snowballed top or adc and jglers still don't come to snowball even more. I feel OCE jglers cannot prioritse their priorities. If a jgler actually camped say mid all game, thats a win. The mid laner will be too far behind to even come back. Like I said before.

For early game junglers like a shaco jg, if he hasn't ganked each lane at least twice (and cheesed all over the enemy jungler) before the laners hit lvl 6, he's either had his first camp 5 man invaded and you didn't help him and so you can go to hell; or he's not good at what he does.  However if I see an ammumu try to lvl2 gank a lane that isn't pushed hard with only 50% of his hp and mana, I cry. \nPersonally I find mid or bot the easiest lanes to gank first since top laners are good at dueling and are tanky (if they aren't tanky and are like riven or fiora, the first gank is 100% necessary, let the laner get first blood, as it generally guarantees the lane is won without further help). Lategame or at least junglers that don't have their spike till6 probably shouldn't try to heavy gank before lvl6 and just stick to counterganking or showing presence in hard pushed lanes.\nIf you are losing lane hard though, you have no right to call for a gank. If the jungler comes it's because he's ahead and he's giving you a charity and honestly he should just be working on map control in other lanes by taking towers before getting to you. if you are only a little behind though, you need to store up health and mana and YOU NEED to let the ENEMY PUSH by only hitting at the last moment so that you can both go in on that laner and properly 2v1 him rather than doing the lemming approach and going in 1by1 to die. \n\nGanks are a privilege and a strategic decision (though heavy ganking is often strategic), they are not your right as a laner and hard counterjungling (counterganks, killing the enemy jungler, forcing him to back and then taking his buffs) is as if not more important than ganking, because if the enemy jungler cannot gank then the few ganks your jungler makes are more gamechanging. As a laner it is your responsibility to win lane on your own. The junglers job is win the jungle, map & vision control and put more pressure on lanes than the enemy jungler. \n\nHe is not a babysitter, he is a global presence and camping a lane is not good. Doing a double gank, where you make a gank but don't invest, only to come back after taking 1 enemy jg camp and kill them is good though because nobody expects it; but don't camp a lane otherwise a good enemy jungler will make a bigger impact whilst the enemy is forced to play safe.\n\nAll that said; inexperienced junglers don't gank nearly enough since whilst it's a strategic decision, it should be quite common; just don't expect it in losing or pushed lanes and remember the jungle is basically like a lane as well but with less focus on farming and more on map control.\n\nOh and assistance pings and information like flash down are nice; but it's still up to the jungler as to whether he thinks the lane is gankable. If you are 0-7 against that top lane irelia or renekton I'm probably not coming to help even if I'm snowballing no matter how much you flame or spam ping.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-07-28T10:44:54.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I don't even main jg\" opinion = irrelevant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-07-28T05:48:22.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a filthy ap jungle corki player:\nfuck you","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-07-28T05:49:36.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou for your kind words.","replies":[]}]}]}
