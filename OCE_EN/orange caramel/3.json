Her being 27% off now doesn&#039;t mean I need to wait 1 year until she&#039;s 50% off, does it?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T10:07:18.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Star Guardian Janna, was released _relatively_ recently in terms of league.\nand it's on its early sale now.\n\nI would hazard a guess that it being on sale now does mean it likely wont be on sale again anytime in the near future. _(but I'm no expert on sales, so I could be wrong.)_\n\nPersonally I think its best to get what you can, while you can. \nits full price is roughly $10 right? 27% off makes it just over $7, thats only a difference of $2 from half price (50% off).\n\nEven if it does have another sale in a couple of months (which i think is unlikely), is it worth not having the skin for that long just for the sake of an extra $2?\n\n\nIf it was me, Id take the chance, and enjoy the skin now. If there is another sale soon, then you've lost $2, _(which is like 1 small can of coke)_. And if there isn't a sale, then you've bought the skin on a 27% sale already, and have been enjoying it this whole time.\n\nThats my 2 cents haha","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2017-03-26T11:53:55.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Money isn't an issue. There's just something that makes me feel good knowing I got all my skins for the cheapest amount possible. I haven't directly spent any money on my skins.
