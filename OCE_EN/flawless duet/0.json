I tried for the second time to buy items from the shop,\r\nI asked my friends for assistance because this was really weird, one (EatDinna) told me to just disconnect and reconnect to the game, I opened the main menu and went to do this but I couldn&#039;t click any options or buttons, I was like in the main hub of a game but couldn&#039;t do anything. \r\nIn the end, I had to restart my monitor and computer to get into the game, when I was reconnected my friends were losing by quite a bit, we managed to get close to winning but we lost. So know I have 20 minutes to play. I&#039;m not sure if it just me or other people are experiencing the weird bug. ~ Raaginglikehell &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-25T10:43:17.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds like a connection issue to me, however you should [repair your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6) just to be sure.\n\nHas this occurred since?","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-04-24T06:01:32.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sharing accounts now are we?
