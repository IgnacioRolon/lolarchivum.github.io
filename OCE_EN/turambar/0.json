Black cloak, black boots: the colour of choice for those who navigated the streets of Noxus after dark. Behind him, he heard the sound again - it was little more than the displacement of air but all sounds were significant in the small hours of the night. A door burst open and a drunk spilled onto the street. Light splashed over the stranger revealing details that the night had concealed: his boots were well-made, his cloak was plain but heavy. A rapier&rsquo;s scabbard poked below it. Wealth. Out of place in such a poor district. A sword alone would not normally be enough to deter the violent or ambitious but there was something about this man, a creeping aura of danger, that would dissuade all but the most foolhardy from waylaying him. The most foolhardy or the very drunk.\r\n\r\nThe drunk picked himself up and roared vulgarities back toward the open door before he noticed, suddenly, the man standing before him. He wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice cloak,&rdquo; he said, with a leering grin, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s such a cold night.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe dipped his head to get a look at the stranger&rsquo;s face but shadow obscured it. The drunk was a large man, fat around the middle but strong too, with thick arms. The stranger&rsquo;s sword did not scare him, nor the silence or hour of the night. After all, he had a sword of his own and, as drunks often do, he wagered he was better with his. In his mind he had caught a rich fool alone on the streets at night. He drew the sword he had been fingering and poked it in the direction of the stranger.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You deaf, tough man? The cloak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have i-&rdquo; The drunk&rsquo;s throat caught the word and refused to let it out.\r\n\r\nThere was only a single distinctive feature on the stranger&rsquo;s otherwise plain garments and it was on this that the drunk&rsquo;s eyes had finally alighted. A small clasp held the cloak together at the neck - a circular fan of daggers. The drunk shook the sword from his hand, like it might bite him. He turned and ran into the darkness.\r\n\r\nAs the stranger resumed his rapid walk, more sounds were added to the night: the heavy steps of the fleeing drunk that came to an abrupt halt, a barely perceptible ping of metal and springs from the same direction and then behind him, the soft movement of air again. The beating of wings? Each sound dripped with significance - having the perception to note them was the difference between life and death in Noxus. The strong climbed up - it was their way. It weeded out the weak but also meant that all must constantly guard against the ambition of others. In Noxus, it was the strongest who had the most enemies and this man had more than most.\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned into a long, narrowing street lined with unlit buildings that, after some distance, denied even the moonlight access. The soft flutter of wings shadowed him but this time the sound was followed by a whir and a thump. He passed into the dark, relying on memory and sureness of foot to keep him from stumbling. After a minute he finally slowed his pace, hugged the right side of the street and let his hand trail along the sides of the buildings. A right turn into a covered alley was followed by a left, down a flight of stairs to a door below street level. He quickly stepped through it.\r\n\r\nWith a noise like spitting oil, a small green flame appeared in the dark and moved across the room - a handspark - Zaunite hextech that could summon fire on demand. The flame was introduced to a wick and the dim light of a dirty lamp threw shadows around the room. The man removed his hood. His face was handsome but stern, his eyes intelligent and alert. A few greys streaked a full head of dark red hair. He was perhaps forty years old, but showing no signs that age had taken a toll on body or senses. The clasp of daggers was the sigil of his house, the final clue needed to identify him: Marcus Du Couteau.\r\n\r\nHe walked into the next room - also windowless - placed the lamp on a table and opened a cabinet built into the corner of the room. The lamp flickered irritably. With a knowing look at the darkness, Du Couteau turned his back on it and hung his cloak on a hook. The room was heavy with presence.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Was I followed?&rdquo; he asked of the shadows.\r\n\r\nA face melted out of them, everything save the eyes concealed by hood and mask. He tossed a lifeless bundle of black feathers on the table and pulled the mask down. He was young, a lot younger than might be assumed from his eyes alone - barely old enough to enlist, though it was obvious that he was no soldier.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You retain the Crow&rsquo;s interest, General.&rdquo; The assassin skirted the light out of habit and propped himself against a wall, barely visible in the gloom.\r\n\r\nDu Couteau was tall, with a straight posture - nobility, military. With the cloak removed, a gorget could be seen reaching up to cover his throat, finished in some kind of powered black to disguise its presence and keep the light from bouncing off it. Similar armour protected his chest and his forearms. In addition to the rapier, a parrying dagger sat on the small of his back.\r\n\r\nThe assassin also wore the colours of the night but there were few other similarities between the men. He wore no visible armour save for curious vambraces, finished in the same powdered black. His cloak was two tiered and attached to his clothing at the shoulders but had folds in such a way that unless he spread it to conceal himself, it ran down the middle of his back. The first tier reached just past his belt and ended in a dozen tips that hung with a weight that suggested metal had been sewn into them. Arms folded and shoulders slouched, with alert, resentful eyes, there was a roughness, a harshness to him that could only have been learned through hardship. This one had been raised by the streets.\r\n\r\nDu Couteau studied the dead bird - a raven of unnatural size. &ldquo;Lord Swain knows we keep something from him,&rdquo; he said.\r\n\r\nThe assassin bent to the ground, noticing some minute detail. A blade appeared in his hand, sprung from a hidden compartment and he scraped at the dust. &ldquo;I should just slit his throat.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Du Couteau answered immediately. &ldquo;Jericho Swain never likes to do himself what he can have others do for him. If his ravens seek answers then he does not know what we plan. That makes him more dangerous, not less.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDu Couteau picked up the lamp and turned back to the cabinet. He twisted a hook towards him and the back panel slid aside to reveal a passageway.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And Talon,&rdquo; Du Couteau paused at the entrance, &ldquo;he does not know about you. That gives us a rare advantage. Do not be seen.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon watched his master open the door at the other end of the passageway. Taller and wider than the entrance, the colossal figure of a Raedsel Guardsman blocked line of sight to the room beyond. But as he moved to allow Du Couteau past, Talon caught a glimpse of the man his master had gone to such great lengths to meet in secret: ruler of Noxus for hundreds of years but looking no older than thirty: Boram Darkwill, the Ever-Young, Grand General of Noxus. The door closed, plunging Talon back into complete darkness. He pushed the panel back until it clicked back into place. He pulled the mask to his face, swung himself noiselessly up to the attic and out the window he had entered.\r\n\r\nA thousand miles away, alone in a room at the Institute of War, Jericho Swain sat motionless, eyes fixed in front of him, unblinking. Hunched on his shoulder, its talons digging into his flesh, a raven mirrored his pose. Even larger than the warped bird from the Noxus slums, this was the alpha, the origin, the creature that had sired all in the Raven&rsquo;s unkindness. A row of eyes ran down each side of its head and each burned with intelligence, seeing things far away. On the high walls that surrounded Noxus, one of its progeny stared intently into the darkness below, searching. Jericho Swain saw with its eyes and heard with its ears. But he saw no movement and heard no sound. He closed his eyes, breaking the bond.\r\n\r\nIt was time to return to Noxus.","replies":[{"poster":"Turambar","date":"2016-07-15T04:21:35.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks mate, that's really encouraging to hear! Really want to write more of it and I actually have time on my hands at the moment (fortunately/unfortunately) so will hopefully find somewhere to get more of it out.\n\nAnd you're right - the idea is that this night is one part of a much bigger story but I'd definitely want to flesh Talon out. If you take just this passage (without knowledge of the rest of the lore), there's only small hints as to who Talon is, where he's come from, what drives him, etc. Because of the way that Riot does its storytelling/lore reveals, they suffer from the burden of pieces having to be instantly interesting and action packed, so plot and characterisation get turbocharged. My preference is to go a little slower - build those elements (especially characterisation) over time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T22:49:56.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So full of intrigue and mystery! I feel like I'm reading the first chapters of a good thriller novel :P Well paced throughout, but I wonder if, should you ever keep writing this particular story, you could put more of Talon's character into it to flesh out the story. But maybe this story isn't so much about him as it is about all of these characters. \nAnyway, canon or not, I really like this piece. Well done :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Turambar","date":"2016-07-01T18:12:48.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took my cue from the original Talon teaser that seemed to hint that Swain had a keen interest in finding out about Talon but took it back a step and assumed that the Blade would want his Shadow to remain, you know, in the shadows. As Talon served (serves?) the Du Couteaus, one of Noxus' most eminent families, it would make sense that Swain would want to keep tabs on his potential rivals.\n\nAnd yep, I know the IoW and the League isn't canon any more but it was always the part of the lore I thought was most compelling.","replies":[]}]}
