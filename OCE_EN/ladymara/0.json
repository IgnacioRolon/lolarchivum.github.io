When I join a normal queue I always get last pick since I take about 2-5 seconds to get into the lobby. \n\nBefore the patch everything ran fine, and my settings have been changed to lower ones incase it was that but I still get drops and bad load time.\n\nI have no clue what caused this, but I'm thinking something in the patch might not sit well with my computer or my league. I've had the same problem before and it solved itself over the next patch\n\nPlease help and tell me if any of you have had the same problem? Is there a fix for it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T04:15:10.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you tried repairing?\n\nYou can also try flushing your DNS, clearing your internet cache, defragging and turning off your firewalls/anti-virus.","replies":[]}]}
