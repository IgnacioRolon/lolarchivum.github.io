If it seems like Syndra goes between wanting absolute power and being human, it&#039;s because she is. It&#039;s a big deal (I think) to give up humanity to power. I am not sure, but I wrote it how I interpreted it all even though I feel like I left a lot to be desired in my writing style. I&#039;m pretty rusty I know my tenses need to be fixed (I think, it&#039;s why I need some advice ;A;)... I hope you enjoy! I wanted to leave it open ended so I could actually possibly expand on it in my Wattpad.\r\n\r\nThis story is for the competition A Touch of Void.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;I need more.&quot; Syndra stretched her fingers out to the sky, as far as they would go. A grim look flashed across her face as the enticing blue sky spread as far as she could see. &quot;This place can not offer me what I seek. Not anymore&quot; She dropped her arms and sighed. This land was her birthplace but Syndra now sought something more sinister in order to gain what she wanted. Syndra hasn&#039;t reached her full potential, not by a long shot. She looked down on Ionia from her temple with mild disgust. They were ants from up here, busying with their lives. Her temple had been in the sky for so long that nobody bothered about it anymore. The day she isolated herself was one filled with shock and horror to the villagers below, now it was just a story they tell people that pass through. \r\n\r\nSyndra shook her head slowly. Her mind felt like it had company inside, reading her thoughts and it made her feel violated. It was a new sensation, one she did not like. Syndra saw herself in his minds eye, in the future. She was powerful, and incredibly hungry. Her power had grown, but in the vision, she was not commanding how she used it. It was an infuriating thought, to be at a height of power and have no freedom.\r\n\r\nSyndra knew who was in there, showing her the tantalizing thoughts. The stories even reach her, mostly through her one trader. She flexed her hands out and spheres formed in them, pure dark magic threatening to explode if she applied too much power. &quot;Show yourself, Prophet.&quot; Her voice was mild, but angered. She scanned the area slowly, noticing the air shimmer by a rock. Syndra raised her ball above her head as a threat: come out or die.\r\n\r\nA foot appeared first, then a man looking abysmal in the eyes appeared all at once. The mask he adorned over his mouth was pulled down in an attempt to gain some favour. He grinned, but nothing about it was pleasant. &quot;You seek power?&quot; He asked, even though he knew the answer. He&#039;d been watching her for a while now, her power was great alone but where he came from could push her beyond her limits. Syndra lowered the ball and it began orbiting her, as her guardian from this unknown presence. She nodded and stepped toward him apprehensively. &quot;And you can offer it?&quot; Her brow raised, curious and cautious. &quot;I can offer a many a thing for you, Syndra.&quot; The answer was heavily avoidant, but she understood its meaning. The power came with a price. She didn&#039;t have anything to lose, and everything to gain.\r\n\r\nThe hooded man bowed his head, the sick smile still across his face. &quot;I am Malzahar. And I believe we are going to get to know each other well.&quot; Syndra felt as if she had made a bad deal, and a twisting feeling began in her stomach. She shoved it deep down with her regrets and human emotions. Her face remained stoic, with a hint of haughtiness. Maybe she could turn it in her advantage. &quot;When would you be ready to journey with me?&quot; Malzahar asked, raising his head. She couldn&#039;t make much of his motive with eyes so deep and lifeless. It left her feeling exposed. &quot;Now is fine.&quot; Malzahar nodded and raised his hand, making a waving motion. A purple and black portal opened, she couldn&#039;t see into it but she could make out noises. Some were screams, others sounded more like squishing. All were not pleasant. Malzahar stepped through and Syndra, as if on autopilot, followed. The portal itself reeked of decaying flesh but made her power pulsate through her. She walked through a thick mist and was on the other side, facing the prophet. He held something small, caressing it between his hands. His lips moved quick in a low whisper, talking to the tentacle he was holding. His expression darkened and she suddenly felt her stomach drop as the purple glowing tentacle stretched toward her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSyndra could not explain the sensation overcoming her. She was raised, and something hard and hot like iron pierced her belly. She reflected on the nights crying herself to sleep after the other villager children tortured her, simply for being different. Except this was not children that made her scream in agony. As soon as she had felt her feet raise away from the ground (and in a way she did not command) she was dropped back to the surface of wherever Malzahar had taken her. Syndra cursed and writhed on the floor, barely hearing Malzahar hover toward her. &quot;Surrender to it. The Void can give you power, let it do its work.&quot; Syndra was on a proverbial fence, if she gave herself to the Void there would be no turning back, no humanity to cling to. She knew she was powerful, but this promised more then she could hope for. In a moment of helplessness and pain, she stopped squirming and lie there. Syndra felt the Void power course through every fiber.It did not take long. Perhaps, she thought, Malzahar instructed the thing to hit her with a heavy amount to overcome her. The pain from her torso was gone, almost like someone had plugged it up. Suddenly, she had a pain again but it wasn&#039;t as intense. More like a dull gnawing at her belly. She held it tight, shaking her head. Syndra felt her headdress slip and listened to it clatter to the ground. She began to understand it was hunger biting at her. She now knew she was lured into a pocket of the Void, Malzahars personal pocket to infect her.\r\n\r\nSyndra stretched her fingers and attempted to make a ball of dark magic. She succeeded and swelled with insatiable desire to eat something. She released the orb and made two more to surround herself. Her feet lifted off the ground with just her sheer will. Malzahar looked with satisfaction at his recruit for the Void. It wouldn&#039;t be too long until all of Runeterra would fall to the Void. &quot;Now, I would like you to go consume something with this power you have. You will feel less hungry if you do.&quot; A lie through his teeth, for the hunger never ends. She did not know that yet, but she knew who she was compelled to feed to her new power. Ionia would be first, but before those annoying mortals she would visit someone she knew would challenge her humanity.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIn a temple dedicated to shadow methods, Zed overlooked his courtyard. His ninjas trained mercilessly, learning the way of Shadows. Zed turned away into his quarters, contemplating his journey so far. He was sure with this firepower, he could end Shen. If anything in his life were to be filled, it would be the pride in spiking Shens head on a pike. Zed wondered if maybe the day had come early, as he sensed an intruder in the temple. It was a sudden presence. Shen could teleport, maybe it was him.\r\n\r\n&quot;Master! There is a woman tearing through our ranks!&quot; A ninja informed his Master, and the information about the intruder made his brow furrow. A woman. &quot;Is it Akali?&quot;He sounded annoyed. When no words came, he looked at the ninja who shook his head. &quot;A mage from the Vo-&quot; The ninja was cut off by an aura of dark magic ripping him toward the courtyard. Zed heard a wicked laugh from where the ninja vanished to. He smelt blood, and dark power. Without a warning, a portal opened and out stepped Syndra, someone he considered an ally but that seemed to be a failing concept. She looked different. Her hair flowed in rich purple waves and her eyes seemed lifeless. \r\n\r\n&quot;What has happened to you?&quot; He asked, emotions mixed with anger and confusion. &quot;I got more power.&quot; She paused and placed a finger on her chin as if contemplating something. &quot;And, Zed, I am hungry.&quot; The orbs grew larger and more appeared in her hands. Her magic was tainted but powerful. Zed drew both blades, ready for a battle. Syndras power raised her off the masonry of the temple. &quot;I am so desperately hungry, and you look like a nice meal.&quot; She taunted him, thinking it an easy battle. &quot;I am no Void creatures food.&quot; He said coolly and could already tell where this was heading. Without hesitation, he leapt and she began hurling her magic missiles.","replies":[]}
