I would like some sort of ranked system for ARAM so I can get matched with decent players. I realise ARAM is all random but id say a majority of people have no clue how to play some champions. I can't say that I am the world best player but I do have a good understanding of all the champions. I think It would make ARAM better for everyone were good players can play other equally skilled players and bad players can also play against each other. Even if the ranking system is just a Match making rating and not official like summoners rift I think it would be a step in the right direction.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-14T04:38:49.432+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Even if the ranking system is just a Match making rating and not official like summoners rift I think it would be a step in the right direction.\n\nYou realise that ARAM *has* MMR, right?","replies":[{"poster":"thelost1","date":"2015-01-07T03:00:57.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How so ive played games with diamond and gold players next match I get 4 bronze there is no MMR, if there is, it is complete rubbish","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-07T03:02:37.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because ranked MMR has **no effect whatsoever** on MMR in other queues.

Now that I think of it like that, I quite like the idea. Two problems though;\n\n1. It would be arguably easier for people who have less champions (they would have to master less champions but would still have the same prowess).\n2. The champion pool is always changing (new champion releases, balance updates, reworks, bans, etc.)\n\nWith a bit of tweaking, it could work. For example, you could have different modes of ranked ARAM, and each mode has a preset of twenty or so champions that everyone can choose from. That way, no one would have the advantage of less champions, and it would be *feasible* to be decent at them all.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
