I was demoted from S1 after losing a 3v5. An afk Twitch and A soraka with no mouse. Was hoping for some genuine information as to how I can be fairly demoted after a game like that? Can Riot seriously expect anyone to win a 3v5 and then have reasonable grounds to demote them for losing? C&#039;mon Riot, you need to pay more attention to the real issues.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-07-20T05:05:01.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot probably isn't gonna do anything about it because the chances of the game going 3 v 5 is pretty low and fyi a 3 v 5 is winnable (I've done it before). But to be fair to you I really think riot should implement some sort of system where if the game was not fair and  you lost the game,  less lp would be deducted and if you are on the verge of being demoted then you won't get demoted but you'll earn less lp if you get promoted to the next tier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-18T03:10:57.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not fair and Riot don't care. You are low rank, i have been pushing this shit for ages, Riot need to start looking at more than just the top % of players and realise how bad it is down here.\n\nIf we had all the stats I could almost guarantee you that games at the bottom end would have, based on % PER GAME: More AFK, a higher KDA differential per team, higher stats differential per team, just everything will be more lopsided down here.\n\nRiot need to realise that by changing how the game matches at the top end only makes it worse at the bottom end and look into it properly.","replies":[]}]}
