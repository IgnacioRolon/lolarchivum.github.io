Joined a ranked game. Lost LP. Now stuck in 'repairing client' which claims there is 4 gig to download and I'm downloading it at a speed of 150kb/s after it starts at 3mb/s. Download remaining is simply not moving at all, even when it's downloading fast. ETA 600 minutes. Thanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2018-03-21T11:14:50.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep exactly.\n\nIn my case this is caused by I tried to reinstall using the Installer from 2017.\nThe solution is to uninstall, and get the current 2018 installer.\n\nHope it fixes your issue.\n\nAbout the lost LP..
