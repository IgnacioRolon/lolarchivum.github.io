Maybe we could get it going a bit faster.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-01-29T13:13:24.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows 7 Ultimate SP 1\nIntel R Core TM i5-3317U CPU @ 1.7GHz 1.7 GHz\n4.00GB RAM\n64-bit OS\n\nHow can I view my graphics card?","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-01-29T16:35:56.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I increase my FPS from 25 FPS to 120 FPS, it is far better now.

It's mostly down to your graphics card.

It still lags, especially if they have champions with high-graphics spells such as Lux or Reksai tunnels.\nIn addition, what I do right now is turning off LolClient.exe in game. The ingame program is League of Legends.exe. For some unknown reason, LolClient.exe eats 500kb memory in game.\n\nI have cleaned my registry and currently defragmenting.\nI will keep you updated, hopefully this works.\n\nNote: If its about teamfight with all the booms and bangs, I usually give it up, since I lag completely I cant even use Zhonya despite spam-click my number 4.
