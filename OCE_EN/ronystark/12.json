Mastering one or a few champs is better than having numerous champion pools\n2. Mastering a role with your mastered champs is even better\n3. Learn your mastered champion mechanics and limitation\n4. Learn how your mastered champion can win against various opponent\n5. Learn your combo right to deliver optimal result\n6. Focus on csing\n7. Focus on objective, dont chase kills\n8. Do wards\n9. If you are against your counter, or in losing state, build tanky items, play safer\n10. Keep checking minimaps (in my case: optimally every 5 seconds)\n11. Do ping to warn your teammates of any danger that you know from checking minimaps\n12. Do not duel without any valid reason. No pride or bravado is not a valid reason. Keep focus on csing.\n13. If you are laning, do not engage if you dont know where the enemy jungler is\n14. Go engage if your jungler is close\n15. Think about your escape plan before you engage (ie: wait for a few seconds to have your ignite and flash on after cd)\n16. Do make a plan of what to do before you start any action (plan on how to engage, how to escape)\n17. Learn about rotating\n18. Use /mute against anyone in game who do verbal abuse\n19. Learn from mistakes. Do watch your own replay especially the part that causes you to die so you know how to get better next time.\n20. Check your internet ping before playing (open &#039;cmd&#039; and run &#039;ping google.com&#039;)\n\nFrom mental/psychological point of view:\n1. Only think about how you can get better and play the best to win your team (assume you are playing against a bunch of LoL total newbies)\n2. Do not think about your opponents rank (whether higher or lower than yours)\n3. Do not play if you are not in your best state. This is pretty similar to drink driving\n4. Be confident, not overconfident. Be respectful, never disrespectful\n5. Do not check your opponents rank before the game starts / during the game\n6. Do check your own teammates to avoid any intentional feeders, unrankeds and stuff. If there is one in your team, dodge.\n\nUnranked = someone who is totally new to the game, who does not have any rank in previous seasons.\nPoints are sorted randomly\n\nI just realised the mental-points yesterday.\nDoing these alone, I do feel I play better and managed to win 5 games in a row lately.\n\nI am currently just a silver aiming to be gold, so my knowledge might be limited to silver understanding.\nI still have a lot to learn.\nFeel free to add more if you have new / better tips\nor if you want to know more, feel free to ask.\n\nTo forum staff: This thread might not fit into GD category, so please move this to the correct category. Thank you and sorry for the trouble.","replies":[]}
