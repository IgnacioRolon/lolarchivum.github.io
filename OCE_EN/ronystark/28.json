(referring to Nightblue3 Bronze to Diamond in 3 weeks)\n> Is it purely luck?\n> I do not want to play the game just for the sake of doing it.\n> Is there something that I should know about this game? Something more for me to improve??\n\n&quot;This game is unfair&quot;, &quot;there is no such thing as justice&quot; are the things that make me think about this.\nAnd then I find out that this game is basically a life simulation.\n\nHere are some points:\n\n**The elo reflects the people in life.**\nThere are some people who are bronze elo in life, on the other hand, there are those diamonds who no matter what happens will always be on the top of the food chain.\nImagine the kind of people that is easy to complain, too lazy to learn, always demand people to be perfect.\nI do not think the people who do this in real life can ever reach the top.\nSimilar to this game.\n\nThere are also things about **teamwork**.\nThose who do not ping is similar to the ignorant people.\nThose who do not ward is similar to people who do not want to sacrifice something to reach the higher goal\nThose who do not want to learn is similar to people who .. well.. stuck at the people imagined above.\n\nI do not want to be bronze elo either in this game nor in life.\n**I want to learn. I want to be better.**\n\nFrom that point, **I stop complaining, stop raging, stop demanding people, start learning from others**, start pinging, start warding, taking it easy in game, even laughing at the Defeat sign, and many more. It becomes my habit eventually.\nWithout realising it, I start to do the text displayed in bold above in real life as well.\nAnd hey, the Victory sign just keeps appearing.\n\nThe things that I learn in this game are so easily applicable in my life.\nThis game helps me to be a better person.\n\nI pity those who have quitted, since they miss the essence of this game.\nBut for you who want to quit, think about this.\n\n> Do you want to stay at Bronze elo in your real life too?\n> or do you prefer to start as a better person, to be the-better-you either in the game or in life?\n\nIf you do not want to stay in bronze elo, you better start changing your perspective, be humble, start accepting the fact that you need to learn, and start learning of course.\n\nI am no smart guy when it comes to talking smoothly (also rip grammar maybe :kappa:), but I hope you get what I mean here.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nNote:\nMy door is always open, you can always add me in game if you want to ask anything about this game or my experience.","replies":[]}
