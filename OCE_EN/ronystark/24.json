As stupid as it sounds, it does happen.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea on how to prevent yourself from getting overexcited?\r\nOr the other way around if losing (to prevent yourself from getting desperate to win) ?\r\n\r\nSince I think this issue can be related to real life as well, I am looking forward to any positive solution for this.\r\n\r\nPlease advise\r\nThank you","replies":[]}
