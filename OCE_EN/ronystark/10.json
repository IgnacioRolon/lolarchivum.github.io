My ping is at 20ms.\r\nBut suddenly the ping goes haywire between 400-1200ms.\r\n\r\nI dont think this is because someone is torrenting in my house.\r\nIf it is because of torrents, the lag ping will be stable, usually around 800ms.\r\nBut not in this case.\r\n\r\nI am in Sydney\r\nUsing Windows 7\r\nLag happens around 11pm to 1am.\r\n\r\nAm I the only one experiencing this?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-07-24T05:17:44.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey RonyStark,\n\nCan you try the solutions provided in the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) Riot Games Support article?","replies":[]}]}
