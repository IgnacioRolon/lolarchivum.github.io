It doesnt matter if I am at bronze silver or gold, this happens.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of learning to be better (get good), what should I do in this kind of situation?\r\nAny positive encouraging idea to deal with this situation will be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-14T09:53:03.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aaand it happened again just now. winning top lane 3/0 but mid feeding ahri 10/0.. and our mid is annie.\nOP","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-14T14:38:36.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahri generally dunks on Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-14T14:39:33.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you can do is share knowledge.\n\nI mean really you don't think their team has the same ideologie of a top laner losing 0-4?\n\nBot lane is often more important.\n\nTry taking teleport though, it can make it easier to impact the game from top lane although it's not a definite.\n\nEasier to port than roam and you can roam and then port top etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-14T01:27:02.821+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"git gud","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-14T03:42:07.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"real mature reply by Bronze-4 Genisys here\n*standing applause*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-08-14T14:12:30.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You suck up to them reaaaaaaaaaaaaally good when they do one thing right.\nyou like worship them.\n\n\nmakes them wanna do better.
