Cheating bans are pretty much always automated, since they detect a non-standard client or script being used etc rather than the fallibility of a human looking at what *might* be scripting or just some mad predictions, some are of course more obvious than others.\n\nThat said, the automated systems are constantly monitored, and the people behind them have access to all the info they collect so they can make their own separate judgement if they feel it's necessary.\n\nIt's also worth noting that cheating bans are handed out in waves to help maintain the ambiguity of the detection software (if they don't know what/how it is detected they can't try to dodge it) so it may be a little before someone actually gets banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-09T17:51:06.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what would be an example of harmless just like a different ui or custom skins","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-10T04:51:09.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally speaking yes, although Riot was talking about making all custom skins disallowed mid this year (I'm unsure if the change has gone through or not but I wouldn't risk it) because there was too much ambiguity there.\n\nA better example of something harmless would be the various programs that show summoner stats in the loading screen. Since they use only the Riot API and information easily attainable by going to any number of places like op.gg that uses the same, there's no problem with them. It is a convenience rather than an advantage.\n\nOf course, bear in mind that any program that CAN do something harmful, whether you are aware of or using that feature or not will get your account banned, so any third party program is a use at your own risk scenario.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
