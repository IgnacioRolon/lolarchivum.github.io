This is like when people said \"Yone\" was coming from the Project teaser.

Dhama drew a lot of attention because it had polished art and was generally a very fleshed out and cool concept, that said the base idea of Yin and Yang has many possibilities but is hardly in and of itself an inspired original idea. It's everywhere and used in many many things. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Dhama concept, but saying Riot should give credit to Dhama because....they share the yin yang theme? Because it's a two in one kind of champion? That's stretching don't you think?\n\nDhama was a great concept, and I'm sure some of the people who designed Kindred may well have seen it, doesn't mean they stole it, even if you ignore all the legal jibber jabber. That's like saying Jinx stole Harley Quinn's design. Just cause they're similar, and have been inspired by the same roots, in fact I'm fair sure Jinx took direct influence from Harley Quinn, but it still doesn't mean they stole the idea....","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-09-24T05:53:19.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Spawn Man,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=vn9trPEw,comment-id=0004000000000000,timestamp=2015-09-24T00:33:19.548+0000)\n>\n> How is it stupid?

In what way did they change Kindred to be like DhaMa? If you look at the sketches, Kindred is clearly Lamb and Wolf in earlier concepts. Just look at them http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/champion-preview/champion-insights-kindred-eternal-hunters and then look back at DhaMa concept. He should be given credit?
