What&#039;s happened to them, I do not know, but I just wanted to check I wasn&#039;t the only one.\r\n\r\nThe champion which sticks out in my mind the most is Katarina. Maybe it was just because I was a Bronzie, but since I moved to Silver, I&#039;ve played maybe one game with Katarina out of hundreds. It used to be Kat mid going 30/2 every game, and to see her completely absent is just&hellip; strange.\r\n\r\nOthers include Fiddlesticks, Heimerdinger, Kalista, Wu Kong, Zilean and Shyvana. I used to see these champions plenty, and I think I&#039;ve seen them combined under 30 times out of hundreds of games. Is it a power balance thing? Or are they just used by newer players? Or were they nerfed and I just never noticed?\r\n\r\nOr I could be seeing things which don&#039;t exist. Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-12-12T06:41:39.438+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina is a very polarized champion. She either gets fed, and deletes your teammates in seconds, or she does nothing and is irrelevant for the whole game. That's why she's mostly played in bronze, because the level of play (generally) in bronze allows for you to sweep teams for tons of kills. LeBlanc is a better assassin at higher tiers because of her relatively low level of counterplay, requiring specific counters or VERY precise mechanical skill to ouplay.\n\nFiddle shows up now and again as a dark horse, but in general is bad due to the amount of CC removal/hard CC in team comps, with champs like alistar being able to knock you out of your drain and keep their squishies alive, plus the amount of healing hate.\n\nHeimerdinger is a very good pick still, but mostly for low elo. He's also very polarized and won't do anything if it comes down to a farm lane, and once you know what his kit does, you avoid taking a billion damage from the big tower and instead kill it in two hits and make him waste his ultimate.\n\nKalista is still very heavily played, but she relies on a good team more than any other ADC. A good vayne can carry a bad team through proper kiting and positioning, a good kalista cannot as half her kit requires a support to work with her to achieve it.\n\nWu kong is still played, but with a lot of bruiser items falling out of favor, and attack speed/crit champs being king in the current chain of patches, he doesn't bring much to the table that a tanky Garen or Darius wouldn't.\n\nZilean is just not good. Unless you can utilize a good ultimate on a good carry, and buff/support your team right, he's not a very good support. He relies far too heavily on team mates to become a solid champion. If your team is goo, you will win with him. If not, you will lose.\n\nShyvana falls into another attackspeed/tanky champion, just like Jax or Vi, but doesn't bring anywhere near enough raw damage or survivability in her kit. Her survivability is ALL in her items, and her damage is as well. Build her devourer, and you'll notice you die a lot in the early game. Build her Warrior/tank, and you'll notice you just don't put out enough damage mid-late game. A better choice would be Jax, Devourer Vi or Tank/Devourer Yi, all of these can be built either hybrid AD/AP with Guinsoo's, Gunblade and sated, or simply Sated/BORK/Black Cleaver and tank and outperform shyvana at all stages. I think that shyvana could do with an armor and HP buff while in dragon form, like Gnar, but that might be a tad too OP.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-12T17:58:02.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers all! Answered my questions. Maybe it's just me in regards to Kalista - I swear I've not seen her played in forever.

(he currently has a buff on the PBE and the AP jungle item is being changed so he might come back)\nShyvana went out when Bork and Devourer got nerfed. She still good, but just no longer \"OP\"\n\nPersonally I never saw much Zilean, Heimer or Wukong. A Heimer and Wu here and there but not really that often.\n\nKalista is still played and still strong, but with the mass changes to ADCs people are just testing and finding the \"strongest\".\n\nI was thinking the same thing about Katarina. She used to be a permaban back when I was Silver. I guess it was a combination of a \"tank meta\" as well as an increase in the cost of AP items. Kat hates tanks so the when most teams have 2 and sometimes 3 tanks, she gets easily shutdown.\n\nMight see her come back now with the new item {{item:1082}} and new Assassin Mastery","replies":[]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-15T19:30:15.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"schizophrenia","replies":[]},{"poster":"Donald Dunk","date":"2015-12-11T17:56:31.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tons of champs go in and out of being FotM after every patch, no changes there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-11T14:18:41.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Katarina kinda goes in and out of meta with patches quite often, so it's not necessarily that it's changed in a higher ranking.\n\nFiddlesticks has never really been that big of a champ since early season 5 late season 4.\n\nHeimerdinger isn't even that played, and as you climb, people slowly start to work out what to do against him.\n\nKalista went from being Tier 1, to about Tier 3 currently.\n\nWukong is in a decent amount of games, recently i think the meta shift in top and jungle kinda pushed him slightly out of meta, as well as thunderlords decree being something that somewhat counters him.\n\nZilean hasn't been meta for months.\n\nShyvana was only really meta while Devourer was super strong, and with Crit being better then AS in general atm, she has fallen out.","replies":[]}]}
