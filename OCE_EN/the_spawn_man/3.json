I thought I&#039;d check in on a couple, the first being Nasus.\r\n\r\nBefore him build was perfect. I&#039;d go {{item:3025}} &gt; {{item:3110}} &gt; {{item:3065}} for 40% CDR and decent stats, then into whatever else was needed, like {{item:3026}} or {{item:3083}}.\r\n\r\nNow, with gauntlet giving 20% CDR, I&#039;m not too sure if I keep building it that way (I just love SV and FH on Nasus, so getting rid of them is not an option) or exchange gauntlet for something else? I&#039;ve been toying with the idea of {{item:3812}}. Lifesteal, 10% CDR to bring total back up to 40%, and damage taken is slowly bled, allowing you to engage in prolonged fights with your Q.\r\n\r\nBut then I&#039;d miss out on the awesome Spellblade ability of {{item:3025}}. I mean, the slow can easily be replaced by {{item:3022}}, but not the Spellblade. I don&#039;t really want to go {{item:3078}} as it leaves Nasus too little defence, and costs too much.\r\n\r\nSo basically, how do you build Nasus? Just a balanced build. Full tank I go {{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3083}} and {{item:3102}} or {{item:3026}}. Full damage/lifesteal fun, I go {{item:3065}} {{item:3110}} then as much life steal I can get like {{item:3153}} {{item:3072}} etc.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been cleaning up either way. Pretty much once I get 200 stacks and my SV and FH, I&#039;m good to snowball. But for argument&#039;s sake, I&#039;d like to know for a run of the mill, balanced build, what would you suggest? Bite the bullet and let there be some unused CDR? Or something else?\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\n\r\nP.S. A question I&#039;ve always wanted to know&hellip; do enemies killed by Frozen Gauntlet&#039;s spell blade passive (AoE damage) add to Nasus&#039; stacks?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-01T00:24:18.056+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can just trade trinity for frozen and still get your 40%... and you can get the mastery for 45% too..\n\nTrinity had its health stats buffed a little, so it is still a little tankier\n\n+ trinity makes you do a tonne more damage, trinity does like 40% of his damage on q till around 702 stacks","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-01T09:07:54.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm, yeah forgot the Tri Force got a bit tankier. But it's still pretty expensive, and is a crit build on Nasus even viable? Wouldn't Death's Dance be better (from the CDR options I'm looking at)? Bleeds damage, life steal, ad, and also CDR.\n\nI'm thinking of getting rid of Frozen Gauntlet as an option all together. It's funny, the CDR increase kinda messed everything up lol! If my team doesn't have CC and I'm going a balanced build, I could always get Frozen Mallet for some slow.\n\nSo now for a balanced build I'm thinking {{item:3110}} > {{item:3065}}  > {{item:3078}} OR {{item:3812}} (whichever I'm convinced after I do some research is better) > {{item:3742}} OR {{item:3022}} > either more health, lifesteal, or GA.","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T18:25:29.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"deaths dance needs a 5 damage increase its weak as shit i ran these numbers that item is fucking garbage at 65.\n\ndeadmans plate would be good if u were playing at 3k+ vs evenly skilled opponents in a ranked 5 where you have your 4 teammates on either side of you literally within 10metres distance, online etc i wouldnt fucking bother it makes a huge difference. rushed frozen heart is what \"you\" should get. like first item.\n\nspirit visage is completely situational you need team of heals or like a jungler babysitting u with smite/heal. \n\nor like a nidalee etc, dual tri lane map breakdowns i aint going through that here. \n\ntrinities shit, ok for carrys not playing standard 1-1-1-2 lane meta ie from a solo lane etc\n\nfrozen mallets only good in combination with clawgauntlet or a couple of other stacks. never a one off purchase... do you guys even.. goldfish. attention spans of goldfish. you know cannabis cures ADD right?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T18:31:39.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"warmogs is only good if uve calced it right as your only hp item that gets you over 3k. or a couple of extreme cases where ur monstrously fed and it doesnt fucking matter so much WHAT you buy.","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T18:32:36.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ga too is never ever an item you have in your head like \"yeah im gonna build ga this game\". its purely a spot purchase. must be picked. real time situational dynamic strategy etc etc BLAHBLAHBLHBA","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T18:35:32.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a great item for allof space and moba time has been merc equivalent. debuff and now in lol variant it has lifesteal.. come on.. just look at those components. good on any hero. maybe not so much for nasus.... but still\n\nmaw & ssupgrade is bullshit broken combo right now\n\nblood is as blood does. botrk hero variant. could build on nasus but sheen better tower destroyer and ur not a split pusher ur an tp ghost/homegaurd into middle of 9 brawling chaotic forces FSUing (fucking shit up) kicking ass and taking names! chaos & destruction .. from nothing to everything in one sequence. great character identity\n\nbanshees because you want to be a swag %%%% with a necklace go get laid neckbears","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-01-01T02:19:41.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3025}} +{{item:3065}} +10% cdr from runes is the best base imo.
