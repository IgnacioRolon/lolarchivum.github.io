Riot Please Respond!","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I finally got two days off work after 2 weeks straight, and I sit down to play some LoL. Loads up (first time too after a rough patch of not being able to load the launcher over a period of a few months). There&#039;s an update? Oh well, I don&#039;t mind waiting a few minutes for my weekend wind down. I&#039;m sure Riot is making the game better and more enjoyable for all! :D\n\nAfter a few minutes I start it up, and get ready to try out my new Blitz AP Jungler build. I get into game and&hellip; 01 Frames Per Second. Huh? Oh well this happens at the start of every game. It&#039;ll pick up any second. *30 seconds later* Hmm, still hovering around 11 fps. Maybe I&#039;m lagging? Nope?\n\nLong story short, ff at 20 and an angry team. I changed no settings, nothing on my computer&hellip; OTHER than downloading the 5.9 patch. I go from running good quality settings for everything and running at around 60 fps, to the same and only being able to run 01-11 fps. Absolutely unplayable. Even dropping to default settings then low quality for all settings, it only picked up slightly to around 20-30 fps. Even in the tutorial mode the problem persisted.\n\nI&#039;m going to try and troubleshoot the problem and will report if anything works back here. Hopefully someone here knows wtf is going on (Riot please! I play this game every single day, please I just want to relax this weekend).\n\nIs anyone else having this issue? I&#039;ve read it&#039;s happened before on boards in previous patches. Please help! :..(\n\nUPDATE:\n\nIt's all fixed now. I repaired the game via launch screen, which seemed the most logical thing to do, and retarted my computer. It's now running at a full 60fps. If you're having similar issues, I'd start here.","replies":[{"poster":"divingteam","date":"2015-05-24T15:32:32.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patch 5.9 i have had stuttering and freezing in game and have spoken to others with the same issue.

Best to just get this solution out the way before diving really deep into it.\n\nFor future reference, OS means Operating System, which is the underlying software which allows you to run programs on your computer. Anything from Apple uses their proprietary iOS, so just saying \"Apple\" would do in most cases.\n\nHave you reset your computer? Another common solution to get out the way, especially if you're a person who makes use of hibernate.\n\nAre you experiencing issues with any other games/applications on your system?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Zexion","date":"2015-06-01T14:01:05.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been having FPS problems for a while now, I usually run around 200-300 FPS but randomly when I go to last hit, trade, fight, ward or even moves it drops down to 30 and freezes for like half a second while my ping is unaffected. I have tried changing all the settings, windowed, borderless and full screened, turned to sound off and on and even re-installed multiple times. It is starting to become a big issue where I have lost game winning fights just coz I got locked up for a second. {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Reach","date":"2015-05-17T19:15:26.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experiencing this problem ever since this morning now, makes it challenging to play properly ;-;.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T13:59:44.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What happens if you disable your sound?
