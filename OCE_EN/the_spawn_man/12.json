I was immediately drawn to play it on my Thresh, who especially late game, benefits from loads of extra armour and MR. But I tried it out just now in game and it was very disappointing. Here's my build and I'll see what you guys thinkâ€¦\r\n\r\nCurrent Final Build Items: {{item:3069}} {{item:2045}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3102}} \r\n\r\nRunes/Masteries: Tanky masteries, with speed and some mana regen, and some cooldown. Flat/Scaling armour Marks/Seals + Scaling HP Glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that I am a speedy Thresh, able to get in, gank, ward, get out quickly, and become a late game tank/beast. It runs pretty well, and I'm able to carry as supp most games.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the {{item:3512}} would be coming in to probably replace {{item:3068}}. Both have pros and cons for me. Sunfire cape is slightly cheaper, and its passive burn is great when  \"playing\" with enemies in my box. The health isn't really needed. The Portal on the other hand is great as it gives both MR and Ar. But the active is useless imho! You place it and you get a suckier version of a minion that sorta does a tiny portion of damage to creeps. However, they evaporate very quickly, so hardly ever reach anything, forcing you to place the portal very close to the tower/objective, which inevitably leads to the portal being killed.\r\n\r\nSo, am I missing something? What are the tactics with this thing? On one hand I'm like \"Well, it gives better armour, MR and one okay passive, and one I can more or less ignore\" but on the other hand, is the burn damage from SF Cape worth it? It's a toss up. I'm leaning towards the Portal for its defence, even if the active is strangely underwhelming, but should I stick with the cape?\r\n\r\nThoughts? Or experiences with the Portal? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-28T02:06:24.953+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Spawn Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=VB2x60eA,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-25T01:37:36.930+0000)\n>\n> The health isn't really needed.\n\nHealth is hands down the best defensive stat, as armor and magic resist stack they slowly become less effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-26T15:39:22.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL i did but ali twice my bad ahaha AND voli/rammus.\n\nThe second list was for non-meta/rarely used for split pushing. \n\n* Unless your going AD Malph, he doesnt do a lot of damage to towers. That and he has more of a teamfight presence than a splitpushing one as you mentioned.\n* I know rammus' R does damage to towers and is on a relatively low cooldown, however he doesnt have the greatest minion clear which results in him using his R to clear minions quickly (Unless he has a Sunfire Cape). By the time he gets to the tower he has already used his Ult. Another thing is the synergy with Rammus' kit, he gains AD based on armour and ZZ gives armour and AFK split push while he has impact in teamfights as a tank/peeler.\n* Gnar and Voli also have a greater teamfight presence than a splitpushing one. Which is why they are on the list as SPLITPUSHERS.\n*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-25T10:49:13.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason for it is specifically for Full Tanks with no Split pushing capabilities. \nEg.{{champion:36}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:54}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:20}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:106}} \nAnd to some extent {{champion:12}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:154}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:77}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:102}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:12}}","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-26T07:34:37.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"voli rips towers apart...so does gnar....and malphite clears waves like a god but it better at teamfights....rammus ult rips towers apart and is on a low enough CD you can use it, and then back and use it in the next fight anyway.\n\nthen you reuse some of the same in the 2nd list...and alistar is in that list TWICE...lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheUrinalWind","date":"2015-01-25T04:40:27.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing as lee and someone had placed a portal under a tower.
