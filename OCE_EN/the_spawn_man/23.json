Wondering if anyone would know&hellip; this whole Pool Party thing, it&#039;s very unclear. You&#039;re supposed to get 5 points for winning a 5 man premade game on LoL. I&#039;ve done this several times now, on Norms and Aram, and neither time has an announcement popped up or anything. Nobody in the &#039;Pool Party&#039; chatroom seems to know, and I can&#039;t find anywhere that says what notification - if any - you&#039;re supposed to get, or where you can see your own personal points. Heck, even the global point tracker is still not functioning.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? Would be keen to know so I don&#039;t miss out, and can also help the many others who are asking the same questions.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-17T04:29:28.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, there's no individual point tracker planned on being released.
