I&#039;d say he was a new jungler/assassain, but he&#039;s not extremely meta. I am not very versed in percentages etc (such as hp/ad/mr etc gained per level) so I&#039;ll leave that part out for now (if I do use them, they will be very approximate), but will give a general overview of how he&#039;s meant to play.\n\n(TLDR; Sneaky chameleon jungler that uses flies and his tongue to ambush enemies, and can also mimic other champions and monsters)\n\nSo, introducing&hellip;\n\n**Snik, Jungle Shifter!**\n\n**Overview:** Snik is based on a chameleon, and his abilities reflect this fact greatly. He relies more on deception, surprise and sneak attacks to overcome enemies. His greatest role would be as a jungler, but  His abilities make him an effective counter-jungler and escape artist, with ranged poke. In team fights he in an initiator and assassain, designed to disrupt enemy carries and harass flanks. He trades ability for durability (in terms of using flies or eating/saving them), so must choose when to fight, and make the times when he does count.\n\n**Stats:** I imagine that Snik would have low health and resistance, but that would partly improve when not using abilities (see passive and skills later). His movement speed would be decent, in addition to attack speed, but that his attack damage would only be in the lower range. Snik&#039;s abilities would use mana, and I believe the mana pool would be around average. (Again, I&#039;m not versed in exact percentages and numbers and such, so if anyone would like to help out with this section, let me know).\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n**Passive - Chameleon Digestion.** Snik gains 1 _Fly Point_ every 12/10/8 seconds, and on every enemy champion kill or assist, or Large or Epic monster kill. Snik can have a maximum number of 5 _Flies_ at any one time\n\nFor each _Fly Point_ Snik has, Snik gains +50 Health, and +??? Health Regen. When Snik is at maximum _Fly Points_, his movement speed is increased by +???%.\n\n**Q Ability - Tongue Strike.** Cooldown 10/9/8/7/6. Range Around 1000. Scales with AP. Skill shot with narrow hit box. Snik fires his tongue out in a straight line, damaging and slowing the first enemy it hits.\n\nIf Snik holds down the ability for a 1.8 second wind up, it will instead hook and pull the first enemy it hits towards Snik, as well as dealing damage and slowing their movement.\n\n**W Ability - Fly Bombs. ** Cooldown 7/6/5/4.5/4. Scales with AP. Skill shot with AoE bomb blast. Snik consumes one _Fly Point_ to throw a fly bomb in a given direction. It deals AoE damage, and gives vision of effected enemies for 2.5/3.5/4.5 seconds.\n\nIf Snik has no _Fly Points_, he can still use this ability, but it no longer grants vision and deals less damage.\n\n**E Ability - Hover/Buzz** Off! Cooldown 27/24/21/18/15. Self targetting ability. Snik consumes one _Fly Point_ to launch into the air and hover, using his collected flies as makeshift &#039;wings&#039; (he makes a cool buzzing sound while he&#039;s flying). While in this state he can&#039;t be targetted, slowed or disrupted, and can be &#039;steered&#039; through the air for the duration (1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds), including over other units and terrain.\n\nIf Snik has no _Fly Points_, he cannot use this ability.\n\n**R Ability - Camouflage.** Cooldown 120/100/80. Targetting ability. Snik tranforms into targetted unit, literally camouflaging himself as that unit for the abilty&#039;s duration. At Rank 1, he can transform into target enemy/allied minion and lesser jungle monster. At Rank 2, he can transform into target greater jungle monster. And at Rank 3, he can transform into another target champion, allied or enemy. The ability lasts for 5/8/12 seconds, after which, Snik is revealed. During the camouflaged state, Snik moves and acts like the unit he has copied.\n\nWhile Snik is transformed, he gains +???% of the targetted unit&#039;s health and resistance, that decays over the duration of his transformation. Snik can activate other abilties while transformed, but loses his camouflage once he deploys them. If Snik takes damage that would deplete the bonus health and resistance gained from his target completely, then he is revealed.\n\n**Thoughts:** I think Snik could be a great champion that rewards strategy over simply skill usage, and with a high skill ceiling. Sniks usage of flies would be interesting, and players would need to decide whether to trade off the passive health and regeneration they give with their usage of Snik&#039;s W and E abilities. Their ratios and acquirement rate could be tweaked to make for more or less of a trade off depending how he performs.\n\nSnik&#039;s Tongue strike could be used for ranged poke when not charged, and an initiator tool when charged. I imagine it would be harder to hit than a Blitz hook, but with slightly more range and with a cheaper cooldown to allow for usage as a damage dealing ability for use in jungle.\n\nWith his hover ability, Snik would be able to avoid enemy ultimates or make quick escapes inside the jungle over terrain. It would be vital when ganking/ambushing tankier opponents that you couldn&#039;t burst down with a quick Q and/or E fly bomb, to keep one _Fly Point_ to make that quick dash away, and really plays to Snik&#039;s poke and retreat tactics. The ability to become untargettable/slowed could also lend itself to playing Snik in lane, much like Vlad&#039;s W, where he is able to avoid ganks and getting could in waves of minions. Plus who doesn&#039;t like a chameleon dude flying around holding onto buzzing flies?\n\nHis ultimate could be used to initiate ganks, to counter jungle and as a quick get away if in a group of say minions, as well as being pretty cool (the duplicating another champion effect was recently used on Trickster&#039;s Glass in Bilgewater. It was a crowd favourite, but the abilty wasn&#039;t really viable for mass usage. On one champion however, it might be more viable). The percentage of health/resistance given as well could require team work. For example, if you camouflaged yourself as an allied tank, you&#039;d need to communicate with them for an effective gank/escape. Transforming yourself as an enemy champion would be harder since they would probably be in sight range, but could require usage of the jungle bushes to copy them and then surprise their allies.\n\nAnyway, that&#039;s the champion I thought up. Again, obviously not finished in terms of specific ratios and per level numbers, but the overall abilities and feel is all there.\n\nEDITS:\n\n2/9/2015 - Lowered E ability duration.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-02T03:09:35.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a pretty cool concept, but his kit looks more like a support-ish jungler than an assassin. Also that E duration is way too long, and I'm assuming you can't attack mid E?","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-02T03:44:16.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the thoughts. Yeah as I said, he's not really 'meta'. He's definitely a jungler, but as for assassin? Well maybe. He's got the hit and run vibe - especially with some CDR for that W burst - but he's definitely not a solid assassain. I guess it all depends on his attack speed, ad, etc.\n\nYeah maybe should reduce E duration. As for attacking mid E, wellâ€¦ I had toyed with the idea of Snik being able to throw Fly bombs while flying, which visually would be pretty sweet, but sounds a bit OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-02T03:57:29.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be so cool, but not really OP unless he's dropping them at his position.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-02T02:33:51.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also apologies for the Frankenstein image example.
