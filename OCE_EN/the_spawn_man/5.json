I currently main Blitz, then Bard, then Thresh. I have tried branching off into supports like Tahm, Morgana and Janna and even non-traditional supports like Zac, Cho and Ziggs. The problem is, too many supports, too little time!\r\n\r\nSo I put it to you, when do you use a specific support? I plan to be proficient in all supports before long, so I want to know, if you&#039;re in champ select, which one do you use? I don&#039;t want to sit in champ select and auto pick my main, just because I feel safe with them. I want to think &quot;Oh, they&#039;re picking X champs, or our team is lacking in X - I should pick X support&quot;, like you&#039;d use Vayne adc with loads of high HP tanks on the other team, or Rammus if you&#039;re versing a full AD auto attack team.\r\n\r\nSo for supports, for each, what would you use for? Like I know Janna is great if you&#039;ve got some tanks but not much mobility. Blitz for his displacing pull if your team doesn&#039;t have an initiator. Malphite for his combos with Yas or for teams which will need to group together. And Braum for combos with high attack speed adcs like Kog Maw, or if your team is lacking hard CC. What is each support the best in, for your opinion?\r\n\r\nHopefully I&#039;m getting my point across, but at the end of this thread, I&#039;d hopefully have a guide like &quot;Use Tahm if your team doesn&#039;t have X, or your enemy has loads of X champs. Do not use him if&hellip; etc&quot;.\r\n\r\nThoughts? I want to transcend&hellip;\r\n\r\nP.S. Also, I&#039;m still struggling the good fight in Bronze 2 in a role that can hardly carry on their own, so if any good adcs want to duo with a decent support, hit me up!","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-02T23:20:38.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For bronze I'd take out thresh and most definitely bard and replace them with Nautilus and at least 1 heavy AP caster support. You want to pick the most brain dead easy mode supports until you hit at least silver 3.\n\nWhy. Simple. If your team is bad you want to be able to transition whatever lead you can get. Nautilus is probably the easiest since you can make picks without much effort and he is very tanky. Annie as an AP caster is also really good. Stun is essentially guaranteed and if your adc is doing badly be as selfish as possible. take kills. take cs take whatever gold you can get and just delete people with her.\n\nPlaying bard and thresh is just asking for trouble in bronze imo.\n\nTo answer your question on who to pick when. Don't worry about that at all.\n\nIf you are mechanically/skillfully better than your opponent (especially in bronze) it doesn't matter what advantage a counter pick may have since you are the better player straight up. Get so good with your 3 supports that you can play them in any lane and still play very well. \n\nThe first 3 I learn't where Zyra, Karma and Naut. I can play all 3 anywhere except adc (not because I can't but because it is pointless).\n\nBlitz is great pick making. Naut is a monster pick/engager and annie is the same as naut. As I said above while different supports are better for different (and at different things) Naut is the jack of all trades. Tanky - Check. Dmg - Check. Engage - Check. Stuns - Check. Disengage - Check. Displacement - Check.\n\nTLDR - Pick 3 supports and learn to play them excessively well into any and all compositions is much more effective than learning every single champ to an average or less ability.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-05-03T05:04:55.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. Firstly, this isn't really the answer I was looking for. While I do appreciate that you think 3 supports over many is the better option, I was more looking for just a guide as to what each support was the best at, if you play them to their top standard. I can play Blitz and Bard against pretty much any team (currently have nearly 300k mastery with Blitz), but I still would like to know what the specific strengths of each support are, because I mean at the end of the day, if a support has a heal/shield, cc, and utility, they become to seem very much like one another.\n\nThat said, I'll still reply to your post. I'm not a noob 'Bronze' player. I was playing at Silver 2 last season, but got banned, and started in Bronze this season (long story). I do know how to play champs like Bard very well. I don't always think my team knows how to play *with* Bard, but I can be very proficient with him. In fact, if it's a juggernaut team we're versing, I always snap pick Bard for his CC and stuns. I'm looking less on how to level up with support, and more to know if I want a particular point of impact in a game, which support to take.\n\nI have been eyeing up Naut for a while and would love to try him out. Again it comes to the question between what his particular strength is; I mean, Blitz has a pull, and CC. You say he's a jack of all tradesâ€¦ so you'd just use him if your team is well-rounded and needs a level support?","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-03T07:07:06.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. probably the easiest way to look at it is to look at what the champions do. You just pick the opposite type of champion to the composition the enemy team run if your team doesn't have a solid composition. For example the enemy team pick Malphite and Yasuo but your team pick a bunch of picks that don't go together. You would pick Janna, Sona, Zyra,  Braum or Sejuani. Why, all 5 of those champions have large disable or displacement abilities.\n\nThe biggest issue you will face is that some champions just don't fit any comps. Karma is one of my fav supports ever but really doesn't fit with any type of comp at all. You do stupid dmg, can peel, can bait (40% instant heal OP), can engage, can disengage but doesn't \"excel\" at any one role as would say Janna into a heavy engage composition.\n\nIn relation to Naut. The reason he is the jack of all trades is simply because he does almost every role (except healing) at 75% efficiency. He has an aoe slow, built in shield + sunfire, hook that works on terrain, knock up and the most stuns in the game. If you go into a team with nautilus it is very easy to hook > stun > aoe slow > stun closest target and then just walk around stunning everyone while you spam the slow. In relation to champions that hook the default order for most is Thresh (Best), Naut, blitz and finally leona.\n\nTLDR - I would use Naut if my OWN team didn't have a comp that revolved around a strategy.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-02T12:56:33.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First tip: you gotta learn what is a support, what is their role?
