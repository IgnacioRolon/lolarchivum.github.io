And the second time directly after a new patch. I&#039;ll get into champion select and the get into the game loading screen, and I&#039;ll be the last one to 100%. This time around it took me 5 minutes to get to &#039;100%&#039;, but the game doesn&#039;t load. So I alt-tab out, and a screen pops up saying that the &#039;Game has crashed&#039; and gives me the option to reconnect.\n\nSo I try to reconnect and again, it takes foreverrrrrr, and when I get to &#039;100%&#039; it does nothing. So I reboot my modem, computer and do a speed test which says I&#039;m fine. I relaunch League, and it tells me to reconnect. I do it, and it takes an average amount of time to get to &#039;100%&#039;. I get into the game and there is a status bar at the top of the screen saying it&#039;s trying to reconnect, and while it does I can see everything in the game and the mini map etc. Then a bloody &#039;Network Warning&#039; pops up and says that I&#039;ve been away for too long and the game will &#039;Exit now&#039;.\n\nLike seriously? I spent all that time trying to reconnect, and finally when I reconnect, you tell me all that time took too long and you&#039;re going to disconnect me again? Who the hell thought that was a good piece of system EVER? Like seriously, can someone explain to me WHY it disconnects you AGAIN after you reconnect? Ridiculous.\n\nSo I then try to reconnect and then it just keeps saying I&#039;ve disconnected and freezes, so I have to hard reboot my computer and now I&#039;ve given up.\n\nI&#039;m on a Mac, and this is the SECOND time this has happened. Both directly after a patch. Once before in a previous update (5.14 I thiiiink ?) and now this newest one. My internet is fine, I was playing perfectly fine yesterday and the day before. I hate when someone d/c&#039;s on my team and now due to no fault of my own this happens and I&#039;ll probably get reported. At the very LEAST get rid of that stupid pop up which disconnects you AGAIN after you reconnect successfully into a game!","replies":[]}
