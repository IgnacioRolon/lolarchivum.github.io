TEAM MATES! ~ Rant","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, I'm currently on a 15 minute time out from playing LoL at the moment because of failing to select a champion. I'm going to use this time to do something completely unproductive and write a wee rant.\n\nNow, I'm no LoL star. But I know the basics. That's why it boggles me why there are so many, even level 30s (!!!), that still don't know calls and meta in Champion Select. I'm currently on the time out because I thought I'd save us the trouble of going through with a game we were clearly going to lose. It's worse than fighting over who got top, it's the players who say stuff like \"Me, X player and X player all mid\". Or \"We're having 2 junglers.\" (Yes I actually played a game with 2 junglers, and it turned out exactly as you'd expect). Or when you clearly call something, they reply several lines later and then insta lock, forcing you into a position you had not intended. Or worse, instalocks jungler (the seldom times you even have one) and then says \"I'm not ganking… ever\".\n\nOkay, obviously the meta is meant to be broken sometimes, but not in solo queue, where there are no premade teams and you don't have some awesome strat. There surely should be some tutorial to teach newer players that 1) What the general lanes are, and what the meta is with them, 2) How not to be a complete idiot. Why punish those who do know what we're doing and make us wait until level 30 to have the chance to not play with those who are clearly out of their depth. I try my hardest to stay calm and never blame my team (outwardly) and my player honour reflects that, but there comes a point where you want to bash your brains out with your keyboard after the umpteenth game in a row where you lose in Champ Select. I don't even play badly in most of my games now, and we still lose due to incompetent team mates making stupid calls about what role they play, regardless of how well they perform in-game. \n\nOkay, my time out should be over now, so hopefully I don't end up in another game where they all yell out \"TOP TOP TOP OR FEED\" \"DUO JUNGLE\" \"I CAN'T SUPP\" \"BOT!\" \"WHAT DOES ADC MEAN?\" at once, or wait until 10 seconds to go before lock in to tell you that they actually want a different role. Please… just one… single… game…\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'll create a log here of my games so I can actually show you what a basic day of LoL entails in Normal Solo Queue.\n\nGame #1\n\nTwo team mates immediately D/C after feeding mid and bot lane. My once winning top lane is now getting ganked by mid so frequently I am now unable to farm and we all surrender at 20.\n\nGame #2\n\nActually a good game! I did well, my team did well and filled all positions.\n\nGame #3\n\nOpposite of the last game. I did well, but the team was f'd from the beginning by not playing a jungler. In team chat I tried to see who wanted to go jungler, and there was radio silence. Three team mates fed Jax, Trist and Zed. Complete loss. Game ended with all opponents sitting outside our nexus /laughing until we surrendered.\n\nGame #4\n\nI'm supp. My adc turns to me and says \"First time playing this char\" \"Oh, and I've never played ADC before\". Like why wouldn't you play a bot game first then? Promptly feeds Caitlyn to epic proportions. Nasus top, versing a DUO lane, gets stomped somehow. Jungler keeps calling for a team fight, but then everyone slowly files out of base 1 by 1 until they push up into the arms of a thousand bullets. Nexus dead in 22 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"DiabolicEsper","date":"2015-01-20T04:23:19.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes u just have to go with the flow...I agree that there are some idiots out there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-20T09:19:01.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals are for fun.

My 4 year old brother can go into a bot game and wreck face, going first time x role or x champ in norms is how you learn faster and get good faster. Bots are for learning the basics of the gaming or just for messing around","replies":[]},{"poster":"Breawien","date":"2015-01-20T04:15:17.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are we talking about \"normal\" or \"ranked\"? i rarely play normal, when i do, i dgaf, DOUBLE JUNGLE IS WHERE ITS AT!","replies":[]}]}
