So what makes a fun champion? Some ideas&hellip;\n\n**1)** _Character and flavour. Champs that look cool, have a weird or amusing story are always fun to play. Their animations and effects are interesting._\n\n**2)** _Varied gameplay strategies and roles. A champion that can play different roles, or their role in varied ways._\n\n**3)** _A nice range of interesting skills and abilities. High skill caps on champions lead to different outcomes to various encounters._\n\n**4)** _Are viable and competitive. Not as sure on this one - some people have fun winning and when their team isn&#039;t flaming at them, so this could be dependant on the person._\n\nSo those are some things I look for when deciding if a champion is fun or not.\n\nChampions like Zac, Cho and Tahm are pretty interesting in terms of story, animations and effects. I guess that&#039;s why a lot of champions have skins to make them more interesting, like the recent Project skins adding a bit to some of the imho most boring champions in terms of look.\n\nFor varied gameplay strategies, I&#039;d definitely say champions like Nasus, Singed and Warwick are boring. They have to follow the same strategies each game (infinite farming/creep denial/getting sated and ganking after 6, respectively), and probably also are quite limited in terms of an interesting set of skills and abilities also. However, champions like Thresh, Sion, Lee, Fizz and others who can swap roles from junglers to supports to laners, and also have an interesting set of abilities to change the outcomes of encounters, are at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nFor me personally, if I&#039;m looking at all of the above characteristics, the most fun I&#039;ve had playing champions would have to be the following: Bard, Cho&#039;gath, Zac, Sion, Thresh, Shaco, Blitz and Ziggs. With the least fun being Warwick, Vladimir, Nasus, Singed, Heimerdinger, Yorick.\n\nSo, what makes a fun champ for you? Who are the most/least fun champs you&#039;ve played with?","replies":[{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2015-09-23T08:39:52.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you play Singed by farming in lane, then I must admit, it gets pretty boring. However, when you play proxy Singed, I don't know about you, but I absolutely loved every single moment of it.\n\n-You feel like a thug when you do a level one proxy and the enemy team can't deal with you\n-Once you have your core items, you can literally give 0 ****'s about the enemy team and run around like a madman in a team-fight\n-If you get fed, then I can guarantee you will be ganked 5v1. The best part? You manage to get a kill, maybe two and escape most of the time.\n-Even if you don't do too well and have a KDA of 0/12/5, it probably means that the enemy team is so obsessed with you proxy farming, that they constantly are ganking you, thus letting your team's other lanes at an advantage.\n\nJust my two cents on my fun champions. You don't need to agree to them, by all means.\nCheers,\n-Anserem","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T09:05:11.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah fair enough. I just don't think he fulfils point 2). He's pretty much one role, one build and very little in terms of skill cap and ability variation. The feeling of being a pain in the arse to the enemy team is fun, but many more champions can do that, and also be visually, skillfully and aesthetically pleasing at the same time. Although maybe not on the troll level of Singed.\n\nReminds me of why I love Sion so much. You can split push all day, and then you just R away from the fight when they come to gank you. And when it gets to inhibs and such, you die and then come back to life to finish the job. I won a game the other day where their nexus was exposed and I had it to half health. They killed me and walked away forgetting my passive. Popped back to life and finished off the game. Was pretty funny.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-23T04:41:04.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything thats balanced and/or takes actual skill to play, none of that lee sin, riven or yasuo bullshit.","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-23T11:46:35.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lee Sin is probably in the more skillful end of the skillscale. \nHe's kinda easy to do well in Bronze and Silver and Gold but he levels off once you start hitting the higher MMRs. \nSame deal with Riven.\nFizz.\nYasuo. \n\nRiot pretty much says, get better, to counter these types of champions.

I mean, a champion like Singed is very balanced, but is not fun at all imho. I'd almost argue, the more degenerate a champion is, and the more insane pentakill combos you can get with ease, the more fun they are to play surely? ; )","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-25T15:00:11.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really despise people who say champions take no skill or are OP and easy to play, each and every champion is different, you literally cannot compare two champions simply based on abilities or skill level. Every champion has something they're good at. Every champion is overpowered in their own way. What one champion lacks, another makes up for.

I love being able to instantly kill someone by hiding in a bush and landing charm. It almost feels like she belongs on Summoners Rift as she's a fox and the way she moves just makes sense. I feel as though Ahri is probably one of the best champions Riot has developed both skill-wise and aesthetically.\n\nYou can play her as an assassin (which I prefer) or simply as a mage, although her kit screams assassin as her ult allows you to get in and out extremely quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-23T09:54:01.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo \n1) he has a cool lore/story, lots of fun interactions with other champs, riven and yi to name some. (On a personal note, he is voiced by my favorite voice actor)\n2) because he only needs 2 items and runes to get 100% crit you can build him tanky afterwards or go full damage or anything in between, both are lethal, he can play 2 lanes mid and top, but as far as roles are concerned he is pretty much stuck as an AD assassin/fighter, however what varies his role a bit is your team comp, you'll find you play and build quite differently in a team with cho/ori/malph than you do with a team without knockups. So he does have some variation.\n3) yas has a very high skillcap and is one of the very few champs to have 100% difficulty rating on his profile. He also has 5 abilities as opposed to the usual 4, and 2 of his abilities play very differently from other champs, the windwall is obvious, and his R is one of the very few teamwork orientated ultimate abilities. Also being a new champ his ability particles are nicely animated (champs like malzahar/poppy for example have bad ones)\n4) yas is about as viable as it gets, tbh I'd like to see him nerfed a little (even though he is one of my favourites) \n\nAlthough my main is Azir, \n1) his lore is probably the most well known in the game and he yells half of it out while playing as well. (He is voiced by the same voice actor as my favorite anime character)\n2) only 1 proper lane and role unfortunately, but his playstyle is quite unique\n3) definetly a high skillcap, and as such is very rewarding to play, (also same as yas regarding ability particles) \n4) he is viable for sure, a little too much so, and is competitive.\n\nI don't really care much about winning (unless it's ranked) and I only play champs that I feel are strong in aesthetic/lore/fits my playstyle. I don't play champs for their power at all, infact I prefer ones that aren't OP because they are less popular","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T12:32:28.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno… I just find Yas kinda boring, both in style and gameplay, although yes, his build and role variety do make him a bit better.
