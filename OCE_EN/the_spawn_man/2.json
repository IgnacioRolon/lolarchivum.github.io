Now you may say &quot;But he&#039;s the tankiest support ever!&quot; and ask how I could be so stupid. Now hear me out. All the other supports (that I play in any case) are unique. Blitz has his super grab. Thresh has bonkers utility. Bard is well&hellip; Bard. Morgana has her snare. They all have unique abilities and strengths.\r\n\r\nNow when it comes to Braum, as soon as I played him and saw what everyone was saying his strengths were, I immediately compared him to Zac and thought him not unique at all! I&#039;ve been playing Zac support for a few months now to great success, and in my opinion, he is a far superior version of Braum. His Q slows, his E can engage, stun and evade. His R can knock up and stun multiple champions. In fact, all of his abilities can affect multiple enemies. His passive can bait under tower, or be a basic Guardian Angel. He&#039;s tanky.\r\n\r\nBasically, everything Braum does, but better imo.\r\n\r\n And yet, Braum is still hailed as the king of tanky supports. So I have to ask. Why? 1) Why is Braum support good. What am I missing? 2) If it&#039;s very marginal, why would Braum be preferred over a Zac support? Is it really just because Braum is more well known and the traditional &quot;tanky&quot; support? They have a very similar style of abilities, and if you argue they&#039;re completely different, surely you&#039;d argue a Zac support would cream a Braum support?\r\n\r\nThis isn&#039;t a hate on Braum thread, just thought they were similar, and wanted to know thoughts on who was stronger etc.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-11T11:17:15.314+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Compare the pair:\n\nPassives: Braum is a stun that doesnt require an ability to hit in order to start. Zac passive provides no help for your partner though can be more useful later.\n\nQ: both Q's can be used to poke and both slow. Braums however also applies his passive.\nBraum's Q is a 70% slow decaying over 2s from level 1 and has % HP damage. Braum's base damage is also higher than Zacs.\nZac's slow starts at 20% and only goes to 40% for 2s and has an AP ratio.\n\nW: Zac will almost never be close enough in lane to use this unless your opponents are dumb or you are destroying them. Braum point and click jump to friendly minions or champions, also grants Armour and MR. Zac's can be better, damage wise but Braums helps more defensively by sharing resists with the ADC.\n\nE: Braum Shield. OP. Zac's jump, while good requires time and vision control to be effective.\n\nR: Braum slows in an AOE and knocks up and can be used both aggressively and defensively. Zacs displaces people. Zac's is a 20% slow, Braums is 40% level 1 and 60% with level 3 ult. Braum's has more base damage however Zac can hit people mutliple time so can do more damage overall.\n\nHonestly Braum is just all round better than Zac as a support. The only thing where Zac wins is that his W can do a lot of damage. But you would have to play super aggressively to use it often.\n\nTLDR: Braum's abilities and CC are better than Zac's which makes him a more useful support.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-12T17:52:14.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys! I can see how Braum is a bit heavier on the cc side, although one question: so his passive, it only starts on hitting his q or an auto attack, and *then* his allies can land the following three hits necessary to stun, correct? Or can his allies do this without Braum hitting the enemy, but just when he's nearby?\n\nI still think that Zac, played aggressively, can match Braum, if not beat him, purely because hardly anyone plays Zac and his E combo takes most by surprise. Stand behind tower out of sight; when the enemy gets too close, E into them. While they're stunned, walk slightly behind them and R them into the tower range. ADC should clean up. Someone who is not familiar with Zac will never see that coming.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-11T12:21:13.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"braum is the god damn cc generator and i hate him x7 more than zac, his cc is practically perma anyway, q slows 70%, then you get insta stunned by that freaking passive that knocks on extra 200 or whatever damage, into a freaking knock up, into the stun after knock up into a freaking massive perma slow into another 70% slow into stun +200 again. Then his w is a dash to aid and it makes him and the other person tankier, and his e is a freaking mobile windwall. He is one of the most annoying as hell supps to fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-11T13:00:04.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zac support is only good if you can always land your E, if u miss you will be punished hard.
