The title is not sarcastic. I understand games should change, but I&#039;m having a very hard time getting to grips with the new update. I&#039;ve played one game and I did not enjoy it one bit because it truly felt like a completely new game and I could not concentrate on having fun. I&#039;m very much a player who likes to know what is&hellip; the &quot;standard&quot; to play in regards to masteries, builds, strategy etc, and then break the mold from there. But as I said, first, I need to know what the mold *is*. Please help me. :(\r\n\r\n1) **Trinkets and sightstones.** \r\n\r\nSo there are only two trinket types now? Ward and lens? Do you upgrade them at all? What are Farsight alteration and Oracle alteration? Do you *have* to upgrade them to those?\r\n\r\nAnd sightstones! What&#039;s up with them! Doesn&#039;t the ruby sightone seem terrible compared to the other options now (unless you&#039;re building loads of active effect support items?). Obviously Eye of the Watchers is for AP champs who want a bit more vision. But don&#039;t Equinox and Oasis seem pretty similar? What scenarios would you use the different sightstones in? And of course, three are now gold income items - would you ever sell your main gold items for an upgrade gold income sightstone?\r\n\r\nAlso, before 5.22, I used to get away with buying a ward trinket, and forgoing my sightstone for something else (I know, noob play, but my team was good with vision) like a Warmogs or Banshees. Now however, the ward trinket never seems to fill up a charge before the last ward runs out, resulting in 0/3 or 1/3 wards on the map MAX all the time. Should this be the case? Are trinkets now basically useless for supports now? Why am I being forced into buying a sightstone if I was perfectly happy running trinkets alone before?\r\n\r\n2) **Health pots or Refillable potions?**\r\n\r\nWhich is better? Let&#039;s be honest and say that unless you&#039;re versing a counter champ, you&#039;re not going to burn through all of your pots before your first back, which is more efficient, refillables or pots? Would lanes use them? Support?\r\n\r\nAnd upgrading refillables. You can only upgrade into Hunter&#039;s Potion and Corrupting potion, correct? Is this mandatory? If not, is it worth it? Is Hunter&#039;s for junglers, and Corrupting for laners?\r\n\r\n3) **Jungler starting items.**\r\n\r\nHunter&#039;s machete is for AD champs, and Hunter&#039;s talisman is more for AP/Mana reliant champs? Does it matter which you get if you need both to build your main jungle weapon?\r\n\r\n4) **Support starting item.**\r\n\r\nI main support. With some of the sightstones granting you minion gold etc, should supports still be buying OG support items like Ancient coin (I&#039;m gonna guess yes), or start straight away building into sightstone items (especially if they have the new gold mastery)?\r\n\r\n5) **Speaking of masteries&hellip;**\r\n\r\nWhat are the standard routes of AD/APC/Tanks/Supports/Junglers these days? With the new masteries, it seems like you don&#039;t have to tailor your mastery pages specifically to each champion as much. Still, knowing what is the &quot;standard&quot; route for champions would be cool. I like the vibe of making hard choices in the mastery tree, but obviously it leaves less room for the imagination.\r\n\r\nAnd now with gold runes, gold masteries, gold items&hellip; how much is too much? Again, this is pointed more towards support champions.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just some thing I&#039;d like to know. It&#039;s all new to me. I don&#039;t cope well with change. Masteries I could&#039;ve handled. Maybe wards. MAYBE jungler items. But the flasks too. They changes the flasks. Too far. I don&#039;t know which way is up any more. Any help you can give an ol&#039; Blitzcrank main would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"wakiZashi","date":"2015-11-20T16:29:47.613+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, let's see how much I can help you with! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n> So there are only two trinket types now? Ward and lens? Do you upgrade them at all? What are Farsight alteration and Oracle alteration? Do you have to upgrade them to those?\n\nTechnically there's still the same 3 types, lens, orb, and ward, however Riot removed the Greater Stealth Totem upgrade from the shop since, y'know... no one ever remembered to upgrade to that (it's not quite the actual reason, but it may as well be).  So now, if you buy the green trinket at the start of the game, it holds 2 charges of wards, which very slowly recharge.  In addition, over the course of the game (per-level) your trinket will upgrade itself continuously; for example, the Warding Totem starts with a 60 second duration, and over time increases to 120 seconds at level 18.\n\nThe alterations are replacements to the old trinket-upgrading system.  For reference, [here's how the trinket system used to work.](https://www.draw.io/#LOld%20Trinkets.html)  You could buy any of the three, swap them at any time, and then upgrade them to their better counterparts at level 9.  You probably already know that, however.\n\n[With the new system,](https://www.draw.io/#LNew%20Trinkets.html) (and this is pretty relevant if you're a support main), you can only purchase either the Warding Totem or the Sweeping Lens at level 1.  These can each be exchanged for the other at any time.  \nWhen you hit level 9, you can make a choice.  If you have a Warding Totem, you can either leave it as it is (the stealth ward option) or purchase the Farsight alteration, which is like the old Farsight Ward.  \nIf you have a Sweeping Lens (which a support generally will), then you can keep it as a Sweeping Lens, or get the Oracle Alteration.  \n**Note that if you get the Oracle Alteration, your sweeper no longer grants the stealth-detecting True Sight (it will still disable wards it finds, though), but continually sweeps for 10 seconds and follows your champion's movement, and is about 50% larger.**  \n\nWhile it might look like you wouldn't ever get the Oracle Alteration since it doesn't technically reveal wards, bear in mind that both the Sweeping Lens and the Oracle Alteration will spawn warning particles over units it finds that you can't see (champions, pink wards, etc).  So if you're walking through lane and you think there's a stealthed Teemo or something nearby, pop Oracle's and look out for warning particles as you go past.\nBTW, I may not necessarily have interpreted that correctly, this is just me reading the patch notes right now and expanding them into something more clear.\n\n>And sightstones! What's up with them! Doesn't the ruby sightone seem terrible compared to the other options now (unless you're building loads of active effect support items?). Obviously Eye of the Watchers is for AP champs who want a bit more vision. But don't Equinox and Oasis seem pretty similar? What scenarios would you use the different sightstones in? And of course, three are now gold income items - would you ever sell your main gold items for an upgrade gold income sightstone?\n\nThe \"Eyestones\" are items that build out of a Sightstone and whatever Tier 2 support item you have (Nomad's Medallion, Targon's Brace, or Frostfang).  This is a choice where you either get the Eyestone (which loses the Tier 3 item effects, but retains the Tier 2 and the Sightstone wards while freeing up an item slot) or a Ruby Sightstone and your full Tier 3 item (which takes up an extra item slot, but gives you the benefit of your full support item and a reduced cooldown on it and the other items you have).  For example, if I'm playing something like an Alistar or Janna, and I have to continually use items like Righteous Glory or Face of the Mountain to help my team, then I would definitely go for the Ruby Sightstone option.  However, on Blitzcrank, you probably aren't buying so many active items, and getting more passive effects (or just straight AP), so assuming your team still has some reliable shields/engage, you can forgo the full support item and free up some room for that Luden's while retaining the vision.  Of course, the whole team should now be taking advantage of the trinket system, so vision is distributed around by everyone.\n\n>Should this be the case? Are trinkets now basically useless for supports now? Why am I being forced into buying a sightstone if I was perfectly happy running trinkets alone before?\n\nThis is a bit of a weird thing, but I'm pretty sure Rito intends for supports to run Sweeping Lenses over ward trinkets, and take advantage of the new Eyestones instead.  If your team is good with vision, you can still get away with no sightstone, because you either get the Sweeping Lens and let your team take care of vision duties, or you can hold onto the warding totem, because as you level up the recharge time shortens.  \n\nThe other thing about this is the price reduction on pink wards.  Now that they are 75g, teams are probably expected to use them in place of the old stealth wards for the purposes of things like warding river, etc., until you have the sightstone.  So basically Riot are kind of forcing this sightstone change onto the support role, but they may have intended it to go down smoother.  \n\nWards also leave behind a bit of rubble when they die for 5 minutes, which you can use to figure out where the enemy team is placing wards, and get more efficient pink/sweeper placement by putting it on those areas.\n\n**For everything else you put here, I'm not really qualified to talk about it cause I'm just a low-elo scrub, but I'll give short thoughts anyways.**\n\n>Health pots or Refillable potions?\n\nFrom the patch notes: \" Refillable Potions: For the same cost, three health potions outscale this immediately, but a single trip back to your fountain recoups the value difference. Refillable is an attractive option for those looking to play the long game in lane; its upgrades provide some very real power.\"  If you're playing extremely passive and just trying to farm your item gold and not have a crapload of that gold be spent on the now-50g health pots, refillable/corrupting is a very efficient way to do that. \n\nFor the Hunter's Potion, buy it on any jungle champ where getting the regular pots usually means slow jungle clear, no sustain and potential early backs (maybe {{champion:32}}).\n\n>Jungler starting items\n\nFor this you might just have to carefully study the patch notes and see how it applies to your personal jungle style, but more or less you could potentially sum it up as \"Machete if you don't need to worry about sustain, Talisman if you do\".\n\n>Support starting item\n\nI don't believe this has changed, you still will build your support item then choose whether to get sightstone, and then make choices as detailed above.\n\n> Speaking of masteries…\n\nI don't like saying it, but there's not much I can help with here.  Masteries are very personal things, and you make them based on how you play.  With that said, you can possibly start with a series of Facebook posts from Disco Heat where he showed some mastery sets off.\n\n[Marksmen](https://www.facebook.com/eroticdiscoheat/photos/a.1447497382158105.1073741828.1447462695494907/1661212880786553/?type=3&theater)\n\n[AD Jungle](https://www.facebook.com/eroticdiscoheat/photos/a.1447497382158105.1073741828.1447462695494907/1661212927453215/?type=3&theater)\n\n[Ranged Supports](https://www.facebook.com/eroticdiscoheat/photos/a.1447497382158105.1073741828.1447462695494907/1661213867453121/?type=3&theater)\n\n[AD Top](https://www.facebook.com/eroticdiscoheat/photos/a.1447497382158105.1073741828.1447462695494907/1661215227452985/?type=3&theater)\n\n[AP Mid](https://www.facebook.com/eroticdiscoheat/photos/a.1447497382158105.1073741828.1447462695494907/1661329934108181/?type=3&theater)\n\n\nHopefully some of this has helped you out! ~~It only took me like an hour to put this together~~ {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-21T09:02:13.762+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oracle's alteration does reveal wards, it just doesn't fully reveal stealthed champions.

Trinkets and Sightstones**\n\n100% yes upgrade your trinkets. The exception will be if they lower the limit on {{item:3363}} \n\nThe upgrade on {{item:3341}} is always worth it. You can't use it over walls as easily but it is a minor drawback. The upgrade has a far superior diameter, reveals for longer, is movable (follows you around) and reveals stealthed champions as well (not completely, they leave behind a red shadow image as they move)\n\nAs for the {{item:3340}}  trinket, upgrading it may seem like a toss up because the {{item:3363}} wards are fragile and visible. However it really is well worth it upgrading it. The recharge on the ward trinket is slow, so you can only have one ward down at a time that way - two with {{item:2043}} (you should ALWAYS have a pink out if at all possible) - whereas the Farsight trinket is on a 40 second cd and doesn't count to your ward limit. What this means is that every 40 seconds you get to put down a permanent ward (they don't have timers). Yes the enemy can see them, but you will have far more vision with Farsight than you will with Ward.\n\nAs for {{item:2049}}, on support you should pretty much always be buying one. Even if the whole enemy team has {{item:3363}}  and no invis so you don't need {{item:3364}} you should still have sightstone and take {{item:3363}} instead of red trinket.\n\nAs for {{item:2045}} vs {{item:2303}} {{item:2302}} {{item:2301}}, it depends on the champion you are playing. For example, when I play {{champion:412}} I usually want {{item:3069}} and {{item:3800}} so Ruby Sightstone is beneficial. But when I play {{champion:267}} I want {{item:3504}} and {{item:3116}} so I'm better off saving the slot and keeping the mana regen with {{item:2301}}. Ultimately this is about your planned build path. I used to end up selling Spellthief's on Nami but now I can just build it into my sightstone.\n\n**2. Pots or Refillables**\n\nThis pretty much comes down to preference. I like to take {{item:1041}} / {{item:1039}} with {{item:2031}} into {{item:2032}} in jungle, and I'm seeing {{item:2033}} quite popular in mid lane. But again, all about preference with this one.\n\n**3. Jungler Starting items**\n\nDown to preference, you don't get all that much more sustain with {{item:1041}}, so if you think you'd benefit more from the mana, even on champs like say, Kindred (though if you're starting Red side you're probably better off getting machete first because you'll get blue buff first) then {{item:1039}} may be a better choice for you.\n\n**4. Support Starting items**\n\nI don't quite understand what you mean here. You build the new Sightstones out of {{item:2049}} and {{item:3098}} / {{item:3096}} / {{item:3097}} so your starting items as support haven't changed.\n\n**5. Masteries**\n\nThe point of the new masteries was largely to diversify, and facilitate individual playstyles rather than cookie cutter pro builds. With that said, generally speaking there will be a particular keystone that just makes sense for a particular champion or role (Bond of Stone for tanky/support styles, Windspeaker's Blessing for any support with shields/heals). Mid lane will typically take Deathfire Touch, ADC will typically take Warlord's Bloodlust (now it's being nerfed more people might take Fervor of Battle).\n\nAs far as support is concerned, I have three seperate pages for the supports I play. A tanky page with Bond of Stone (0/12/18), an AP page with Windspeaker's Blessing (0/18/12), and an AP page with Thunferlord's Decree (0/18/12) for champs like Zyra without shields/heals. The gold mastery is easily swapped for it's alternative if you have AoE for teamfights as the 5% restoration can be quite strong, the gold mastery is optional, the gold items/runes are the same, so nothing should really change there. I've never used gold runes and never felt it necessary.\n\n**tl;dr For Blitzcrank**\n\nTRINKETS: Start with {{item:3340}} and switch to {{item:3341}} when you get Sightstone, then upgrade to {{item:3364}} at lvl 9. If the enemy team has no invis champs, and are using all Farsight trinkets, then they have only have 3 stealth wards and you coudl consider opting for {{item:3363}} as an alternative. You'll have more vision for your team, but less control over the enemy's vision.\n\nSIGHTSTONES: If you want {{item:3069}} or {{item:3401}} then build it and {{item:2045}}, to get your gold's worth maybe invest in something like {{item:3800}} or {{item:3143}}, really just at least one other active. \n\nIf you don't want the support item actives then build your Sightstone and starting item into {{item:2303}} or {{item:2302}} at a time you deem appropriate (usually after you've at least finished boots and one other full item).\n\nPOTS/REFILLABLES: On support, I would simply take pots, start with your gold item, a {{item:2043}} and one {{item:2003}}. Pretty much, ignore the refillables in support.\n\nMASTERIES: Choose whether you prefer resistance (MR/Armour) or Health, and build up to 18 points in Resolve with your keystone in Bond of Stone. It's worth noting that Runic Shield will increase your passive, but Veteran' Scars is perfectly alright also.\n\nThen probably build you're 12 down in Cunning with Left (Move Speed), Right (Biscuits), Right (Mana Regen) then Left/Right (Gold/Tankiness in teamfights).\n\n\n\n\nNow of course none of this is the be all and end all. Essentially the point of this patch was to give you more options so we wouldn't all have cookie cutter builds/stats. Experiment and play around with match ups and work out what feels best for you.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-12-06T10:14:52.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers man! So the blue upgraded trinket doesn't count towards your ward count? :O\n\nI don't really see the point in upgrading your flasks tbh. I'd be wary of upgrading them before you purchase your first core item, and after that, they're hardly worth it, as you'll undoubtedly begin to have other sustain or not be in lane as much.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-06T18:54:04.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't no, you can have infinite blue trinket wards out (and it's on like a 40 second cooldown).\n\nAs for consumable it depends who you're playing. I will often upgrade to Hunter's Potion in the jungle if I'm playing someone like Kindred, because it gives me the freedom to move around and try and get my marks, without having to worry about if I have enough health or if I should recall. That said I don't need it for very long. As for corrupting, I see it mostly on DoT heavy champs and it is quite effective. But if you aren't at least drawing even with your opponent, I feel pretty much same as you do, that it wouldn't be worth it, and that it would put you behind too much. But if you have say, enough gold to buy your needlessly large and enough leftover to upgrade, it's may very well be worth it on champs like Malz/Brand/Swain etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-21T12:45:45.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its cruddy, and i want the smoothness of 5.21 back","replies":[]}]}
