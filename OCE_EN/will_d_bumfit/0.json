If I am forcefully disconnected from the game due to internet loss, why am I placed in the low priority queues for missing 2 minutes of the game.

You need to *consistently* leave games to get hit with LPQ. Secondly, it requires you to be AFK/DC for more than 5 minutes to be marked as AFK/DC by the leavebuster system, so 2 minutes isn't going to affect you assuming you continued to play once you got back in.\n\nI would also like to point out that the leavebuster system gives reasonable leniency in the case of unintentional disconnections. The fact remains that, if your connection is disrupted consistently enough for you to be hit with LPQ, regardless of reason, then it is your fault for playing the game without meeting it's connection requirements, which is outlined in the TOU and EULA.","replies":[]}]}
