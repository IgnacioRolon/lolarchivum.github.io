It has a teenage main character in a modern, very blank neighbourhood. They take some kind of shot by putting their hand on a little pad each morning. It removes colour from their world and creativity etc. As you might expect, the main character decides not to take his medicine and begins to see colours again. He/she somehow leaves the closed off neighbourhood and teaches them about independence.\r\n\r\n1. Did I just imagine this movie?\r\n\r\n2. If not, what is the name of this movie?","replies":[{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2014-12-26T11:54:16.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only thing I can think of is the giver...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJNNugNe0Wo\nAbout emotions being taken through daily injections","replies":[{"poster":"Vantage Point","date":"2014-12-27T00:19:28.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, thats the one.","replies":[]}]}]}
