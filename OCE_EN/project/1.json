Meaning a a total of only two items.\r\nFor example my team has the majority vote for an infinity edge and the other teams vote went towards a Black Cleaver so only those two items (and their sub items) could be purchased throughout the entire game.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-04T05:20:50.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you mean only those two items could be bought - everyone on your team would have 6x {{item:3031}} ?\n\nMaybe instead have a pool of items - ban certain items like you do champions in ranked games (maybe 2?), then take a couple of items that are *exclusive* for each team to really mix it up. You might need a bit more in it for it to be a new mode though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-09-03T12:17:02.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The games will just hit a stalemate because no one can ramp up to fulfil their late or mid game roles (the support will probably deal as much damage as an adc if both items picked were strictly tanky)","replies":[]}]}
