If you aren't one of those two, you might as well just go home. \n\nCurrent champions to be wary of:\n\nThe Mid lane overlords are:\n**Zed** (who has an 80%+ ban rate) basically no one wants him anywhere near their games!\n**Ekko** (who is now a tank that deals assassin-like damage)\n**Fizz** (Is Fizz.. nuff said)\n**Azir** (the new favourite pro-pick for mid, he went from zero to hero overnight a while back os a few pro's played him and now everyone wants a turn) \n**Ahri**\n**Lux** (not technically an assassin, but QR is basically instakill on anything except full MR tank now) \n\nThe ADC's of the season are:\n**Lucian** (seriously, this shit is fucked)\n**Ezreal**\n**Vayne**\n**Caitlin** (sometimes. she is probably the more balanced of all of them, but still very powerful)\n**Jhin** (very very popular, but has very distinct weaknesses that the others lack, so isn't that much of an issue)\n\nHigh profile Supports are:\n**Thresh** (forever and always)\n**Alistar** (unkillable, also with assassin damage)\n**Annie** (why have support capabilities when you can make your ADC redundant?)\n**Brand** (this shouldn't work, yet it basically doesn't lose)\n\nTop laners (for once in history, this is actually the most balanced lane):\n**Voli** (Cuts ADC's in half without even trying, but no other role except ADC's has enough damage to kill him)\n**Swain** (really unstable atm, the slightest nerfs/buffs make him able to 1v5 or make him unplayable)\n**Malphite**\n\nJunglers:\n**Fiddlesticks** (is very strong now, but only recently obtained the spotlight)\n**Graves** (theoretically its a very bad bad pick.. yet somehow always wins)\n**Kindred** (in a tank meta, who better to take them down)\n**Malzahar** (the new update hurts... he is basically immune to assassins, yet has enough sustained damage to melt tanks)\n\nNew editions:\n\nThe new champs this year are:\n**Jhin** (ADC) Very popular, very fun, very strong, but has well known weaknesses to exploit which makes him balanced. His lore is tied to Shen and Zed\n\n**Aurelion Sol** (Mage) He is one of my all time favourite champions now. Very fun to play, But he is hard to play properly and only has 1 ability (his ult) which can hit  someone if they are close to him, (so basically if the enemy has a dash, you need to use your ult or your fucked) which doesn't make him the safest pick in an Assassin meta. He is a sustained damage roaming mage. He is Tied to Targonian lore (a new lore, search it up) and is arguably the most powerful being in the LoL universe. \n\n**Taric** (Suport) his new update made him a whole new champion, he is still a Tanky armour support, but now has an AOE kayle ult, and now bonds with people (like kalista, but you can change your buddy) His lore is also Targonian\n\n**Taliyah** (Mage) she only came out a few weeks ago, but i really like her and will be using her a lot in future games, She is a damage/utility mage built for roaming. With heavy ties to Azir and Shuriman lore.\n\nThere was also a bulk update of mages and a few others. Major changes were made to:\n**Shen** (New passive Q and W)\n**Vladimir** (new E updated Q)\n**Malzahar** (new passive W and E)\n**Cassiopeia** (new passive and W)\n\nMinor (but still big) changes were made to:\n**Brand** (passive now broken)\n**Vel'koz** (ult does true damage on passive)\n**Annie** (tibbers is now a monster, but not a nuke when spawning anymore)\n**Swain** (new Q)\n**Fiddlesticks** (new passive)\n**ZIggs** (executes turrets under 30% with W)\n**Syndra** (new passive, can throw multiple balls)\n**Xerath** (5 shots on ult at max ranks)\n**Anivia** (ult now starts small and grows)\n**Veigar** (gets ability power on every move, not just Q)\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt takes ages to take a turret by pushing minions in the landing phase, and its too easy to take them with multiple champions (legit, you can be smashing your lane, and pushing your lane for 10 minutes and only get 1/4 of the enemy turrets HP, then get ganked once and lose your full HP turret.)\n\nDragons are now colour coded and each colour gives you a different ability (red increases damage, Brown gives you true damage to turrets, white gives you move speed, blue gives you HP and mana regen) then at 30 mins the big-ass dragon comes and that doubles the bonuses of the others.\n\nBaron is now almost instawin when you get it, if you don't get at least 3 turrets and 2 inhibs, something is wrong. \n\nNew monster: The Rift Hearald, spawns at baron pit until the 20 min mark, killing it grants a buff to once champion that doesn't expire for like 20 mins and stays after they die. \n\nMinions: Minion block is now stupid, having your path altered by minion block, often slows your move speed down (god knows why they havent fixed it) and sometimes you can be snared by being blocked by minion.\n\nOverpowerdness: RIOT has a new tactic, instead of nerfing a powerful champ, the buff ALL the other champions, which means that all the champions are just getting more and more powerful, to the point where anyone can basically 1 hit anyone else (which makes assassins very strong, because the have the mobility to not get hit) (and makes tanks very strong because they are one of the few champions that can't get 1 hit, but can 1 hit other champions still)\n\nYea... hope it kind of helped.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2016-06-08T03:40:56.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"game is still trash like it has been for the past year, don't worry, you won't have a hard time adjusting","replies":[]}]}
