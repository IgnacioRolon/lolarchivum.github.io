I could let it go if I only bought 1 skin for the champ but I can&#039;t, I&#039;m a collectionist, so I have all the skins.\r\n\r\nSome of the champs have been fundamentally changed to a point where I can no longer play them, I would relearn but it actually hurts my feelings to see some champions now, mostly looking at Shen, Morde and Talon...\r\n\r\nPS: Please never ever touch Nocturne or Wukong...","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-20T11:37:06.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They used to refund skins and champions when the said champ is reworked and into one that no longer appeals to you. You used to be able to argue for refunds on the basis of the champ and/or skins being no longer what you had purchased for upon their rework. That lasted for a short while I think.\n\nBut people being people, many of them started to abuse reworks as free refunds essentially.\n\nAnd thus Riot stopped doing it altogether. You have the community to thank.\n\nEDIT: I wouldn't call Talon butchered though, idk, I think he's still doing pretty darn alright, just a bit different now.","replies":[{"poster":"Knightrift","date":"2017-03-21T00:48:54.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a fair enough call I guess.... People are jerks after all.\n\nTalon is butchered to me, few champs were changed and they got massive buffs for some reason like Malz/Brand but the actual gameplay/builds didn't change. \n\nTalon was awesome against mages, Silence, rake, Epic Q from triforce (WTH HAPPENED TO TRIFORCE!!!).... Ashe was awesome, Frozen mallet on Q and passive Crit build ups and I have no idea what their intention with Morde was (bought his new golden armor skin before noticing he had been changed).... Shen was also one of my favourite supports for bot lane, especially the Q heal, taunt and shield to soak up the damage. Sadly I collected all those skins including Yellow Jacket and Frozen...\n\nI really hope they never touch Nocturne or Wukong... I noticed they nerfed Nocturne's passive but that's ok because it's so similar to what it used to be.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-03-18T22:40:35.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every account gets three refunds and that is all","replies":[{"poster":"Knightrift","date":"2017-03-20T07:13:12.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if I own all 7 or 8 of Ashes skins, I can only refund 3 of them?

If I'm getting a \"stiff shit\" then I won't be spending another cent or bother coming back to this. \n\nI'm an old fart who doesn't appreciate his money being wasted.","replies":[{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-03-20T11:33:55.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically riot wont do anything.
