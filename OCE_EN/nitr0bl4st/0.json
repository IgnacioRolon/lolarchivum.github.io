The game had told me to restart my game after \"upgrading\" the champion shard because a connection problem and now I am left with 1726 blue essence and no Kindred champion. Just a champion shard. Do you guys know how should I approach this problem?\n\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-02T10:20:34.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's an account specific issue and also purchase related you'll have to go through player support for that one.
