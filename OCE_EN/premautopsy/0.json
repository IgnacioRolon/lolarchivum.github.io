The reason I think this is this because he Trolled for a very long time before getting caught. \r\n\r\nMaybe I&#039;m just cynical, but Riot seems to put in a lot of effort for new champs, new skin and all those other things that make them cash.

People Love Tyler1 and I do too.\nAnd Riot MAY HAVE seen Banning Tyler1 Off the game was a big move & Might end up bad for both partys.\nThere is alot too go into here, and Alot of arguments for each side.\n\nI just believe people should drop the arguments and Anyone that brings it up should be warned or banned.\nIts just drama and People are getting the blame. Both of them did the wrong thing.\n\n-RedPandaFox","replies":[]}]}]}
