Cool lore, variety of characters, fun gameplay. The community/playerbase however, is terrible. I have quit this game many times but keep coming back because the game itself is fun and I have spent so much time on it I don&#039;t want to feel I&#039;ve wasted it, but now I might delete my account completely despite spending 1k+. \r\n\r\nThe last 3 games I have played have been utterly draining. I play games for fun, but as I type this I am actually just completely devoid of energy. I thought, playing on pbe would be a break from regular toxic League because it&#039;s pbe, but wow was I wrong. Every game at least 3 people were either toxic, extremely salty, or just unpleasant to play with. Teammates who blame you for everything, afk, swear at you constantly, etc.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve had people in the past say &quot;just do /muteall, if you don&#039;t like talking to them&quot;, but this just shows how awful the people who play the game really are. Never with any other online game have I had to mute people so frequently or risk getting bombarded with toxicity. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re seeing this and you&#039;ve played the game then unfortunately you probably know what I&#039;m talking about. I hope the community of this game improves eventually, but even then I don&#039;t even know if I&#039;ll want to come back.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-24T02:19:47.800+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":3,"body":"Dont worry man riot are banning for sneezing now so you and the 1% of people who aren't toxic will have the place to yourself soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Justaguy","date":"2017-11-26T04:46:47.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"If 99% of a community is toxic.  it DESERVES to die.

In fact, I am learning more to be a team player when I see some good players supporting my role and other gammers.\n\nMaybe if we start playing well and respect other people's mistake and giving encouragement to good plays or play as a team we might influence the community in a positive way? Just like how the good players are influencing me.\n\nForming a group of friends that you could play with who are understanding and non toxic will make the gameplay more pleasant. I am looking for such players myself. \n\nI cannot tolerate people who are egocentric, they spam pinging as if they play best. They think about their own score, hide under turret, aim for the final hit and blame others for dying and boast that they are the one getting kills.\n\nAs far as losing the game/making mistakes, I think it is completely normal, every can learn to be better through mistakes. There is no need to be toxic.\n\nGood luck, have fun ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-24T03:11:38.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah and it's assholes like that that have ruined Riot and the game so now people are perma banned for messing around and getting up at trolls.","replies":[]}]}
