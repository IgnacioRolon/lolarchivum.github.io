I&#039;m looking for 1 or 2 people to duo with. My perfect duo partner has a high Kda on recent games but loses their games cos of bad teammates - duo with me, get that win. Enjoy the freelo. They also add me before 5:30 PM and are able to play from about 5:30 onwards late into the night, tonight. They don&#039;t skype. I&#039;m happy to use any other voice comms, just not skype.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll see who adds me when I finish work and log on. I&#039;ll also recheck this thread throughout the day.\r\n\r\nAs this acc is only bronze I can only duo with bronze or silver. i&#039;ll be winning many games tonight. Will you?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nThe Teemonator","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-13T03:38:32.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please add me.

I'll be looking forward to playing with you after 8pm. ;)\n\nAlso with teh 100% win rate, half of them I only played once, its a smurf account with not many ranked games played so naturally there will be high win %'s on my preferred champs. It was more a way of letting the smarter forum goers know that I'm an ADC/Mid/Jungle main and I'm not talking smack about winning a lot ;)","replies":[]}]}]}
