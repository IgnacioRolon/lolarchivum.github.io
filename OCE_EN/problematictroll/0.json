Prove me wrong with evidence. I made 2 support tickets about Mog and nothing but when I made a thread about him he magically got a 2 week ban within a day.\n\nThere literally isn't even a player report option in support tickets since like a year ago.

RiQt still plays to this day even though the copypasta assured me that 'justice comes on swift wings'.\n\nNeither player has namechanged. The only thing I didn't mention in the ticket was that they were both using evadee as well but a player shouldn't be expected to name every script the cheater is using.\n\nAnd I think this was back when player reports was a thing in tickets, since that's gone support staff aren't even trained to handle reports beyond saying 'report them after the game and they'll be banned'.\n\nAnd this isn't even the first thread about aamazing. Do you honestly think people haven't sent tickets about him? He's been scripting for several months if not a year now.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-02-11T07:30:33.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"141 wins 76 losses as Xerath last season.\n\nHoly %%%%.\n\nThe thing is, if anyone is going to get a ban here, it will probably be you, sadly, that's how things around here work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-02-11T06:42:18.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a 'scripter' he sure does have a pretty low KDA and w/l ratio, I'm no scripting expert tho","replies":[{"poster":"Problematictroll","date":"2015-02-11T06:44:25.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Bronze V Irelia,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=RneBpdr8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-11T06:42:18.552+0000)\n>\n> For a 'scripter' he sure does have a pretty low KDA and w/l ratio, I'm no scripting expert tho\n\nProbably because his decision making is silver level.
