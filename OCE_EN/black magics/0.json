OCE skin?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"So it has been at the very least months since anyone from Riot even mentioned the OCE exclusive skin which was promised to be distributed amongst the players who transferred or created accounts on this server early. They said that they didn&#039;t want to create an Australian skin, but rather that it should be Oceanic on a whole.\r\n\r\nWhile this might be a difficult proposition... could we get an update, Riot? It has been two whole seasons since this skin was promised and yet no progress has been stated at all. At this point I would rather you tell us the skin was canned and that you can&#039;t keep your promise (a promise which applied to every other server mind you) than to continue keeping the server in the dark and hoping we forget about it (which a lot of people have actually done since the discussion about it was SO SO SO long ago, back in 2013).\r\n\r\nPlease tell us **SOMETHING**.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-05-20T07:39:45.779+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi everyone!
