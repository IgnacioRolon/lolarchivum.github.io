Her area of worked ground is enormous and the duration of it is way to long. You poke or fight them and then the entire mid lane is unusable only after 2-3 Q casts. Seems odd to put such a debilitating passive on a champion who's skill shots are hard to hit enough already considering they can be easily creep blocked and has short range. Her E can be strong if you land the clunky knock up onto them but the second wave of damage needs to be more like Viktors or Vel'Koz abilities where the second wave of damage isn't 5-10 seconds behind. \n\nOverall I feel like Riot are trying to make different champions with different abilities but making them incredibly hard to play. When you factor this in many people are going to be choosing the easier champions who do just as much if not more damage because you'll ultimately have more success actually pulling their abilities off. She's not special considering most champions can counter her ultimate. FLash (obviously) cait net, lucian dash, ezreal blinl, tristana jump, graves dash (that's just the bot lane... renekton dash, ekko dash, fizz jump, aatrox jump.. the list goes on and people are just going to counter pick her ultimate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-05-22T17:09:40.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im feeling the same way, Q damage is way to low, her poke does nothing and easily countered once other players start building mr, I found lvl 1 poke quite strong to lvl 4 in solo lane, but she is very weak soon as item builds come into play, you can go magic pen but than your going to lose out on other items.\n\ntoo add to what your saying, I find q very annoying, I get it the aiming thing its like a skill shot, but the worst part is for my team mates who hate getting K.S your Q can sometimes take kills away especially if your intention is just to poke down. I find this happens a lot more in the late game as she does tend to scale well, that might be it though, she is probably better if you set up a scaling itemization, with runes, masteries etc.\n\nanyway regardless your right though, she has a big marker on her head as she is very weak, and a fuck load squishy, you barely get time to use her mobility in fights... lol I find the ulti is very slow and is only good for helping your team mates snowball a lane, but most of the time people have escapes to get over the wall, I even found that zed basically walks through it, if taliyah is a mid laner, she is countered to everything that mid lane has, so many issues with this champion, it might just be a matter of making her damage throughput stronger, anyway who knows.","replies":[]}]}
