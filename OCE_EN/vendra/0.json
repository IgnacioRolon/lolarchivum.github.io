Particularly the Shadow Isles, and namely, Thresh. Now I don&#039;t know if Riot even thought about this while creating him, but damn I&#039;m curious about him BEFORE his glory in death so to speak. Like yes, he was a warden, and he was nothing short of an asshole, but I honestly want to know more. Same goes for Kalista, but to a lesser extent. Karthus was given a pretty solid explanation, his obsession with death and etc, but some of the others, really not so much. Even Hecarim peaked my interest. \r\n\r\nAnyone know if there&#039;s somewhere I can specifically enquire about this? Here..? Is anyone else curious about this or... is it just me.. okay I&#039;ll just.. {{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"JCPANDIT","date":"2015-06-30T17:12:28.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have been purposely vague about the background of the Shadow Isles (though have claimed they've got the entire backstory mapped out), it is unlikely you will receive the answers you're looking for... at least not until they update Evelynn's lore, I'm presuming. \n\nThe best solution is cross your fingers and hope they reveal more details at the next Harrowing event. Or try to piece together your own theories using the Q&A sections they had for the different Champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Vendra","date":"2015-07-06T04:47:51.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did they ever even do a Thresh Q&A?
