This has happened to me before, but not with 20min q&#039;s. So im just really frustrated about having to wait 20mins twice and id thought i would make a complaint. Ps give me a mystery skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-10T01:04:59.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol fuck no, your argument is invalid. Thats like going to maccas for ice-cream, dropping it, buying another one, then dropping that one, and asking for a new one for free because YOU dropped it...Not their fault that you dropped it. Same thing here, you had a 20 min queue, went and waited, didn't click except or was too late so you had to wait, and now you want free shit? LOL pls, how dense are you to think thats gonna happen","replies":[{"poster":"Gekku","date":"2016-11-11T07:40:18.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" didn't click except or was too late so you had to wait\", read properly it pop'ed up for 1 second and i accepted. Its a rare bug, that has happened to me before just not when i have 20mins. AND you clearly don't understand humour because the last bit was a joke and wasn't thinking anyone would give me a mystery. Its a complaint not an agrument.
