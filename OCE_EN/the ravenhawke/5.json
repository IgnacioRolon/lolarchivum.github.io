It wasn&rsquo;t natural. But that didn&rsquo;t stop the lone assassin from enjoying it. The cloaked warrior of the night was striding through the silent and empty halls, his dark eyes staring down blankly at the ground beneath him. He glanced to his right, finding the entrance way to the Institute Library. Glancing over his shoulder, he slowly opened the door and entered. The center room was dark, lit by only a single candle on the table in the middle of the room, the flame lighting up the walls around him, revealing the large bookcases filled with reports, novels and maps.\r\n\r\nWith a wary eye, he stepped into the middle of the room. His amber eyes narrowed as he observed the library around him. It seemed empty, the sounds of his own breathing seeming to echo from the walls. This was the meeting place, as the note he found outside his door claimed. He normally would have ignored something so insignificant, often believing it is a trick or an ambush of some kind. As an assassin, he had been wary of such things. One lesson he learned well on the streets of Noxus, was how to stay alive.\r\n\r\nHowever, the note had been apparently addressed from a certain Demacian ranger, whom he had associated with on many occasions, and it had peaked his curiosity. Maybe it was a trick after all. He sighed hoarsely, and was about to turn and leave the room before a sudden voice called to him from the darkness.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Took you long enough. Feels like I&rsquo;ve been waiting here for hours.&rsquo;\r\n\r\nTalon whirled, brandishing an arm of steel to his right, his blade glinting in the light from the candle-fire. His amber eyes seem to roar alight in the reflection of the flame.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Show yourself, I&rsquo;m in no mood for games.&rdquo; He warned, hissing out the last words from his mouth.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Geez, someone&rsquo;s cranky. Stub your toe, assassin?&rdquo; The voice taunted him, before stepping out into the light, revealing herself. Talon grunted low, gesturing with his blade.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Mind telling me what this is all about, ranger?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn let out an irritated tsk. &ldquo;Will you relax for just one minute? I&rsquo;m not here to expose you or anything. I&rsquo;m actually here to help.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon&rsquo;s eyebrows could not fall any lower.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And why would you want to help me? We&rsquo;re enemies, in case you have forgotten.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn laughed. &ldquo;Trust me, I have no intention to become best buddies with you. But I have information that would benefit you, so hear me out.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Information? What information could you possibly have that would be of benefit to me?&rdquo; Talon inquired, relaxing slightly, but still keeping a cold, suspicious demeanour against the ranger.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do you want my help or not?&rdquo; Quinn demanded impatiently. Talon rolled his eyes, sighing briskly.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now, so tell me what you want from me. What is this precious information you have for me?&rdquo; Talon spoke low, and steadily, lowering his blade.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You are looking for General Du Couteau, correct?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon&rsquo;s eyes narrowed dangerously.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What about him? What business is it to you?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn placed a finger to her chin sceptically.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, I found the sudden disappearance of General Du Couteau strange myself. So I decided to look into it. There aren&rsquo;t many actual reports or cases about his disappearance. However, with some investigating, I think I&rsquo;ve managed to find a lead.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon&rsquo;s eyes widened, but he swiftly regained his steady gaze.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What sort of lead?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAs the Demacian ranger moved over to the bookshelf, Talon carefully observed her, his dark eyes glaring into her back as she reached for a dusty collection of reports from the shelves. His mind wandered in curiosity. Why was she helping him? What information did she hold of General Du Couteau that he didn&rsquo;t? It didn&rsquo;t make sense. Whatever the reason, Talon was determined to find out.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t answered my question, scout.&rdquo; Talon informed her, in a low voice. Quinn turned to face him, watching as his eyes burned into her skin.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what question might that be?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You still haven&rsquo;t explained why you are doing this. Why you are helping me, your mortal enemy.&rdquo; Talon responded, his eyes narrowing.\r\n\r\nQuinn sighed, turning back towards the bookcase, leaning against it, with her left hand for support.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;My reasons are my own. My advice would be not to question my actions, or I might be tempted to change my mind about informing you. Does that answer your question?&rdquo; She spoke, in a powerful tone, glaring into the amber eyes of the assassin. Talon grunted in response, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Good, now stop interrupting me, or it will take me all night to find this report.&rdquo; She told him, focusing her attention back on the large bookshelves in front of her, rummaging through the various books and reports. Her eyes lightened up as she found it, and she carried it over to the large table against the back wall of the room, moving the candle onto the table, placing it above the book in front of her. Without a word, Talon lightly stepped forward, his movements deathly silent.\r\n\r\nQuinn glanced over her shoulder at him, gesturing for him to come forward. Talon walked up to the table, leaning over next to her at the large report book in front of him. Quinn pointed to the report on the sudden disappearance of the great General Du Couteau. Talon studied it carefully, making sure to observe every detail within the text. Quinn watched his eyes dart left and right, and smiled as his eyes widened.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It says here that the last place he was seen was within the head-quarters of the Black rose, at the Noxian Capital. But that can&rsquo;t be right. He was seen heading into the Black Rose head-quarters alongside&hellip;&rdquo; Talon paused, almost spitting out the names next listed in the reports. &ldquo;LeBlanc and General Swain. He suddenly disappeared, following the assassination of Boram Darkwill.&rdquo; Talon&rsquo;s gaze lowered dangerously. &ldquo;Looks like Katarina was right.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn&rsquo;s brows furrowed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon quickly glanced at the scout beside him. &ldquo;After General Du Couteau&rsquo;s disappearance, Katarina believed that Swain and the Black Rose had something to do with it, but was never given any substantial evidence to prove it. But now, we do have the evidence.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn raised an eyebrow. &ldquo;And how do we have this evidence exactly?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon&rsquo;s mouth tugged into a rarely seen smile. &ldquo;Because, General Du Couteau disappearing that shortly after Boram Darkwill was assassinated? And then Swain claiming victory over Keiran Darkwill and becoming Grand General of Noxus, even after the rumours of the &lsquo;Master Tactician&rsquo; being involved with the events that led to the battle of Kalamanda? It all makes sense. First, Swain and the Black Rose assassinated Boram Darkwill, and then removed General Du Couteau, and with LeBlanc and the Black Rose&rsquo;s help, Swain seized control over the High Command. This was their goal all along. I should know, I was there when he took control.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn turned to glance at the book in front of them, her eyes straining from the dim candle-light. &ldquo;So Swain personally removed all of the threats to the position of Grand General, so he could claim it for himself?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon nodded. &ldquo;Right. In Noxus, strength determines everything, in any form. He already proved his personal strength, and then he sought to prove the strength of his leadership at Kalamanda.&rdquo; Talon paused, folding his arms. &ldquo;Looks like the information here proves Katarina&rsquo;s theory. The battle of Kalamanda was set up, the battle between Swain and your prince was all staged by the Black Rose, in order to assist in Swain&rsquo;s ascension as Grand General.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn eye&rsquo;s widened. &ldquo;Prince Jarvan must be informed of this immediately. If what you predict is true&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon turned, striding towards the door to the Library.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s true, and I&rsquo;m going to prove it.&rdquo; He stated, his eyes set upon the door.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Quinn demanded, and was rewarded with Talon turning to face her, his amber eyes filled with a fiery ire.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find LeBlanc and get some answers. It&rsquo;s about time she confesses to what she knows.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And what makes you think she&rsquo;ll tell you?&rdquo; Quinn questioned the assassin, folding her arms.\r\n\r\nTalon smirked lightly, gesturing with his blade. &ldquo;I have my ways.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nQuinn let out a sigh. &ldquo;Of course you do.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon turned, and walked to the entrance, placing his hand upon the door handle, before he stopped, and glanced from over his shoulder at the woman behind him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I should have killed you when I had the chance, Little Bird.&rdquo; He spoke, in little more than a whisper. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me that.&rdquo; Quinn retorted back at him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;What, am I irritating you?&rdquo; The man challenged her patience, with a minor chuckle.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;More than you know, assassin.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nTalon smirked, before he turned away, opening the door and leaving the room, his cloak of blades whirling behind him.","replies":[]}
