Unfortunately I don't have any answers for you today, but maybe I can add a bit of context to the issue.\n\n_Here's what we know about achievements right now:_\n\n + **Riot** used to be very keen about adding achievements to the game. In the past we even had an [achievements tab](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/attachment.php?attachmentid=854543) in the client, but this was removed in patch 3.7\n\n Since then achievement icons have become an occasional thing included in special events, but apart from that achievements really haven't moved forward for a while.\n\nI wonder if Riot wasn't able to implement achievements due to limitations with the client at the time? It's possible that the new reworked client will open up the possibility for achievements again.\n\nIf anyone has any additional info on this, I'd love to hear it ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-21T01:49:27.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are achievements though.\n\nUnlocking mastery points, rising through ranked and getting champion masteries.\n\nSure they're not achievements like Steam or XBox, but they are achievements.","replies":[]}]}
