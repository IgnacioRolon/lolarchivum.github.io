She really shines vs moderate sustain or less melee characters, and low sustain mages. \n\nShe has extremely good sustain for a mage (Mantra'd W is a lot of healing [2x20% of missing health!], as well as a shield - nevermind if you're able to start flask + pots!), so she can really bully a lot in lane. Basically, if they're melee, you can constantly lay down a normal W as they go in to CS - it makes them choose if they take damage or not. If they decide to go in, you can simply punish them with autoattacks that reduce the cooldown of your next W and Mantra. If you're able to use this to get a level lead, you can then build an Early Randuins / 2xCloth Armour, and sustain them out. \n\nAgainst mages, she's still very solid because she scales extremely hard with experience / levels compared to a lot of top laners - her damage scales so well, she's able to build tanky vs them while keeping up in damage. \n\nOn top of all this, if you're far enough ahead, you can just build straight damage items. Haunting Guise is always amazing on this kind of build, with the splashing into HP, and Karma's high base damages. \n\n</ramble!>","replies":[{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2014-12-03T11:24:55.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you said Karma was a surprisingly effective as a tank top, I thought you were joking :).

Depending on how confident you are on mana sustain, Morellos early might be better! \n\nIt looks like you were up against Pantheon top? You might want to consider buying some cloth armours to build into a Warden's Mail during the early game as well (to be turned into a Randuins late game). This is generally only worth it if you're not well and truly ahead like you were in that game! It's also more valuable vs low sustain champions (like Pantheon) because then you can create a war of attrition that you will always win with your W + Mantra.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2014-11-24T12:50:16.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fill or feed","replies":[]},{"poster":"ADC or Cry","date":"2014-12-04T06:37:59.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jungle/ADC","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-11-26T20:49:31.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support.
