To begin with I thought someone had mystery gifted me something but no, what I saw was even better. The message that appeared was something along the lines of \"You have been recognized as one of the top mentors\" something like that. So had a look and read through and I do believe that this is the message that appears when someone is awarded the helpful crest right? So I immediately and I mean IMMEDIATELY started a custom game to see my new crest in action. But it turned out that I still had my Great Leader (or the yellow one, I forget what its called) crest. Is there a way to change it? or is it just a slow display between the notification and the award or am I completely and utterly wrong about what the notification even means. \r\n\r\nI understand that this is not even remotely important but any amount of help on this topic would be so very much appreciated its not even funny.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-01-28T22:55:49.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sounds like you have unlocked a new Honor crest to me - from what you've said, it sounds like the Great Mentor. \n\nWith Honor crests, if you own more than one, you will only see one showing when you're playing a game. The only ribbon that acts differently here is if you have the Honorable Opponent crest, it will always be the one shown to players on the opposing team.","replies":[{"poster":"Omegadraconis99","date":"2015-01-30T00:58:45.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so while I have the new crest it may not even show up? I remember reading somewhere that if you have multiple the rarest one appears. And since I've only ever seen one blue one id assume that's the rarest right? Thank you for the reply by the way.
