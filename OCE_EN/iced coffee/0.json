A bugsplat error would appear and the launcher would relaunch leaving the error. This repeated until I closed the exe through task manager.\nA few friends have been getting this error as well. I found a rather simple fix that worked for me and them;\n\nGo to your League of Legends installation directory (Normally; C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends)\nRun &quot;lol.launcher.admin&quot; and click launch.\n\nNote you have to keep launching it this way.\n\nI've also heard turning off Discord overlay fixes it, but my friend has overlay off and still had the issue until he did this. Though turning off Discord to launch the launcher works just as well.\n\nPlease fix this Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Metuzals","date":"2017-09-23T21:56:55.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two of my friends are having exactly the same issue. It appears to have come up in the last couple days. Reinstalling did not fix it for them, even completely purging their machine of all things LoL and reinstalling.
