I'm just letting you know that you might have a wrong option in one of the pages. The question was \"What would you spend rp with\" and one of the option says \"runes\". As far as I know, you cannot purchase runes with rp but rather rune pages. Overall it is a good survery and I think this actually would help you find out what the people thinks of the league of legends community and is community proud of saying \"I play league of legends\" and would recommend league of legends to their friends. I honestly think this survery can change alot of things just by posting the results later on when the survery ends. I honestly never recommend league of legends as a game because of the amount of saltiness in it, I also never say that the league of legends community is a good community to be part of because of certain things. I really loved the question \"Are you buying rp to support riot\" or something like that. If you are not posting the survery result later on, can you please tell me the result for that question, I wanna know if majority of the people buy rp to buy skins or is it to support RIOT company.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Madi","date":"2016-05-24T00:16:19.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool survey, thanks for sharing!
