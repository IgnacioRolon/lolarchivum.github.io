If you only have the choice of 1 tank then i would probably favour someone with hard cc so that they can soak damage and peel. If you have 2 tanks then one of them can be an engager to get on the back line while the other is still free to lock down and or peel for the damage dealers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-14T22:57:33.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeryLastGrimm","date":"2018-03-11T11:41:17.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the best tanky engager at the moment would be either {{champion:154}} as his E into ulti combo is terriyfing if he lands it, the other being {{champion:57}} just because his W is point and Click CC, makes him invulnerable to most damage, and this sets him up for the rest of his CC. Most tanks apply hard CC, The two kings of CC atm are {{champion:516}} and {{champion:111}} as they both (I believe) have the most ablities that apply CC. \n\nBut most tanks can do both hard CC and engage as they have both but some are more reliable than others.","replies":[{"poster":"Y R U Running","date":"2018-03-11T12:04:48.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I've heard Zac has amazing CC and that he does rely on his E though it can be dodged pretty easily. \n\nMaokai I have tried and he just doesn't suit me. \n\nOrnn I will try though as his ultimate is amazing.\n\nNautilus I have tried but I feel like he just doesn't do enough damage.\n\nAny other engagers but not tanky like Rakan for an example?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-03-14T22:51:42.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nautilus does damage, get a haunting guise, build full tank with thornmail and sunfire, finish liandries, max w for dueling, or e if you're already ahead. Q max on Nautilus is terrible unless you're ap nautilus which I don't advise.\nNautilus has some very high base damages as tanks go, the trick is to be aggressive since your e does more damage if they try to run away.\n\nI mainly played nautilus support but I also used him toplane. I've had games of support nautilus where I have literally decided fuckit, my adc isn't here yet but that twitch is looking a bit too cocky and that brand hasn't got much mana left, I've gone in and killed him, or when a darius has won toplane because my toplaner is a potato and is dead and I need to hold top, I've gone in with my support budget and levels, and I bash him about a bit and force him to flash away because just because i'm a support, does not mean I will not kill you 1v1. I took ignite with full intention of killing anyone who underestimates nautilus, top or support. \n\nAlso low elo, ignite nautilus top is terrifying (and somewhat mandatory because you have issues in the early-midgame with lifestealers and midgame by the time you have a thornmail and your core build, you should be focusing on teamfighting instead because like most tanks, you don't win the 1v1)), and ignite nautilus support is an amazing kill lane.\n\nNaut is an amazing midgame tank, his lategame scaling isn't as great since whilst his w makes him oppressive when ahead, and he has alot of damage, amazing lockdown and cc, but isn't very useful lategame once adcs can do consistent armour piercing damage. Nautilus is a strong early-midgame tank, since his w allows him to take very onesided trades, his q allows him to zone enemies and pick fights, his e forces enemies away from waves has good damage and allows him to push hard when necessary, his passive roots people and gives him better short trades since it does just about as much damage as sheen and can make enemies hesistant about engaging or diving you and helps hold people in place as you beat them up, and his ult is a great, 'counterplay... yeah... that thing...' since it helps lock people down and does alot of damage and is great in skirmishes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeryLastGrimm","date":"2018-03-14T05:17:44.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean Sion would apply CC but you gotta be good with the ulti, Warwick may be good his fear hurts alot and his ulti is scary, Jarvan IV would probs work well for what you want. His Flag and Drag combo is a good knockup his ult is a good thing to keep enemies close although is a double edge sword as allies cant pass through it, In sayin that J4 can delieve the orianna ball or Galio Knockup which can set up a good team fight for your team. Speaking of which Galio wouldnt be too bad, you can build ROA if you want or go full tank your choice\n\nTL:DR Try these guys {{champion:59}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:3}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2018-03-12T08:15:38.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"J4, has CC, engaging combo, top and jungle both can be played, has early damage even though you build tank, but can be a 1 one-shot assassin if you go full damage\nHis weakness is that his skills are game changer.
