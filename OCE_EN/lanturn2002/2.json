Life advice k?\n\nThose acquaintances of your at school \"that called you trash\" are not good friends material; Dont expect them to consort you when you are depressed. Dont bother trying to get their recognition either. After HS you most likely wont be keeping contact with them any way.\n\nLeague is the only thing you know how to do??; Its probly because league is the only thing you DO. Play sport, be active, be outgoing, enter a club and go interschool competion. This is much more rewarding and will give you personal growth exprience. Which inturn, help you getting into a good uni or other areas that look at leadership or team participation activities.\n\nDont waste your time in league just so you can be socially accepted within your group of uncaring \"mate\". Trust me on this, when you get to an age that you can go to bar or club, you want to have wide range of social knowledge and topics to talks about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2018-04-08T21:44:38.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are few things to get familiar with\n\nFirst: get the right runes for every champ you play. You can do this by gg how pro players set up for each champ, understand why they choose some specific rune points by watching some professional league competitions and pay very close attention to the caster's analysis\n\nSecond: get the best itemization for every champ,too. Why did you even think Mercury tread would be good on an adc champ? Enemy team has too much cc? Quicksilver sash then. Mercury tread wont save you when you get hit by cc, you will eventually get one shot anyway unless you can instantly remove all cc \n\nThird: please please and please, TRINKET!!!!! \n\nAnd last: stop spamming support every game, spend time playing different roles to learn other crucial skills like last hitting, auto attack mechanics, controlling neutral objectives etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"collects","date":"2018-04-08T15:37:00.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok without looking at your match history here are a few tips. 1) this is not a job. Your not getting paid to play this game so do what feels fun. I always get serious towards the end of the season because I want my gold boarder but till then enjoy and don't suffer from burn out. 2) only have 6 champ you main and master those champs mechanically. If you want to main others have more than one account. That way you don't tank your rankings while learning those champs. 3) match making does put you in games you can't win it's a known fact and if your sitting at 55% win rate it's 100% going to happen unless your a god and you don't need a team. 4) mute toxic players then block them. In all honesty just mechanically mastering 1 well rounded champ is enough to make gold. Mine was kayle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-08T12:16:35.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ain't even played that long and you're already Silver.\n\nKeep going.\n\nAlso, sounds like you're in high school.

You simply are not.\n\nI'll tell you why you feel so helpless? Because you effectively are. The enemy is watching you and your team from a mile away.\n\nWhy do I stress the importance of Red Trinket and vision control so much?\n\nHere is just one example:\n\n1. a) WITH SWEEPER - With Sweeper turned on, you can walk to a spot on the map, knowing you aren't detected. Even if they have wards, you can sneak past them, or destroy them. THIS IS HUGE! Say you go from Dragon Pit to enemy's red-side Raptor's brush with your sweeper turned on and you detect nothing. You can camp that brush, confident the enemy doesn't know you're in there. This is called SETTING UP EFFECTIVELY.\n\n1. b) WITHOUT SWEEPER - You go from Dragon Pit to enemy's red-side Raptor's brush without sweeper turned on. If they have one single ward, they see absolutely everything you are doing. You are sitting ducks, and will soon be dead ducks.\n\nThe advantages are too many to list here. I guess my point is: if you don't go Red Trinket, the advantages you are depriving your team are immense. You can only expect to lose if the enemy Support is vision controlling and you are not. \n\nThink about it as this. They have map hack. You don't. Yes, vision control is actually that OP.\n\nIf the enemy Support is just as bad, and doesn't go Red Trinket, then it's just gonna be a fiesta. It's bad beating worse.\n\nIf you are going to main Support, you ABSOLUTELY MUST learn vision control. ABSOLUTELY MUST.","replies":[]}]}
