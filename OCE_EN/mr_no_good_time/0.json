It's essentially to prevent people from just ditching a game, and then still being rewarded for it because their team managed to really pull together. DCs happen from time to time of course, and it sucks to lose LP for it, but if it's only once, then you'll earn that LP back in no time and in the grand scheme of things it shouldn't really mean much. If it's happening a lot, then you need to look into either preventing it or accepting the consequences of it (and probably avoiding ranked)","replies":[]}]}
