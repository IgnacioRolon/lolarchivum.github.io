Maybe just an in-client method of making all Champion and announcer VO from other countries accessable?\r\n\r\nPlease consider!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-08T11:29:40.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I definitely support this. I mean hell, it's definitely not an extremely niche and unheard of thing since many people have been using add-on softwares to do exactly that, so why not just make it a part of the options menu (to prevent file clogging and audio taking up extreme amount of space, simply make the options \"ticked\" and VO would only be downloaded and updated if the whatever language pack is ticked in the options)?","replies":[]}]}
