That Graves is okay right now? If so then sure.\n\nWhat you don't seem to get though, is tanks are rising, and thus the tank-killer ADCs (Jinx, Kog'Maw) or the ADCs that can evade the tanks (Sivir, Graves) also rise. Corki is in there as well because he does all 3 kinds of damage, armour shred and is able to peel for himself.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-04-09T03:39:12.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay first of all, no.
