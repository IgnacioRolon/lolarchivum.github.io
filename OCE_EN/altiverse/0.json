They give you the blueprint to create the first strike borders and 2 project cores each. (you need 7 cores and a blueprint to make the border).\n\nThe rest is RP only. So basically the IP icons are for nothing.\n\nYou can buy the Champion Skins, Ward Skin and 3 Icons for 5271 RP.\n\nThe Project Boxes work like Normal Hextech boxes. They are slightly more expensive than normal hextech boxes HOWEVER have 2 items inside and guarantee 2 Projext Cores to create the borders.\nInstead of paying 1950 RP for 10+1 Hextech Boxes. You pay 2950 for 10 Project Boxes + either 1 free box or a Gem.\n\n-----------------------------------\nTLDR\n \nTo gurantee you get all 3 first strike borders, skins and icons, you spend 8220 RP for the Skin + Project Box bundle.","replies":[{"poster":"Altiverse","date":"2016-08-02T04:40:43.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks alot for this :)\n\nPS Is the Disruption icon RP only too? or are there 4 IP icons? o:","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-08-02T06:21:02.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the disruption icon wont be released until next week. but looks like yes, it is 1500 IP","replies":[]}]}]}]}
