It was while he was casting a pro match and I can't seem to find it anywhere, but it went something like this:\n\"It doesn't matter why he wasn't there, what matters is that he wasn't.\"\n\nThis is in reference to the team making a teamfight play or allowing themselves to be initiated on while one of their teammates was obviously not nearby. Point being that it doesn't matter why the person wasn't there for the fight, what matters is that the team chose to fight without them and lost when they could have been more patient and made a better play later.\n\nIt made me realize that choosing to take an uneven fight just because we're ahead wasn't primarily the fault of the person who wasn't there, it was mostly the fault of the person initiating or getting caught because we chose to put ourselves in the position for the uneven fight to happen.\n\nLooking at your replay, the decline of your team in that game was primarily due to players choosing to fight with missing enemies and without respect to the fog of war/lack of vision on their flank, or fighting at a clear disadvantage when other teammates were not nearby. Sometimes they were in base buying an item, sometimes they were clearing a wave at their turret, other times they were indeed out of position on the map when grouping was the optimal choice.\n\nBut if they aren't nearby, don't feel forced to fight. It is better to concede a little pressure and be alive for when your teammates are in position for a fight than to just fight because \"it would have been a good fight if they were there\" &lt; that's a decision trap that a lot of players fall into and one that took me years to stop doing. It doesn't matter if it would have been a good fight if they were there, the fact is that they weren't. So choosing to take the fight is clearly just another wrong call in response to a wrong call made by one of your teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"im ICEMAN","date":"2018-06-18T12:04:01.762+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS IS SO CORRECT, the best macro decision is that one that also accounts for what the full context of the game (AND THE OTHER PLAYERS) is. \n\nThis is clear for example when you win a team fight and have multiple objectives to choose from. \n\nMaybe YOU want prioritisation of the inhib opposite Barron (if a viable option) to help snowball (transition into Barron while enemy has to clear suppers on the opposite side of the map), but your team wants to take a different inhibitor or objective, maybe they just want to clear the enemy jungle and reset. If you go try to solo take that objective and disregard your team, its longer them who are out of position it is you. \n\nIts all a two way street that requires all members of the team to participate. \n\nThe players who is farming (maybe and adc) needs to have the map awareness to know when and where a fight might break out and whether he has the potential to participate (0.5 - 1 lanes distance away) and affect the outcome (maybe using the theory of numbers advantage, if anything insane has happened etc.). \n\nThe grouped (or partially grouped) players need to not take a disadvantageous fight especially if their team isn't in position to take something on the other side of the map or join the fight (or if you dont trust them to join the fight). And instead you can wait patiently for the split push to create pressure before you show on the map creating your own pressure. (This is really over simplified, NEACE on yt had a good guide to split-pushing macro, while I dont think he has perfect macro its a very good start)\n\nThere is a LOT of macro in league and its impossible to say that anyone ever knows THE best play but assuming its always the teams fault is going to be wrong response every time another league coach Allen 'xFSN Saber' Chen says something like 'the 4 other members on your team a NPCs and what they do can be simplified to RNG. Because of this never type to them and always make the play that doesn't rely on them. Instead be self sufficient whenever possible and concentrate on anything YOU could do better. \n\n10/10 post from Gehim just wanted to tack on my 10c","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-06-06T23:41:46.207+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hardly a rant tbh","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-06-09T11:35:29.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes more like a mild winge","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-29T02:23:10.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid necro...","replies":[]},{"poster":"TYLER1TRUEGOD","date":"2018-06-29T00:53:43.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyones trying to do a new meta were ADC doesn't exist no more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-06-07T14:07:00.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OCE VortexDragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=2EE9w4BW,comment-id=,timestamp=2018-06-06T12:24:00.491+0000)\n>\n> I'm done with these teams.
