I like the new queues (Solo/Duo and Flex).  I don&#039;t play on the Flex Queue purely because I don&#039;t find it competitive.  I&#039;m not here talking about it being bad or not.  (You can talk about that yourself).  I&#039;m here asking why would Solo/Duo queue be gone around 3-6 am (Australian Time I think.  Correct me if I&#039;m wrong.)  I&#039;m from New Zealand so its worst because the the queue is gone at 6-9 am. I could be trying to play a game then notice that the Solo/Duo queue is gone. Same goes for the Flex queue.  Its gone at 9-11 am (New Zealand time I think.  Correct me if I&#039;m wrong) I don&#039;t have a problem if flex is gone because I don&#039;t play on it.  But for someone that wants to play flex, it wouldn&#039;t be fair for them to wait for the queue to be back.  Sure they could play normal/aram/other rank queue/special game mode that out right then.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind about the queues.\r\nWhy would the rank queues be remove at some point in the day?\r\n\r\nQuestion/s :D\r\n\r\n#1 Why remove queues in the first place?\r\n#2 Why at that time?\r\n#3 Do you guys hate me for making this?\r\n#4 Are you guys able to remove queues at a better time? (I play in the afternoon as well but it I&#039;m not in the mood to play by that point because I might be tilted. Its a habit I have of getting mad xD)\r\n#5 Why is dominion still part as a game mode in the home page ;)\r\n#6 Will you have a good day?\r\n\r\nThis is from the worst sliver 5 player (Not bronze :D)\r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful day.     \r\n\r\n#GETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
