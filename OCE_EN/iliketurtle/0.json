I&#039;m now Sliver 3-2 at this moment but that doesn&#039;t matter.\n\nI want to talk about the topic of the esport around OCE.\n\nI&#039;ve been reading a lot of OCE boards lately but correct me if I&#039;m wrong as I&#039;m quite a young person talking about this.  I enjoy OPL.  I like it but its not exciting at all.  Their isn&#039;t anyone making &#039;plays&#039; lately.  Our region low elo wise, I think in my opinion is a lot better compare to NA/EUW.  But the  small player base makes the top level kinda bad when we can&#039;t learn from other region because of our location and ping.  I&#039;m very surprise that not much events happen in OCE at all (or that I don&#039;t hear about) so I feel riot should have a list of tournament for OCE that they could start up.  I think this would make the community a lot more competitive  and have some region guest as part to increase our knowledge of the game from a different region play style that we can take.\n\nIn my opinion, OCE could be a really good competitive region.  Sure our player base is VERY small but this also has it advantage.  I haven&#039;t seen anyone talk about how fast our region game play CAN change.  What I mean by this is that when a new meta is being played IN OCE by the top players, they can spread the game play and knowledge down the ladder faster as our MMR is kinda stretch so it reaches lower elo making the game have a better sense of the meta faster.  I&#039;m pretty sure this plan is bad but I&#039;m just putting my voice out.  One day, I hope OCE can do well in the wildcard rounds.  (Until then, I&#039;m just gonna grind out my games to get as good as I can in the game as I LOVE it.)  (\n\nI heard a thread about Tainted Minds but I don&#039;t want talk of that as I care about rioters feeling (I have no idea whats going on with the story)  \n\n(Side track not with esport so you can skip this if you want)\n\nI haven&#039;t had much flamer or trollers.  I RARELY get them which I enjoy.  (I don&#039;t want this post to feel like I&#039;m attacking riot so I&#039;m gonna give them happy vibes to make their day) \n\nTL;DR \n\nI started early 2016 and sliver 2.  This is my POV heading into this\n\nI&#039;m young so I will have lots of mistakes.  I kinda wanna revamp this topic\nIts a boring region (High elo wise)\nLow elo is acutally pretty good compare to other region\nWe can&#039;t get good I think because of Location and Ping\nWe could be a good region (idk, this is my opinion)\nMeta spreads easily towards lower elo faster (Because lower player base) as so few people have good MMR\nGood job with making our games enjoyable (To make Riot Happy and this post isn&#039;t about hating them)\n\n!Ideas!\n\nMake a tournament list yourself riot to make the player base play more\nBring over other teams from other region as guest players in our rank/tournament\n\nThats about it.  Hope you enjoy this topic.  I kinda just made this to revist to what seems to be dead topic in terms of acutally talking about it.\n\nBy your fellow Sliver player, Iliketurtle\n\n(Please ask me what I have done wrong and what I can change and edit about it.)\n(You can also post your opinion down in the chat as I would love to hear other people opinions)\n(I'll add people comments I think is worthy with problems/idea/solution)\n(If any Rioters are reading this, I'm not hating.  I'm just pointing some stuff out and to telling you my opinions and others in the chat)\n(Also, Hi :D)\n\nAdded Input in Comment By LaKIGR :\n\nHalf the problem is riot doesn't really give 2 shots about oce and the other half is our pro plays still have to work and study they don't earn anything for play, out side tournament prizes. Unlike in other regions like NA or LCK where they can scrim all day everyday\n\n(One week after the original post)\n\n(I want the comment section to be about the topic, plus don't flame Riot. Ok you can flame them but just do it respectfully plz.)\n\nI've been reading the comment section down below for a while now.

I haven't heard of OCS, OOL, or Throwdown/Showdown tournament. Maybe you could try to promote it like you did to MSI. Rip Dire Wolf. You'll get them next time. Also whats is this sever skin about?

Its is our goal to have an event on every weekend and run a ladder in the off season to help players keep growing. You probably wont find official riot tournaments that are not for pro players. Currently its up to the community to provided these. Riot OCE is quite small, so their main focus is more on setting up pro scene at the moment, which is fair enough, there really inst enough money in the scene at the moment. \n\nWe have an article on tournaments and where to find them: https://www.summoners-society.com/tournaments-places-to-find-them/ \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/\n\nSo hopefully this can help you as a player and hopefully have more talent come through! \n\nAs for your comments on improving the scene, the more the community get behind the pro scene the more money can go towards it and help it improve! So getting people to was OCS/OPL, supporting your teams with icons etc..  OCE is small and new, it will take time to get at place where its strong. \n\nThings that can help improve the scene\n-Tournaments for members to play in, hopefully find new talent\n-Supporting OCS/OPL (Viewing parties/watching it!) \n-Buying icons \n-Getting your friends into league of legends. \n-Share the events with family and friends \n\nRiot do really need to improve when events are on though, which I think this season they are getting much better at! Its very clear in the client MSI is on. They started a facebook page this year as well, their twitter is good for keeping update to date with events. \n\nOPL players don't have to study anymore and have gaming houses. A lot of them have the chance to put in 110% now, so over the next few season, you'll probably notice a big jump improvement. Teams are boot camping over seas now. \n\nHope this helps,\n\nSumSoc","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-03T00:13:32.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great info and initiatives - thanks for being awesome SumSoc! {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-04-29T06:28:29.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So as u said the reason oce does so poorly at IWCI is the fact we can't scrim with better teams.

There definitely are complications around being so geographically isolated - they can't scrim China or Korea teams without bad ping issues, but we are definitely trying to solve this problem.\n\nFor the second point - the pro players earn a Minimum of $500 per match week of the OPL (which is 20 weeks a year) plus any prize money, sponsorships or top ups that the team provides them and we also help the teams provide gaming houses so that they have somewhere to live (i.e Free Rent) and they actually do scrim and train full time this year. Some probably do study still which is good, but this is their job now.\n\nAnyway I don't want to just chime in with a 'listen to me I'm papa Riot', I just wanted to provide some context and hear your thoughts? \n\nI'm mostly glad to see that people are passionate about this topic, because I want us to be competitive as badly as you guys do!","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-05-04T10:45:54.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so firstly u say that riot invest heavily into the oce region, yet I don't see it. We only just recently got all our teams into gaming houses and even when we did finally get them they sucked. Or at least tainted minds did. On top of that we have no tournaments in the oce region besides the OPL and that's it. so again I ask where exactly is all this money going as I don't see it any where. And what ever amount your do end up spending in oce on gaming houses or what ever else u spend it on. All it does is put us at the level that all the other severs have been at for years. Hell we are still 4-5 years behind the Korans. \n\nAs for the second point just as a comparison in the LCK spring SKT T1 who took first place took home a grand prize of $89,571 USD. Now in the OPL split 1 Dire wolves who took first place only got $11,923.12 USD, Now I understand that we are a smaller region as such our prize pool is much smaller. However the grand total of the LCK prize pool is $264,234 USD the grand total for the OPL is $23,846 USD. What our players earn in comparison is shit all its barely any thing. I earn more as a cabinet maker apprentice than these guys earn playing at the highest level of play we have. \n\nOn top of that they made us wait 2 years for a sever skin, when we finally got the skin we had to pay for it and on top of that not only did the skin not represent the oce sever in any way, the skin feels like it was put together at the last second and oce was told to just deal with it. Bloody hell huntress sivir feels more oce than what we got. \n\nHonestly it feels like oce is the forgotten part on riots to do list that u just stuff under all the other more important stuff and when you do end up reaching it, your just put in under another pile of more stuff","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-05T06:58:29.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely understand your perspective - and I agree with you, we are still so far behind the LCK (who is literally 10-20 years ahead of every other region in terms of Esports infrastructure). I'd love to see our players earning as much as the other international players - it's a matter of supporting the competition as it grows, attracting sponsors and partners that can help us grow the OPL to the size/scale of the other regions, then we can actively grow the prize pools, player payments etc. The money we are investing is being spent as efficiently as possible, but it does cost a lot of money to run a team - we have seen some really big improvements in the team infrastructure across all the teams, as well as lots of amazing content being created and building up the profiles of the teams and players which is awesome - but it does take time to trickle through to results of course!\n\nI also agree with your sentiment behind tournaments, although their currently is the OCS, OPL and OOL, as well as the Throwdown/Showdown pro-am tournament - it would be great to see more tournaments - particularly community driven ones. A thriving community of competition underneath the competitive scene is important and something we would definitely get behind. \n\nWe really appreciate the feedback though!
