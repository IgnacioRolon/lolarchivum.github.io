Personally I like Akali Jungle with Smite Ignite because I find she snowballs really easily and the enemy team have trouble tracking you and as you are a strong Assassin and duellist this can be problematic for them - couple this with strong sustain, decent clears and a passive that loads up while you farm Jungle on top of your insane sticking power and recent buffs and you've got one nasty Jungler.\n\nGet counter-jungled though and enjoy a very difficult level 1-3 phase.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-27T10:34:04.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maining 1 champion in the jungle can only get you so far, Rengar is pretty diverse in what role he can play in a game as an assassin, bruiser or tank but you should be using other champs too, if you're a good Rengar then Rek'sai might be worth your time, problem is that unlike Rengar, she has no reliable sticking power so you'll need to get chilling smite or you will fall off late game. Nocturne is a great, underrated champion that plays like Rengar but offers more to teamfights. His strengths are diving the carry and picking off lone enemies with his ultimate and killing them with his damage and CC, although he lacks the stealth of Rengar, he makes up for it by bringing great utility in the form of his ultimate and the ability to zone someone out of the fight, but he has fallen off a bit due to tank meta, still, he is a great pick that isnt likely to be taken from you, however, with a new devourer coming that sounds OP af, I would definitely try and learn a jungler who can scale off it, such as Yi, but much less played, Nocturne remains a good example but there are probably more champions who could make more use of it.","replies":[]}]}
