Man that sounds so cheesy... anyway, I am looking for some advice on champions to pick up and/or main as a new mid lane main. Im a gold2 Season6 and current rank in flex top lane main looking to switch roles for a bit of a different experience, Mainly getting bored of the same role.\r\n\r\nI have started playing {{champion:38}} as of a few weeks ago since i was interested in him and i can do decently well, just lack the ability to carry even with my positive kda and decent farming for a roaming assassin. I like his kit but and he suits my style. along with {{champion:245}} and {{champion:105}} but i need a safer more reliable mid to fill the hole for waveclear and safety. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nAlso does anyone have some advice for a new mid laner? considering it was my 4th preferred role.\r\n\r\nTHANKS! also looking for someone to play with :D","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-24T04:03:05.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you like kass you should pick up ahri.

Also dont try to make any plays at any point of the game because the risk is always greater than the reward just sit under your tower farming until you get a gank. However If you wanna have fun thats a very different story. Id start by closing league and picking up another game instead","replies":[]}]}
