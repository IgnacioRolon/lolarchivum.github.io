I&#039;m personally finding it difficult to stick to just one role whether it be Top or JG. Part of the reason is the champs others is the reliance on a team or what one role brings that another doesn&#039;t. I cant stay with one role anymore and I guess I&#039;m 50/50 split with what to play. any advice for someone who cant play a role and should i stick with 1 and just grind it into myself or change between what feels best at the time?","replies":[{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2016-11-16T07:05:42.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"change to the role to what you think is best game by game if you find it more fun, thats the main reason to play lol to most. H9wever if ur looking to climb fast, playing 1 or 2 champs that can play either top/jg/mid (2 out of these 3 roles) is probably more effective.","replies":[{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2016-11-16T07:06:36.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"a good example that fulfills these conditions is ryze","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T00:55:50.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always useful to have a second role, and most people who want to play ranked do. Enjoyment aside having that versatility does a lot for your play. I for example main supp > mid. The most distinct advantage I have is that when it comes round to teamfights I know the capabilities of our support and know when they can back be up or when they can't. The second is the obvious, that I have something else I am confident to play if I don't get my main role.\n\ntl;dr Pick up a second role, it'll help you all round :)","replies":[]}]}
