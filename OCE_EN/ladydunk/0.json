But they seem to be old and outdated so I want to ask this question again.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I've never owned a MacBook before but I really want to because they look so freaking awesome. Currently I have Samsung tablet pc which runs lol just fine with occasional lag (not sure if it's the laptop or the internet problem). I play adc a lot so even the tiniest lag is enough to drive me crazy. To make things worse, the screen part of the pc sometimes disconnects from the keyboard port, leaving me with the mouse control only..... so I really think it's time to upgrade to new laptop.\r\n\r\nI've been thinking of getting MacBook this time, and I know what you guys are thinking: 'if you want performance, go for pc... blah blah'\r\nI just want to know if MacBook is good enough to play lol without lag or heating up too much.\r\n(besides, have you guys seen the new gold MacBook pro?? it looks amazing).\r\n\r\nIf I do go for MacBook, I would probably go for MacBook Air or the cheapest and smallest (I think 13 inch?) of MacBook pro with retina and SSD. Anything above that is beyond my budget.\r\n\r\nSo, how are those two when it comes to LOL?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-26T12:04:39.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> MacBook\n\n\\*facepalm\\* \n\n> First of all, I've never owned a MacBook before but I really want to because they look so freaking awesome.\n\n\\*double facepalm\\*\n\n> If I do go for MacBook, I would probably go for MacBook Air or the cheapest and smallest (I think 13 inch?) of MacBook pro with retina and SSD.

You sound just like my friend when I told him I wanted to get a MacBook.\n\nFirst of all, gaming is not the main reason I want to get a new laptop. I need one for my uni stuff and if I can run lol on it, that would be nice.\nAnd I only play lol. Don't really play any other games that require higher spec so it's pointless for me to get a high quality pc that I'm not going to be fully satisfied with when it comes to non-gaming related work.\n\nanyway, thanks for your input.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-27T03:20:03.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I think you misunderstood my point.\n\nYou're wanting a new computer and you're on a budget. The fact you want to use it for more work related tasks than gaming doesn't change the fact that proper PCs are more cost efficient than macs.

Just don't play at the maximum settings and you will be fine. Apart from that, If you can, go for the Macbook pro range as that gives you more processing power.

Anything over medium high to me is considered not playable to do frequent fps drops. I do alright with medium high, but if i find my fans are getting really loud or if 150 fps is not needed I play medium.

Apple is a garbage company with overpriced products but since they look like alien shiny tech everyone buys it. I can handle people needing a MacBook for school or already having one but if you are going to get one for the sake of it and ignoring the facts, I have something to say:\n\nI was so damn excited to get a Mac, it looked so cool and I thought I would enjoy it until it died. You get so used to the bad UI and operating system. It's so slow and bad specs and the pricepoint, it throttles and limits FPS, it can't apply even the best specs properly on the operating system. As soon as I switched to Windows (and PC in general) after 3 years of using the Mac which costed $2300 for 8GB ram and a crappy GPU.\n\nIf you need something to use on the go and can't get a desktop just look at some of the higher quality laptop brands, which happen to be cheaper than the mid range MacBooks.","replies":[]}]}
