Have you ever had any other type of punishment such as a chat restriction/14 day ban? Prolonged periods of negativity are just as bad as one-off occurences of extreme behaviour (such as inting, racsism, etc) and will eventually be punished with a permaban. \n\nWhile this chat log does not contain anything that immediately stands out (such as the typical encouragement of suicide, racism/sexism/homophobia/ableism), it shows you being a toxic player and contributing to a negative team environment, which is 100% punishable. \n\nIf other players are \"baiting you into fighting\", simply mute them at the first hint they are trying to do this so you don't get triggered.
