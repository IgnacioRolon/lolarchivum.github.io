I dropped 20 dollars on the spot because I decided I wanted to fast level to 30 to get into ranked quicker, so I could play with my irl mates. That was money wasted. Here&#039;s why. \n\nRecently, in maybe my 12th game of league of legends, I encountered an 18 year old with a good taste in &quot;dark humour&quot;. I wish I had access to what he said during his chat logs of the game, but they unfortunately belong to whoever at riot controls such things. This Azir was very upset at all of us right from the get go, he was dying a hell of a lot and being genuinely uncooperative. Quote &quot;I&#039;m not doing anything to help you c*nts&quot;, etc. Que me coming into the chat, I started berating him (which probably wasn&#039;t the smartest, but hindsight is always 20/20). This was all just internet haha as far as I&#039;m concerned, until he said &quot;I hope you all get cancer.&quot; Now I&#039;ve had my father pass from cancer maybe two years ago, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to remind this player of his humanity. I stated my experience ingame, not really sure what I was expecting as a response. I knew deep down that because it was the internet it could go both ways, but in any case I decided at the time it was the best course of action. I was wrong. He said &quot;Yeah, he probably deserved it.&quot; I was pretty offended, but not quite so offended as when players on the OPPOSING team were telling me to get over it, how it was simply a case of &quot;Dark humour&quot; and that I was &quot;Too immature&quot; to understand. \n\nHowever, this isn&#039;t even what really made me MAD. What made me angry, was that I received a 14 day suspension (Hence losing my 7 day xp boost that I paid MONEY for in the process) due to my replies. They weren&#039;t the kindest, but I&#039;ll drop a copy paste of my chatlogs for the suspension and you guys can decide for yourself whether or not you would have said or done the same things in my shoes. I do not think what I said ingame was worthy of a 14 day suspension, but thats just my two cents, maybe I&#039;m biased. What do you guys think? Here&#039;s the chat logs (CHAT LOGS: Game 1\ni flake ss: stfu lmao\ni flake ss: you went in at a stupid time\ni flake ss: irel\ni flake ss: you just left\ni flake ss: hahahaha\ni flake ss: why\ni flake ss: nice missing call azir\ni flake ss: lol\ni flake ss: aight azir\ni flake ss: im gonna report you\ni flake ss: and so is the rest of the game\ni flake ss: and ur acc will b banned\ni flake ss: n u can go be a toxic little rat to the rest of ur irl &quot;friends&#039;\ni flake ss: get off my cock lol\ni flake ss: are you upset\ni flake ss: hahahaha\ni flake ss: hes upset\ni flake ss: can we 9x report this azir pls, he just wished cancer upon all of us lol\ni flake ss: idk man my dad died of cancer so its a bit offensive\ni flake ss: holy moly\ni flake ss: ur getting a 9x report azir\ni flake ss: or close to it\ni flake ss: enjoy ban\ni flake ss: GIVE IT TO HER\ni flake ss: LOL\ni flake ss: azir\ni flake ss: you use memerdreamer69\ni flake ss: unironically\ni flake ss: youre a disgusting, friendless virgin\ni flake ss: and you&#039;re gonna get a 9x report\ni flake ss: azir is super toxie\ni flake ss: he said\ni flake ss: my dad probs deserved\ni flake ss: getting cancer\ni flake ss: thats not something thats funny\ni flake ss: thats like legitimately offensive\ni flake ss: do you understand that dark humour is funny when its appropriate, clearly wasnt appropriate there\ni flake ss: you&#039;re just some 15 year old idiot with a huge ego and you&#039;re gonna get a ban\ni flake ss: ill def\ni flake ss: ????\ni flake ss: you&#039;re both as bad as eachother hahahaha\ni flake ss: Can&#039;t cope with social interactions?\ni flake ss: mate i dare you in person\ni flake ss: to go up to me in person and tell me you think my dad deserved to die of cancer\ni flake ss: i&#039;d drop u on the spot\ni flake ss: lol..\ni flake ss: ????\ni flake ss: I am a victim here hahahaha he said my dad deserved to die of cancer???\ni flake ss: That&#039;s not funny????\ni flake ss: ?????\ni flake ss: He already said we should all die of cancer,\ni flake ss: so i reminded him of how ppl behind keyboards are human\ni flake ss: in the hope that he&#039;d realize\ni flake ss: that it wasn&#039;t a good idea\ni flake ss: to say such things\ni flake ss: and then he took it over the line lol\ni flake ss: irelia\ni flake ss: you shoulda focused akali\ni flake ss: gg\ni flake ss: focus akali ok\ni flake ss: go kill\ni flake ss: ill defend\ni flake ss: end\ni flake ss: we can push\ni flake ss: ggwp\n\nTHE USERNAME OF THE AZIR WAS \"name removed\"\nTHE USERNAME OF THE EZREAL WAS \"name removed\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-01T12:25:46.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so HeartVine addressed most of it but I think there's some extra context I can give you.\n\nFirst of all, just because you got punished, doesn't mean they didn't.

Azir's behavior was dark and unacceptable. Dark cancer jokes intending to insult another player (like azir to this guy's deceased father) should be dealt with accordingly. That being an instantaneous perma-ban. You're only delaying the inevitable when you let this guy stay in the community.","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-01T18:18:58.470+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone deserves a chance to reform; if they've blown that chance, then sayonara.

With that in mind, if you haven't received the previous punishments (10-game and 25-game chat restrictions) I'd recommend submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to appeal the ban (I'd recommend selecting \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\"). It's possible that the system identified certain terms/phrases and didn't properly catch onto the context of them, which can happen on the rare occasion (no system is perfect, after all), so that may be a contributing factor if this is indeed a case of escalation. On the other hand, if you have previously received both the chat restriction punishments, an appeal will more than likely fall flat on it's face and amount to nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-01T07:20:12.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're just going to get told you should have muted and reported at the end of the game.
