I just had a particularly toxic ranked game and after typing out what felt like a paragraph of description I hit enter to get a gap between my my initial paragraph (about the players negative attitude) and then discuss their requests for me to commit suicide in paragraph two. Unfortunately for me the enter key just automatically sent away my report and I was unable to discuss how this player told myself and another player to commit suicide, claimed it was funny that people do commit suicide, and then made racist jokes.\r\n\r\nI would hope that ticking 3 boxes on the left hand side is good enough for people to read the whole 45 minute chat log but I feel that this whole mess could be fixed with any of the 3 following options, 1 enter brings up a review before submit button., 2, Enter is a paragraph button and you need to click to submit, or 3, it&#039;s only me and I need to be more succinct.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-02-09T12:03:30.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think if you shift click enter it will go to the next line instead of posting it\n+","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-03T01:28:02.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ticket is more or less a conversation with the Riot staff, it doesn't just end with 1 exchange. The support ticket is designed to be like an online chatroom for that purpose (though the first 1 or 2 responses you'd get are most likely scripted response unless your case is very unique in some manner, they do that for time and efficiency reasons).\n\nSo you can always follow up with more information within the same ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-02-06T01:53:11.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you might have misunderstood (unless im the one whos misunderstood) and hes talking about the post game reporting function as opposed to player support.\n\nIf im wrong then you cant follow up with more of anything, due to the fact you only get to report once post game before the \"report\" button disappears","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Heylryn Namoriel","date":"2017-02-03T00:08:09.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, point taken, I was just soo salty and needed to get my point across!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2017-02-02T15:33:22.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or dont press enter next time haha ;P","replies":[]}]}
