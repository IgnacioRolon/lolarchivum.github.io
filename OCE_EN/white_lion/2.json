Also then, there would be a champion that is suited versing a team of all ap. \r\nThats about as far as I got with the thought, so I wanted to put it out there and see if other people thought it was a good idea or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-17T12:06:17.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have 4 AP and 1 ADC and enemy has a Galio, the game is LITERALLY relying on the ADC to do well.

SV and Banshees, Void Gate or GA. QSS and Hexdrinker. These may seem like a small amount of choices but building 2 of these plus Mercury Treads already makes the enemy team do such a low amount of damage to you expecting you to have a fair amount of health and they aren't a 20 / 0 LB with full build and 20 stacks of Mejais. Right now is the tank meta and its only going to get harder to anything, adding a tank MR scaler will just ruin the double AP or triple magic damage with Corki or Kog bot lane and be to easy to counter with a single pick or item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-05-17T00:09:48.143+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-17T00:30:23.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crackdogrock,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Ljo2eNxs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-17T00:09:48.143+0000)\n>\n> Well honestly, magic damage is there to keep a unique type of damage so people can't just stack armour.\n\nyeah plz no mr thornmail xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-05-17T00:55:27.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing you guys have never played {{champion:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-17T10:45:06.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair galio is an old wives tale at this point, i only ever see him in aram, ARAM!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-17T03:19:15.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I lelled @ this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-05-17T01:01:01.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GaZ MinT,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=Ljo2eNxs,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-16T23:49:10.747+0000)\n>\n> there would be a champion that is suited versing a team of all ap. \n\n{{champion:3}}","replies":[]}]}
