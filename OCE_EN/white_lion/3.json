On the upper left of the window, click \"Change adapter settings\" and then identify which adapter is the one you're currently using to connect.\n\n>Right-click that adapter and go to \"Properties\". Then, in the box list, scroll down to the bottom and select \"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\". Do not check/uncheck, just highlight it. Then click \"Properties\".\n\n>Note down the settings present as they are before you edit them; you'll need to be able to restore them later on. Then, change the lower part of the window, \"Use the following DNS server addresses:\" to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 respectively. Hit \"OK\" on the two windows, and close everything else.\n\n>Then, in your start menu, find \"Command Prompt\". You can do it by either looking in the Accessories menu or by searching. Right-click \"Command Prompt\" and run it as an administrator. Then type in \"ipconfig /flushdns\". Then reset your computer.\n\nBest of luck in doing that, but if you find it doesn't work, could you test out League on another connection, like say a mobile tethered hotspot or something? I'd like to see whether it's the computer or the connection (or both, even).","replies":[{"poster":"White Lion","date":"2015-04-06T10:01:23.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The server addresses did not work, internet disconnected then stayed that way until I changed back.\n\nAlso, it is most likely my laptop since you mentioned it, it is slow and it tends to freeze very often, almost like lagging in game, but its the laptop itself that does it, I have experienced it freezing and then shutting down.

Don't change anything else in that dialogue as it may get rid of your connection. Good thing you noted how it was originally so that you could change it back.\n\nThe reason I say this is that if you use a different DNS, it wouldn't cause your internet to stop working. Unless your ISP has implemented code specifically to prevent you from using their services if it thinks you're using a non-default DNS (which I've never come across, but it's a possibility), then using another one would not disconnect you, thus leading me to think that.\n\nRule of thumb is that you shouldn't use a laptop for gaming, because most often they're only ever built to handle word-processing and 3D object editing, nothing as intensive as hours-on-end gaming. What's the average frame-rate you get from it, playing League?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
