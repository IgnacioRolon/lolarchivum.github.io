The problem is though that when I entered a vs. Bots game my camera would not properly follow or move for me with the arrow keys (unless I held the space button which isn&#039;t ideal) and I had to double click to do ANY abilities. \n\nThe thing is when I went into training mode to adjust my settings solo, everything worked fine as I just had to click once to shoot out my abilities and the arrow key camera movement was totally responsive as it was before I took a long break from League.\n\nThinking it was fixed, I jumped into ARAM and suddenly I am stuck with awkward ability clicking and camera again...so I assume its something to do with me playing with other players thats causing it. \n\nIf anybody knows how to fix this, it&#039;d be much appreciated.\n\n(I&#039;m on MacOS Sierra version 10.12.5. if that helps).","replies":[]}
