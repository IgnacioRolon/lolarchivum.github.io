However I feel as if in order to climb I need someone of a high elo to give me guidance/reassurance. I need someone to help point out my mistakes and to help me stay calm in games when I am not playing well and I lose confidence. \r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if a high elo player could take me under their wing and help me to improve. If you think you are this person add me and message me in game: BubbaCuz \r\n\r\nThanks again","replies":[{"poster":"pu55y d3stroy3r","date":"2016-02-04T01:52:32.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I can coach for a fee if necessary.

Most important factor to climbing and gaining elo is to make sure you search your team mates up in champion select. If they are garbage, dodge. \n\nThe differences between bronze 5 and bronze 2 is the same different between bronze 2 to plat 5. As you can see there is a huge between bronze5 and 2.

Improvement simply requires a good attitude and with time you will develop high level mechanics and game sense. It doesn't matter how well you play, there's always something you could do better. It doesn't matter how bad your teammates play, there's always someway you could've played better. Sure, some games may be unwinnable, but I guarantee you that in 50% of your loses where your team throws and gets caught especially lategame, if YOU don't throw you could stall out the game and prevent them from ending.\n\nI suggest using \"/mute all\" and recording your gameplay with OBS, then looking over at your mistakes. This is the best way to avoid the sweet temptation of laying all the blame on your teammates. There is no major secrets or ways to improve in a week from a silver level player to a diamond level player. But, as long as you have the right attitude and put the time into learning the game, you will improve at a fast pace.\n\nIn terms of developing your game knowledge, no one on these forums could sum up the game in just a few paragraphs, you should put the time into watching youtube videos from high level players that explain the game. Don't watch some Plat 5 yapping about, look for professional / at least high diamond level analysts. I suggest you visit Lastshadow9's channel, he is a professional analyst and puts up videos of him during his coaching sessions, they are very useful. Hope that helps brotha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-04T04:14:27.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not high elo but I can help if you want.

We don't have map awareness. 3. We are greedy.\n1. Everyone doesn't know whats more important. Too many times i see people focusing more on kills than Objectives. A Good example is when an ahri and is escaping to the jungle thats unwarded. Now u could go chase her in that unwarded jungle and have a 70% chance of getting ganked and killed.... Or u can take the safer route and push the wave, recall or attack tower if u are above 50% hp. There are many other examples but if i did i would be writing a comment longer than the game of thrones books COMBINED. 2. Look at the mini map every 10 secs and don't blame team for not MIA. 3. Don't go for kills and instead focus turrets, drag and baron. I don't care if your 146/0/50 but all your nexus turrets are gone and u haven't touched a single turret because at the end of the day kills don't win games, Objectives do.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-03T07:54:57.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kills are really only important in the early game. It's a big thing for support if they can get their ADC a few early kills, but you're correct in that in late game objectives should take precedence. \n\nNow sometimes (especially if you're behind) you do have to kill three or four of them to be able to push objectives. If they have a really fed Rengar and Vayne then chances are you aren't going to do much pushing if they're alive, so if you can kill the two of them, push push push.\n\nBaron calls are also something a lot of people struggle with. A good way to judge whether it's a good call or not is to look at how much space you have for it. Are two of them in bot lane? Great. Is their jungler fed, alive and mia? Not so great. Are top and mid lane pushing onto them? Do you have vision on 4+ of the enemy? Great. \n\nBasically this one is just remembering what to consider and common sense from there. Where are your enemies? Where are the minions at? Are any of them dead? Where is your team/what is their hp? Can you kill it quickly or will it take you a while? Ask yourself as many of those kinda questions as you can and you'll have a pretty good idea of whether or not it's a good call or not.\n\nAs for map awareness, you need to get into the habit of checking it anytime you have downtime, and in fights where not all are present, any spare second you have. You're running to lane? watch your map. Just disengaged? Check your map (but make sure you're out). That kinda thing. Map awareness and vision are such a huge underrated thing in the lower elos. I don't pretend to be an expert, but I'm kind of in that point between where some games have great warding and awareness and some don't, and the difference is very obvious. Check your map people!\n\nAll that said, anyone who just wants tips or advice is welcome to add me, I'll help wherever I can :)","replies":[{"poster":"BubbaCuz","date":"2016-02-03T13:30:18.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers mate.
