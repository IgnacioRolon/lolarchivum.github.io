I don&#039;t know about the rest of you, but i haven&#039;t been here that long but TEAM SELECTION and the process to going into a match is sickening.. Its simpley so frustrating that you often find yourself with people unwilling to work with you or let you play the area you wish to play... BUT for some reason you wont let us back out of those games.. you instead PUNISH us for leaving because we know the GAME wont work with such IGNORENT people.. \r\n\r\nSo you ask,. Well your ranting about a problem i am commonly finding myself tackling daily on here. so what do you suggest young noobling to lol.\r\n\r\nWell. Pretty simple, but this is to be DISCUSSED on how it would be implimented into the game machanics and DEVS would need to talk this through. I really do think it would help the game devolp and keep your LOL population playing the game, And keeping there laptops/computers intact from less stress from Nasty Obnoxious Toxic players.\r\n\r\nMy Idea on how to sort this problem out: \r\n\r\nAdd a timer to the start when entering Charecter selection, where no1 can select a char for 1 minuete. FORCING people to talk. Its a team game.. where we gona go if you don&#039;t say what you are best at/want to play/where you want to play. \r\n\r\nADD A BUTTON where ALL team members have to press when ready TO select chars. so then IF there is one person or a couple being compleate Toxic waists. you can then Exit that match creation without punishment timer&#039;s.. [I often find myself clicking out of cliant and closing it] I&#039;d rather suffer 5 mins waiting for another game with some decent people/ players who talk than spend 40/50 mins in a loosing game.\r\n\r\nReason&#039;s other than clearly stating that this is to avoid those game&#039;s where there is no comunication or team game play, Would be that this should of been implimented into the game from the start. ITS A TEAM GAME FORCE THE TEAM WORK ELEMENT FOR THE LOVE OF......","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-22T04:54:17.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I really like your ideas to promote discussion among a team before a game, that's an interesting way to encourage teamwork among strangers. \n\nJust wanted to point out that Riot have already reworked champion select to counteract some of these problems. However, at the moment it's only for Ranked queue :( I see you're not level 30 so won't have experienced it yet, but it really helps a lot with reducing conflict before the game. [Here's](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html) the page that describes the rework - it does say that it will be released in blind pick (i.e. normals) towards the end of the 2016 season, but there's not a great deal of that left, so I'm not sure if that's true or not!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-22T17:07:54.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As long as it's not exactly like blind pick where it becomes a race to lock in your favourite role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-09-22T16:38:26.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres used to be a wonderous mechanic called team builder, where you would choose your roles, and hosts would cycle through you and others to choose which ones they liked. unfortunately people didnt play it for some reason and they shut it down. it was far better than having to support every game because i joined late.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BloodFettisH","date":"2016-09-22T07:13:59.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes  I am not level 30 yet. but this is due to constant Frustration with players not playing. The AFK system needs to be updated to. We should be able to vote to Surrender the game and it not COUNT as a win/loss to either team,. as this is also driving me mad,.\n\nI am not 30 due to these 2 common facts. I keep getting so wound up i won't play it for age's even though i do wish to be playing some ranked game's along side my brother and friends.. But with so much hastle to even play a decent game,. it is driving me insane. and its taken me nearly 2 months to get to this level. as i wont play more than 2 games in a day now due to these reason's.\n\n Im sorry but im not one who will openenly be happy about waisting 1 hour of my life, watching 2 idiots ruin a game which at the end of the day is just some Coloured Pixles on a computer screen and  life > that... If you understand I don't mind loosing but you have made it so worthless to play a game for 50 mins its Infuriating","replies":[]}]}
