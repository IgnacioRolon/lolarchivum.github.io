Did anyone else have this problem? why was it not a loss prevented?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-07T05:10:13.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you all on Windows? They recently had an update in preparation for the upcoming Windows 10, which requires a system reboot. If you were all in game when this happened then you wouldn't have seen the message saying \"This computer will shutdown in three minutes.\"\n\nAnd it's not that unfeasible for at least one of the two people to /ff when they see three others dc (usually because they never come back). And loss prevented is only for server wide issues (although recently, they will allow for some specific ISP issues that affect a large portion of players).","replies":[]}]}
