It has been going on for the past 3-4 days now. If I&#039;m not playing a game of League, my Internet works fine, Steam downloads at 1-2MB/s, YouTube loads 1080P without me having to wait, Internet pages load, even opening the League client and loading into game is all fine, but as soon as I get into game my entire Internet goes to shit. I can&#039;t load Facebook, I have the \"Attempting to Reconnect\" bar on my screen 90% of the time. My ping goes back to normal for about long enough for me to walk to the outer turret, maybe get a couple of farm and then just goes to hell again. Sometimes I don&#039;t even make it past the Nexus.\n\nI have no idea what&#039;s happening, because at no point does my ping start to go up. It goes from 10 to instant disconnect and nothing works. After the game everything works fine again as well.\n\nAny ideas as to what might be causing this issue?\n\nUPDATE: Tried uninstalling and reinstalling League. Same thing happened while I was downloading. Everything was working fine and then the install slowed to 1kB/s, YouTube stopped loading, couldn't even load Facebook. I stopped the download and now my Internet is working perfectly fine again.","replies":[]}
