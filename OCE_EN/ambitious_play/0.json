Since I just got some dumb automated answer, which didnt help me at all because i had already done all the things the reply said, i will post this here. I just got a new comp (windows 10, i7 2.6 ghz, GTX 960m) which is more than enough to run LOL. Every LOL game i get into I get this graphical bug which actually made my computer crash once, so i really need to get this fixed. I will post a photo. So far i already run LOL as admin, I have updated drivers, and have tried rolling back my graphics driver, i clicked the repair button in the client, i reinstalled the league client. The only other game i have on this laptop is COD 5 which runs smoothly, so i definitely should be able to run league.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-06T06:48:07.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWow, that's quite the graphical glitch you're experiencing.\n\nIt looks to me like there's an issue with your GPU driver (Although you said you've tried updating it and/or rolling it back.).\n\n>The only other game i have on this laptop is COD 5 which runs smoothly, so i definitely should be able to run league.\n\nCOD 5 (I'm assuming you mean World at war) actually has lower system requirements than league and more than likely will cause less strain on your GPU. It's possible your GPU may be faulty, as you said the system is new (Assuming it's a laptop as you listed a mobile GPU) I would recommend returning the laptop for an exchange if at all possible.","replies":[]}]}
