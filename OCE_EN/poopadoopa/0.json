I&#039;m a pretty bad player in general but i really like lissandra but whenever i play her shes feels like every other champion just out-everythings her. Her range is weird, the fact she isnt tanky is kind of dumb considering she has a lot of low range CC and her passive is just a bit boring to say the least. If im wrong and she is actually is amazing im just playing her wrong what would some tips be?","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-01T03:46:22.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your q increases in range after hitting a target so you can line up some pretty cool trick shots, at later levels its on a very low cd and it becomes your main source of damage. Your other abilities are simply tools for survival while your dish out your dps with Q, so when people come near you, you can root them and kite away with e or chase with e. I often like picking lissandra when theres a yi since you can just press r on him and he becomes useless. Lissandra isn't terrible but she could use some help to her numbers. The problem is if her damage is increased too much she can pretty much destroy squishies with one combo.","replies":[{"poster":"Poopadoopa","date":"2018-04-01T05:27:59.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice!

If anything Liss is on par with if not easier than Syndra. Either way your arguments don't hold up to fact. Simply put, Liss isn't super strong, nor does she have a kit with abusable strengths. She needs to get close to deal any damage, and thats her largest flaw. Because of that flaw she will never break out of being a t2 mage unless her numbers get buffed, and if that happened she'd be busted.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-04-01T06:42:01.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's exactly the kicker right there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
