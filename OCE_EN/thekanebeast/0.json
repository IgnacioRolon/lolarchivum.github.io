Maintaining an overall winrate of around 55% is the key to climbing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-07T03:51:00.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This can also mean they are versing players of a lower MMR than them, so the system expects them to win more than 50% of games to maintain their MMR. It usually occurs when the system is readjusting, basically it's determining if their MMR should drop or not. If they're losing against players of lower MMR (therefore losing more LP than gaining) then their MMR will drop to match.\n\nHowever, there is a significant uptick in complaints surrounding LP gains at the moment, so it's entirely possible there are some issues there at the moment (not that it means everyone voicing those complaints are affected). Given there are already promotion/demotion issues because of the changes to the system, I wouldn't be surprised either way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wild Fires","date":"2018-12-06T03:16:23.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is currently an issue with LP gains. I believe Riot are aware of this and working on a fix. You should normally be gaining slightly more LP per win than you lose per loss. This means if you can maintain a roughly 50% win rate or higher in your games you should see some progress in your ranked climb.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-12-15T19:04:01.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait so your overall win rate determines how much LP you get now?","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-16T00:54:59.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not so much overall, as recent winrate. And it always has. Think about it this way, if you win 1, lose 1, a few times in a row, you should be close to even. However say you win like, 8 games in a row. You will be placed against harder and harder opponents because the game would think \"this person might deserve a higher rank, if they can beat people who are higher than them, i'll give more lp so it's easier to climb\" and vice cersa.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-12-06T13:11:39.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been only getting 13lp per win and -30lp per loss its fucking ridic","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-12-05T17:31:43.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see any games in your match history?","replies":[{"poster":"vincent2004","date":"2018-12-05T20:25:30.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bro i gain 12lp per win in silver like goddam why all of a sudden","replies":[]}]}]}
