I&#039;m looking for the better mid laner and stronger champion mid and later game overall... So who do you think is better, viktor or Vladimir?","replies":[{"poster":"WeakboyLuvLadies","date":"2015-04-05T04:27:27.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythessmurf","date":"2015-04-05T00:22:04.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys, I guess I'm going with Viktor :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-04T23:26:36.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both are creeping into the meta atm. You said Viktor is underplayed. He won't be for long.\n\nAs for strength, I'd say Viktor is better, since Vladimir is nice and tanky with nice damage, but he lacks the CC and isn't as strong in the mid lane due to his short range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-04-04T21:31:09.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both fun, but I would say Viktor's funner because he has a higher learning curve.","replies":[]}]}
