Riot really doesnt even give a **** about us (me atleast) and decides to mute me for the most stupid shit. Legit people are toxic all the time and i&#039;ll admit i have my moments but people say stuff way worse than me. Some players use the &quot;N&quot; word, Other Racial Slurs and Sexism in offensive ways and do not get muted. The only time i would usually curse is when someone is Intentionally Feeding. Cursing is acceptable to a certain degree and I should not be muted.\r\n\r\n Look Riot I&#039;m not a racist like others. I&#039;m not intentionally trying to be rude/toxic or feed but you have legit no idea of how your game works. Its OCE, legit the most toxic server and the people who start trouble in games usually never get muted. You can&#039;t just mute a toxic player they don&#039;t stop. There will always be more until you do something. Stop favouring NA and fix your real problems.

Like, at all?\n\n> Cursing is acceptable to a certain degree and I should not be muted.\n\nYou're not wrong, but there's a clear difference between something like \"f\\*ck me\" and something like \"f*ck you you stupid feeder b!tch\". Targeted slurs/curses are not acceptable, no exceptions.\n\n> I'm not intentionally trying to be rude/toxic or feed but you have legit no idea of how your game works.\n\nOr you just have no idea that you're being a d!ck and don't properly understand that certain behaviours are simply unacceptable. I tend to think the latter is true (as it usually is in these kinds of situations).\n\n> You can't just mute a toxic player they don't stop.\n\nIf you've found a bug with the mute feature where it doesn't actually stop an individuals comments from appearing when you mute them, then you should submit a support ticket to inform Riot of it so they can fix it. Here's a link: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us\n\n> It's called a Tribunal if you weren't \"Buffing\" and \"Nerfing\" the wrong champions you could actually do something that could help this toxic community.\n\nSounds like you don't understand that the people responsible for balance don't handle the player behaviour issues (and vice versa).","replies":[{"poster":"RectalPunishment","date":"2016-11-30T05:08:49.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-30T09:20:30.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RectalPunishment,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=cvjfAEWG,comment-id=00050000,timestamp=2016-11-30T05:08:49.040+0000)\n>\n> [DELETED]\n\n\"skitzfit\" please point me in the direction of this skitzfit.
