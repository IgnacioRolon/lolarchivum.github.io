Sometimes you may even have to queue for 10 minutes before finding another team to play against. An easy way around this is to match team builder teams with other teams from the 'Normal' queue. I don't think that this will have any real negative effects and will only make team builder more popular. Any thoughts on this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-30T05:49:11.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One happens in real time (normal) the other happens over a period of time as people join. What you would have to do is wait for a team builder team to be put together, enter the matchmaking que, only to be joined with 5 people that entered the normal que. Teambuilder people would then have to wait additional time as the blind pick people choose champs and change masteries before getting into game. I think the coding for such a thing would be rather complicated.","replies":[{"poster":"Morro","date":"2015-01-30T06:45:16.981+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it could work if the team builder team is made as per usual up until you start searching for a team, then you would search for a game that adds you into both the queues. I understand that you would have to wait for the other team to sort out their champs, roles, runes/masteries, but that would still be a lot faster than sitting in the TB queue for 10 mins. And yeah the coding would probably be very complicated, I was just wondering if people would actually like the idea","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ghost cat","date":"2015-01-30T16:13:46.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bcos it's not a normal game, it's team-builder..","replies":[]}]}
