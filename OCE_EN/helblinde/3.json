The fact that your were not only placed in low priority queue but were given a 40 minute wait period suggests you've been classified as a leaver or AFK by leavebuster an excessive number of times, so in that respect it's your fault.

In order to be considered AFK by the game you'd need to be in the fountain doing nothing (which is what is considered idle, both by the game and by definition). Considering everything you've said I would strongly suggest contacting support to resolve the situation. I don't know what actually happened but, based on what you're saying, you seem to have not been idle for long enough to be given leavebuster punishments.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-15T04:41:18.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Helblinde,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bWAIGjhQ,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-15T04:38:35.455+0000)\n> because walking back in fourth in base counts as idle doesnt it ( i know idle means standing still doing nothing) but recently before this low queue i had been getting afk msgs after games for dancing around in base waiting for an engage or waiting out the inevitable loss (1min max) the game that got me into this mess was just me sitting in base waiting dancing around for an engage or them to make a mistake we lost, the game ended and the low priorty queue msg pops up straight after the game the most i had actually idle for was 30-1min maximum the system is obviously a load of %%%% since alot of people are having the same problem i have with the queue looping and never actually ending or idling longer than 2mins ya know some people have to up and open the door for people coming around of letting their pets out this is just usual riot bull%%%% as usual.\n\nWell, pfft xD yeah we both know that wasn't something Riot would like players to do but really, I think instead of not moving, Riot now senses 'AFKs' as either not moving out of the fountain, or staying within your base not dealing damage to enemy units\n\nOnly my guess though\n\n{{champion:38}} {{item:3003}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2014-12-15T02:36:10.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I sent a Riot Support ticket about my own problem, not sure if you’re getting it as well but, for me on my main account:\n\nI press ‘Play’ and it makes me wait 20 minutes.
