HELP","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\r\nI have looked on the forums and asked around on how you earn key shards for the knew hex tech crafting system, but for some reason i am earning hardly any key shards.  For the past three days i have played quite a bit of league, but have only earn&#039;t one key shard over a span of three whole days. Im not sure if this is because i&#039;m doing something wrong or if its a glitch, but any in depth info on how you actually earn key shards would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks,\r\nBI0 HAZ4D {{champion:268}}","replies":[{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2016-04-06T05:26:58.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nYou can find most of the information in this article (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide) but it doesn't include a few things. This is an exact quote \"_Key fragments will sometimes drop after victory in any matchmade game mode--unlike chests, you can earn keys in ARAM or Twisted Treeline. Three key fragments can be forged into a single key; you can also purchase keys through the store for RP. \"_\n\nOkay, there are a few things missing from that. \n\n* When Hextech Crafting was first released some players reported that Key Fragments were not been dropping in ARAM and TT. This issue was resolved in the latest patch 6.7 and the feature is now supposedly operational. \n* Riot have said that Key Fragment Drops and Champion Mastery will be active in every game mode of Rotating Queue - the first of which is Ascension.\n* Key Fragment Drops occur a little bit more likely when you play in a premade.\n* Key Fragment Drops follow a non-linear chance curve, That means that when you get a fragment the next fragment drop would be less likely than the first and so on. This effect resets every month.\n* Instances of negative player behavior will impact drop rates. Those with recent chat restrictions and/or bans will not be given any fragment until some time has passed. The Hextech Crafting system incentivizes good behaviour.

I believe this is likely to change with the implementation of Mastery Levels 6 & 7 but that might not happen for a while. Of course it is good to have Lvl 5 because it'll get you closer to 6 & 7 which may have very good rewards (speculation).","replies":[{"poster":"BI0 HAZ4D","date":"2016-04-07T22:56:29.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All good.
