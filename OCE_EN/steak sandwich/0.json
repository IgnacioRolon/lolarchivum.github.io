If we can be reported for inappropriate/offensive summoner names it&#039;s a fair assumption to say inappropriate/offensive team names should fall under that umbrella shouldn&#039;t it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-18T04:52:45.357+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can report them end of game for inappropriate name most certainly (leaving a note mentioning it's for the club tag doesn't hurt either).

So follow that, or report post-game if you get in a game with one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"atomicqueen","date":"2016-04-17T13:13:17.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeahhhh I am 100% in agreement there >_<\n\nI have a bunch of random adds on my account, and one I thought was a decent player recently started talking to me again being kinda toxic, and when I checked his profile out to figure out who on earth he was in the first place, noticed he'd joined a club which was literally named after the Ku Klux Klan. I blocked+unfriended but there was no way to report.\n\nIt reeks, completely and utterly. I gotta wonder what kind of stuff goes on in that group. Is it racist teens who are detached from racial violence enough to think it's funny, and shove that in the faces of people who have to deal with that fear every day? Or is it an active group for planning hate crimes on the League servers and encouraging hate speech? Best case scenario, it's maliciously ignorant and encourages asinine and toxic behaviour in and out of the game. Worst case, I don't even want to think about.\nIt's really screwed up.\n\nI know Riot has been working hard trying to stamp out toxicity in the community but I'm honestly surprised that some of those names/tags weren't blocked from the group options from the first place, and I really hope they get on it quickly.\nYou'd just think they'd have learnt to anticipate those kinds of disasters from the long journey of managing the community so far.","replies":[]}]}
