Just Alt+Tab back to Desktop, so you can check to see what it's doing, or even better, Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager *and* switch focus.\n\nBut that's not so important. From now, test in custom games until you've fixed it. Does this happen every game or just randomly? Have you tried repairing your client (back up item sets first!)?\n\nEdit: Just read your follow up post (which really you should just edit into the OP). What version of Windows are you on?","replies":[]}]}
