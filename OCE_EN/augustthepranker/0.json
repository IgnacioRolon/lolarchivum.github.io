I just had a bronze 4 jungle.. THAT had finished placements. In a silver game. I got a iron 4 adc when I was que for top support. \nThis is crap. When you are in a tier of iron you play with bronze 4 or iron. NOT SILVER!!!!\n\nI am in silver 4 not playing with plat players. WHY IS IRON AND B4 PLAYING IN SILVER GAMES.\nI shouldn't have to carry them and say \" Put a ward here. Check your mini map every 15 seconds or when someone pings \" I should be with players that are doing this.\nRank in pre season was trash. Iron 4 players in adc role standing still to hit something endlessly. \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
