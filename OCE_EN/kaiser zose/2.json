I had that idea a while ago.\n\nMing, The Alpha Primape\nMing is a combination champion that excels in almost any situation. His unique aspect is his seemingly excellent all-round game. He is good in the jungle, as a support, as a tank, and as a fighter. He considers himself a mortal enemy of Wukong.\n\nSkills\n======\nPassive: Monkey Business\nEvery third basic attack punches the enemy, dealing 80% of the base damage to enemies behind the target.\n\nQ Skill: Double Punchy\nYour next basic attack hits twice, dealing an extra 10/25/40/55/70[+0.01AD] physical damage each strike and slowing them by 10/14/18/22/26% for 3 seconds. Also applies the Monkey Business passive each hit.\n\nW Skill: Banana\nPassive: Collects a banana every 24/22/20/18/16 seconds. Can store up to 3 bananas.\nActive: Eats a banana, restoring 50/95/140/185/230[+0.1AP] health and increasing Ming's attack damage by 10/20/30/40/50 for 5 seconds.\n\nE Skill: Rolling Hammer\nDoes a forward flip in a direction then bashes the ground, dealing 60/100/140/180/220[+0.2AD] damage to enemies in front of him and knocks them up for 0.1/0.2/0.3/0.4/0.5 seconds.\n\nR Skill: Ming Of The Jungle\nRoars while beating his chest for 2.5 seconds, suppressing nearby enemy champions and dealing 200/280/360 true damage over the duration. Upon recovering, you gain a shield that absorbs 50/70/90 damage for each champion you suppress.","replies":[{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-16T20:54:06.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually a decent idea.
