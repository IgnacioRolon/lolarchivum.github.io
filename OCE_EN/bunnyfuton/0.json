If I watch a game of league and he&#039;s is casting I am guaranteed to enjoy it. Close seconds are MonteCristo and Atlus. Monte just has so much game knowledge and as I am a slightly less mechanical player that focuses on rotations, objectives and zoning rather then outplays I really enjoy having him break down each game even while its being played live. I also enjoy listening in on his OGN Plus countdown and think anyone interested in a more focused breakdown of each week should go ahead and watch that. As for Atlus I just really like the enthusiasm he shows while casting which I feel most other OCE casters lack. He is also very good at keeping the talk flowing throughout and between games. I would love to see him cast with some of the more well-known casters/analysts such as Phreak, Kobe, Rivington, Zyrene and Krepo just so more people are aware of his talent and experise.\r\nThoughts?\r\nP.S. Unfortunately there is a limit of 10 options so if I missed your favourite caster/analyst I apologise but hope I covered most of the main ones.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-07-17T05:32:49.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like Jatt because he's always on the money with the analysis. But Montecristo, Quickshot, Deficio, Kobe, Krepo, Rivington, Atlus, Spawn, Pastrytime are also good. Papasmithy and Zirene kinda bore me, despite being good. And Phreak is just plain rude at times. The yank crew in LPL are not favourites of mine.","replies":[]}]}
