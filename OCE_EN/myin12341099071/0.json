I sigh with anticipation &ndash; what mischief would I get up to today? I don my coat, my hat, and I glance in the mirror. Is something missing? I grab my glove, and emerge into the world. \r\n&ldquo;Boil in mud, meddling fools, because what&rsquo;s black and blue is about to show you all the definition of pain!&rdquo; Most of them pay no attention, some dare to laugh, but one day, they&rsquo;ll see. Suffering awaits these peasants. But there&rsquo;s no time now. I&rsquo;ve been evading the Bandle City officials ever since the incident. Lulu awaits me outside the city walls, and we leaving together today. I almost blush at the thought. \r\nDaydreaming, I almost don&rsquo;t hear the clanking of metal down the street, the armour of the guards who just can&rsquo;t get over that one time I stole the mothership. I sigh, and throw out an Event Horizon. Off I go; another day, another opportunity for evil!\r\n\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fuzzy! Zippy! Delightify!&rdquo; I twirl and I whirl and I dance in the meadow. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pretty, Pix? So many colours!&rdquo; \r\nPix flutters about in reply.\r\n&ldquo;Huh? Oh, you&rsquo;re right, it does look purple.&rdquo; Turns out the only flowers I&rsquo;d planted were violets. Transmogulating children into flowers is so much easier than planting them yourself. I sigh. In the distance, I see a big metal glove approaching, and I smile. &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; We whirl our wands and channel a teleporting spell, but a sudden commotion breaks our concentration. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;What happened, Lulu?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Shush, Veigar. Look &ndash; over there.&rdquo; Bandle City&rsquo;s royal guard had just mobilised, and was marching out of the city gates. Are they so determined to catch us? They can try! &ldquo;Weaklings! Unimaginable is the power of the Master of Evil!&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Shh! I don&rsquo;t want to have to polymorph you.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re coming for us! And besides, I owe them a healthy dose of suffering.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Let me disguise us, and ask them what they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; She was right &ndash; Bandle City isn&rsquo;t known for violence. So why is the Guard here at all? I can feel the cloaking spell take effect, and we approach apprehensively. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Morning! What are we up to today?&rdquo;\r\n\tThey respond as they continue marching. &ldquo;The fair maiden Sona has been captured. We suspect Noxian spies are guilty. What they want with her, we do not know, but we must retrieve her before anything happens.&rdquo;\r\nSona? Veigar glances over at me and shrugs. &ldquo;What was she doing here in Bandle City?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;She played a concert here last night&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;So she was taken in the night?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Actually, it happened this morning. There was quite a commotion.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Commotion? But Sona can&rsquo;t scream for help&hellip;?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;She was spamming like crazy on her etwahl&hellip; which is clearly a bad sign, because it&rsquo;s not even URF week yet.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Anything we can do to help?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Not really, ma&rsquo;am, just leave it to us.&rdquo;\r\n\tWe come to a halt as the procession marches on, waving goodbye like good, law-abiding citizens while planning our next move. As they move out of sight, we make eye contact, and the disguise wears off. \r\n\r\n\r\n\t&ldquo;Who cares about Sona, let&rsquo;s just leave as planned!&rdquo; Why help this stranger when there is so much suffering to cause? \r\n\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a good chance to win back the favour of the officials? You&rsquo;ll finally have a home, Veigar! Isn&rsquo;t that worth anything?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;But&hellip;all the souls to swallow, all the champions to destroy!&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I want to return to Bandle City someday. I left a life behind there, so I&rsquo;m going to do everything I can to get it back. Right, Pix?&rdquo;\r\n\tPix flaps his wings in affirmation. \r\n\t&ldquo;Okay, V, time to make a choice. I&rsquo;m gonna go follow them now &ndash; are you with me?&rdquo;\r\n\tI roll my eyes. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo;\r\n\tLulu flashed a smile and my heart skips a beat. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go then. I recommend skipping.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWe didn&rsquo;t reach the Noxian capital until late afternoon. The Guard had made a beeline for this place. By now, they&rsquo;ve met with troops from Demacia, Ionia, and Piltover, as we watched from a nearby rooftop. Hm. Looks like kidnapping a pop star is a pretty serious crime. \r\n\t&ldquo;Lulu, don&rsquo;t you think we should leave before we get caught?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;V, that&rsquo;s the whole point. If they catch us, maybe they&rsquo;ll forgive us for what we&rsquo;ve done. It&rsquo;s the perfect chance for a new start, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;But what if I want to be evil?&rdquo; \r\nWhat if I want to be evil with her?\r\n\t&ldquo;No time for this now; they&rsquo;re marching on.&rdquo; The troops split up all over the city-state, marching down all the main streets, and up the mountain. &ldquo;Who do we follow?&rdquo; \r\n\tWhile Lulu decides, I spot something out of the corner of my eye: a small blue crest marking a small alley. It glows menacingly. &ldquo;Lulu, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Let me send Pix after it. He&rsquo;s a great scout.&rdquo;\r\n\tHer purple friend darts towards the alleyway, disappearing as Lulu shuts her eyes. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Shh. You&rsquo;ll see more with your eyes closed.&rdquo;\r\n\tCryptic. Before I have time to think about it, Lulu is alert again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Black Rose; they&rsquo;ve taken Sona.&rdquo;\r\n\tI&rsquo;ve only ever heard rumours of the Black Rose, my biggest rivals in Runeterra &ndash; what organisation is more feared, more evil than the Black Rose? This is my chance to destroy my competition. I can&rsquo;t contain my excitement. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go after them!&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Wait. The Black Rose is scary &ndash; we should be careful.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Nevermind that. You said it yourself &ndash; isn&rsquo;t this the perfect chance to clear our names? Why hesitate when we&rsquo;ve already come so far?&rdquo;\r\n\tLulu is lost in thought. Let&rsquo;s give her a taste of her own medicine. &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m going &ndash; are you in or not?&rdquo; \r\n\t&ldquo;Vroom vroom then.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe alleyway winds and winds and it wasn&rsquo;t long before Veigar and I got lost completely. What&rsquo;s more, the sun set an hour ago, and we had only Pix&rsquo;s light. We raised our wands at the ready &ndash; who knows when something might happen. \r\n\tThe sound of an etwahl. We step towards it tentatively, wands at the ready. \r\n\tA crow suddenly flies at me, and I turn it into a mushroom. A voice from the shadows. &ldquo;Ahh, the Fae Sorceress. What an honour indeed!&rdquo; It chuckles.  Another whisper, indistinguishable.\r\n\tVeigar stays quiet next to me, but I can feel him draining the cosmic energy in the alleyway, preparing to fight. &ldquo;Is that&hellip;the Tiny Master of Evil I sense?&rdquo; \r\n\tHe falls for the bait, and fires a Baleful Strike into the darkness. &ldquo;Not so tiny now, hey?&rdquo;\r\n\tCackling. He missed, and we lost our cover. &ldquo;Go Pix, illuminate!&rdquo; He flies over, and I gasp at the sight. The scars, the cane, the crows. It could only be... &ldquo;Swain! Hand Sona back right now!&rdquo; \r\n\tTwo cackles; his and a woman&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Surprised to see me?&rdquo; She steps forward. Leblanc! She&rsquo;s in on it too! &ldquo;Hand her back, or we&rsquo;ll have to fight!&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Hmph. Watch closely.&rdquo;\r\n\tShe disappears as her voice echoes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all smoke and mirrors.&rdquo; She appears suddenly to our left. &ldquo;Glitterlance!&rdquo; No cigar. Veigar throws out an Event Horizon, catching Leblanc by chance. There is a Primordial Burst of light, and all of a sudden, a second Leblanc appears. They run away from us. &ldquo;Jericho, finish them off!&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Beatrice, go!&rdquo; The crow comes out of nowhere. I sigh &ndash; don&rsquo;t they ever learn? Another crow, another mushroom. But then I feel talons clawing at my feet. &ldquo;Nevermove!&rdquo; Suddenly, he contorts, and his figure undergoes a horrific change. A demonic crow stands before us. &ldquo;I bet you taste like chicken.&rdquo; He cackles. \r\n\tJust as he was about to attack, there was a sudden cry from behind. &ldquo;Demacia!!&rdquo; In a golden blaze, Swain was suddenly engaged in a melee for the death, desperately evading Garen&rsquo;s whirling blade. This is my chance to help. &ldquo;Up we go! Hugeify! Tremendo!&rdquo; Swain is knocked back, and a great sword falls from the sky. &ldquo;Justice!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAll I can do is watch as my mana regenerates. Still, I didn&rsquo;t see where Swain went. When the dust cleared, all that was left were several black feathers on the ground. The Black Rose retreats and I am the most evil being in all of Runeterra. I cackle. \r\n\tSona had been saved by now, and was recovering. Turns out Swain loved her concert so much he wanted her all to himself. What a pathetic kidnapping! I could&rsquo;ve done better. \r\n\t&ldquo;Hey Veigar, you did good.&rdquo; Garen smiles at me. Hmph. As if I want his approval. As I scoff and teleport away, I can&rsquo;t help but think about what&rsquo;s happened today. Noxians being bad, me being evil, Demacians saving the day again, and Lulu&hellip; \r\nJust an ordinary day in Runeterra I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"HarvesterofSouls","date":"2016-07-05T02:52:34.229+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is amazing, great job myin12341099071","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-07-05T04:23:42.023+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice job. Changing first person is a difficult POV to pull off, unless you;re writing a novel, then it is just a change of chapter. I would suggest using an obvious break mark when switching POV. Like this:\n\n*********\n\nI would also consider just doing the story from one POV.
