(Note that the description mentions only basic attacks trigger it, However Leona's W can trigger it twice at once) Also worth noting that if Thresh Last hits a minion, that the Goldshare will still happen.\r\n\r\n-GangreneElbow","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-08T03:36:16.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"UNIQUE - SPOILS OF WAR: **Melee** autoattacks execute minions below 200 (+100% AD) health.\" \n\nKey word there is melee, Thresh's attacks are ranged =)\n\n\" Killing a minion by any means heals you and the nearest allied champion for 40 health and grants them gold equal to the kill. \"\n\nLeona's W is AOE so it should be able to use up multiple stacks if she kills minions with W. It will not execute the minions though. (Leona's W does do quite a bit of damage at times so it may seem like it is executing but it isnt.

What exactly classifies an attack as \"melee\"? It couldn't just be within a certain range of attack, because the different melee characters have different ranges (eg. Xin Zhao has more range than Nunu, but both are melee, and then there's Gangplank). And it couldn't be that melee attacks do not fire projectiles because of the existence of autos such as Vel'koz's or Thresh's.\n\nSo what technically makes an attack melee in game terms?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-09T02:07:11.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I don't have the most technical answer.
