The Support agent will manually review the case and determine if the punishment was made in error, and possibly reduce/remove the punishment based on that.\n\nThe standard progression for chat-related punishments is chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game) then bans (14-day then permanent). If you've skipped any of those punishments, it may be the result of behaviour that generally results in escalation, such as racism, homophobia, suicide encouragement etc. Without further context (such as the chat logs) you probably wont be able to get any feedback from the boards.","replies":[]}]}
