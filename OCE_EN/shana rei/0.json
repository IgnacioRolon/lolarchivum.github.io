I just can't win any games lately.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\r\n\r\nWell tonight has been so much fun (and the last few days)\r\n\r\nGame 1# - Got autofilled support. No worries I&#039;ll play Nami. Laning into Naut and Draven. Tough lane but play passive. Game goes relatively even until they show up 4 man bot and dive us. We both die but that&#039;s fine. Enemy team take tower, rotate to other lanes, 5 man everything. Game goes to utter crap and every team fight is a cluster as my team (even after I said please don&#039;t fight in chokes) just keep fighting. I get blamed for the loss of course but all supports expect to be blamed anyway.\r\n\r\nGame 2# - Nothing to report, played Mord mid into Yasuo, easy lane, everyone did their job easy win.\r\n\r\nMy issue is when I play my main which is top and pretty much only as Fiora.\r\n\r\nGame 3# - Lane into a Riven. Easy lane get first blood and hold the waves. The riven was a smurf (I could tell by the way she played the match up, no silvers play it that way, plus I checked after. Every single champion in her top 5 played had 70% or more winrate). The problem starts when our mid literally just starts refusing to help the team. What turns from a fairly even game across the board with me holding the riven down in lane turns into a 20K lead for the enemy team and a 4v5. As much as we beg the mid laner he refuses to help. Another loss but moving on. (I died way to many times in this game but to be honest with a 4v5 and that much lead and the enemy lucian literally diving the tower for double kills on my team if I went in it was full commit. I was basically just pushing the limits of the champion. I did end up 1v2 the huge lucian and giving him his first death when he was something like 11/0. Sigh.)\r\n\r\nThe Riven smurf was honestly the best lane I have had in a long time, she really new the matchup and pushed it to (at least) my own limits. Both of us using every cancellation in the book, using the creeps and vision. It was a mad lane and heaps of fun. What honestly tilts me is I see people like this and I for the most part can pretty much always shut them down in lane but they seem to win a ton of games. I never understand why, it always looks to me like they get carried by the rest of their team (at least when I play against them).\r\n\r\nGame 4# - The final game of the night. Lane Fiora into Kayle. Plenty of harass my way but it isn&#039;t a deterrent. Our jungler ganks and we get a kill which is nice. Bot lane are leading 3 kills to 1 when a big fight happens. Both top laners TP in but instead of fighting my team runs. I&#039;m left for dead and Kayle gets a double. We lose tower and from that point on the game becomes a crapshoot. After I died I told my bot lane the game is probably not winnable now but they were being positive and politely told me to shut up, fair enough I thought so I did exactly that. 20 odd minutes later I&#039;m roaming, getting what kills I can and keeping the lanes under control to the best of my ability. I&#039;m the only person on the team not unnecessarily feeding or starting fights, I keep decent CS for what little I had access too but the game is just too far gone. For a positive bunch they sure turned sour at the end of the match. Blaming me for the entire loss and telling me I &quot;could&#039;ve&quot; carried.\r\n\r\nTLDR - Win lane lose game or Lose lane lose game\r\n\r\nI seriously don&#039;t understand this game anymore. I try my hardest and I consider myself (mechanically at least) pretty proficient with Fiora but I just can&#039;t win any games with her. I teleport gank, I roam, I take tower, I secure objectives, I focus carries in fights. I just don&#039;t get it. None of it seems to matter I just end up losing anyway. \r\n\r\nI do understand that just because you win lane doesn&#039;t mean you win the game, that&#039;s not the point. My point is I always try to help everyone else on my team when and where I can but it always seems to mean nothing.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify I am constantly evaluating my play, I still make plenty of mistakes and I am still learning a lot of the matchups but jesus if it isn&#039;t tilting AF when you confidently shut out a yasuo, riven, jax or renekton only to have it mean nothing at all.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any pointers I seriously am in need. These games (and they are all I&#039;m getting, I either win easy or just straight lose it without a chance to make a difference).\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll be back for more punishment tomorrow, lets see how many games I can lose!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-17T11:25:51.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't bother with the whole \"Are you warding correctly?\" or \"Are you positioning yourself right in teamfights?\" bullshit, just increase your champion pool to a solid 4-5 champions and when you get the chance try to counter pick into the enemy top laner, seriously as a top lane main myself who can play almost every top lane champion I've won so many matchups by simply just counter picking\n\nE.g Enemy team picks Riven = I pick Cho gath or Garen (Or maybe just darius because I'm good enough on him)\nEnemy team picks Jayce/Darius = I pick Renekton\nEnemy team picks Pantheon = I pick Kayle/Kennen\n\nIf you have to pick first before their top, just make sure you're rotating in your champ pool every game. Champion diversity is strong in this game, especially in low elo.

What what what what what what.\n\nGame before that, someone clearly boosting - All champs less than 30% winrate except jax which was over 80%.\n\nGame before that one, the mid lane on the enemy team admitted he was smurfing and it was quiet clear he was.\n\nIs it so hard to ask for a nice even game.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-03-17T11:11:51.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literal next game.\n\nExact same as above.

However there are always things in our own gameplay we can think about to have done something better and improve.\n\nI want to note on a few things that may help you in these situations to win games more consistently.\n\n---\n\n**Mid Game**\n\nIt seems that you have your laning phase down pretty well, like you said pushing your limits and winning against a Riven that was a smurf, but then you mentioned that the game snowballed from the enemy team from there. So a big thing you might want to look into is vision control.\n\nVision control is such a vital part of league because if you know where the enemy team it lets you plan ahead since you know they are coming, setting up ambushes, avoiding ganks etc. Think to yourself:\n\n* Am I buying enough control wards on average? \n* Am I using your trinket enough to deny or add vision?\n* Am I looking at the minimap enough?\n\nAnswering these questions will help you get a perspective on if you are putting enough focus as you should on vision, and if you aren't it might be an area you want to improve on to help your own and your team's mid game potential.\n\n---\n\n**Communication**\n\nNow I did notice that you mentioned you did communicate with your team from time to time, but think about are you communicating or pinging enough? Communication is such a important part of league, however sometimes it can be hard to get people to listen to you, and that is why **getting a good first impression can help a lot.**\n\nIf you are the top laner ask your jungler before minions spawn what their clear path will be. Ask your team if they want to invade in champion select or to watch out for an invade if the enemy team has a blitzcrank for example.\n\nStart the communication flow with your team early and keep it consistent in focused on winning the game. If you are in the position where you started the communication and you do well in lane, you may find that people will find it easier to trust you and follow your lead. From there you can tell them what objective you want the team to go after next have it be baron, dragon, next tower and get everyone on the same page.\n\n---\n\n**Team Fights**\n\nNow this is a small thing that I noticed you mentioned near the end of your post talking about how you always focus the carries in team fights. In a perfect world this is great because it gets rid of their main damage dealers while yours are still alive. However there is still that front line of the enemy team that the rest of your team has to deal with.\n\nSometimes as a top laner it can be better to stay with your team and deal with the front line first, if everyone is hitting the same target and peeling for your carries, **Ping your team who to target as well.** You will find your team fight wins to be a lot more consistent. \n\nThis point weighs even more importance as a Fiora where you have an ult that can heal a team and let you kill the enemy tanks very fast. If you are able to eliminate the enemy front line while having used your ult to heal your team in the process, the enemy team now has to deal with all of your team being healed by a Fiora ult.\n\n---\n\n**In Conclusion,**\n\nThese are just a few things that if you work on might make your wins a bit more consistent. If these help let me know and if there is anything I can elaborate on or any other questions I can answer let me know. Good luck in your games and your climb!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-03-16T00:34:05.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Elam,\n\nThanks for that. Good write up and good read. It definitely highlighted a few things (especially buying more control wards).\n\n**Mid Game**\n\nComing from a previous support main my trinkets or sweeper are pretty much always on cooldown which is a good habit and are upgraded accordingly, I rarely use the blue but that is just preference and also because I usually see some very questionable wards from our support so I just do it myself. If I can I always ward the enemy jungle (above blue or near red depending on my side spawn) if I've pushed my lane. Try to coincide it with the jungler rotations as sometimes I can get some free kills or buffs.\n\nI rarely if ever play aggressive when I don't know the location of the jungler and try to time it best I can (eg - play aggressive until 3:30 ish when the enemy jungler will be top side then shoot off to ward and play safe until further showings).\n\nI probably don't look at the minimap as often as the very high level players but I definitely am looking at it once every 10 seconds at minimum. I do sometimes get tunnel vision but I usually immediately notice I'm tunneling and break that to check map.\n\n**Communication\n**\nI try to type at a minimum but I use the pings a ton. Enemy missing, ping it twice, ping it twice every 15 or so seconds until they return. If it looks like a roam or TP I will ping danger on top of my teammates and from the general location I think the enemy may come from. It pretty much never works though, people just tunneling hard especially mid laners I find. The best way I found to combat those kinds of players is to simply follow my top laner if they leave lane and ping it as well. I lose farm but generally can save someone from dying and maybe get a kill in the process.\n\ni'll try to communicate more with the whole team and see where that leads me.\n\n**Team Fights\n**\nYeah I completely agree and understand, I was a bit tilted after all those games so it was a pretty rushed post. I know using Fiora's ult is good for shredding front line and if team fights line up that way I usually do and then I immediately switch to the carries or even just whoever is left. \n\nSometimes I get a good flank or notice the carry is out of position. Sometimes I'll even just ult the frontline, tag it twice with a quick reset and then as my team finishes Ill leave them to get the kill + heal and I will go in for the carries. It all depends on the actual fight. I know I make the wrong decisions in these situations  sometimes so I do my best to clean those up for the next engagement.\n\n\nYou did mention above about the Riven game and that the team snowballed. They snowballed only due to the fact that our vlad was pushing side lanes and even when he knew they were coming just hung around and died. He taunted us to report him (I did) and he even admitted not wanting to help us. I concede that game was a throwaway that was completely unwinnable from my teams position.\n\nI'll be back on the grind tonight when its time to get wrecked haha.","replies":[]}]}]}
