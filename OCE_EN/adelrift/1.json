A former vassal of Demacia, he traveled the void in the hope of retrieving an ancient artifact. But the void corrupted him almost completely. He still retains his abilities though, making him a powerful adversary and teammate.\r\n\r\nSkills\r\n====\r\nPassive: Shining Liberation\r\nUpon dying, Percy's soul is released, granting vision of the area for 8 seconds.\r\nArea: 650(+20 per level).\r\n\r\nQ Skill: Mortifying Fog\r\nConjures a cloud of void energy that travels forward. Deals 30/70/110/150/190[+0.3AP] magic damage per second and slows the opponent by 15/2025/30/35% for 3 seconds.\r\nRange: 850, Width: 250.\r\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds.\r\n\r\nW Skill: Void Healing\r\nHeals an ally for 60/105/150/195/240[+0.1AP] health. It can also overheal, granting a shield that absorbs up to 100/150/200/250/300 damage for 6 seconds.\r\nRange: 650\r\nCooldown: 22/20/18/16/14 seconds.\r\n\r\nE Skill: Voidling Scout\r\nSummons a small voidling that travels to the target area. It will then stay in that spot for 60 seconds. If an enemy is within range, it will explode, dealing 35/65/95/125/155[+0.2AP] damage and revealing the targets for 4 seconds. Your passive is disabled \r\nRange: 1000, Vision Area: 450/500/550/600/650.\r\nCooldown: 60/60/60/60/60 seconds.\r\n\r\nR Skill: Azul-Rise\r\nConjures a giant monolith in an area in an area, knocking up enemies for 0.2 seconds. This artifact acts as a turret, gaining 700/750/800[+50 for each 100AP] health, and dealing 80/120/160[+0.5AP] damage per second to surrounding enemies. It will also stun the enemy for 1 second when they are first hit.\r\nCooldown: 120/100/80 seconds.\r\n\r\nSkill Breakdown\r\n===========\r\nQ Skill: Mortifying Fog\r\nIt is what it is. It's basically a rip-off of Anivia's Q skill, without the stun of course. Though it is slow, it has a decent debuff and can pass through multiple enemies.\r\n\r\nW Skill: Void Healing\r\nA great healing supplement that makes Feras so powerful. The overheal makes it a very handy tool.\r\n\r\nE Skill: Voidling Scout\r\nSimilar to Teemo's Mushroom, Voidling Scout will explode upon \"seeing\" an enemy. It can hit multiple targets and reveal them.\r\n\r\nR Skill: Azul-Rise\r\nA powerful turret that can hit multiple opponents. Similar to Trundle's E upon activation, this ultimate can really turn the tide of battle, keep enemies at bay, etc.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think? Any changes needed/nerfs/buffs? Any feedback is appreciated.","replies":[]}
