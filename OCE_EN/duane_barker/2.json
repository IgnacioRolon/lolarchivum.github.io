It only lasts half a second to a second, but everything freezes then when it unfreezes no one is where they were. It makes farming and team fights completely impossible. Nothing else is lagging only league. Speedtest is fine, local software based speed test is fine, problem exists whether I'm on ethernet or wifi","replies":[]}
