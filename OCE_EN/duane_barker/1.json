I've opened 8 in a row, got 600BE in the first 7 and only finally got a champ shard in the last one. Other friends tell me getting BE for them is fairly rare, but happens from time to time. And my room mate who already owns every champ mostly paid for with real world money said he's never got BE in capsules and just has stacks of the same champ shards saved up because he gets so many. Am I just super unlucky? or is it something to do with levels? Should I be holding onto the capsules and opening them when my account is a higher level?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2019-02-23T05:55:37.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you are leveling most capsules give you BE in place of skin shards.\nYou can see exactly what you can expect [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752824-Reward-BE-XP-System-Breakdown)\n\nIt's so that you will end up level 30 with more BE than you would have if you had been given champ shards in the leveling process, and gives you the opportunity to choose your champs from the store instead of feeling limited to the shards you have.","replies":[{"poster":"Duane Barker","date":"2019-02-23T08:57:23.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does that mean if I hold onto them all and don't open any more until level 30 they'll all by champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-23T12:55:18.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, capsule contents are set when you receive them not when you open them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
