But even with all the season 9 changes, this bug that's been around for years still exists. This is a broken mechanic. Autofill is obviously necessary, but this is the worst way of implementing it.\n\nI play my autofill game, I get 3 games of \"autofill protected\". 3 lobbies in a row people dodge, I'm autofilled again. I play my autofill again, I get 3 more people dodging queues and I'm autofilled again. I've had 7 autofilled games in a row on my main. The game is unplayable on weekends and school holidays because young kids just dodge every time they can't play a champ they have a skin for. \n\nI've always played my autofills but after 7 autofilled games in a row I just dodge every time I get a role I don't want now until I get game restrictions, then change accounts and dodge again till I get the role I want. By the time that games finished the restrictions are over, I change back to main and do it all over again. It's ridiculous. If you have 3 games autofill protected and someone else dodges, this should not count as one of your 3","replies":[]}
