I am one of those many people. I just finished them almost 1 hour ago or something. I went 7/10 on my promos and got placed in bronze 4. Last season I was bronze 2 and I went 3/10. I don&#039;t understand why I did even worse now. I don&#039;t know if this matters much but our support in one of the games was dced for around 10 minutes or something and another when our mid left the game. So yeah, I don&#039;t get it. I don&#039;t see how I done even worse.\n\nNow when I went 3/10 I did bad in almost every single one of them, I was carried those 3 times I won. This time I think I did pretty good in most of the games. Does this make sense to you guys or not?  Can someone explain how this happened.\n\nThe link shows 9 out of 10 matches.","replies":[]}
