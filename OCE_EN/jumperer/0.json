The new ranked system is really hard to rank up in. Last season my Acc was bronze 1 and pre season silver 4.\r\nI play my placement matches and win 9 of 10 games and place in bronze 4.\r\nI am still in bronze 3 with a 94% winrate 16 wins and 1 loss yet my mmr has barely changed since the first match.\r\nIf you look at the first match i played the average rank of the teams was iron 1, and now 16 wins 1 losses later I am still getting matches against an average of bronze 4 meaning my mmr has only gone up by 1 rank even though iam i n bronze 3 now and only getting 18 LP per win. No skipping ranks no nothing.\r\n\r\nI like to give ranked matches my full effort and only receiving so little gain from my handwork is very demotivating and thus i just play casual and troll here and there.\r\n\r\nI honestly dont have to energy to play ranked anymore if i am not going to be rewarded for my handwork.","replies":[{"poster":"Magnanimous","date":"2020-02-17T06:06:07.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How much LP are you getting per win?","replies":[{"poster":"jumperer","date":"2020-02-23T09:49:45.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like around 19 lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Xayah0neTrick","date":"2020-02-09T05:47:31.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate I added you in game, send me a message when you jump on.
