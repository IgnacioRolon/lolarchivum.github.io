I played 3 games today of TFT with first giving me LP but the next two games didn't. Both the games were wins with one coming 3rd and the other coming 1st. the time was between 6 to 11 australian time and none of the games i play are premade. this is relly frustrating for me and i should be a much higher rank than i am now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-25T04:59:24.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was hoping some of the other people affected might get back to me too but thanks for the info, I'll pass it on.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"jesusgmserything","date":"2019-07-27T14:09:36.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played about 4 games, placed in the top three on all of them and my LP has not changed.
