After playing a 40 minute match, the death timers never got above 30 seconds and the game ended after the enemy team won two consecutive team fights while pushed up, if they were not pushed up prior to the first teamfight they would have required to win a third. Keep in mind as this is on the howling abyss map there is no option to recall in order to heal up as well. There were multiple times both teams should have lost, up to 15 minutes prior to the end, but were saved due to the death timers being incredibly small, overall leading to a frustrating experience.","replies":[{"poster":"suppaslayer","date":"2015-12-10T12:09:48.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"indeed, we won 3 teamfights at 40 minutes and the enemy team won after 1 hour just cuz of a scaling veigar able to get 1800 ap. It's rediculous how they can all die 3 times and come back even before our minions are at their turrets...\n\n20 sec deathtimer at 60 minutes is not cool rito, I hope this is not intended and gets removed","replies":[]}]}
