It also displayed an error report twice during this time where it didn't unfreeze however it change what was happening.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there is any way to fix this as I do not want to lose anymore lp to an error in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-10T22:55:07.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like what would happen if there was a drop in your internet during champ select.

Did you mean that, while you were in a Skype call and in champion select at the same time, the call was also interrupted while the glitch occurred?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Filtrophobe","date":"2015-02-10T06:57:23.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*New development\n\nI won my next ranked game and I am now on 97 lp.
