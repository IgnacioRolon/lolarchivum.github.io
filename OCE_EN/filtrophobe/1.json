This means I am no longer able to see what anyone is picking and banning, as well as being unable to pick my own champion.\n\nThis error has caused me to fail to select champions on numerous occassions, and the most recent one which just occurred has caused me to lose 10 lp, being close to 0 I am not very pleased about this happening. Collectively I have lost at least 28 lp (7 failures) from this error, which is a fair amount seeing as I don&#039;t play ranked a lot, and there seems to be nothing I can do about it as the error is listed as unknown.\n\nDoes anyone have any information about this at all?  It honestly seems like I lose connection to the riot servers in the middle of champ select without my internet going down, and yes my firewall lets League through.","replies":[]}
