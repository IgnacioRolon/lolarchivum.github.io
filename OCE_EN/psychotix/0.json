A lot of people have told me it&#039;s the fastest and most effective way to learn the game. Right now I&#039;m just kind of going around doing a bit of this and a bit of that, but as I&#039;m getting closer to 30 I want to try and find a consistent role to play (because currently I&#039;m kind of a fail at everything xD), but I&#039;m having some trouble. Any ideas? \r\n\r\nAny help greatly appreciated ^.^","replies":[{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-06-01T08:37:51.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Psychotix,\nUltimately, what you want to main is completely up to you.\nTo be honest, each role is equally important despite popular beliefs and it's about how **you** can contribute to your team in the end.\nStart off by playing a few free champions that have different roles and see which ones you like. \nThen, try playing other champions of the same role to see if you like them too.\nFor example, not long ago, I wanted to be a support main due to {{champion:412}} being my favourite character (still is).\nThen I picked up {{champion:105}} and {{champion:268}}  and decided I like mid too!\nAnd now, I'm thinking of being a jungle main (loving the {{champion:33}} ,{{champion:19}} ,{{champion:77}} ) with mid/support as my secondary as I prefer to help the team out as opposed to getting all the kills and carrying.\nAnd remember, it's **okay to change.** - It isn't like you have to main the same thing forever! Spice it up and try new things once in a while.\nAs a sidenote though, for ranked you want at least two roles you're equally as good at just in case you don't get your first preference.\n\nIn the end though, you probably want a few champions you can play each lane - even if it's just to understand the lanes position.\n\nFor example, I play various champions in different positions such as:\n**TOP:** {{champion:245}} {{champion:150}} \n**MID:**{{champion:105}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:103}} \n**SUPPORT:**{{champion:412}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:37}} \n**JUNGLE:** {{champion:33}} {{champion:19}} {{champion:77}} \n**ADC:**{{champion:81}} \n\nSo I basically have at least a few champions I play every lane, despite not \"maining\" those lanes.\nI tend to favour champions that can move around a lot and have good mobility, hence my champion choices.\nSo playing the game and finding your preference and playstyle will really help you \"main\" a champion!\nIf you need anymore help, feel free to add me. (Name: Frozen Despair)\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"Psychotix","date":"2016-06-10T00:58:48.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SteelerKing","date":"2016-06-01T16:56:04.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about \"which lane do I want to play\", it's about which champs you wanna play.\nAll the champs have some role(s) that they are expected to do.\nYou can try to jungle zilean but that's not gonna work out and everybody will think you are trolling, demoralizing your team before the game even starts.\n\nWant to play Jax? Go top or jungle.\nYou like to play Ezreal? Head bot or mid.\netc.","replies":[{"poster":"Psychotix","date":"2016-06-09T23:17:39.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I originally thought I should main a champion as well, but then when I read some stuff online people said that it's more suitable to find a 'role', if only because there's a chance the champion you want to play would be banned (in ranked), and it's more flexible to, say for example, play mid and have a couple of champions you can play really well in mid. I've asked my friends too and they've given contradictory opinions too xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Waregil","date":"2016-05-31T22:55:29.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely about finding champions that you find fun to play. What I like and enjoy might be completely different from you. Also, once you do find one or more champions you like, try focusing on something specific each game. Like cs/map awareness, etc. Above all, play what feels fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Au Serpent","date":"2016-05-31T14:31:30.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's more about finding champions that fit your play style. if you've played games before, what class / ability's did you have? do you want to be a tank in the front line, a control mage / healer assisting your teammates, an Assassin? find a play style, find qa champion that fits that play style, master 1 champion, learn a few more very well in case of bans.
