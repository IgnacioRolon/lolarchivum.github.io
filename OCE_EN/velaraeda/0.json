I hope some people like this one, even if it&#039;s a tad darker than my entry for the Void competition.\r\n&gt;Enjoy!\r\n\r\nThe sky was dark.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear night, too. No clouds. Perfect for hunting. Perfect for staining blades, for tasting fear. Perfect for sending a message.\r\n\r\nThe moon, high above, deepening the shadows, was red.\r\n\r\nThere was a cult hidden deep within the city, shrouded in darkness and in red cloth. Masks hid their faces. No one must know who they are. No one must know the cult of the Blood Moon exists.\r\n\r\nNew recruits and old members stood around their leader, each one in shadow, masking the power of the blood moon. Behind their masks, their faces were passive, but there was also a hint of fear in their eyes as they beheld the crushing power of the blood moon. They could all feel it, could hear its whispers, its promises. Eventually, they would all sacrifice part of themselves to taste that power.\r\n\r\nSome cultists wondered how their leader could stand beneath it and not even sway where he stood, fixed directly under its gaze. Unlike them, he did not dampen the moon&rsquo;s light with shadow.\r\n\r\nNo one had ever seen his face. Rumour spread, cloaked him in mystery, protecting him from treachery. Was he a demon, too, like the very things they were here to summon, to bend to their will?\r\n\r\nEach one of them was uncertain, even those experienced few, but they were all hungry for power. They readied themselves for the summon, for the spilling of blood that would draw the demons towards the light.\r\n\r\nThe hour was late. It was midnight, now.\r\n\r\nThe mark was chosen, the blood spilt. The mark: a young woman, from a noble house deep in the heart of the city, unbelieving in the power of the cult. A dangerous enemy, if she, as the head of her house, ever chose to believe.\r\n\r\nSomething hidden, watching silently from the dark of the cultist&rsquo;s shadows, answered the call, accepted the mark. Darkness twisted, formed a shape; last of all, silver shone, bloodied by the light, as the blade, the death tool, took form.\r\n\r\nThis was not a new demon.\r\n\r\nOne cultist, the master of ceremonies, the one who knew the names of all demons, tensed where he stood, beneath the blood moon, beside the cult&rsquo;s leader.\r\n\r\nJhin knew the brutality of the demon that had accepted the mark. He had hoped he would never see it again.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the man that became this demon, remembered his skill with a blade when he had been a mortal man, the eagerness in his eyes as he sacrificed himself for a taste of the blood moon&rsquo;s power. An assassin, with the power of the blood moon. A good asset, if they kept him.\r\n\r\nJhin remembered the moment when they lost control of him.\r\n\r\nHow long had it been watching them from the darkness of their shadows? How long had it been sitting there, so close they could have touched it?\r\n\r\nIf another demon had been there to take the mark, would it have killed them all, including the demon, in anger? There was another thing to consider, though. If its bloodlust from long ago was still strong, would it have waited in those shadows until they were more relaxed to do its killing?\r\n\r\nJhin knew this demon would end them all one day, just to see the fear in their eyes as they fell, screaming, beneath its blade.\r\n\r\nIt was expected.\r\n\r\nThe man it once was, the assassin known to the cultists as Talon, had regularly spoken of the same thing, before. He relished the fear in his victims&rsquo; eyes before they died. It was like a drug for him. He had been so eager for bloodshed, Jhin remembered. Eager to test his skill. To see that fear.\r\n\r\nJhin thought that even if Talon had not become a demon, if he had not found the cult and transformed, he would have killed and killed until there was no one left in the world to kill. Fear fuelled him.\r\n\r\nNow, he had the power of the blood moon. And he would have it forever.\r\n\r\nCloaked in shadow, behind a pale, bloodied mask from long ago, a single blue, ghastly eye looked skywards.\r\n\r\nMidnight under a blood moon. A killing moon. An omen of death, of demons and of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA perfect night for assassination.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe first body fell quickly. Silently. It did not matter who they were. It only mattered that they died.\r\n\r\nEach one that fell was a step closer to the mark.\r\n\r\nTwo more. Guards. Tired men with better things to think about than their own shadows turning on them, sinking blades into their flesh.\r\n\r\nThe demon was swallowed by shadow. It curled around the creature&rsquo;s body like cold, dark fingers. These people, it thought, every one of them, should have been wary. It was the night of the blood moon, after all. Demons were about.\r\n\r\nThe fourth was a commoner. She barely had time to take a breath to scream before he was upon her, single blue eye glowing in the dark. He straightened. She was just another stepping stone. A smirk, as he thought of her as the _fourth_&mdash;\r\n\r\nA familiar click, barely audible. To him and him alone, it echoed through the cobbled, silent street. He felt anger rising, bubbling up from the darkness. It was warm, red. Like the lifeblood that stained his blade.\r\n\r\nOnly one person would dare use a gun on him.\r\n\r\n_Jhin._\r\n\r\nThe name came swiftly to him. He remembered Jhin. Both parts of him did. There was a bitter taste in his mouth. A bad, old blood taste.\r\n\r\nNot good.\r\n\r\nTwo more familiar sounds: the trigger being squeezed, then the bullet&mdash;\r\n\r\nHe sidestepped, a trio of thin, spinning blades already in his hand. Pain across his arm, his bladed arm, where the bullet nicked him. An echo of pain. An instinct, not a demon thing, to flinch away from it. He glanced down. Shadows knitted together across his skin, stopping the blood from flowing, softening the wound. Closing it with darkness.\r\n\r\nIf he was not already cursed by his own actions long ago, he would have cursed Jhin and his incredible aim.\r\n\r\nHe spun on his heel. The deep red of the moon&rsquo;s light was no hindrance. He knew exactly where Jhin was. He saw the gleam of the gun.\r\n\r\nThe fury rose up in him again. The blood moon amplified it, twisted it. Shadows curled around him, shrouding him. He could feel Jhin&rsquo;s heartbeat, could hear it, guiding him. Was he afraid?\r\n\r\nThe demon relished the thought of a new target. A challenge. And, a murderer&rsquo;s fear. The man, whose name was once Talon, enjoyed it, too.\r\n\r\nHe was running then, vaulting over walls, flanking, getting closer to the other assassin. Jhin didn&rsquo;t stand a chance. The monster was upon him in seconds. A whirlwind of twisting, living shadow and knives, each one sharp enough to cleave through bone.\r\n\r\nThe gun clattered aside. It was the loudest thing either of them had heard all night. He was defenceless now. An easy target.\r\n\r\nBeneath the weight of the demon perched on him, Jhin couldn&rsquo;t move. Living shadow curled around Talon. His one eye glowed, deepening the darkness around him. The only blade that was necessary was the one on his arm, bright and brutal.\r\n\r\nIt was forced beneath the living assassin&rsquo;s head. Forcing his head up. Forcing his eyes away from the gun.\r\n\r\nIf Talon looked closely, and he did, he could see the fear in Jhin&rsquo;s eyes. True fear. The fear of a man who knows he is staring at the face of his killer.\r\n\r\nLovely.\r\n\r\nBeneath his mask, his nostrils flared at the scent of blood as he forced his blade closer to Jhin&rsquo;s neck. Fresh. The rich, warm blood of a killer. One day it would be added, like his, to the terrible power of the blood moon.\r\n\r\nJhin&rsquo;s actions were curious. He was another target, but it was not his time yet. One day, they would all bleed. What did he want, then, interrupting the master&rsquo;s work? Did he want the mark for himself, to then be given the power of the blood moon? Did he finally want to transform, like Talon had done so long ago?\r\n\r\nWell, if he did&mdash;\r\n\r\nTalon leaned closer. Mask to mask. His one eye, bright blue, a great contrast to the red and the black of his shadowy clothing, gleaming. His voice, a rasping hiss. A demon&rsquo;s voice twisted by the blood moon.\r\n\r\n_&lsquo;Stay away from my mark.&rsquo;_\r\n\r\nA great weight lifted from Jhin. The demon was gone. He could breathe.\r\n\r\nHe reached for his gun, examined it lovingly. Thinking.\r\n\r\nTalon was a threat to the cult if left unchecked. Naturally. He was a threat to everyone if he wasn&rsquo;t contained. No, _controlled_. But that could wait a night or two. There were other matters Jhin had to tend to first. He grinned beneath his mask.\r\n\r\nThe first: taking tonight&rsquo;s mark from his rival.","replies":[{"poster":"jawny","date":"2018-10-06T14:57:01.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I liked when you said 'hey' at the start, hit me right in the feels.
