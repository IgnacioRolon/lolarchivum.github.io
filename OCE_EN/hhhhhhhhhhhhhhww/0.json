Instead you click buttons like [these](https://i.gyazo.com/e4d0c335e878694b1b366288a528370b.png) to buy the amount of RP you want. Are you sure you purchased that RP from Riot and not somewhere else?\n\nEither way, it's probably a good idea to contact Riot Support [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), and explain your case to them. Use the category _\"I have a question about purchasing RP\"_.\n\nGood luck! :)","replies":[]}]}
