Plus all his basic attacts should look like boxing jabs and upper cuts.\r\n\r\nWhen you make this skin and put it into the game, I would love one for free please :)","replies":[{"poster":"SirMIttenz","date":"2015-03-02T11:08:14.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ha ha fair enough..... but i just thought it was funny and a possible idea for the future","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-01T08:31:26.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no more lee skins for god sake. he has so many y give him another. zac only has his release skin and the only way lee is ever getting a new skin is when riot nerfs him to the ground the day before the skin is released\nbut yes this skin would be awesome","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-01T08:55:45.985+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing about zac (and xerath to a degree) is that there is only so much you can do in addition to changing their colour palette.\n\nI got all xer skins but they feel a bit samey if I am perfectly honest.\n\nJust cant see much happening for zac because of the nature of his character.","replies":[]}]}]}
