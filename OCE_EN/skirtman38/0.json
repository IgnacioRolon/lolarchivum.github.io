His sustain and build path is fairly similar to warwick, but has the bonus of more cc/escape tools. In the current jungle meta, Sated: Devourer Aatrox is broken, especially when combined with AP Nashor's Tooth Aatrox. I used to play it regularly, before I went through my support phase through to top lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-03T05:22:53.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, will just say this is in the wrong topic thread. Should be in Gameplay and Strat.\n\nThat aside, I learnt how to jungle on one champ, and I recommend him whenever I can. I see you like tanky champs, so he might be perfect for you.\n\n{{champion:31}} - Cho'gath.\n\nYep, the nightmare from beyond. One of the best tanks in game, and with {{summoner:11}}, and his Ultimate Feast, it's like having 2 smites in hand at all times. You'll ALWAYS get dragon. Get his E to level 4, while also maxing out Q, is how I max him.\n\nGet {{item:3709}} to become pretty much the biggest tank in game at Max R; {{item:3027}} for the only damage you'll ever need plus extras (your Ult deals true damage, so all you have to do in fights is pick off low health carries), {{item:3065}} for the self heal regen from your passive, {{item:1326}} for speed if you need to get around feasting up your stacks should you die. And boom, you'll go 8/1/10 consistently. If you add some more AP and magic pen for you last two items, then you can easily go 15/1/10 ever time.\n\nHe clears well, deals amazing damage, is tanky as heck, split pushes like a bawss, and he's pretty cool to look at. And if you wanna go more tank you can, ad, you can, or more ap, you can too. Such a versatile, cool champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-02T15:27:01.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Olaf","replies":[{"poster":"Skirtman38","date":"2015-09-03T03:10:56.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have olaf, he is a beast","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-03T01:13:22.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi will win you games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-09-02T22:58:27.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:14}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-02T22:32:14.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maokai","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-02T22:31:34.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maokai","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-09-02T16:16:37.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox and Nocturne although i wouldn't recommend jungle Aatrox because he doesn't have a good clear and his ganks aren't really good because the Q knockup is a little slow. Kayle might work for you because kayle have a W to heal herself when clearing the jungle.  Zac might work too although i have never tried to jungle with him yet. Xin Zhao have quite a good sustain too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-02T15:36:07.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hecarim for sure! {{champion:120}} ^^\nEdit: Or maybs {{champion:56}}.
