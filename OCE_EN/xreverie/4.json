I&#039;m hoping the ranked champion select screen will be adopted to some extent into normals to resolve this, or some other solution?\n\nAlso there are a lot of people who will call a position and if they don&#039;t get it they will feed, are inappropriate, or who you can tell are trolling. Is it possible to add some solutions against this activity (eg: reporting in champ select, allow a certain number of queue dodges per day etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-18T21:32:02.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nUnfortunately there are some people who will troll if they don't get their role, the only thing you can do is report them. I believe riot is working on a new champ select for norms, but with the mage update, taric, and Aurelian Sol, they are a little bit busy. I do agree that having to say your role fastest can be a bit annoying at times, but you may get forced  into a role you never knew you liked and might enjoy it.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"M2001ARYAN","date":"2016-03-12T08:27:19.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is something you can actually do about this, but it'll take your whole team too... You all need to report him on the same grounds, e.g., verbal abuse, etc. This will get them reported to the Tribunal and they will get banned for a good amount of time!","replies":[]}]}
