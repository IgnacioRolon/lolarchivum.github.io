He doesn&#039;t use mana, and synergises well with lifesteal.\n* Small windows to engage on him and come out positive with a trade (shield, windwall, dashes). He can play safer during these Windows, meanwhile you&#039;ve lost mana if you&#039;re playing a mana champion to proc the shield for an opportunity.\n* Strong in all parts of the game, particularly the 30 minute mark. The comebacks are real. Snowbally.\n* Strong splitpushing and wave clear. Makes it difficult to roam and create pressure on the map in the early laning phase.\n* Have to keep track of his abilities, his positioning, and the minion waves. My map awareness takes a hit (imagine more practise will provide me with more capacity to deal with it eventually)\n* DPS and burst damage. Can slay squishies and tanks.\n* Outplay potential is a bit high. A lot of champs simply negating a single skill can be enough for yasuo to cut them down, without the enemy being able to deal with him as their damage is in their abilities with higher cooldowns than him. With a shield requiring no skill to soak a single skill from an enemy, a knockup to potentially engage or disengage (but requires a charge, so not too bad), a windwall to cancel out many others, and dashes to avoid skill shots, engage, or escape (if positioned well), I think it&#039;s a bit much.\n\nI&#039;ve played him a few times. I&#039;m not that great at him, but have had some games where I&#039;ve carried hard and it felt wrong. I&#039;ve considered investing time into mastering him, however he gets banned a lot, he&#039;s overplayed, and annoys me too much.\n\nInterested to know why he suffers in higher ELO however. Perhaps jg shuts him down / camps him, players are more experienced in tracking his kit and keeping map awareness etc, and the enemy team doesn&#039;t give him an opportunity to recover if he&#039;s behind. Those things don&#039;t happen in low ELO.\n\nWhat I&#039;d like against a yasuo is more opportunities to deny him Windows of strength: no auto shield, and him having to earn Windwall and dashes. Perhaps:\n\n* Dashes have stacks. He&#039;s given 2/3 dashes. Earns a dash for hitting a Q on an enemy, or last hitting a minion with his E. Loses them by getting hit by the enemy. Displayed in Jhin/Annie like bar. At full stacks he can use windwall.\n* Shield can be proc-ed while it&#039;s charging, or requires more skill to earn (perhaps last hitting minions with E).\n* Nerf his later game if he has a good early game, or give other champs a better late game. I think the new thornmail will help against him for tanks. AD assassins can buy an executioners calling which helps some what. AP champs get demolished late game by him (morellos grievous wounds isn&#039;t enough), and early game depends on the match up, but generally he can take them.\n* Do something about his sustain, or his waveclear. Gate him with mana, reduce his DPS/attack speed early game, reduce his health regen, or nerf lifesteal runes and items, no lifesteal on Q proc.\n* Perhaps make him more bursty, and build flat damage / lethality rather than crit and attack speed\n\nMore skill expression in obtaining strength, allow the enemy to deny/work around strength, and provide more strengths and weaknesses. He should be able to be outplayed as much as he can outplay - at the moment it's mostly tied in the skill of the yasuo player.\n\nIf you&#039;ve made it this far, thanks for reading :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-02T01:42:54.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forget that Riot doesn't balance League based on low elo they give 0 shits about low elo players opinions","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-07-02T08:28:48.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Am always up against one in the mid lane in norms.

Yes its true, he snowballs very well, buy is so damn easy to deny him that snowball. Around 90% of common toplaners counter yasuo, and around 60% of the in meta mid laners also have advantages over him. Yasuo is also really susceptible to ganks  at all stages of the game, atm he is all about those 1v1s, anything more than that destorys him more often than not, \"but he is made to 1v5, I've seen him get like 1v5 3 pentas in a game\". I'll correct you on that, you have seen a fed yasuo complete 5 successive 1v1s in a row for his pentas and that is all there is to it, 92% of yasuo's \"1v5\" pentas are from multiple 1v1 fights in a row, of which they are either supremely fed or you all stuffed up your plays really hard.\n\nHe fails in high elo because people have realised \"oh wait, every form of cc makes hi dashes useless, and he has abysmal early gamer stats and base damage!\" Early game champions shut down a yasuo extremely hard. So do all champions with reliable cc and damage steroids. The \"tank\" yasuo builds have all been to counter his crap base stats. Come on, his highest base damage is 1/3 the average of other champions, support champions actually have more base damages than he does, he just has high scaling. A yasuo denied gold or is zoned in anyway is usually useless for the rest of the game, \"but he will just farm and destroy us later\" you say? Well good for you, he is also extremely easy to prevent farming, as i said, shit stats and 100% item reliant, so just keep his lane occupied and he cant do anything farm wise, and if he goes to another lane to try farm, chances are the laners there will try take it over him anyway, in turn helping you prevent him doing anything.\n\nHigh elo players also usually have a nice rule of \"if its a yasuo gank him by 4 min then every 3 min after\" rule, and that really shuts him up. He becomes really easy to dive and after 3 deaths and will offer literally nothing in teamfights. His \"strengths\" also really work against him, his \"oh no super broken infinite dashes\" have a 10 sec static cd, and more often than not will place him in a bad spot where he is easy to punish. Champs with ranked poke spells (yes ranged) easily shut him up too, as was mentioned you can poke out his shield, and when thats down, the lane gets fun, he either zones himself or he takes a load of poke from your range, ranged laners are actually a huge pain for him because he never has a shield, and taking deathfire touch and using a spell on him just before his shield stacks will either force him to waste w, where you can chuck shit at him for 40 sec or he can zone himself more, or you pop his shield with like 4 damage from the burn, also a win. Letting him aa you can also work to your advantage if you have a reliable cc, you let him hit you, which draws a lot of minion aggro, which then destroy him while he dashes around in minions after the cc losing an average of 30% hp, always funny to watch.\n\nYou may think playing safe against a yasuo is the best idea, but more often than not thats what low elo people do, they then get punished for it, constantly harassing a yasuo more often than not will win you fights, due to his extremely squishy nature. After harassing him you then freeze lane, wandering around his minions as to zone him, a 1/2 hp yasuo won't dream of going near something double his hp during laning, especially when it has cc, this is why shit like darius, renekton, annie, lissandra, panth, irelia and things like that zone him and win so much, he is **THE MOST** cc susceptible champion in the game, a slow like or an aa speed reduction are more than enough to screw him over, thus why champs like malphite and tryndamere also destroy him in lane. Silences and dots again, destroy him, thus swain and malzahar. Any form of cc will cause a yasuo great pain, the problem with low elo, is that they are too scaled of his **STRENGTHS** they completely forget about his massive amounts of weaknesses and pass the off as non existent, scaring themselves into a corner and letting him scale. **THAT** is why is is strong in low elo.","replies":[{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-07-02T13:49:20.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate this. I think his damage is reasonable early game however. A good ult and Q, or windwall at the right time can put the enemy team at a disadvantage, or get them slain.\n\nAgree that you can't turtle against him in lane or you can let him get ahead. Low ELO can be variable with the types of jg you get, and people don't keep track of where he's at, and can be much more uncoordinated. \n\nI've noticed his malz winrate is abysmal. I'm finding mages difficult at the moment though with divers, skirmishers, and adcs being strong.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-07-03T06:46:16.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His early game damage isnt from \"pure unadulterated damage\", as I said, his base damages are abysmal, his strength comes from being able to repeatedly attack multiple times in short instances, this is why he seems to do a lot. Because of his need to hit multiple times in a row, cc is more effective against him, as it stops him from hitting you multiple times, be it a slow, silence, snare or stun.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
