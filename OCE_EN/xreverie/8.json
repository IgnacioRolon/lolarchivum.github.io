I must admit that i haven´t bothered checking the exact number since it would requiere a lot of work and i don´t think we need more numbers that those aready provided by the game. this was just a puzzle i wanted to solve.\nhope i helped (and that you read it) and if i was not clear in my explanation just ask. english is not my native language.\nas to how the game decides which one to apply. I have not the faintes clue. I do suspect that is a database since i have seen things as stupid as the adaptative dmg gained from the rune fleeting when ramus is powerballing be ad... you literally can not use it without cancelling and loosing the buff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2017-09-26T07:25:01.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:40}} {{champion:516}}","replies":[]}]}
