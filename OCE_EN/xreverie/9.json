Then the runes went to live and I suddenly found out they changed it to some shitty 3 hit bonus damage passive. I understand it would be OP for adcs with high amounts of attack speed to build it up quickly and high amounts of range to keep it going, but for melee champions like jax it would of been perfect. Maybe they could bring it back and have it nerfed for ranged users? Please I was really looking forward to that rune the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LethalGhost","date":"2017-11-10T02:58:33.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly have to disagree completely with that last little portion \"I like the simplicity of the system\" Okay okay, I understand I hold only an opinion some people might like the new update, The only issue I have is the whole rune system that just released was almost nothing that was promised in teasers, trailers and promised expansion of the games progress. To me it is quite literally a mediocre precursor to what was promised as a further in depth game play. It completely limits our ability to counter the champions we typically in previous games (before update) would have been able to try and at least put up a balanced fight. This new update in my opinion removes all challenge of being able to do so due to the limit of customization through our play style. Not to mention so much was reworked that it could take several more years to even get a hint of balance game play. To me the creators have lost sight of what the players want and are just throwing rehashed mashed poop at us, and calling it a fun game. The game lost its challenge when it became catered to children who don't understand strategic abilities. A once good game just crashed and burned for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sonatics77","date":"2017-11-09T23:59:32.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"- There are a lot of minor runes you can't view about an enemy that are important when making decisions in game\" \nBut before you couldn't see any runes and only the keystone mastery.
