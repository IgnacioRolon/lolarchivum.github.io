His shield comes back pretty quickly giving you a pretty small window to use an opportunity which yas players don&#039;t  generally give you. Can sustain with a dorans / lifesteal. Has no mana resources. Very easy farming. Strong all parts of the game. Get&#039;s crit easily of some inexpensive items. Takes a lot of mental energy to lane against and predict what a yas is going to do.\r\n\r\nI basically perma ban him if I get a ban. Is there any reason he&#039;s not getting more of a nerf, in particular the early game?","replies":[{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-01-18T17:49:44.533+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh the classic yasuo is \"insert your worse joke/name calling\". What elo are you, perhaps i can help. Let me tell you something, back in the old days where i mained ahri (season 4?) I struggled against yasuo as a silver (i was new at that time as well and wanted to focus on learning ahri and the game). It took me awhile to conquer these \"unbeatable\" counters until i realised my mistakes and put in more effort to work around it. Every champ has their weakness and strength within the game and it takes effort and time to learn how to work around it. I know it may sound hard and all you wanna do is just say rito plz nerf this broken ass chaaampppp but when you think about it its not exactly hard.\n\nThink about it this way, yasuo counters ahri completely because shes based on skillshots and yasuo can just block or dash to dodge them all. Think about how you play league and all the basic things you need such as mechanics, knowledge (when to poke,items how to cs etc) champion's skills etc. All of these come in handy yeah? Lets say we're in laning phase and depending whether yasuo is good or not its a 50-50 lane win or lose. Be confident, be cocky if you will because who knows what it might result in.  Doing simple things can bring you to an advantage such as:\n\nPredicting how the enemy or yasuo  plays and working around it. It doesnt hurt to change your playstyle to adapt to the game. An example of this is when i was a noob ahri player i spammed waaaayy too many skills, was so passive and well you catch the drift. How did i counter this and improve? By forcing him to move or predict a certain way that would give me advantage. Now as i said all basic skills for league come into place, knowing that i can poke with ahri's q i figured if he was in a certain place for example right next to a low minion, i would throw in q to get poke and that minion.  Always switch up your trading so you become less predictable and dont always waste your important skills (example as ahri dont always throw your charm, predict where he will dash to etc, save it for the right moment). I remember a few times where i forced a few yasuos to windwall because they thought i was going to use a skillshot but instead i just walked straight in and autoattacked (no shield passive = easy poke later on)\n\nBuy items for what is needed and dont be afraid to experiment. I had this build where i wanted to be tanky enough to survive the lane or game. Lets say they had like the best wombo combo (like ori yas and malphite) of course if u got stuck on one of those ultis you're pretty much f*cked. During those days i experimented and those certain builds worked for me and saved my ass during those games. I remember building like roa -> cdr boots -> ap items and zhonyas and that would make me so tanky that i would last a couple of bursts as ahri. No clue if that still works now though.\n\nDont be afraid to learn champs that counter certain champs. I remember learning lissandra just to counter yasuo and zed, i have to admit that was pretty hilarious, thinking about how i denied so many yasuos or zeds from getting to the back line. This also brings a lot of variety to your champ pool and who knows if you might like the champ or not.\n\nLearn from your mistakes, dont blame the god damm jungler unless they just int your lane, just secretly cry inside if they do. Knowing your mistakes is better than repeating them right? \nI know that might take awhile to process and even to wonder why it was considered a mistake but once you realise them you're basically on a roll to improving. Also dont rely on ganks, rely on yourself. Unless they camp u hard or the jungler doesnt see an easy gank then again just secretly cry inside.\n\nNow im sorry if this doesnt make any sense or didnt help you at all (or was just based on ahri). I read your post at a very, VERY late time and i kinda regret not sleeping :-:. I should probably sleep now .-. I hope you find a way to counter yasuo and gl with your rank games :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-01-18T17:31:02.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not getting the nerf he deserves because Riot no longer believe in doing to champs what they did to Irelia.\n\nUnfortunate really because his kit is horribly overloaded for his current item build where he simply gets {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} and builds tank from there.\nHe still gets his annoying Wind Shield, except now it's capable of taking more damage when it's up, despite the fact that it can be popped and waited out for with a single AA.\n\nHe can't utilise the armour pen in his ultimate unless if he crits, that was such an excellent nerf by Riot, it totally stopped the existence of Tank Yasuo.\n\nTop it off his E is now getting a buff to scale with AD.","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2017-01-19T02:48:18.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're nerfing the base damage and adding an AD scaling, his E has become weaker, the AD ratio is trying to give Yasuo players more of an incentive to build more AD rather than Tank.
