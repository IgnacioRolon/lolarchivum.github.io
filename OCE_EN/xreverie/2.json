Between then and now league made a connection with me and has helped me through a tough life stage. The feeling of improving, the competition and challenge of the game is like nothing I&#039;ve ever experienced.\n\nI&#039;m at an all time low with league and am playing way less of it at the moment however since I feel:\n\n* Riot have become way more politically correct\n* The game is less fun than it used to be\n* You&#039;re not giving the players what they want, and have lost a lot of your original vision\n* Seems like you&#039;re making change for changes sake\n\nBelow is why I think these things:\n\n**Varus lore change**\n\nThis makes me cringe a bit - deleting the lore of a champion for what seems like an initiative to encourage diversity and homosexual rights or something.\n\nIt feels like the start of a culture of political correctness, rather than focusing on making a kick ass game. Just don&#039;t, political correctness and social justice is just annoying now.\n\n**Runes reforged**\n\n- Fast-paced, snowballs, and too unforgiving when behind\n- There&#039;s a lot of cheese\n- Has largely made redundant the learning and training put into the game\n- requires way more stat checking with runes etc\n- Has lost strategic depth, and games feel like they&#039;re lost early while you wait 10-20 minutes for a game to finish\n- Has overall made the game way worse\n\n**Hextech crafting / levelling changes**\n\nProgress with levelling feels slower, and hex tech is an annoying way to get content, and a dishonest way to monetise.\n\n**URF**\n\nThe players want URF. I want URF. The lack of response around it in the past and the lying was shitty, as are your excuses.\n\nWhat to people think?","replies":[{"poster":"ToshiroT1","date":"2018-01-12T13:49:20.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-13T01:27:24.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you need to realise how horribly shit this game has become since the early days of League, did you even read the post? Do you not see the direction this game is going? Riot forcing homosexuality into league for the sake of political correctness without a care for the state of the games lore, the new runes making games completely one sided and fast paced with one shots/massive damage happening everywhere, the stupid BE system that everyone was mad at when it launched and Riot did BARELY anything to make it better, it's still shit, and who can forget, URF, which again, EVERYONE WANTS, does Riot care? No, \"URF makes people stop playing League\", well monkey brains, put your heads together and think why there would be a sudden drop in players after a massive event of a game mode that everyone spams as much as possible because it only comes out as rarely as once a year. You didn't stop to think that the massive drop in players is maybe, people taking a break? Some people play League ONLY for URF, some people make plans for URF with their friends and play games endlessly ALL WEEKEND, then take a big break from League. THATS WHAT HAPPENS YOU MONKEYS, STOP LOOKING AT YOUR STUPID DATA AND THINK LOGICALLY HERE DUMBASSES.\n\nSo basically, games gone to shit, Riot replaced all their staff with zoo animals at some point, and you're wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-12T14:18:56.659+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToshiroT1,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bIQRs43q,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T13:49:20.407+0000)\n>\n\nDude that's toxic!","replies":[]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2018-01-12T14:42:03.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ToshiroT1,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=bIQRs43q,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-12T13:49:20.407+0000)\n\n\nDisagree with this sheep comment. You don't have to adapt to change for changes sake, or treat all change as positive. Nor is disagreeing with a change necessarily a bad thing. Change does sometimes require a response however and uninstalling and leaving this game is a viable option.\n\nAlso I think the reasons for the changes to league are questionable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2018-01-13T03:11:36.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I have to make a call.\n\nI'll sign into League here and there to play some ARAM with some friends, but won't be playing Rift, ranked, or watching eSports as I have been. I'll check back regularly to see:\n\n* If URF is made available close to its original form, if not better, and made available more often, if not permanently \n* Runes / balance are fixed so the game has more strategy, depth, potential for comebacks, no cheese, and isn't like playing dark souls in the laning phase. I want challenging, intense games, that are impacted by several decisions and mechanics at all times of a game, and feeling that i can impact every game and get good, and that my influence can win the majority of games.\n* Riot shows more evidence of listening to what players _really_ want, and are focused at its core on games that connect with gamers, that kick ass\n* Changes are well thought out, have a direction and meaning, and aren't just made because of a culture of innovation and change for its own sake, or because  some staff at Riot are bulls in a China shop who like to wing things and because they think change is cool without enough thought put into what they're doing, or their end goal (which should be making a kick ass game that connects with players, and naturally monetises)\n* There's no other political statements, or social justice messages coming from league / riot. Keep it all the fuck out. Ocean week, giving to charity isn't a bad thing though.\n* hextech changes and loot boxes die a horrible (or wonderful and desirable) death. Make the game fun and desirable to play over and over again by making the game awesome, and make great content that people want to buy (which admittedly is still the case). Addictive monetisation and gambling methods are pretty dishonest.\n* There's less copying of the Overwatch system, which has a lot of the shit you've taken on, without the gameplay issues or terribly though out changes, or the lack of availability of their URF equivalent (or the All Randomness)\n\nI'm pretty devastated - I want my game back, or rather don't want the crap that **_is_** now.\n\nSurely I'm speaking on behalf of the majority of the player base on this.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2018-01-13T11:01:27.572+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There's no other political statements, or social justice messages coming from league / riot.

I quit about a month ago, and now just clown on smurfs in normals once a week or so. The game is being made to be less skilful overall and appeal to bronzies and people who will buy stuff in the short term. But in the long term there will be a mass exodus. Another company that does not understand how business works, trying to justify things with numbers and not common sense.\nSince season 5 there has been a slow removal of skill in many areas, so I'm gone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-12T14:26:21.625+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Game is always changing. Most people who have played for some time find the earliest seasons they played the best ones. I don't think that's just nostalgia however. The game changes so much that its simply not what people fell in love with when they started playing and League seems to be continuously moving toward being more e-sports oriented. This doesn't appeal to the average player. Metas being more tight, more flashy champions that are fun to play but a plague to vs, clampdowns on toxicity to the point banter draws bans and yes they seem to make a lot of decisions based on public image, suddenly nuking Varus lore and making him gay is an example. \n\nRiot doesn't really care too much about player feedback these days but is really good at making it look like they do by slowly rationing out things that should have existed for years (better pings, more bans etc) so they can go \"see we listen\" whilst 10 other terrible aspects of the game sit in the background.","replies":[]}]}
