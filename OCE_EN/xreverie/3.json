There's no reason not to release URF for the weekend period, if it's going to last 1-2 weeks then those who want to hardcore ranked can still do it and play URF. Riot for some stupid reason decided to push everything back. Ranked should have started Wednesday, Sylas Thursday, Skins Friday, URF Saturday.\n\nThis issue goes back to Riot wasting the longest preseason we've had on non-existent changes. And then dumping a bunch of pretty huge changes right at season start.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charastiel","date":"2019-01-28T01:51:05.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except that we've had stuff all communication about it and what little detail they released said 28th. We got to the 28th only to be told its now being released at 3AM on the 29th. Riot doesn't care about anyone who doesn't fit into their timezone. Their staggered release is pointless they don't even follow their own timelines.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IGGY AZALEA","date":"2019-01-27T05:20:32.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DONT THINK RIOT UNDERSTANDS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO THINGS DURING THE WEEK {{sticker:sg-janna}} LIKE DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND HOW STUPID THIS IS!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-01-26T02:56:19.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it'll be on the 29th for OCE sadly :(","replies":[{"poster":"IGGY AZALEA","date":"2019-01-26T06:47:18.742+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats fucking sad","replies":[{"poster":"Willy Donka","date":"2019-01-26T13:00:22.991+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"what the fuck, these are weekdays...
