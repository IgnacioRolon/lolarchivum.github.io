In season 6 I played a minimal amount of ranked games and finished at Bronze 5 0lp.\n\nThis season I&#039;ve been practicing more and have been trying to improve / climb. I&#039;ve made it into Bronze 1, the highest I&#039;ve been.\n\nI&#039;m finding there are variables I can&#039;t control that can make a lot of games difficult to win however:\n\n* Feeders, trolls, smurfs, leavers, bad players\n\nFeeders in lane are the biggest issue. One reason I like to play mid is to be able to influence lanes by roaming. If people were to break even in lane, and knew their roles at a basic level (eg: i&#039;m the font line. I engage and soak damage when my team is around, and when it&#039;s a good time to fight) it would be enough.\n\n* Team MMR\n\nStatistically some teams have a greater chance of winning, however usually teams are pretty close\n\n* Getting primary and secondary roles\n\nI&#039;m working on this often. I&#039;m primarily a mid laner since it suits my style, I have a good champ pool, and feel you can carry and best take the game by the balls. I&#039;ve converted adc to my secondary position as I think it&#039;s the next best position to do the same thing, however you&#039;re more dependent on having a front line, bot lane match ups are quite distinct, and you have to synergise with a sup. Two champs for every position, meta champs preferrably.\n\n* Team synergy and communication\n\nTeams without balanced sources of damage, cc, or a front line tend to suffer. Team mates out of position, or diving in 1v5 without the team or any pings. Being able to capitalise on objectives (frustrating when a team is aced with a turret in front of the team and everyone backs).\n\n--\n\nI&#039;m finding from the above that over playing a number of games things work out, as the other team/players can experience the same issues. If I&#039;m consistently performing, winning lane (particularly mid) etc, I win games. It can be difficult when you get a string of losses however and find it can be easy to place blame on a combination of the above. If I were better however I know I could carry more of those games, and have been able to with some of them.\n\nWhat I&#039;m looking for now is ways to have more control over those things, and to improve. Some things I&#039;m trying:\n\n* Watching streams, watching my own games, coaching, youtube, practise tool etc\n* Memorising acronyms and things to improve mAPM, awareness etc\n\neg: Gold Level Items Health Mana Summoners       (things to assess on our team and enemy team, particularly in lane: GLIHMS)\neg: Vision Whereabouts (of everyone) Objectives Timing (power spikes and game time)     (VWOT: more macro game assessments)\n\n* Small champ pools of meta champs (thankfully over the last few years I have a good pool of champs as the meta has changed, and if it were to change again I could adapt)\n* Being able to play all roles. Focusing on mid, adc, and sup (usually the autofill pos)\n* Check op.gg to see if I need to dodge someone tilted, or a troll\n* being a teams emotional support, and mentor (point out mistakes respectfully for correction)\n* ping everything, ward where possible, be dependent on self where possible to carry games\n* agression - dominating lane is more likely to let you pressure the map and win games\n* in pre-game lobby communicate to secure a good team composition - question bad picks\n* say hello, glhf, gj etc in chat to increase morale, particularly if team is tilted\n* ranked anxiety - don&#039;t be afraid of demotion etc. it doesn&#039;t feel good, however the experience for improvement is amazing (very different game from norms, and it&#039;s harder to improve just playing norms)\n\n\nAnyway that&#039;s where i&#039;m at. Does anyone have any thoughts, or advice? Would anyone like to duo with me, or be my critic?\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-09-06T10:20:05.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you've come to some good conclusions, especially when you talk about dealing with smurfs, trolls, feeders, etc.\n\nConsistency is key to climbing. Play one good game and end up feeding because you're too cocky in the next and you'll go nowhere. I agree with many of your ideas. However, pointing out someone's mistake (particularly in low elo) will generally upset and/or aggravate the person you are criticizing. Even if that is not your intention.\n\nFrom my experience, people in bronze believe they deserve a significantly higher rank, and as a result, they do not take kindly to any form of criticism. I used to have this mentality back in season 4 (and a bit of season 5). I felt that anyone trying to help me out were either attacking me for my decisions or too stupid to understand what I was doing. As a result, I ignored everyone or flamed them. Needless to say, I was hardstuck low bronze. After changing my mentality and focusing on self-improvement, I climbed out of bronze and am currently gaining 25-30LP for wins in silver 5.\n\nI am still very bad at the game, especially when compared to people in higher elo. However, I love the idea of helping someone else out of a situation I found myself in not too long ago. If everyone can have this mentality and want to improve their skills, rather than blaming everything on everyone else, League would be a much less stressful and significantly better game because of it.\n\nOne must also keep in mind that solo/duo is about getting 3-4 random people to work together. This can be frustrating when everyone wants to play some kind of carry champ and not many people want to allow themselves to get carried. For example, many people do not enjoy playing tanks. Some people prefer playing carry laners/junglers. If a team needs a frontline, but the last people to pick don't enjoy playing tanks, they most likely will not pick a tank or would underperform because they're playing something they're unfamiliar with.\n\nAnother key thing is to not believe that a game is over just because you don't have a tank or don't have much CC or whatever the problem may be. Especially in low elo, anything can happen. I have lost many games against full AD comps because people on my team didn't understand that building armour will make their damage almost completely negligible.\n\nThe last bit of advice I have is that you just keep on playing. The more you play, the more you consciously try to learn from every game, the more you will improve. Learning and applying what you learn in your next games is vital to climbing. As long as you remain in that mentality and don't tilt, you should just keep playing. Never play while tilted. You can fall into the trap of becoming overaggressive or just make mistakes in general because you're not focusing enough. I always have other activities for myself if I decide I'm too tilted to continue playing. I can do some push-ups, punch my punching bag, load up another game that isn't as frustrating and is generally something simple that can calm me down. Anything to get me out of that mindset and allow me to vent my frustration.\n\nMy apologies for the wall of text, but I feel that you might appreciate it based on how much detail and effort you put into your post.\n\nFeel free to reply if you disagree with anything I've put forward","replies":[{"poster":"Mini Bao","date":"2017-09-06T16:48:15.337+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is also very frustrating that people are playing champions that they don't know how to play in ranked; and they do not care that they are actually affecting the experience of other players on their team who is trying to climb.\n\nThere should be a system that prevents players from playing champions that they are not familiar with, such as a quest that they have to play the champion in normal game and win the match 10 times before they can play it in ranked etc...\n\nI have to dodge a lot of the games because of that and I am the one that is being penalized for doing the right thing.","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-09-08T03:04:19.008+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a good suggestion to fix this issue. I believe there are many problems surrounding ranked as far as players are concerned (trolls, smurfs, feeders, etc.), but the biggest issue with ranked is that there is no way to effectively and fairly stop these players from ruining other people's experiences. Players that enjoy playing off-meta picks can be in danger of being banned. Especially if they don't do well in a couple of their games. For example, I have been a Heimerdinger main for a very long time. He's not been a meta pick for years. I have been flamed and reported just because I picked a champion that many people believe is bad purely because he's not played often. Should I be banned for picking someone that's not meta? Am I trolling by picking him? It's a very difficult situation because Riot can't always tell when someone is playing something off-meta or when someone is trolling with their picks.\n\nThat being said, reporting players in OCE isn't very effective a lot of the time. The automated system can only definitively ban a player for being toxic for multiple games in a short period of time.\n\nAs far as dodging is concerned, although it has immediate disadvantages, it is more likely to be beneficial for you in the long run. Dodging doesn't reduce your MMR, whereas playing the game out and losing would. You only lose a maximum of 10LP from dodging, but you could be losing anywhere from 15-30LP from playing the game.\n\nA lot of high ELO players talk about how they would dodge games no matter how much LP they lost for it. I believe Pants Are Dragon once said that he would keep dodging games even if it demoted him down to bronze 5, because his MMR would still be challenger.","replies":[{"poster":"Mini Bao","date":"2017-09-17T13:38:24.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh, I don't mind people playing off-meta stuff, as long as they have the win rate and kda to back it up. If they don't have the win rate on the champ even if it is meta, it is still a no-no lol. Nevertheless, I do find that it has something to do with auto-fill as well. Sometimes (actually quite often) the auto-fill is not balanced between the teams, which then makes people play things that they are not familiar with. So then it comes down to if you are lucky or not when you press the \"Find Match\" button, and pray for the best that you don't have a lot of auto-fill in your team.\n\nI guess it would be ok for higher elo to have auto-fill feature, since they do not have enough population and hence would have very long queue time. But they should remove that in lower elo, as player population is not an issue; and it is likely that players might not have much experience with the game. I only played this game for over a year, other than having to keep up with all the new patches, I am still trying to learn 7 years worth of content. Riot is making changes to encourage new players to the game, but how do they expect them to learn 7 years of stuff by just having them play level 1 to 30?\n\nI'm going to finished my rant here, since my 30 minute dodge is done XD","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xReverie","date":"2017-09-06T12:47:05.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Appreciate this, particularly around being mindful of how sensitive people are in bronze to criticism.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-07T05:45:49.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately a lot of that stuff you just can't control. At the end of the day the only thing you can reliably influence is your play. If you can keep improving you will keep climbing. \n\nOne thing I would point out from experience is be careful of the tips you pick up from LCS level play. For some of them to work you need your team to understand what's going on as well. Plus I don't know about you, but I sometimes get caught out by someone doing something absolutely insane specifically cause I'm not expecting it.
