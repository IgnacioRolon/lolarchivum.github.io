With no hard cc, 1 damaging basic ability, an ult which is at best a zoning tool and mild taunt, weird ap ratios but is best built tank, actually one of the best buffs in the game in blood boil, alot of tankiness, 'consume' an ability which makes it possible (though not advisable) to jungle without smite. Nunu is a bit of a mess.\n\nbut if nunu does get reworked, the ability I don't want to see removed has got to be blood boil. The huge ms+atkspeed steroid is very fun, offers some synergy and supportive qualities, and enables weird tanky bruiser top builds utilising builds like:\n{{item:3748}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3111}} , which can push really fast and duel most fighters surprisingly well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-10T23:55:13.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunu needs a rework, his entire kit is garbage and useless, that's why no one but trolls play him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Hunt Is On","date":"2018-01-10T14:36:37.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you can't beat a good ol lvl 6 ult in bush while your passive is up and you one shot anyone at full charge that shit hella fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2018-01-10T14:29:31.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's in desperate need of a rework, his kit is equal parts boring and garbage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-10T14:11:16.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Galio was already removed for being a relic of the past and Nunu is in the same vein of champion he was in so Riot might remove him soon and replace him with a different champion called Nunu.","replies":[]}]}
