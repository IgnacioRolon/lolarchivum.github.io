And to my understanding i had not actually told him but more or less hes seen me do it a number of times, although he is one of my best mates he would never know the impact in would have on the rift and my mental health . I am no saint i can tell you that and have flamed many times over my LoL career , but as time went on i became less toxic and learnt to become one with the team. Im sure this will reflect in my prev bans, im unsure of exactly how many times i have been banned . I am a strong league support since season 2 ! The reasoning for the final and permanent ban was verbal abuse to my team and the opposition . The chats reads some crazy stuff and although i was heart broken at my account being taken away, i felt pitty for him as he had acted childish in his defeat . I have since made a new account and have had nothing but good experiences . You can also revue this account if you wish -HerbShuttle . I wish to appeal this decision under the grounds of my password being stolen(Also falls on me for not being more carefull) and that i am a asset to the LoL community.  \r\n\r\nPlease and thank you for taking your time to read","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-09-27T02:43:38.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok have you made a support ticket because no one can really help you beyond that here on the boards.... hmu if you want some advice I have had 4 accounts banned and 3 recovered","replies":[{"poster":"TheRacistBogan","date":"2017-09-27T03:20:23.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, this is as far as i have got.
