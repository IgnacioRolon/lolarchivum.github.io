Ask me anything!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys! \n\nI&rsquo;m Victor Zanozin (Veeedka), Riot Oceania&rsquo;s resident tech (or officially, IT Projects and Operations Specialist). I work on all the tech that supports Rioters every day and also on our esports broadcasts and events. I&rsquo;m here for the next few hours to answer any questions you might have about me, what I do for Riot, and anything else you can think of! \n\nA brief history of me: I&rsquo;ve been interested in computers and gaming since I was very young - I think my first computer was a broken Microbee (kinda showing my age a bit here). I grew up playing Day of the Tentacle, Relentless, Doom, Myst, Diablo, Starcraft and many others and over the years have never lost that love of gaming. I&rsquo;ve worked in various IT roles in different parts of the country for nearly 15 years now and started with Riot Games late last year. \n\nOutside of work I still spend a lot of time gaming and exploring new tech, riding bicycles and motorbikes and travelling. \n\nAlright, I&rsquo;m going to hand it over to you guys - Ask me anything!\n\nEDIT: Okay guys, time for me to head home. Thanks for all of your questions, it's been fun answering them :) ","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-03-31T02:52:50.306+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favourite Rioter and why is it Agent Mindstar?","replies":[{"poster":"Veeedka","date":"2017-03-31T03:11:57.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who's Agent Mindstar? \n\n;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-03-31T02:48:43.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Charmander, Bulbasaur or Squirtle","replies":[{"poster":"Veeedka","date":"2017-03-31T02:50:30.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Charmander.

We also have a lot of private IP that needs to be protected. \n\nI have worked for some major financial institutions all around the world, so I'm kind of used to the strict policies - When I got to Riot they were interested in making sure you knew why the policies they put in place were there (rather than a because-I-said-so type model) and were always happy to accept feedback on tightening or loosening certain policies or restrictions. \n\nI get to play with lots of stuff!

It does - The environment here is quite different to NA/EU, and very different again to the environment in China/Korea. The different regions focus on different priorities that are more relevant to their local areas, but also being in this region lets us do a lot of things earlier than other regions and far more quickly. \n\n3.)
