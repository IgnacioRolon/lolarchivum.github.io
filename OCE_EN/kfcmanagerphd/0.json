I&#039;m new and match making doesn&#039;t have a system to match me with other new players because every one makes new accounts so they can cheat the system to match up with players like me. I&#039;m not encouraging these cheaters by playing them, but I&#039;ll get banned if I afk or leave so if Riot refuses to fix this problem how does any one expect lol to exist in a few years time? The community is just pushing away all new players and there&#039;s nothing I can do when there&#039;s no way to leave with out punishment? If any one has some tips for how to punish my team mates for not surrendering and encouraging these cheaters I&#039;d love to hear it, so far all i can do is be toxic and I don&#039;t like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-09T21:09:36.785+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toxicity is always a choice.\n\nYou can choose to give in to another's behaviour and be controlled by it, or you can learn to rise above it.\n\nIt doesn't take long now to reach lvl 30 and reach a point where the system places you with people of your own skill.

WookieCookie stated (in an [old post](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/lets-talk-smurfs-snow-and-bans-ask-riot), though still relevant it seems) that, and I quote, \"Instead of trying to restrict or prevent smurfs, various teams across Riot try to minimize issues caused by smurfing. For example, one of the teams that works on meta-game systems developed pretty good detection methods that quickly separate new players from experienced smurf accounts in the early levels. Within a few matches, smurf accounts only end up playing against other smurf accounts.\"\n\nThough it seems \"a few matches\" may be a *bit* of an exaggeration, in some instances. It also seems like it may apply more to PvP matches, as opposed to Coop, and from what I can tell you've only had 2 PvP matches on the account you're using now (with a total of 19), according to OP.GG.\n\nGive the system a bit of time to \"catch up\" and figure out where you're meant to be. Like Lord Sessh says, \"it's not the be-all and end-all\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-09T23:00:10.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're dumb op...","replies":[]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-12T17:09:39.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"solid bait","replies":[]},{"poster":"KFCMANAGERPHD","date":"2017-08-09T17:50:53.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please, if there's any champs I can play that can team kill my team mates that would be awesome.
