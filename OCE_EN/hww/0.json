Mystery Gifts Skins well that would be my 2nd option if you want them keep and you get a good chance of getting something rare or something good. But Option 1 buy on 50% sales would be my way to go","replies":[{"poster":"HWW","date":"2019-01-22T03:43:14.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are purchasing all skins via mystery skins cheaper than the 50% off sale?
