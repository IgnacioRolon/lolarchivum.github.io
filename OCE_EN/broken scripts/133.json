You usually patch at around 3:00 AM and yet she still is not here. Or, did you mean the 28th for America, so we have to wait until the 29th?\n\nCan we have some damn clarification on when things are actually becoming available? A timer, an official date, or something so we are all not sitting in the dark?\n\nEdit: I see that OCE gets her on the 29th. How lame. Guess I will not be playing her on release. It is either Early Access to Shadowbringers or Qiyana. Lmao.","replies":[]}
