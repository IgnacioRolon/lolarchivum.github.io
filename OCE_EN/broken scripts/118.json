My monitor is playing up and keeps turning off and on. I assume the heat plus its age…\n\nAnyway, I just want to take a few minutes to talk about him and where I feel he is heading and what should be tuned. We all know new champions normally release a bit bonkers, whether for increased sales or due to PBE not doing its job due to high elo players getting in there and stomping bronze players for the YouTube clickbait.\n\nI feel like Aphelios will have Aatrox/Akali/Sylas syndrome where he is almost impossible to balance in pro levels of play while being subpar in Solo Queue. So, he will be nerfed for pro players, which will hit his regular gameplay, and see him tank in winrate. On that note, too, I feel like he will have a very mediocre winrate due to the sheer amount of circumstances in his kit.\n\nHe feels like he is a strong champion that is second pick material. He seems to be beaten by a lot of current meta ADCs without any real issue. Xayah and Kai’sa, two S+ tier ADCs, both defeat him easily with very little effort. Not to mention that his counters are quite common, too. Tristana ruins him, as does Draven, and Lucian causes some headaches. That is five semi-popular ADCs that can easily put him in the dirt. Jhin, Caitlyn, and Jinx all seem like decent choices, too.\n\nHowever, if all the conditions are right and he has the correct weapons, then he can beat all of them with very little difficulty. However, things have to align and that can cause some issues for him.\n\nDespite everything that I have said on the matter, he is insanely strong and is obnoxious due to the sheer amount of stuff he has in his kit. He has:\n\n- Poke (sniper)\n- Wave clear (flamethrower)\n- Crowd control (grav canon)\n- Sustain (pistol)\n- Sieging (chakra)\n\nThe only thing he lacks is mobility. I think it is fantastic we have another ADC without dashes, leaps, resettable jumps, stealth, and whatever else the recent ADCs have had. It is a breath of fresh air to see an ADC that cannot just jump or dash over a wall and escape.\n\nHis kit is convoluted and hard to follow. However, if you can learn to follow his kit and respect the stronger points in his kit, then he is nothing more than a fly. It is easier said than done, though.\n\nOut of any combo he has, the sniper and pistol is the most obnoxious to deal with. The pistol does an insane amount of damage level 2. I think it hits for 220 damage and then add on the shot from the sniper.\n\nHis level 2 basic combo is 324 damage on a dummy. Here it is.\n\n(sniper) Auto > Q > Auto > W (pistol) > Auto > Q > Auto\n\nThat is half of his health as damage. At level 2.\n\nA reminder that his pistol also heals, too, so he can tank a bit of damage. I have been able to burn heal and flash every single game with this combo. The second I hit level 2, I push for it. With a support like Leona, it is a guaranteed kill.\n\nI think out of anything in his kit, the pistol needs to be tweaked. It has too much sustain and damage in it.\n\nHowever, we need to understand that level 2 is his spike, just like it is for a lot of other ADCs, so hitting it too hard can be a massive detriment to him. We also need to understand that he can attempt this combo 4 times and the damage is halved if he misses the sniper Q. It is a situation combo that is risk vs reward, but the reward is too much.\n\nSumming it all up.\n\nAphelios is a lot like Katatina and Yasuo, honestly. He is described as being a hard champ, much like Katarina and Yasuo, however he is insanely easy to get positive results with, even if you are not a mechanical God, that it ruins the illusion of skill.\n\nStraight up, most players I see are just brainlessly spamming autos without really doing much. His insane base damage works well in low elo, but in high elo, I can see people understanding how he functions and using that against him.\n\nAP mages are still his bane. Diana, Brand, Lux, and Veigar all destroy him.\n\nPlay Veigar bot and watch as he goes 0/7 as your basic combo pre-6 is 90% of his health. You will one-shot him with sorc boots and orb.\n\nHe is a strong champ that is vastly misunderstood right now. No one is respecting his weapons, therefore they die to him. I have seen people just walk into his turrets and then whine that they died. Like, you are standing in a red circle, man! You can see the range of it!\n\nI have a feeling Riot will absolutely shred him and make him unplayable.\n\nDo you disagree? let me know. I love a good debate.","replies":[{"poster":"slxw","date":"2019-12-16T20:20:20.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a game against him in norms top, i wrecked him with teemo.\nnow its just top n jg with tp, ward alcove, let em push and jumanji.","replies":[]}]}
