If it's still broken for you, please let me know! \n\nFor a bit more context on what happened (still don't know exactly) - The North America server shares a datacentre with some parts of the Oceania server.   On all our servers we usually perform maintenance every couple of weeks at a time that is off-peak for that server's local players (ie. middle of the night / early morning).  \n\nIn this case, we were working on a device that is associated primarily with the NA server,  and has previously been worked on with no impact to OCE.  Unfortunately this time it did cause impact, so we've got to do some homework now to figure out why now....\n\nApologies for the interruption to the evenings games :'(","replies":[{"poster":"LOST CONFIDENCE","date":"2019-11-01T04:56:54.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my account is in the queue forever..........can not find a match","replies":[{"poster":"2supportU","date":"2019-11-01T09:29:53.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same goes for me....and now it's saying im banned from the queues for \"declining\" too many games...I didnt even get the pop up to join the game....and the timer still continues to tick","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ANOREXICCAVE","date":"2019-10-30T11:06:01.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mindstar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=s0vZ3I7n,comment-id=000d,timestamp=2019-10-30T10:58:29.080+0000)\n>\n> Hi folks\n> \n> I just got called about this, will do some digging and find out what is happening.

Ranked queues *have* to go down to maintain queue and matchmaking integrity though.
