You may disagree or agree with what I say, that&rsquo;s up to you. I just like getting things off my chest. My biggest flaw is that I speak my mind, no matter how harsh the words may come out. I list this as a flaw because it is.\r\n\r\nI know I have a troll status or a &lsquo;Sackboy thread, downvote and move on&rsquo; type of deal, but please hear me out. It isn&rsquo;t often I actually speak my mind without coming off as sincere.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon League of Legends back in 2009 when the game was still in beta. I fell in love with the game, the characters, the lore, and the graphics. The players were toxic back then, but it was mainly seen as banter or just jokes. You wouldn&rsquo;t be reported for saying &lsquo;GGEZ&rsquo; back then, either. It was a great time because no one was really offended. People swore, they ranted, and they felt like nothing was their fault, but it was nowhere near as bad as it is today.\r\n\r\nI have sat and watched this game grow. I saw it evolve from hand-drawn, pizza feet characters to stunning characters that look out of this world. I have seen characters that were said to be &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; released. Mechanics that no one ever dreamed of appearing in new characters. I have seen lore butchered, added, and then butchered again. I have seen a small company thrive and become a large company that is still successful today.\r\n\r\nIn some sense, I am proud I got to see it all, but in others, I am not. The account that saw it all is banned. Any account I have made has barely lasted over a season. Heck, I have a few that are permanently banned at level 14.\r\n\r\nIt took me ages, but this disgusts me. I have no idea how I have nearly 100 total permanently banned accounts. I don&rsquo;t know why I always go back on my word and start belittling people when they mess up. I think that it&rsquo;s a coping mechanism, but I have no idea. I have the mindset of that I don&rsquo;t mind if I lose as long as that loss could have been prevented.\r\n\r\nIf I had one wish, it would be for my main account to be unbanned. I think, in the end, having an account I actually care for &ndash; I mean that &ndash; I would be the most friendly player in the world. But I don&rsquo;t trust Riot.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I was given a challenge by a Rioter to make a new account and make it to level 30 without getting banned. If I did this, my main would be unbanned. I did what was asked, it took a month, but I did it. The person who issued the challenge left Riot and the next Rioter denied my account being unbanned because &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not done&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nAnd I think that was the point where I snapped. I stopped looking at Riot as if they were a decent company. I quit looking at the players with proudness. It made me bitter and I take out my anger&hellip; my hatred on everyone else to spite Riot. I dislike being lied to. I hate people that make promises and then break them. Riot has no idea how much that ruined me mentally.\r\n\r\nI stopped enjoying the game and began enjoying ruining the game for other people.\r\n\r\nSomehow, in my mind, it all made sense. I didn&rsquo;t look at my actions and be like, &ldquo;Whoa, dude, that&rsquo;s not going to help.&rdquo; I just saw red and wanted Riot to suffer for lying to me. For breaking a promise. For raising my hopes and then crushing them.\r\n\r\nI know nothing will come from this. I know Riot won&rsquo;t contact me and be like, &ldquo;Hey, we&rsquo;ll make good on that deal now!&rdquo; I know that. But, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to change unless something is done. I love this game. I enjoy playing the game, even when I lose, but I cannot enjoy it if I constantly seek to undermine Riot, and that is never going to stop because that&rsquo;s how I am mentally.\r\n\r\nIf you wrong me, I will continually wrong you until I feel the price is paid. Breaking a promise when I was the most vulnerable has an infinite cost, Riot.\r\n\r\nI went from a starry-eyed boy that wanted to work for your company to a bitter person that wanted it to burn.\r\n\r\nNone of this excuses my behaviour, I know that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-29T09:47:16.786+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cliche as it is, admitting is the first step. I've been around awhile myself, and the people that cause the most problems are the ones that genuinely think their behaviour is ok or justifiable. Why should they change if they've done nothing wrong? Ofc that's not how everyone else see it, but that hardly matters to them.\n\nI won't pretend I've had the best impression of you from boards, but it takes a lot more than people think to admit wrongdoing, especially to a community you know is probably going to shoot you down anyway which you made clear from the get go, so at the very least I can say I respect that.\n\nOfc, admitting is ONLY the first step, but look at this way, the fact that Riot is committed to reform and allows you the opportunity to make a new account means you can take it further if you really want to, With that said though, noone, no matter how persuasive can convince you to change if you aren't willing to, that is true of anyone. It seems like you still aren't likely to change your behaviour, but there's hope at least I suppose.\n\nAs for the level 30 challenge, I suspect you were likely the victim of timing there. Riot realised that it wasn't actually helping anyone reform and so revoked the practice, though I'm unsure of the timeline so I couldn't tell you when. You could always try submitting a ticket explaining what happened (assuming you haven't already), but I'd say chances of anything changing now are next to nothing.\n\nRiot has done things to lose player trust in the past, and if I had to name their biggest downfall even now, I'd say it's communication. The only advice I can give on that one is to remember that they're a big company with a lot of different teams, and I get the feeling they don't all communicate so well which each other nevermind us, but at least they value their players a lot  more than other companies.\n\nYou can say you aren't going to change unless something is done, but do you think by wronging more and more other players you are giving Riot any incentive to help you in any way? Ofc a perma ban is a perma ban but it applies to life as well. If you wrong others because you were wronged at some point, you only hurt yourself, the person that wronged you has already moved on and meanwhile you are ruining your hopes of getting help from anyone else.\n\nRemember that by being toxic you aren't hurting Riot, you are only hurting other players who may well love the game as much as you used to.\n\nIf you truly don't enjoy the game, and are only playing to hurt Riot, then why play the game? One persons actions in game aren't going to hurt Riot, it's only a waste of your time and energy and all at the cost of other players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2017-09-29T08:49:39.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot be like k! cool story bro","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-09-29T08:29:08.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol mad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-09-29T22:58:59.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Scripts,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yzEtPJHr,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-09-29T06:49:44.381+0000)\n>\n> , it took a month, but I did it. \n\nTook me more than a year to get level 30, you must have put in some serious XP boosts there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-29T11:06:46.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, so you're saying that at some point Riot CONSIDERED unbanning your main?
