I play with the same skin every time consistently (let's use the example of Garen, I only use Warring Kingdoms Garen, yet it randomly selects Sanguine or Desert Trooper whatever that skin is called yet I've NEVER played the Desert one before let alone most of his skins I own). There are certain champions for me that this happens most often with, and I don't understand if there's an underlying system to try to get me to use my least used skins but it's such a tilter when you only realise on the loading screen cos I was busy browsing memes after locking in. (This has happened so many time with Sanguine Garen, and really Rito I don't want to look like I'm wearing bacon the entire game). :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-27T11:25:36.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is so hard to change page with with 2 clicks within what?
