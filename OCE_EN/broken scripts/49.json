It was an interesting read, honestly. Sadly, despite the rich and exciting history of my family, I literally cannot provide proof because it has my information there and, because I'm the last male alive, you can see all my details, which ruins my arrogant air and I cannot have this. I'm from the direct line, whereas there's branch from where my family literally married everyone all over the world. Hence the connection to Austrian nobility. That, I assume is a bastard line.\n\nMy family was also one of the first settlers to Australia. Wowies.\n\nANNEX THIS COUNTRY, IT'S MINE! WE DISCOVERED IT.","replies":[]}]}]}
