ADCs can be played mid and toplane, with some (Twitch) going jungle, so I really hope they don't nerf her when she's played elsewhere.\n\nKinda sad she won't be in URF, though. She looks like she'd be nuts in it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-30T04:03:49.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree though I can respect that support is a bit trickier to balance flexes for.\n\nThe gold and experience mechanics for support are substantially different, and it's easy for a support centric champ to become too strong if they're balanced elsewhere or visa versa.\n\nI mean really, the only supports (generally) who can flex are mages and tanks to mid/top. Full enchanters like Nami just can't really compete, but as a support, they out-perform a lot of other champs (totally not biased).\n\nPersonally, I'd take a super unique support, that can only support, over something more typical like Lux that can flex. If that's the trade-off it has to be, I'll happily take the unique-ness.\n\nBut that is, of course, coming from someone who always has been and probably always will be a support main, so really isn't playing them or any other champ in any other role much anyway.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if we get lanes with Senna like the Ashe/MF strat.\n\nAlso a new global ult!","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-10-30T06:44:25.211+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I do love a good support discussion/debate!\n\nI do agree that supports that can go into other roles are much harder to balance than champions that can go support. Lux/Brand/Vel’koz are fantastic examples of this. Heck, even Morgana was designed as a midlane mage.\n\nI really do think Pyke shook it up. There was no other support champ that had a secondary class that was damage orientated. Sure, you could build AP on them and do some damage, but not in the sense that Pyke could actually win fights alone and still keep his ADC ahead in gold and offer a degree of crowd control and initiation.\n\nI really do love this unique supports that can do *more*. I had a buddy that hated support, but played assassins. Pyke was like a calling to him as he was tired of midlane. He played a bit of Pyke and soon branched out into other supports, like Leona, Soraka, and Nami. Never thought I would see the day when this guy played supporting willingly.\n\nHowever, we now have a support ADC players can play and this really helps when people get autofilled support. Because Pyke and Senna both have carry potential. Pyke can do fine if his ADC is not performing well, so you’re not exactly held back.\n\nI honestly think that Senna could do well with Ashe. The level 6 would be insane.\n\nAlso, I had no idea her ult was global! That is massive!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-30T11:02:29.678+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too!\n\nYou make a very good point about unique supports. Oddly enough I had that experience with Rek'sai and jungle. Before her release I wouldn't touch jungle with a 10-foot pole because I just had no idea how to play it, it was way too intimidating, and she was my gateway.\n\nHaving that diversity in the support role, even if they can't flex, means more familiarity for players that get auto-filled and less negativity around getting bumped into support in general.\n\nSupport has the advantage of basically never being filled, but there's a wide array of transferrable skills, particularly for top/mid. Players getting filled *into* support generally have fewer options. I'd argue there are a few key skills that aren't *unique* to support but which are much more central. Playing from behind for example. A support main Lux in mid knows how to (consistently) play as the weaker mage and still be successful, but a mid main Lux often doesn't, so the support can flex to mid, but the opposite is much harder.\n\nPersonally, I feel that there are (albeit limited) options in support champs for everyone, and that playing support for a while is a great way to develop some skills that are generally under-utilised in other lanes (at least in my MMR bracket). I think people need to stop looking as at support as \"good god I got auto-filled *again*\" and more as a chance to develop some new skills.\n\nI know that's probably a bit optimistic, but having more unique supports, and especially in roles that would typically fall to other positions, is a strong step in the right direction (and also a whole bundle of fun for support mains along the way!).\n\nThere's also the stale factor. I adore Nami, she's always going to be my main, but consequently, if I'm playing ranked, I'm pretty much playing Nami. I find myself not necessarily getting bored of her, but playing more and more on auto-pilot, less engaged, and mixing things up with a Nautilus or a Neeko (and I just now realise they're all N champs!) is a great way to break out of that. Having more options for *different* is only a good thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-30T03:58:59.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gonna be honest, Senna is probably a champ I'll pick up asap.
