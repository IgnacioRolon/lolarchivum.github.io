IV is so much worse than III, II, and I. Today, I have played 6 games and 4 of them have had an AFKer in them. On my team, as per usual. As i said, I have been stuck or stagnated in IV until some turn of luck happened and I win/lose'd it out. Sadly, in Plat IV, I cannot do that as I lose more than I get, so I am constantly hovering the same LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-22T04:16:48.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"4 out of 6 games?\nCute, i get an average of 2 per game. \nWhen you actually start getting AFKers, hit me up.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-09-20T10:26:11.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes division 4 of every rank is awful because the fact that people can't be demoted gives them no reason to try... ever.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-20T11:13:10.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You can get demoted you just have to lose so many games. \nSource: Me, and my demotion shield expiry.","replies":[]}]}]}
