The vast majority of people will only express their opinion or act on their experiences when it's a negative one. It's human nature. \n\nEvery single day each of us encounter positive experiences but we don't act on it because it's to be expected. It's the norm. Yet as soon we get rubbed up the wrong way, don't like something or had a bad experience we're ready to voice our opinions to the world. The same principals apply to League.\n\nAsk yourself, how many times have you voted for someone when they were friendly or helped you carry the game compared to how many times you've voted for someone who negatively impacted you? I bet the later would outweigh the former hands down.\n\nNot only that, the OCE server is THE most toxic cesspit of assholes imaginable. Do you really think people are going to vote for others when they potentially have something to gain from it? HA! A small minority will vote, but that's about all. Most will take the win and simply move onto the next game regardless of your performance and attitude (unless it's a negative one).","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-06-14T10:55:09.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The vast majority of people\" So you are talking on behalf of the vast majority of league players. You might commonly find toxic people in the elo that you are currently in, everyone knows that. Even people in higher elos knows that Gold and below are toxic but there are players out there that should be honoured and will now be given the chance to let everyone find that honour button wether they like it or not but hey they've put a button for people who had a bad experience to not honour someone.  (Toxic players are found in every elo in every region just because you've encountered them doesn't make the server as a whole MOST toxic server stop giving it this name) \n\nAsk myself? I've honoured heaps of people and yes there are more reports i've done then honours because you encounter more toxic summoners in this community then you do with non-toxic summoners. And i get what you are saying lets break it down i'm a support player, I don't get a good job when i managed to carry a team fight or get the adc ahead by setting up kills. i just sit there and say yep that's my job. \n\nToxic summoners are in every server. OCE shouldn't be refered to as the most anything as it has little to none summoners compared to say NA or EU. \n\nThis system as I said was well made and thought out and if players refer to use a report rather a honour then so be it.\n\nThe people who are honourable and respectful will earn something if it takes them a few months or maybe the whole season. At least they are now getting something out of it not just a pat on the back gl for next game. Where as people that are toxic will not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
