If a support peels for Jhin, have fun against him because he is one of the most frustrating ADC's to lane against, only just behind Ezreal. That's my opinion, though.\n\nI agree with this. With 100% crit chance, his lack of mobility is gone because he gets a free ghost every auto. I could kite a Yi and he could not reach me. Let that sink in for a moment. His snare, which has a 4s CD at 18, also helps him immensely, either while reloading or just kiting. He is too hard to catch and pin down. Only his fourth shot should give MS, to aid with kiting while you have minimal damage.\n\nThe issue, at the moment, is that itemization is too good for ADCs. Jhin gets free stats from everything as AS gives him AD, each auto from Guinsoo's gives him, like, a free BF sword each auto. It's not just Jhin, either. Most ADC's haven't changed and they either become really good on item changes or really bad. However, Jhin is too similar to Vayne. He can be strong as hell one patch, then completely unviable the next.\n\nAt the current time, playing top, jungle, or mid is pointless. bot lane decides the game. I feel bad for top, because they're essentially meatshields for the ADCs and that role is absolute garbage and unfun to play. Riot needs to fix ADC before any other role can be tweaked. ADC should not be the carry role, they're marksmen, according to Riot, not carries.","replies":[]}]}]}
