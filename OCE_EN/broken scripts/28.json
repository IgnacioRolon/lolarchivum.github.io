NB3 legit went AFK for 2 minutes, was 0/2, and contributed nothing to the team. Also, the fact that NB3 got someone banned when that kid was toxic in chat is amusing. Also, NB3 has a history of stealing roles, holding people hostage, and doing the same damn thing.\r\n\r\nFire the employee who banned Nubrac then ban NightBlue3 for two weeks.

I'll say this Nubrac is straight up a narcissistic fellow. Don't be fool by his buzz word of off meta. Just take a look at how he perform in game. As a Teemo support all he does is stacking DPS items, low lane pressure and lack of warding. \n\nImagine if you are his ADC and this fool just leave you for 5mins level 1 to go roam top and mid. You are now zone out of lane with low income. And this is him being standard. There are games he would go mid and be the support. Which is foolish. The mid and top lane are the 2 roles that benefit greatly from high lv for reasons such as dueling, split push, ETC... Instead he goes there to soak EXP, and pretend it is for the greater good. His version of greater good is built on his self admiration. \n\nHis win rate on Teemo is 48%, 441 games played. As you can see, he loses way more than he wins. As much as he like to think it is working and he is a pioneer of great things to come. The true of the matter is, he love himself too much to see the wrongs.  \n\nNB3 is not a great character either, he is a pretentious little man. Back when he has low self esteem it kept his true nature from surfacing. I'll bet. When things goes wrong in his life; The 1st thing he will do is blame someone else for it, and since he is a victim, his outrage is justify.\n\nThey are both at fault.

The crux of the matter is, his game style put his team mate in a disadvantage position and give them antagonizing experience. And of course, as long as he covered all of that with a thin veil of \"Am trying to win\", this is suppose to nullify all the negativity he has created?\n\n>  he isn't doing it purely for shits and giggles and to specifically troll and grief people.\n\nHe doing this because the kid clearly wasn't being taught the golden rule of, is not about winning, is how you play the game.

Whether you and your support synergies well or not, is not even on the same page as Nubrac. \n\nHe is forcing others to be what HE WANT THEM TO BE. There is no choice but to comply. Look at all those games when he went mid and top as a support. What are they suppose to do? Chase him off? They cant! No matter how unpleasant this guy is, you have to play it out. Same with his ADC. \n\nHow can the 2 scenarios converge as you've described? As much of a coward the support is, at least he held your hand and do his job. While Nubrac forced 2 solo lanes into a off role bottom lane. And not to mention he only build DPS items on Teemo and not a single warding item! And we all know how shit an unfed Teemo can be.\n\n> besides, riot themselves said they had already 'investigated' and concluded he wasn't doing anything wrong. but you know, when a content creator with a sizeable following complains the rules change.\n\nOh please, the balloon pumped with ego and knotted cord made out of arrogant know as NB3.

The concept here is continuation. \n\nHe is at a tier where the players are few and the chance of the same encounter are numerous. So if he consistently want to persist his style, knowing how many hate it. He should not be surprise about the negative result. He want to look for a loop hole to annoy others, congrats! he found it.

Riot have the TOS, it is within their boundary to do just that. He is creating many unpleasant games for many players, when confronted with the issue, he dressed it up as \"Viable off meta\".

Better be really skillful or you're gonna look like a fool. The coach are in charge of planing, they will tell you what you should do, and where you should be, and who you should mark. \n\nYou can adapt while playing, but never change the game plan. Because the team wont know wtf you are doing. You'll be doing it all alone. While everyone else on your team will be thinking to themselves, wtf is that guy doing. He is messing up our game plans.

All you are is a free for all steak, ready to be share among the wolfs. \n\n>  you need different minded people to grow.\n\nTrue, one need to know both the good and the bad in order to allocate oneself accordingly.\n\n> another irony here(your arguments seem to have a lot) is that western society is largely driven by narcissism and greed.\n\nAnd where did i wrote such a sentiment?

His so call style is not a play style, but a method for him to **gain attention**. He is doing so to boost his streaming career. Once you understand that, then you can see through the game play and look at his intention. Beneath those denials and practice lies he preach. He know EXACTLY what he was doing. \n\n> my main issue now is why was there such a disproportionate effort now that certain personalities became involved, which resulted in a big backflip of their original investigations (because apparently certain 'evidence' was ignored previously because not the same amount of effort is made when its 'normal' people having an issue)?\n\nDude, it not easy to find a job at riot, and being a measly grunt in the company, would you risk getting fired for not following procedures? Just because a supposes friend call you for a idiotic favor? If the decision come from Riot the company, than it is different in comparison to the \"Riot friend\". \n\nI don't have the details, but an educated guess would be either a lot more complains after NB3, or NB3's complain was the feather that broke the camel's back.\n\n> nb3 would have been punished immediately. his behaviour was literally on display. but no, it took community pressure for it to happen. it comes back to the OP's post.

If you are, then yes that would be unfair. If he is doing things that might get him ban, that is another matter altogether. \n\nTechnically, he received a game banned. Since they've removed it, he can still get ban like anyone else, just not exile, like in the past.\n\n>  he still does the same stuff on stream. so why does riot now want to associate itself with that? i mean, he literally calls the company trash...\n\nPost proof of him running it down intentionally losing, and telling people to kill themselves like he did in the past.

'this is why society has prospered because we don't tolerate bad behaviour' problem is we are not talking about 'bad behaviour'. this discussion has been about tolerating different people and personalities. who are you to judge certain 'styles'                                                   as 'good' or 'bad'. it's actually the opposite of what you are trying to insinuate. we have prospered as a society because we do, as time passes, tolerate differences and influence each other. unfortunately as humans we still have a long way to go in this regard. you need different minded people to grow. another irony here(your arguments seem to have a lot) is that western society is largely driven by narcissism and greed.\n\ni think the only one in a deep hole is you. i've only ever defended him in regards to his personality and playstyle. i have never defended any specific instance of him targeting someone. there just was not any evidence of this until now apparently. it's been made clear (or at least claimed) that he INDEED has been banned for specific instances of behaviour, not for his overall style. you can change tune if u want, but you originally were talking about getting rid of him because 'people don't like playing with him' and because of narcissism and the kind of person he is, not because of a specific game or games that he crossed the line in terms of behaviour and therefore deserves punishment for those circumstances.\n\nmy main issue now is why was there such a disproportionate effort now that certain personalities became involved, which resulted in a big backflip of their original investigations (because apparently certain 'evidence' was ignored previously because not the same amount of effort is made when its 'normal' people having an issue)? is it because it's more about PR and not actually about player behaviour? if it was about player behaviour, nb3 would have been punished immediately. his behaviour was literally on display. but no, it took community pressure for it to happen. it comes back to the OP's post. 'streamers can get people banned?\". it's perception that matters.\n\nregarding tyler1. not sure what details im skipping. riot made a big public PR post about it at the time. 'we've got your back community!!!' when they banned him. then they realised he is actually quite popular with the community. so they made him a poster boy. those are 2 very big extremes. that shows no credibility or that they were ever genuine in the first place (it also shows that they miscalculate things). do you even watch tyler1? overall he has not actually changed. his behaviour is actually what makes him popular... all he's done is refrain from saying and doing certain things in-game. he still does the same stuff on stream. so why does riot now want to associate itself with that? i mean, he literally calls the company trash...","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-07-01T08:53:42.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> lmao so you think because i comment on the nastiness of people in 'social circles' it means i dont go out or have no relationships.\n\nYea, because your concept is so lacking; It sounded like you have little idea of what you are talking about.

Something such as \"AFK farming\" is *definitely* a punishable offence, because it is something that is actively working against your team. If you were to do it consistently in-game, you'd more than likely receive a ban for that behaviour, and whether you *believe* that or not does not change the fact that it *is* against the rules.

The only reason NB3 did so is because the ticket itself had *NOT* shown results for two full days. Believe it or not, but *you* also have the ability to do the same, and contact Rioters directly should you be unsatisfied with Support. In fact, if you find that Support is consistently failing cases you bring to them, I would personally recommend you pursue those cases in other ways.\n\nIn saying that, you should keep in mind that very few Rioters will put up with that if you bring them *every* player you have a minor disagreement with. Try and keep that kind of escalation to the stuff that *needs* to be escalated.\n\n> Also, NB3 made the report while in-game. He typed it while playing. You know, AFKing?\n\nYes, and he should be punished for his behaviour in-game, that was never in dispute (you can find that I said basically the same thing in my original comment). It's also important to consider that he was in a situation where he honestly felt his time was better spent submitting that report than trying to play that game for several reasons, including the fact that 2 of his team mates were already AFK, and another was actively griefing.\n\nFundamentally, that does not make NB3's behaviour any more acceptable, but I do *understand* why he chose to take that action at that point, and if I'm being completely honest, I might have done the same thing given the same circumstances (specifically regarding the \"submitting a report while still in-game\" thing, not his other behaviour).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-06-19T07:32:22.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=z9tuNHiV,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2019-06-18T10:18:13.641+0000)\n>\n> Something such as \"AFK farming\" is *definitely* a punishable offence,\n>If you were to do it consistently in-game, you'd more than likely receive a ban for that behaviour, and whether you *believe* that or not does not change the fact that it *is* against the rules.

That said, the act of ***REFUSING*** to communicate *is* punishable. As I said in my previous comment, you are not obliged to communicate in every single game, but that doesn't mean that you can blatantly refuse to communicate and leave your team in the dark. In particular, situations where a player goes heavily off-meta is the *perfect* example of this going into practice, because not communicating in such a situation is actively working against the team.\n\nCommunicating your strategy and being open to feedback about it is what you *should* do. For one thing, it will provide the team with a chance to adapt to the strategy from the start (even if they don't agree with it), rather than, for example, letting them think they'll have a support in a traditionally 2v2 lane just for you to leave them in a 1v2 situation that they can't handle with their champion and/or skill.\n\n> I, like many others in the community do not look kindly on favoritism, and *I think a discussion highlighting this to riot is very valid*.\n\nWe agree on that point. No one is saying that these kinds of discussions aren't valid, or that the opinions of players aren't valid, but *fundamentally* that does not *change* the established rules. Those rules still exist as they have and likely will continue to regardless of personal opinion on them. You can discuss those opinions freely, you can advocate for change based on those opinions, but simply having those opinions doesn't change the established rules, or mean they don't apply.\n\n> We all have ways to play and you shouldn't get special privilege for being a streamer that allows you to play say offmeta jungle maokai, but a regular player is punitively banned for trying the same.\n\nThen you and I must have *very* different experiences with using off-meta strategies. Personally, I've never had an issue using off-meta strategies, though I have seen many players claim the opposite. That *might* have something to do with how different players address that kind of situation, however, and fundamentally what kind of mentality those players are taking into the match with how their ideas will be perceived.\n\nSomething as simple as just communicating your ideas and intentions with the team, in a positive manner, and choosing a different strategy if they're not keen on it can make all the difference in how those players respond to those ideas (both shot and long term), as opposed to simply saying nothing and doing whatever you want every time regardless of how it affects your team mates. Communicating those ideas also gives those players a better idea of how such strategies work, which may make them more comfortable with having someone use such a strategy in that match, or another match in the future.\n\nUltimately, it seems that the main issue in how players are *generally* addressing such issues is to ignore the rules and just do whatever they want, which is punishable because of how it negatively affects hundreds of other players. My point is, it's likely that many of these players are experiencing issues not because of the \"off-meta strategy\" in and of itself, but how they attempt to utilise those strategies and their attitudes and behaviours in doing so. Then they get banned for abusing another player, for example, and just *assume* it's because they were playing off-meta, when that isn't the point of contention in the situation.\n\nRiot does need to take actions in a way that is as unbiased as possible, that is something I think we can all agree on, but one thing I think players need to keep in mind is that they can't use things that *aren't* punishable (such as \"off-meta\") as a platform for things that *are* punishable (such as griefing) and expect to get away with it, whether that's what they've intended to do or not, and they need to stop misinterpreting and misrepresenting those situations. I think one aspect of that is that many players don't have a more definitive idea of what is against the rules, and I think Riot could try to be a bit more clear on that (I believe the \"reporting a player\" support page used to be a lot more clear on that than it is now, which is unfortunate). Ultimately, though, Riot can only go so far to make it all work, the players have to come the rest of the way.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-06-20T06:24:35.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=z9tuNHiV,comment-id=0000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2019-06-19T09:12:44.854+0000)\n>\n> No, and that's a completely ridiculous way of interpreting my statement.

You will not find a single person who will complain about a Nasus sitting top and farming all game. You could be losing turrets, dragons, inhibitors, barons, and people would just nod and claim that Nasus is farming.\n\nYou cannot have it both ways and be like, “Well, he’s working towards his spike” because that’s bull. He is still making the game a 4v5 and Riot pushes that champion design by buffing it. It cannot be defended. AFK farming is stuck in the meta and it’s a thing that really shouldn’t be punishable.\n\n2) That’s not refusing to communicate. I don’t have to tell my team what I’m doing. It’s not in the rules. If I want to play AD support Anivia botlane, I will. Ranked shows what position you’re going for a reason. I don’t have to speak to them. I don’t have to ping them. I don’t have to ward. I don’t have to join teamfights. As long as I am not actively working to make my team lose, nothing I do is against the rules.\n\nI play a lot of Pyke. I have loved his concept since I saw him—the upcoming nerfs are going to be a massive hit—and I do the same thing. I stay botlane until I’m level 3 and then I’m gone. Pulling from that Nubrac game, the ADC was a damn Sivir. She shouldn’t have struggled at all.\n\nI have never once told my ADC that I’m going to roam. It’s a given as you’re a roaming support. It’s like reporting a Bard for leaving the lane to collect chimes. The only time people complain is when they get caught out because they don’t look at the map and realise I’m gone.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-06-20T12:24:57.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also if your ADC is struggling it might also just be a better idea to follow the midlaner around help enable them to carry more with heals/shields/cc/picks ect... some games it's better to capitalize on a lead than to try to patch up a deficit. \n\nSure the ADC might not enjoy getting dove and not being able to farm, but you are technically making the choice that leads to the highest chance of victory, and whilst this could be considered griefing the 1 player, not making this choice is griefing 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-20T13:51:36.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think perhaps it would serve us all well to re-iterate what the definition of griefing is.

The systems that *are* in place either take too long to act, or just don't figure it out, and in that sense it's very important for players to follow up any gameplay issues through \"higher escalations\" methods (such as submitting a ticket to support) to help the process along. It's fundamentally because of a flaw in Riot's systems, but players shouldn't claim it doesn't work if they don't take the effort to help it work.\n\nEven in this case with Nubrac, the system in place *just didn't get it*. The situation was misread as nothing more than a case of a player going off-meta when the situation was more complex than that, and as a result we now have a high-profile situation that is just flooding the boards and Reddit and such with misinformation and half-truths, a situation that likely could have been avoided if Riot's systems and policies were up to scratch.\n\nIt's not that \"*only* streamers can get players banned\", it's that the systems in place are fundamentally flawed, and it takes significantly more effort to get results because of that, effort which NB3 actually took, while many other players simply wouldn't consider it because of a belief that \"it wont work\".","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-06-20T09:59:45.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"except this person wasn't specifically griefing. just because people feel that way because most are programmed into a specfific way the game has to be played, doesn't mean it is. it's on them if they feel that way. the game with nb3 is case in point. they could have easily won that match and just played around it. the irelia could have easily snowballed. instead they baby raged and afked. don't get me wrong, i can totally understand the frustration. people want to win, and so unconventional stuff isn't exactly what you want to be forced into doing if it isn't pre-planned. but you gotta accept that you're going to get this if you're choosing to be matched with randoms. otherwise you need to lay down some rules and completely forbid all non-meta in the solo queue environment as it's always going to force the random teammates to play around it.
