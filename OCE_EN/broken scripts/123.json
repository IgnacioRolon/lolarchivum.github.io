Not just once per day, not even once per hour. This shit happens 7/10 games to someone. They don’t come back until about 2:30, down 4 levels, down 900 gold, and already have leaver status.\r\n\r\nI am beyond malding.\r\n\r\nI have lost so much work in the past 5 days due to this client making me restart my PC because it gets stuck at 100%. Deciding to take a 30 min break costs me an hour of irreplaceable work.\r\n\r\nNice.","replies":[{"poster":"Determined Oak","date":"2019-11-27T15:37:42.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to get this. but I don't have it anymore.

Freeze at champion select/ban resulting in que dodge penalty.\n2. Black loading screen resulting in all other clients being held hostage in loading until that one restarts.\n3. Freeze on load screen as you described.\n\nI get one of these every 2-3 games, its honestly unbelivable that the client over 10 years got worse....","replies":[]}]}
