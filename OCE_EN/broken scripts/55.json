Who are they and why are they wrenchmen when I am not? There isn&#039;t anything that I don&#039;t know, whether it&#039;s a general issue or a support question. I am, essentially, all knowing. I have played this game since it was in it&#039;s closed beta stages. I reached the top players in Season 1 and 2 whilst on an average of 250ms. \n\nWhat does this have to do with Wuks and SephirothSG? What does any of this have to do with being a wrenchmen? Simple. I am far more knowledgeable than both of them. My IQ is higher. My Vocabulary is broader. I can speak more languages. I am a better League of Legends player.\n\nI deserve to be a wrenchmen. It&#039;s my honour. You should be honouring _me_ by playing your game. I help more people than those two do. My mere presence inspires people. I, and I alone, am revolutionary. I am a God. I am _perfection_. Denying me this is like denying someone their birthright. I will inheirt, like a son in the medieval era. I will inherit.\n\nThe weak always rise to take down the strong, but what happens when the strong is stronger than anyone could ever imagine? The strong is me. The weak is _you_.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-16T09:07:58.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sick bait m8 üëç","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-06-16T03:20:26.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haHAA good bait haHAA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-06-15T10:30:00.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many things wrong with this post that i just cannot begin to fathom a response.

To flaunt superiority over people in the forums?\n\ni don't feel like arguing with someone over this, Riot makes people wrenchmen for their own reasons, if you think you're worthy, sooner or later they'll make you one... they have plenty of other things to deal with at the moment.","replies":[]}]}
