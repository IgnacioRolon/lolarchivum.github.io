However, under the guise of rapid-fire, it’s really a bland mode that is dictated by a hidden and stupidly enforced meta and plagued by tier lists and picks that promote negativity.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t all top level one, you’re bad. If you call a lane, you’re bad. If you don’t play a champion that is strong or a top pick, you’re bad.\r\n\r\nEvery game: Yuumi, Lucian, Hecarim, Lee Sin, Kai’Sa, Qiyana, Fizz, Master Yi, Shaco, Tryndamere, or Akali. There will be four of those in any given game, assuming they are not banned. I missed a few other top tier picks, of course, but that’s whatever.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to play Soraka, for example, you’re going against the grain and playing a champion that isn’t meta, isn’t ‘strong’, and can’t carry.\r\n\r\nARURF was awful because the game isn’t decided on skill, it’s decided on champions.\r\n\r\nURF is awful because it’s the same 10-15 champions picked every time.\r\n\r\nAnother prime issue is that people dodge if there’s a certain champ. Why is it possible for people to dodge? Keep picks hidden until the game starts. Every day, at least 5 games are dodged because Kai’Sa is in the game. “WOW! Kai’Sa not banned, cya!” I don’t blame them as that champ deserves to stay banned – I’m sure regular Kai’Sa could win in URF – but it’s the point. They’ll either dodge or simply go and jungle and watch as the person in the 1v2 lane gets trounced and the game is over at 8 minutes.\r\n\r\nURF is like a better training tool. It allows you to learn to counter certain skills, abilities, and helps you with dodging. Thanks to URF, I can now flash Malphite’s ult 9/10 without complications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the environment this game provides is awful. It makes it unfun and insanely toxic. Add in a bunch of anti-fun champs that make you want to punch your screen – Shaco – multiple times. Add in the fact people don’t care. Add in the fact that people overplay the mode and no longer find it fun but keep playing because it only appears every six or so months.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-11-06T23:11:46.555+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen Yuumi once, Lucian twice, Hec twice, Lee four times, never seen a Kai'Sa, Qiyanna once, Fizz several times, Yi once, Shaco once, Tryndamere twice (both times they inted), Akali once.\n\nI don't know where you're getting your stats from, i've played roughly 60 games of URF and as listed above and i've only seen them that many times, with less bans coming their way, i see Zed more than any other champ\n\nAt no point is URF toxic or negativity promoting. No one is toxic, i mean just last night i ended up in a mirror match with a high quality Lee player, and we duked it out for 20 minutes, both ending the game with 20+ kills and 10 (or in my case 13) deaths, at no point was there any flame, just quality banter.\n\nThere is no tier list in URF that makes sense, there's no \"meta\" everyone fucks around.\n\nThe all top thing is just for fun, it happens on OCE, EU, NA (just go check the League Reddit, i've seen several posts about what things happen on what servers in URF games, and the all top is a common one)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-11-06T11:45:49.653+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Considering my 3 most played urf champions are probably predator lethality Poppy, full AP Udyr, 1shot 4Infinity edge Thresh.\n\nI feel the need to disagree about there being an 'enforced meta'.\n\nMeta is only a vague guide, and I've seen plenty of people feed on 'OP' Urf picks, whilst I decide to 1shot the Tryndamere from out of a bush for the upteenth time as 4 infinity edge thresh. If the tryndamere ults, I hold my auto and run around a bit with predator movespeed, and then I auto attack him with the scariest possible crit.\n\nURF is a magical place where meta doesn't matter, and your memes can be more than dreams. So what if the enemy is playing Kaisai, it doesn't really make a difference when you can 1hit her as Thresh, or run at the speed of light pin her to a wall and stunlock her, or just run around screaming fuck you whilst kaisai fails to break your ridiculous 900hp shield every 1.2s and doesn't realise it's not actually worth chasing the AP udyr.\n\nI mean, sure a professional kai sai can kite you nearly forever, but as AP/resistance udyr, she also cannot do enough damage to break your shield, so if she's dumb enough to fight you, eventually you'll stun her, pheonix stance lichbane and kill her. (Unfortunately, more likely is she'll just pick on your metaslave teammates and the enemy team will ignore you entirely because you pretty much do nothing except mildly bother people and spam your shield and 1v1 towers without minions and still not taking damage).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-11-06T13:39:05.751+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, I've had no issues with this \"enforced meta\" you're referring to.\n\nOther than Quinn and Valor, I've not played the same champ twice, and I've been trying to go for picks I wouldn't normally consider (Kled, Sejuani, Diana, Soraka, for example). I've also seen a *lot* of variety in the champions that others have picked in those games, even though certain champs do tend to be more popular (\\*cough\\* Yuumi \\*cough\\*). I've not had anyone get upset by people not \"going top level one\", or for calling a lane, or for picking decent/mediocre/terrible champs. I've also had no issues with people dodging *after* enemy champs were revealed, and very few instances of dodging to begin with.\n\nHonestly, in my experience, this iteration of URF seems to one of the healthiest, if not *the* healthiest, to date (including ARURF to be clear).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-11-06T14:23:40.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I find the more I play and optomise my AP/resistance Udyr Build, the more fun I have, as I watch enemies give up when they realise nothing they do, has any consequence.\n\nI was towerdiving a Jinx earlier, and after we ran around the tower a couple of times and she flashed, I accidentally stepped on a trap, and so she started autoing me (whilst I was still tanking tower), and she realised that my shield wasn't being broken before I refreshed it, and she just stopped autoing, stood there, not even recalling.\n\nI could feel the hope had died in that person's soul, and they were just waiting for me to kill them so they could return to base, as I spammed emotes.\n\nURF is so much fun.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-11-12T02:08:18.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May I ask have you ever played predator ghost ap ww\n\nI know it's a meme but boi is it fking stronk in urf once you hit 6","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-06T21:37:43.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF is pretty much like a first person shooter + moba, so that's great fun, good for s rank farming, toxic-ish-ish-ish because of meta sheeple that wont adapt, communicate, help or tip one another  or counter build and there's a whole bunch of items, and ways you can dodge Malph ult or actually catch it if you want to lure him away from his team {{item:3102}} {{item:3814}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3026}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3046}} {{item:2065}} {{item:2420}} {{item:3309}} {{item:3905}} {{item:3142}} Just avoid URF then if new and don't want any trolly feedback and fast paced gameplay or ask for tips if there's any nice people.
