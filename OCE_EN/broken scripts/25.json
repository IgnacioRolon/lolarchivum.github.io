I went in for that free gold and then his Q did 60% of my HP and mistakes were made. I destroyed him in lane. Whenever he went to Q a minion, I took 40% of his HP. He had no stacks but then wtf is that damage?","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-04-29T08:22:00.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He melee, you ranged.

I was top lane, as you can see, and the map shows that he got hammered. I had his entire lane at 11 minutes. He had no farm. He was so far behind and still 2 hit me.
