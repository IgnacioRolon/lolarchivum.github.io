Sure it's not great, and ideally you'll want like 90cs at 10min, but every game is different.\n\nIn alot of cases in botlane if I'm playing aggressively against even slightly less competent players with a good partner to back me up, if the enemy jungler does provide some serious pressure, I can generally zone the enemy adc hard.\n\nThis can be even worse in somewhere like midlane, where a fed LB can blink in, half health you, and blink out with barely any window to react, or toplane, where if your jungler inted them an early redbuff and gave the enemy jungle and toplane a small lead, they can very likely poke you down and dive you from more than half hp, if your jungler doesn't match that pressure.\n\nCsing is a basic skill, but assuming that every game the teams will be perfectly matched is a bad assumption. A team of 1 diamond and 4 silvers vs 5 gold players is quite possible, the Gold player who inted into the Diamond player isn't necessarily bad, but the game does hinge on how well he can hold ground against that diamond player.\n\nEvery game is different, and also lategame in low elo games, it can be hard to pick up farm, especially as an adc. You'll have players bouncing or not bouncing waves at bad times, players at full build still eating waves in midlane forcing the adc with their newest most expensive crit builds this patch to try to pick up side waves and push risky depths putting them at risk of being abused by an assassin.\n\nThere are so many things to consider.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2019-02-07T11:10:40.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-02-07T11:54:45.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Excited,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=25bxdmpp,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-02-07T11:10:40.638+0000)\n>\n>[REMOVED]\n\nThis account was banned after 11 ranked games.
