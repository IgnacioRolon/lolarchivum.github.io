Alone, simply cursing isn't a problem at all and won't result in a restriction. If you are constantly harassing people *while* cursing, you can be punished and it'll have nothing to do with saying \"fuck\".\n\nAs for \"kys\", it's definitely a bannable offense. I frequently see chat logs where a player is escalated past chat restrictions to a ban for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-08T08:18:14.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^^ What you (OP) say is an oversimplification and also just not true.

Ultimately players decide what is not ok.\n\nAssuming you did, the instant feedback system usually punished in about 10 minutes (though not always) but it's possible the behaviour was escalated for a manual review. Admittedly I'm not 100% sure what the process there is since we only get told so much.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-09T03:49:49.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate you can get banned from general friendly banter. I'm happy to post up one of my chat logs to show you that even having a giggle with someone can get you chat restricted or used as a strike against you. And I'm not talking about abusing someone in a joking matter or anything alike. I'm talking about banter between yourself and an enemy team player who's been harassing you all game long who in return reports you because you pointed out you outplayed them. No one called anyone bad, etc or said anything derogatory etc, it was just friendly banter between both players but because he got salty he lost himself and his duo reported me.\n\nIn fact, you can call an enemy player trash etc in TEAM chat and still be banned for it.
