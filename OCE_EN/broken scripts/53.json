As it stands irelia is just a stat check champ which a stun that lacks game play clarity.  Also not sure how you can call that good by any means and on top of that they aren’t turning champs into “ anime champs” as u call it. It’s called fantasy nothing in league is possible. Hell the only really anime is the star guardian skins referencing sailor moon and super galaxy skins referencing gurren lagann and a couple of smaller ones like neon vi recall is a reference to Franky from one piece and Ezreal's dance is from Haruhi (Hare Hare Yukai).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-03-20T06:11:22.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=HKJuW6A8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-03-20T05:46:36.468+0000)\n>\n> You don’t even know da abilities 😂\n\nhttps://twitter.com/LeagueOfLegends/status/975753080170954753/video/1\n\nLOOK AT THIS WEEB NONSENSE","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-20T23:37:50.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She looks so slick :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LGD xiDaDa","date":"2018-03-21T08:10:38.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They even use a script to post their trailer.
