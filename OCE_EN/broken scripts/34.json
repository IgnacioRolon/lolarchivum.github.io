The fact is it is and always will be a team game. If you're team believes in never say never with or without you then you should consider playing more pre-made games. \nDon't get me wrong there are some games I myself wonder why these people aren't quitting and it gets super annoying. Having said that I have also seen many games from which opponents d.c. or mistakes are made and games turned which literally would be categorized as \"fate\". \nPerhaps it is not the situation of the game state which is the problem but you're perspective? I don't mean to lecture but.... if that game was literally worth 1m would you be so inclined to quit? All I'm saying is just focus on what YOU can control and no matter the circumstance better yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-14T07:11:38.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Personally, I'm a big believer in \"we can still win this\", but ultimately that relies on us having had *some* success. \n\nIf we've won 1 fight in 3, there's still a chance, low it may be and I will probably deny that surrender. If we're losing every single fight, or someone has already given up and is just not playing with the team, or someone is afk, or there's just no synergy, then yeah, surrender that. If only for your own sanity.\n\nI can't really say I feel they're worse than inters, but it depends on why/how they are denying the surrender.\n\nOn the flipside, one of the things that really grinds my gears is people who just completely give up after their 15/20 minute surrender vote fails. Like dude, it's a vote for a reason. Just because *you* think that game is over/don't want to play it anymore, doesn't mean you get to *make* it over.\n\nIt'd be nice if everyone could just use it as intended.","replies":[]}]}
