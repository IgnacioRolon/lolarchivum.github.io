The problem stems from a tank having 550 ad+ with only a black cleaver.\n\nAnd lee just has ridiculous bases and cds.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-19T23:56:03.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even with bonus on hit damage, no tank should be doing that much with an auto.\nI think it needs to be easier to dodge his heal. As it stands, with his W slow AND the bounce back from his E, coupled with his movement speed from phage (and most of then take ghost as well), theres almost no way of escaping his axe blade, so he's basically guaranteed a 1/3 HP heal.\n\nand yea, Lee needs to be sent back to the drawing board.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-19T13:39:14.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Learn to http://imgur.com/kM2bkel","replies":[]}]}
