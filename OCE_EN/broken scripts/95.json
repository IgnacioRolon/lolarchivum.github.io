{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-12-27T09:16:51.059+0000","title":"\"Ask Riot: URF\"","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, it has to be that points out RIot&#039;s many flaws in that travesty of an article that did nothing but ease the anger from the twelve-year-old children that praise a poorly written article because it seemed to be written by a girl, who knew. That article is reminiscent of Buzzfeed articles, really. Poorly written and full of misinformation.\r\n\r\n&quot;_URF launched a long time ago, way before we ever started doing RGM. It was basically a crazy April Fool&rsquo;s gag that ended up becoming hugely popular. Given how popular it is, lots of players want to know why we don&rsquo;t bring back regular URF more often. There&rsquo;s one reason that we haven&rsquo;t really talked about before now:_\r\n\r\n_**URF makes some people stop playing League.**_&quot;\r\n\r\nThis paragraph is oozing a nonsense response. It&#039;s about as informative as reading a book in a different language. All it does is explain the history behind URF, which isn&#039;t needed because everyone knows what URF is, even people that hardly play the game. In the end, they make themselves look stupid because they explain it&#039;s an, and I quote, &quot;hugely popular&quot; game mode. Should their concern be on the fact that the game mode is hugely popular and focus on bringing it back in all its glory? The answer you should be receiving is yes, but you&#039;re getting a no.\r\n\r\nSo, URF makes a small percentage of the people that play it stop playing League when it goes away. Yet, nothing was explained why people left. In fact, I know more people that quit League altogether after ARURF because it&#039;s simply not fun. You see, it&#039;s like cigarettes, in some sense. People know it&#039;s bad for you, but they do it anyway because, I guess, it&#039;s good at the time.\r\n\r\nYou need to take into fact that quite a few people have a &#039;grace period&#039;. This is a period where people get used to not being able to throw out a spell every two seconds without a single consequence. What Riot seems to be forgetting is to provide how many players come back to League simply for URF. I can assume it&#039;s far more than those that &#039;leave&#039;.\r\n\r\nSKipping forwards a bit.\r\n\r\n&quot;_probably because you&rsquo;re not seeing the same OP champs every game._&quot;\r\n\r\n&lt;scarra laugh&gt;\r\n\r\nYes, because I&#039;m not seeing a Jax, Nidalee, Fiddlesticks, Maokai, Orianna, or a Kassadin every second game right now. I seemed to have left out Shen and Ezreal, too, who have been in 57% of my games. Seeing as we have, supposedly, a selection of 50 champions for this mode, why am I seeing the same 5 or 6 every few games?\r\n\r\n&quot;_URF causes some people to stop playing League, but a lot of you really love it. So instead of killing URF altogether, we&rsquo;re just gonna keep experimenting to find some healthier version of the mode._&quot;\r\n\r\nI would rather not have it at all than to keep playing this aggravating games of RNG that you keep giving us. We have bans now, ten of them, and you still won&#039;t bring back normal URF? I suppose I should be thankful for getting Ashe four times in a row, right. That&#039;s your amazing random system in place.\r\n\r\n&quot;_we&rsquo;ll listen and apply what we learn to ARURF&rsquo;s next appearance._&quot;\r\n\r\nJust like you listened to all the people that asked for regular URF, right? Don&#039;t make me laugh.\r\n\r\nLink: https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2017/12/ask-riot-urf/","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-27T11:07:09.637+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, i'm pretty sure a lot of the people who have left, were the people who would come back if URF came back in a REAL form, and come play that and only that.\n\nThe drop in players wasn't URF, it was people realizing that, yeah league is kinda shit, and being fed up with it.\n\nHell i think we all know that feeling at this point, and i feel riot don't really understand how to remedy that even in their own area's.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-27T22:48:07.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the problem for Riot is that to remedy the game, they will have to dial it back a few notches, and doing so will be a shock for a lot of people _(imagine if your Q didn't half health people??! Unthinkable! O_o)_. \n\nand they are scared of that change period and the players that might lose interest in a less fast-pased kill-focused game.\nBut tbh, I don't see any option other than a forced dial back, yes you might lose some players, but you're going to lose a lot more if the game continues down its current path, and loyal players too.\n\nI think Riot need to be thinking long-term and get out of this short-term view they have currently. \nIf they fix the game now, they WILL lose players, that is inevitable, but the game will live on and more players will join each year. \nif they don't fix the game, in all sad truthfulness, it may only have several seasons left in it before enough people get fed up and go that even if they do fix the game later down the track, there might not be enough people left to keep it afloat.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-28T03:32:37.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, i hate assassin meta's and haven't even been playing that much (have been playing closers this past week) because i'm sick of it, i play games like League for the competitive aspect, and it doesn't feel competitive to one shot everything, because there is very little skill involved in that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-12-30T02:15:51.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure some people even said they only play League for URF so when they started doing shitty ARURF people stopped playing league for good because of THAT. It really shows how inaccurate their info is when it's obvious the percentage of players who ACTUALLY quit the game for good was so minimal compared to the extremely large portion of players who still play the game who want normal URF back. Most the the players they say \"stopped playing league\" were obviously people taking a long break after playing so many games of URF.","replies":[]}]}
