No time in-game to spell right, you know. Also, anything with a ‘✓’ I consider to be fine and just banter. Anything with an ‘x’ is treading the line for various reasons. I will address each ‘x’ below.\r\n\r\n: FF15  — x\r\n\r\nPretty much negative attitude. Hell, I am a defeatist and give up at first blood. Hardly mute-worthy, though.\r\n\r\n: I stopped trying when it hit 5m — x\r\n\r\nAnother case of giving up, but not mute-worthy.\r\n\r\n: Useless jungler — x\r\n\r\nHardly mute-worthy because the jungler was useless. He even said so himself.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nI am not so much annoyed over the mute that I was chat restricted for 10 games, I am annoyed as this is the second time my honour has been reset at stage 2/3. How can I reform when one game like this resets all progress? Nothing I did was even mute-worthy.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-02-25T11:10:36.731+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":":Lag \n:100% lucker\n:You think you killed me off skill?\n:LOL\n: 12m 0 ganks lmao\n: Grats on rushing Tabis\n: Nice one\n: Trash talking as a Renek\n: Rofl\n Brand missed all skillshots, failed a stun, then watched me die\n: Your point?\n: Honestly, I'd sooner off myself than play Renek in norms than trash talk\n: Silver 2\n: Neg w/l ratio\n: Yikes\n---\nYou've constantly argued and shaming the other person over and over. \n\nYou know how you can reform? \n\n* 1st. Stop pretending this is a career, and those loses will bear consquences toward your livelyhood. \n\n* 2nd. This is a game, at the end of the day, it is ok to play well and lose. Nothing bad will happen to you.\n\n* 3rd. Are you ashamed of losing \"or something deeper\"?. Your conversation is you, trying to convince people that those \"misplays\" that had occurred is not your fault. Read it. YOU'RE desperately trying to save face, by implying \"No, no. This is not what it look like. My team mate is shit. Am not shit. They are making me LOOK BAD\".\n\n\nYou cant see what you've wrote was mute worthy?? Really man? You cant see it because you're the one typing it?
