It is entirely how the industry makes money. Gambling with a semblance of control is that much more enticing, and therefore that much more problematic.

The rarer the skin, the more prestige it give owning one.\n\n> I don't struggle with a gambling addiction but that doesn't mean that people don't.\n\nThis is beyond a normal case now. Now you are referring to troubled individuals with addicted personality. They will face many challenges in life, and spending habit on collectable is just one out of many; An intervention is their only recourse.\n\nIn any sense, a lot of things that are normal to the majority is a struggle for them. Therefor this is a special case with it own rules. \n\n> In my opinion, **a simple paywall is far less predatory** than psychologically tricking people into spending more money they should or sometimes can afford.\n\nYes, that is correct. However, if you take this concept of adult should be held responsible for their own action. Then it is ultimately their choice to make. \n\nIn Australia we have addict's hotline, and free council available. But why does the problem persist? Because unless the person themselves see it as a problem, they will NEVER SEEK HELP. \n\nThat mild form of 'predatory' exist everywhere. When you go to the supermarket to shop for your weekly grocery, but end up  buying products you don't really need in the near future; Since it's on sale, might as well stock up.\n\nSimilar with these pixels that people are buying. It's not an investment, it is merely a desire. They are buying the satisfaction of owning it; And it will tell them the 'logic and sense' they want to hear. \n\n**You shouldn't baby proof the world and treat the predominance group as the few. Just as you don't treat a healthy, and ailing person the same way.**\n\n> As a side note, religion can be predatory, and so can pretty much any form of insurance. To deny that would be frankly naive.

It's a predatory business model, no doubts from me.\n\nSo far as Riot, as a company, is concerned, \"community\" is no longer important, just \"profit by any means necessary\". Riot's business model has been going to shit for years, and really it all started when they introduced the Hextech Crafting system. For something that seemed benign at the time, it's just led the way for Riot to push every player towards lootboxes and the crafting system itself, both of which are pretty much designed to generate profit off addiction (as supported by the [RANZCP referral to the Australian government](https://www.ranzcp.org/files/resources/submissions/ltr-president-to-senate-sc-re-gaming-micro-transac.aspx) regarding \"micro-transactions\").\n\nJust consider how everything about event rewards (and really, most/any \"free\" content) is done through the crafting system now, and how everything in that system (event exclusive or otherwise) uses all the flashy colours and animations, and in a \"drawn out\" way (they tend to take a couple seconds or more), that is so common with gambling devices. Even the levelling system and earning BE, which is a very *fundamental* system in the game (players are exposed to it ***from level 1***), *and* can be reasonably argued as having an indirect impact on the gameplay, are based almost *solely* around lootboxes. Everything \"free\" is geared towards exposing as many players as possible, which in turn means as many \"at risk\" individuals as possible are exposed and, subsequently, more likely to develop the addictive tendencies that Riot's business model is designed to prey upon.\n\nIt would be great if the community managed to \"get woke\" and realise what's going on, but they've all been conditioned to just accept lootboxes and the Hextech Crafting system as the \"norm\", even though they really shouldn't be. Lootboxes should *never* be a fundamental feature in any game, and yet they are in LoL. Of course, people are happy to simply explain that away with \"oh, it's free\" or \"oh, it doesn't affect gameplay\", when realistically that shouldn't even matter if it's all designed to trigger addiction, because that's not going to stop people from getting addicted.\n\nThese event shops are just an extension of that problem, it's why they're designed around using the crafting system, and why it's now impossible to *earn* everything in those shops by just playing, even when you've spent the money to get the pass. Riot just want profit, and they're pushing players into that all the time with these kinds of systems, regardless of the negative effects that might have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ornn","date":"2019-07-19T05:15:54.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bought the ward and the 3 emotes and all the rest have been used on champ shards for BE because BE is to hard to get.
