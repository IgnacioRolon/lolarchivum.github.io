You have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nFiora, Jax, Renekton, Master Yi, Camille, Aatrox, Darius, Garen, Xin Zhao, Olaf, Nocturne, Riven, and pretty much any champion of this type excel with the new Conqueror.\n\nAt the base level, it's a free B.F sword with insane healing at 10 stacks, which is not hard to achieve if your champ has an auto attack reset and/or ranged abilities.\n\nCamille can hit 10 stacks almost instantly, so can Jax. The instant they get any lifesteal item, they can outheal a 1v2 fight with stupid ease.\n\nThe rune gives AD&lt; so it is actually bad on Ryze and Cass versus other options, but the healing in it is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"axeI","date":"2019-12-05T05:26:14.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMFAO, you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nYou do realise that some mages can abuse conqueror better than melee champs right hence why select mages are receiving rounding nerfs in the next patch.\n\nNow I know you're posting on \"Broken Scripts\" to hide the fact that you're low elo on your main and that's okay. You must be so inept in your ability to even fight a melee champ effectively, if you're letting them stack for conqueror passive versing them as a ranged champ.\n\nI assume you only play ranged champs since you complain about conqueror needing a nerf. Stop crying, and be a better player mechanically and perhaps macro aswell.\n\nUnfortunately for the most part, riot balances the game around low elo because they cry so much (like yourself) - so you might actually have your wish granted one day. You account for 90% of the league community from iron to gold. If you think conqueror is an issue, it isn't. It's a sustain rune, if you want to nerf damage - apply your same metric to every other damage rune or eliminate runes altogether.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
