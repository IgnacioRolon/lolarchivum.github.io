All you have to do is buy a level 9 sweepers and go around dragon, baron, enemy jungle. Or if they're bad just go to their lane brushes. There are 5 people on each team, each member gets 2 wards. That's 10 wards every 2 minutes or so, depending on the enemy level. You're probably not looking hard enough because i complete this in one go without even trying every time i got it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-10T01:12:20.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/cc55644c554dc31376c3e487260dfbea.png","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-10T07:01:04.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-02-09T11:37:39.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and any wards you do find, allies either flash to steal or have higher aa speed and just wait for it to get to 1 hp, trust me that happens... a lot...","replies":[]}]}
