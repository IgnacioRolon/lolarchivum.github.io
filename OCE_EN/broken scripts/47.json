I haven't once seen anyone be positive or optimistic on this server. No one is like, \"Hey, guys, let's have a fun game!\" Of course, just because I don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but it's a joke how negative this server is, not to mention stupid.\n\nNo, I am not a part of this... community, if it could be called that. I have separated myself from such dim-witted and vacuous players. If I could, and one day I shall, I will gladly depart from this pathetic, backwards, repugnant country known as Australia.\n\nAlso, my IQ is very high, thank you very much.

OCE challenger is like NA plat. Again, real facts.\n\nYou don't play games with your brain only, at least this game is not within that genre, you also need your fingers and reflexes, which come from first being physically capable to play the game in the first place and the next thing besides a brain is the amount of time needed to do the practicing to form the correct reflex. In other words, a highschool dropout player who'd played full-time since beta on League will almost always do and know better than a PhD who only plays occasionally on weekends. Brain is not the only thing in charge here, it doesn't work like that.\n\nAnd even if it is, so what? \"These people, the pathetic lot they are, do not deserve my kindness\"? What are you on about? Do you go around town berating and kicking down little kids, old people, disabled individuals, mentally handicapped, the lesser cultured/educated, or anyone who's merely perceived by you as being inferior in some manner? Who are you to be this cynical and condescending, and act like the little ego trip is all justified?\n\nNot to mention, \"I could easily be rank one. OCE challenger is like NA plat. Again, real facts.\", except you're so far from it there is no \"easily\" here. Hence even in your own narrative, you by your own definitions, as skewed as they are, are identified as among the bottom of all of us hopeless plebeians who deserve no \"kindness\" or whatever it is you're preaching.\n\nSo.............?\n\nIt's 1 thing to hate champions and certain individuals, I mean sure, but hating everyone and intentionally ruin everyone's day while fondling your own asshole is just plain dumb, really. Hell, if you hate people so much, why play a team game, it's not like there are no singleplayer games out there you know?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-03-12T09:16:49.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why we can't have nice things.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-11T08:41:39.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just do well on a troll pick its literally the funniest thing ever.
