When it comes around, which is usually once per year, most people dive on it with abandon. It is a kick in the face when Riot know almost no one likes ARURF. People play it, yes, but no one enjoys it. Everyone tilts insanely quickly in it. People get sick of it after a few games because it is always the same thing with no way to get rid of it.\n\nIt also hardly helps that it is the same champions in each game. Do you know how unfun it is to be a melee champ that has nothing to actually contribute while you are versing a Lux, Morg, Leona, Amumu, and Ahri?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sick Øwl","date":"2020-01-23T19:07:32.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Arurf has like, 20 champs top and you see nothing else\nIt's not diverse it is BORING it's all on RNG since you can't pick or even ban anything.\n\nWe can't go for the champs we love or our mains if you get a lucky op champ then you are bored just one shotting ppl and if you are unlucky just ff...\nThere is no skill needed, no games are close you don't even team fight it's just laning phase the whole game\nThose who enjoy this mode just joined LoL recently and know nothing of the potential it actually holds, they can't understand how bad this one right there is\n\nARUF should never come back it makes ppl sick of league even more, just bring back the real OG\nUltra Rapid Fire","replies":[]}]}
