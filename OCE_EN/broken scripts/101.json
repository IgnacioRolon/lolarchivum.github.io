If you wanna know more there are plenty of multi-season challenger jungle mains who've been salty at Riot for forcing this upon them all year. (almost as bad as the ADC rework)\nThank fuck the skin wasn't given to Ivern.\n\nAs for being baited, if I was baited I would be believing you that the Shadow Evelynn splash is the victorious skin reveal, which btw you did at the worst possible time since we already got the teaser.\n\n[Oh look, it's Graves!](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3uhYG6DkjiI/WdfcwqJXwRI/AAAAAAAAwxM/yDlsRixcTtAoN9-4evJwY0uHstPgdhFUgCLcBGAs/s1600/22228201_1747512031947993_3642781375677130572_n.jpg)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-10-07T09:40:27.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} graves buffs on the way {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-06T00:56:55.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is this legit?
