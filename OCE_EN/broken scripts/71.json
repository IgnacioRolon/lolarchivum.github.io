Versing someone with flash ignite pretty much gives them an instant advantage in laning, no matter how good they are.\n\nEverything should be available at level one. Better yet, let us buy a boost to level 30.\n\nLeveling with new players is tedious because stomping new players. Is. Not. Fun. I vastly enjoy going 20/2 every game because joyful. I also love being locked to certain roles because SMITE IS LOCKED BEHIND LEVEL PROGRESSION!\n\nLEAGUE OF LEGENDS IS NOT AN MMORPG!
