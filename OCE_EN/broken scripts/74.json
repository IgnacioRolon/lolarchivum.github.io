It's nice if you don't, but i just don't trust you, and at least with zilean, morg, karma, annie, lulu or lux, if you decide to int, it's still possible for me to be useful.\n\nShields/Healers and tanks supports are really nice if your adc is reliable, even better if your adc is obviously better (at least mechanically) than the elo you are playing in, but if they're incompetent and position poorly and keep getting caught by blitzcrank hooks and pulled under tower then there isn't much you can do. \n\nI am sick of having to deal with stupid adcs (it's usually draven players) towerdiving at lvl1, over extending, complaining about getting hooked by a blitzcrank under tower and it being my fault for not standing in front of them. It's even worse when your team is massively incompetent and this is rare but it can happen, at least if you get stuck in one of these games, as an ap support you can just go full damage and possibly manage the 1v5 if you get a good chance to hammer the enemy team in a choke point.\n\nSo in summary, you are the real problem here, and you deserve to be reported.","replies":[{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2017-06-01T00:36:01.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think you get the idea from both sides.
