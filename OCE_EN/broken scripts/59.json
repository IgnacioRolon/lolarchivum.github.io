Half the client just refuses to load and then it stretches to fill it out.

Gee that's real nasty.\n\nBut yeah, the new client is still in beta so I guess bugs are supposed to happen? Still annoying though. But hey, there is the legacy client too, you could try and see if you still get random stuff like this, for me I haven't experienced any bug in the champ select on the old/legacy client but then again, I don't really play Ranked much too.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-26T02:26:15.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not for long they are using oce as guinea pigs next patch and forcing it onto everyone in oce.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-26T12:04:41.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't be the first time I was a guinea pig.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-26T07:48:32.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3z3X3Eyo,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-26T02:26:15.181+0000)\n>\n> not for long they are using oce as guinea pigs next patch and forcing it onto everyone in oce.\n\nOh damn.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-25T17:11:02.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol this new client is a downgrade.... its buggy ashell and missing half the features of the legacy.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-25T18:23:38.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Missing features that no one actually uses to begin with. (yes <5% of the FULL community is no one)\n\nBuggy is typical, the Legacy is riddled with bugs, which is half the reason the new client is being made, because those old bugs can't be fixed at this point, and there's no point it working on them now that there is a new client.\n\nAs for actual performance, it uses less RAM and CPU power, it's faster and the stupid Black Screen for lobbies doesn't occur.\n\n----------------------\n\nAdmittedly I'm not using it myself, I'll use it when it comes out of beta.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-26T07:50:46.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3z3X3Eyo,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-02-25T18:23:38.268+0000)\n>\n> As for actual performance, it uses less RAM and CPU power, it&#x27;s faster and the stupid Black Screen for lobbies doesn&#x27;t occur.\n\nIt may be using less RAM and CPU I won't know, but its current performance really isn't great tbh. I mean, the post-game chat/score thingy took me idk what, 30-40 seconds to come out the last time I tried it (which is today), which really is way too slow.\n\nThat said, it's still in beta I suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-26T10:40:34.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it uses less processing power? problem solved thats why no one can run it unless they set the client's priority to above normal or high.\n\nThen again... I would think no one has actually gone to task manager, right clicked on the new client, selected go to details, right clicked, gone into set priority and modified it. Seriously if any of them had they wouldn't be complaining so much.\n\nAnd holy shit that was so hard to type, my \",\" and \"k\" don't work half the time and everything else is double typing, I need a new keyboard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-25T22:00:13.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Admittedly I'm not using it myself, I'll use it when it comes out of beta.\n\nso you'll be waiting a few years then? http://res.cloudinary.com/urbandictionary/image/upload/a_exif,c_fit,h_200,w_200/v1395991705/gjn81wvxqsq6yzcwubok.png","replies":[]}]}]}]}
