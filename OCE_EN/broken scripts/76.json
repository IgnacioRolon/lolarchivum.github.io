I don't try early dragons. I might be a little cowardly but I think that this is a decent principal to follow when looking to take a dragon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-03T13:30:41.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might need to take your head out of your ass first mate, then try and post something worth discussing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-03T07:15:49.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a troll or legit post?
