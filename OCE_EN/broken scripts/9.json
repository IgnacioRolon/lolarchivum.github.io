I can tell from the fact that it says \"185 CS\" at \"5 CS per minute\" that it was a ~37 minute game, which definitely fits a typical bronze/silver CS score.\n\nYou go look at a match that a master or challenger player plays and you'll likely see an average of ~10+ CS per minute (double the shown score), averaging with 100 CS for every 10 minutes of game time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-11-26T06:45:46.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ubAyzoi9,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-26T05:03:15.667+0000)\n>\n> 5 CS per minute isn&#x27;t a challenger sort of score, that is legitmately some Silver/Bronze CSing.\n> \n> Whatever App you are using is shit.\n\nExcuse me, this app was recommended by QTPIE.
