I promise that this is not a troll thread.\n\nI&rsquo;ll start with a little background information on myself.\n\nI&rsquo;m twenty-three and I suffer from severe social anxiety, I&rsquo;m manic depressive with suicidal tendencies, untreated sociopathic issues that are not an issue because of anxiety, suspected autism which was not treated because I grew up unwanted, abused, and neglected the very basics of human care from the ages of three to thirteen.\n\nNone of this is irrelevant as you&rsquo;re thinking nor is it some pathetic attempt at sympathy because I don&rsquo;t want or need it.\n\nI grew up with one friend from the age of nine. He had a loving family and a house, a bedroom, and got three meals a day. I was told to shut my mouth, make myself useful, or told to beg the neighbours for things. I was starved and my clothes were never washed. You may think this is disgusting, and trust me it was, but I never knew better. I never knew people had bedrooms. I used to sleep on the floor because, and I quote, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I belonged.&rdquo;\n\nBack to the issues of friends. I never had any. I never what to say and what to not say, so I quit speaking. I spoke my very first sentence at the age of twelve, and that was to my Nan, who asked me if I was being treated correctly.\n\nNever mind, I&rsquo;m done with a sap story.\n\nRiot does not grant the in-depth response that is required for dealing with abusive people. There&rsquo;s a reason why people can be abusive or toxic, as it&rsquo;s called, and some don&rsquo;t even mean to be. For some, it&rsquo;s a complete accident and they have no idea how to speak to people.\n\nPeople accepted my trolling behaviour and it clung because it was the first time I had really been accepted. No one ever pulled me aside and was like, &ldquo;Hey, man, your behaviour isn&rsquo;t acceptable. I suggest you quit it.&rdquo; I was never told what I was doing wrong. Each ban came and nothing was ever explained.\n\nI am a man with the mental state of a child. I never grew. I am stuck mentally. I cannot comprehend things that people do because I do not understand. I do what I do because people enjoyed it earlier on when I played and it&rsquo;s now stuck in my mind.\n\nSo, why is Riot to blame?\n\nRiot&rsquo;s to blame because they do not seek to help people reform. Warning, 10 game chat restriction, 25 game chat restriction, 14-day ban, manual permanent ban. In any of these, do Riot pinpoint exactly what you said or did to be banned? No. They give you logs of the game, but not the thing that&rsquo;s considered to be abusive. I have asked countless times what I&rsquo;ve been banned for and I have never once been told exactly what got me banned. They just proceed to tell me that I won&rsquo;t be unbanned.\n\nAll permanent bans are claimed to be manual and evaluated, why does Riot not make a message for people to contact support and talk through it before they judge? It would take a few minutes extra work, but it would improve behaviour by a large amount.\n\nHowever, not all the blame can be on Riot. The game is innately competitive and it&rsquo;s human nature to want to win. We thrive on victory. Having someone take that from you can turn a pope into an abusive person. It also hardly helps that most players are teenagers and going through puberty and are in some kind of &lsquo;phase&rsquo;.\n\nStill, despite everything else, the most toxic behaviour could be handled by Riot if they took the time to deal with their players.\n\nThe current system of four warnings then a permanent ban is flawed. This is another issue. This is a game where communication wins games. Why gimp someone&rsquo;s communication to their team? Just remove /all from them and see if they improve.\n\nWhy are permanent bans even a thing? It makes very little sense to why someone could be permanently banned for talking when there are other methods that can be used. I support permanent bans for cheaters, inters, and people that actually ruin games, but with chat related offences, you could just permanently remove their /all chat. I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting at 84 permanently banned accounts if you used this system. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be as bad as I am right now if that happened.\n\nI don&rsquo;t have much else to say, honestly. This is nearing 800 words and I doubt most will even read it once they see my name and the title.","replies":[{"poster":"HashTagNoodles","date":"2017-06-21T10:41:31.354+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you need to word your title better. Riot does not promote toxic behaviour it is the person who pulls the string, YOU. The only person who can change shiz is YOU not some company or other people. Yes people can affect,manipulate and shape you but YOU'RE the one whose continuing these acitons.  Surely yes they can achieve and reduce the amount of toxicity lingering around in the community and game but surely you would understand by now that not everything is picture perfect. There will always be toxic people whether you like it or not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LaMaLiCkR","date":"2017-06-24T04:28:02.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and anti socialism, almost every game i play i have to mute my entire team... and if i talk negative or at all. i get reported....\n\nthey want you to mute everyone and dont talk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-06-21T10:40:26.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually quite an insightful reading, I have never been banned although i never mute chat but i report every inappropriate words that come up on chat.

But I do agree it's pretty funny when Riot stated that the chat itself is not needed for communication (such happens when you get chat restricted) but they simply won't remove the chat itself, instead they just perma-ban the account and the player is even more tilted and pissed off so they go and create another account then BOOM another toxic account is born.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-06-21T06:46:34.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive asked  them to remove the caht for i would rather not have it, they insisted the chat will stay for me to show improvement in my behavior, how about you remove the actual chat that is causing the player base distress. if they want the chat there, help me get better instead of punishing me for using the chat in an annoying way, what i type in game is no where the abuse i see take place. \n\nits like they wont remove the chat for me to show improvement in my behavior but then don't offer any help or encouragement but to punish me if i don't improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-21T09:53:30.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I realise this isn't the best solution, but you can move the chat off-screen.

It's sickening seeing abusive friends acting like they have flowers growing out their arse. Sure, you can attempt to reform, but you're not. Not really. You still have the same attitude, you just mask it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-06-21T06:08:41.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow bro 84 perma banned accounts is a bit much, ive been twice 2 week banned and constant chat restrictions one after another, i say im the rare case where what im saying can be seen as toxic, or it cant, i do admit im annoying but dont abuse, threaten or anything in that nature. however i do get reported for my annoyance and riot acts on it, im not toxic so the wont perma ban me, but i get reported so the system punishes me. \nive seen games where i ask why players dont use certain summoners like heal  and get a response of stfu, kys, retard, constantly it happens more often then not. i ask them to stop abusing me and ask again why they didnt do a certain action. i keep asking till they answer by the end my team is annoyed with me i get reported by everyone and the summoners who told me to kys and wont use heal on a retard like you or i wanted you to die, gets no punishment because they do not annoy other players. its a pact mentality especially in game. \n\nive constantly ask riot in support tickets why not help me get better, instead of punishing me non stop lets focus on improving communication overall in league something i could benefit from instead of keep banning me. ive even ask to remove the chat function for i would rather not have it. if riot wants to punish me and not the players who abuse me i would rather not have the function.\n\noverall ive been \n3 or 4 x 10 game chat restriction\n2 x
