{"poster":"ThunderWielder","date":"2017-03-15T11:54:39.518+0000","title":"Metal Or Death","subforum":"Fanfic Workshop","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey everyone its /u/ThunderWielder here and I love designing concepts and writing lore for league. This is my first lore for a contest and it is about the Full Metal, Project and Mecha skins. I used Creator Viktor instead of Full Machine Viktor.  Its 600 words or so and I&#039;m thinking of adding one or two more characters before I&#039;m done. Just let me know which ones you want to see below.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nA lone statue lay amidst the rumble of the once great Ionian city. The towering stone structure depicted an imposing swordsman with an even more imposing sword. The man looked ancient but deadly; his eyes were frightening even if they were hidden behind a mountain of goggles. The Wuju Swordsman was truly the guardian of this city, was. Now {{champion:11}} Yi sat at the base of the structure, sword in hand, watching over the remains of the guardian&rsquo;s homeland. How cruel it must be to see you hometown destroyed but be unable to do anything about it.\r\n\r\nA wave of memories flooded Yi&rsquo;s mind as he stood up; he recalled the scent of the grass, the smiles of those around him but not their faces, never their faces. Yi swung his sword at the foot of the statue, the glowing yellow weapon cut through the stone. It felt heavier than usual, Yi would have to ask {{champion:245}} Ekko to look at it later but he had to make his way to Piltover first and join up with Lucian and the rest. Zed had probably already met with Viktor and the PROJECTs didn&rsquo;t have much time to waste. As the sun set Yi left the statue and the little inscription he had made:\r\n\r\n&gt;Here lies The LAST Wuju Swordsman.\r\n\r\n***\r\n{{champion:238}} Zed sighed as he left the forest, or what remained of it anyways. The smell of gunpowder and hextricity lingered in the air. Zed had diverted to the dojo to bid his farewells and bury his worries but his load became heavier than before. The PROJECT had wiped away most of his memories but he would always remember the face his master made as the final shuriken ripped through his flesh. That fool! If only he had accepted the new ways. Now his idiot brother {{champion:98}} Shen had also fallen, he too consumed with tradition. Zed winced as his metal footsteps clanged against the stone; his augmented body would take some getting used to but Zed could already feel its power and it wouldn&rsquo;t be long till he mastered it. Zed stepped out of the forest and into the dark streets of Piltover; the only path left was forwards.\r\n\r\n***\r\n{{champion:112}} Viktor&rsquo;s steps rang through the dark halls of his laboratory; he would have loved more light but it wouldn&rsquo;t be pleasant if his creations rusted, he was in the middle of a war afterall. All the more reason not to be experiencing what he was going through right now. Viktor was worried; an emotion he should no longer have. The metal scientist remembered a much simpler time when he was naught but a budding inventor. If only his naive self knew then that the fools would never accept his genius. It took him a while before he first reinvented {{champion:126}} Jayce, the man who despised him; the man who was once his friend. But Jayce had escaped and joined the PROJECTs, nevertheless that didn&rsquo;t stop him. Afterall he was the creator and metal was perfection. Metal was evolution. Viktor had promised a full metal future, and as he brought life to his new creation, he was certain that he would keep his promise.\r\n\r\n***\r\n{{champion:14}} Sion woke up from his slumber; dazed as always. He had been dead on multiple occasions, each time shorter than the last. Sion flexed his arms as he always did; they felt empty. He knew they were his arms but they were distant. He could feel no pain, no joy, just hunger; hunger for the battle ahead. Sion&rsquo;s gaze shifted from his hands to the man in front of him. He held what resembled Sion&rsquo;s axe in his puny hands. The man spoke words but Sion paid him no heed; all he needed was the fight. He didn&rsquo;t care about the lack of feeling in his body nor who he was fighting for; any love for Noxus had faded away with his countless rebirths. All Sion wanted was war and he hoped that he would enjoy it a little longer this time.\r\n\r\n***","replies":[{"poster":"Saben","date":"2017-03-16T08:16:36.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things\n1. I get that this is a world full of metal and machines, but your writing doesn't really convey a story. It might be better if you intertwined each characters part to construct the narrative from multiple points of view.\n2. Kinda relates back to the first part, but I don't really think Sion fits into this world in the state you presented him. Im guessing he's supposed to be Mecha Zero Sion, but there is no mention of any transformations or augments that suggest he is.\n\nPretty good writing, just try to polish up on your punctuation and spelling and you have a well written story.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Ravenhawke","date":"2017-03-16T08:01:18.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good story, decent execution. I could visualise what was occurring within each scene fairly well, and I could grasp the feeling of the PROJECTS here that you were trying to achieve. Master Yi's paragraph was quite detailed and really relates back to Yi's own views towards becoming a PROJECT experiment.\n\nThere are faults, however, as the other readers have commented about, so I won't go to into detail of that portion. There were grammatical errors, and spelling mistakes, but they are few enough that they don't really take away from the story too much. You can't always avoid them, they happen to everyone. As far as I know, I had grammar, punctuation and spelling mistakes myself in my story. Sometimes they slip by you, and that is perfectly fine.\n\nAlso, I felt like after Yi's introduction segment, everyone else's own segments were a bit too fast-paced and didn't really capture the environment as well. I feel like these could have been a bit lengthier and put into a bit more detail. I think that would improve the overall atmosphere and pace of the piece, and make it seem a bit more fleshed out and balanced. I personally wouldn't recommend adding in more characters, as they would just overflow the story and take in too many different perspectives to really focus enough unique detail into the already existing characters. Perspective is a powerful thing in writing, but not if it is too much that it takes away from the experience and thrill of the story.\n\nAlthough it does have its faults, the story itself is not a bad piece. I quite like it, I think you've got a solid idea here, but the execution could be improved. With good execution to go with it, I feel like this piece will progress significantly, possibly making it one of the better stories out there.\n\nTake into consideration what we as commenters have said. It may seem like a harsh judgement, but in the end, we are all trying to help this piece improve from being good, to being great. I really look forward to seeing what you have planned for this story in future, I feel like you're going to do great with this piece. I wish you the best of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zookie","date":"2017-03-15T22:45:24.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The Wuju Swordsman was truly the guardian of this city, was.\n\n\nI know this was already brought up, but the repetition of 'was' at the end doesn't quite work here. I get what you are going for, in emphasising it though. Maybe try something like 'The Wuju Swordsman had once truly been the guardian of this city. But those days were long gone' - along those lines\n\n\n> Zed sighed as he left the forest, or what remained of it anyways. The smell of gunpowder and hextricity lingered in the air. **Zed **had diverted to the dojo to bid his farewells and bury his worries but his load became heavier than before.\n\nThis is just my preference but I don't like starting two sentences that are close together with the same word. I think starting with just 'He' in that third sentence would be better. But as I said, that's my preference in how I write and with the sentence in between it actually is okay. \n\n\n> Sion **woke up from his slumber;** dazed as always. He had been dead on multiple occasions, each time shorter than the last\n\n\nI get what you are going for here but I think that clarifying the fact that he been dead might clear this up a little. By saying he 'woke from his slumber' it sounds like he was just sleeping. Then in the second sentence, you reference that he has been dead before. It might be better to start the paragraph off with something more similar to 'Sion woke, a roar filling his chest' - so that you are focusing on the fact that he is waking but not mentioning slumber. \n\n>  He held what resembled Sionâ€™s axe in his puny hands.\n\nSince you mention later in the paragraph that all he wants is to fight, it might be an idea to write a sentence or two detailing how although he felt his arms are puny, weak, distant etc. they are still good enough to fight since that is what he wants to do. \n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the look into the different characters. I do agree that adding more in might be too much but it's hard to know. Perhaps instead of focusing on another character (if that feels too much), you could finish off the story with a paragraph that describes someone being created - a project skin or something along those lines to tie it all together. But, as the writer, do what you feel is best for the story!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-15T21:58:55.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">A lone statue lay amidst the **rumble** of the once great Ionian city. \n\nRubble, not rumble.\n\n>The Wuju Swordsman was truly the guardian of this city, **was**.\n\nMakes no sense. Why is there a random 'was' at the end? You already said that before.\n\n>How cruel it must be to see **you** hometown destroyed but be unable to do anything about it.\n\nYour\n\n>The man looked ancient **but** deadly; his eyes were **frightening even** if they were hidden behind a mountain of goggles. \n\nI would propose going ancient and deadly. How you've written it comes off stilted. You also forgot a comma after frightening.\n\n--\n\nThe Zed paragraph came off as slanted and out of place. You should never use the term 'anyways' that isn't in dialogue and in a casual setting.\n\n>Zed had **diverted** to the dojo to bid his farewells and **bury his worries but** his **load became heavier than before**\n\nDoes not make sense. A better word would be traversed. And to bury his worries. That's a lead-in sentence. Also, comma after 'worries'. His load had become heavier than before.\n\n>The PROJECT had wiped away most of his **memories but** he would _always_ remember the face **his master made as the final shuriken ripped through his flesh.**\n\nComma. Putting extra emphasis (italics) on that word would be wise. His former master had made as his last shuriken tore through his skin and bones. The cries and screams of anguish would forever be imprinted in his mind. Don't be afraid of prose.\n\n>**Now his** idiot **brother Shen had** also fallen, he **too consumed** with tradition. \n\nComma after 'now'. (this one is debatable as some don't believe that you should. In the end, it's up to you)! Comma after 'brother' and 'Shen' (now, his idiot brother, Shen, had also fallen. You're missing a 'was' after 'too'.\n\n>Zed winced as his metal footsteps clanged against the stone; his augmented body would take some getting used** to but** Zed could already feel its power and it wouldnâ€™t be long till he mastered it. \n\nThis should be a new paragraph. I forgot to correct them. Oops. Comma. Actually, just rewrite this entire sentence. One, you don't need to repeat his name. I rewrote it for you. 'Zed winced, the expression of pain masked perfectly, as he had been taught, as each foot connected with the steel ground. His newly acquired augmented body would take some getting sued to, but he was certain he had made the right choice. The power that thrummed through his very veins was a sure sign that he was correct.'\n\n>**Zed** stepped out of the forest and into the dark streets of Piltover; the only path left was forwards.\n\nSTOOOOOP! We know who's speaking or thinking. Only use his name once per paragraph.\n\n--\n\n>**he would have loved more light** but it wouldnâ€™t be pleasant if his **creations rusted**\n\nHe would have preferred it to be lighter. Sunlight doesn't rust metal.\n\n>he was in the middle of a war **afterall**\n\nAfter all.\n\n>**Viktor** was **worried; an emotion he should no longer have.**\n\nThat is going to drive me crazy. one, why use a semicolon? You use them frequently and almost all of them are wrong. Also, if he shouldn't have the emotion, he wouldn't feel it. Unnecessary line.\n\n>**The metal scientist** remembered a much simpler time when he was **naught** \n\nThat's a title, it should be capitalised. Naught is American English. Use Nought instead.\n\n>**If only his naive self knew then that the fools would never accept his genius.**\n\nYou're switching between past and present tense. It's jarring. 'If only his old naive self had known that the fools would never grow to accept his genius.'\n\n>**It took him a while** before he first reinvented Jayce, **the** man who despised him; **the** man who was once his friend.\n\nIt had taken him a while. Jayce isn't an object, use 'a' instead of 'the'.\n\n>But Jayce had escaped and joined the PROJECTs,** nevertheless that** didnâ€™t stop him\n\nComma after 'nevertheless'.\n\n>**Afterall** he was **the creator** and metal was perfection.\n\nAfter all. The Creator. It's a title.\n\n--\n\nSion's entire paragraph needs to be redone. It's clunky and seems so out of place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-15T12:29:46.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi great piece\n>his eyes were frightening even if they were hidden behind a mountain of goggles.\n\nThere should probs be a comma after \"frightening\" and It might jsut be me, but after talking about how the thing is imposing, the term \"mountain of goggles\", kind of destroys that.
