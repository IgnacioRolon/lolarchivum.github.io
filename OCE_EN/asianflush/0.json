This meant that I couldn&#039;t ping, add points to my abilities, open settings etc etc. I was also unable to purchase from the shop.\r\n- Once a unit was targeted, I was unable to move my character until another nearby unit had been targeted, meaning that if I was under a turret and no enemy units were nearby, I couldn&#039;t move from under the turret.\r\n\r\nAnyone else had this issue too?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T08:56:51.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like you have the Shift key held down.
