My suggestion it to put it as a stat onto tiamat, tiamat has 20 ad make half of it base ad, tiamat is an item people buying Triforce would want to buy, it&#039;d be cool if ravenous had say 20 base AD and titanic had 30 based ad and tiamat had 10, allowing people to say buy tiamat &gt; sheen &gt; IBG or tri, it&#039;d be a really nice build path for most of the top lane bruisers who buy triforce. I don&#039;t think Base ad was that insane a stat it just was the case that you got too much of it, and it&#039;d be interesting to put this as a mixed AD BAD stat on ravenous and more of it on titanic. Maybe even translate some hp into base ad onto titanic so it's a decent item to sit on for tiamat for laning, later in the game it helps bruisers to scale with all the hp stats they buy.","replies":[{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-26T12:12:02.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there's a lot of champions who benefit more from bonus ad than base ad. that number of champions also HEAVILY outweighs the number of champion that would benefit more from being able to by base ad to boost triforce. being able to buy base ad also makes trinity force scale a LOT harder than it should cause it's basically doubling your next auto after an ability. base ad is for early game balance, scalings are for late game balance, and messing with a stat that mucks up this balance makes balancing individual champions really hard","replies":[]}]}
