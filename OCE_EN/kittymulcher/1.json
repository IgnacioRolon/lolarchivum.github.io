Mana items give half the mana to one side and half the blood pool to the other, champ is meant to be the embodiment of adrenaline and fight or fight response in combat. Low disengage lots of engage, meant to enable fighters in bot lane like darius irelia.\r\n\r\nQ a shorter ranged hook (400 units) that pulls a an allied or enemy champ to Garunta if the adrenaline bar was used to pull an ally gives the ally the ability to be thrown by garunta controlled by the ally towards an enemy in a cone, ranged champs instead have an effect where they stop short of their max range. Clicking outside the cone starts a movement command towards where they clicked as normal. If the champ hit is an enemy and adrenaline was used to cast hook you instead deal extra damage and apply a 20% slow for 1 second.\r\n\r\nW auto reset Garunta whips an ally (dealing 5% current hp damage) or an enemy providing a slow or a speed boost, if adrenaline was used roots enemy for 1 second or provides ally with attack speed and a boost to life regen of 10% of missing health over 5 seconds.\r\n\r\nE magic siphoning whiplash Garunta hits enemies with a skill shot and any enemies hit have their next heal be affected by grievous wounds in 5 seconds or the shield on them is forced to start decaying rapidly. Adrenaline used makes the ability get reduced cooldown.\r\n\r\nR Garunta expends all adrenaline increases his movement speed and attack speed and his first auto stuns for 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nIdeally Garunta in the early game is good at all enabling his melee allies to get an all in from level 1 by starting the fight himself then throwing his ally in. Later on in the game he teams up with other fighters to help their engages, throwing in sejuani or Jarvan can be a powerful tool.","replies":[]}
