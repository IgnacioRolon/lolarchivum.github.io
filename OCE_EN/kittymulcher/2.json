Splitpushing is something that people should get access too and out maneuvering/forcing people to stay in lane with a splitter should be a part of the game, and also if a splitter forces a back they shouldn&#039;t get to run back at mach 7 to the inhibitor turret. Assassins like zed and talon, splitters like trynd and nasus should be rewarded for applying pressure and should get meaningful rewards for splitting properly, get objectives instead of the objective of getting to lane against some guy and a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-09T12:44:52.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly wish they'd just bring back t3 boots","replies":[]}]}
