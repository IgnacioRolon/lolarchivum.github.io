My ping stays at 35 the whole time while it&#039;s attempting to reconnect. I&#039;m using a MacBook Air, and my ISP is iiNet. I&#039;ve been playing for the last year without a problem. Has anyone else come across this/Know how to fix it? I really want to play URF.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-04T08:03:28.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried [changing your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5), or maybe just [flushing your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq10) by itself?","replies":[{"poster":"JDxD","date":"2015-04-05T05:28:04.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did.
