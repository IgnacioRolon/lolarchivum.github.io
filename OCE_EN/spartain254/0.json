It's about not having enough people for other queues to be healthy while it is up.  Currently it's only available when the peak amount of players are on so other queue times are not affected.\n\nIt's full time availability is for Riot to look at the numbers and decide what constitutes a healthy queue time.","replies":[]}]}
