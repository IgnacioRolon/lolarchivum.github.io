Riot Tickets About Suspension","url":"https://imgur.com/a/SJ6dNxk","image":"https://i.imgur.com/FnTCR17.jpg?fb"},"up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would’ve thought my situation would’ve been resolved simply and easily by now, but it’s at a point where I must make a boards post to get anywhere as support refuses to help me.\n\nI sent an additional response to Riot with evidence but it has not yet been responded to please read this if you want all the details and my evidence on the situation.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1FoADeGzXlC0VxxOeEce9fjwqlkIIbiJA0OBMlpj9RcA/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis occurred on the 30th of November at around 7-9pm at night, I was notified of a permaban on my account at around 9:42pm stating that I had been using third-party software, knowing that I had never used any third-party software I quickly sent a ticket to Riot discussing that it was completely wrong and for them to double check. Shortly after I checked my accounts op.gg and realised that someone had compromised my account and was still in game duoing with someone named AKA Phil. During their game, I instantly updated my ticket stating that this person using my account was not me at all and I am the true owner of the account and have evidence to prove it (view the doc for the evidence I compiled). I would think that Riot would be understanding of me as I since creating the account has never been banned or done any actions that have warranted one and have been playing the game for almost 7 years since early 2013 and seeing boards post like this which had a very similar situation as I do\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/ZkXuZnN2-my-account-was-hacked-into-and-i-was-permabanned-for-it\n\nput my mind at ease as many people have experienced this type of situation before and were resolved after some discussion and evidence. Unfortunately, this was not the case, I sent a ticket Saturday night and only got a response Tuesday night and I was beyond disappointed with the response I received. As shown in the album, it is my communications with Riot support, but the response is extremely disappointing. \n\nI am fully aware that I am responsible for my account’s credentials and privacy however the response I received basically states it's my own fault for getting hacked. This is an extremely unfair perspective, as hacking has an extremely large presence in the world today it can literally happen to anyone at any moment since League does not have a notification system to show that my account is being used unauthorised or a proper 2-factor authentication system like Blizzards on Steams. How am I the victim, supposed to know the exact moment my account has been hacked, do I need to be on League 24/7?? This all happened in the span of 3 hours and you expect me to react instantly? I was only notified when I got BANNED by then it was already too late and there was nothing I could do. All someone needs are the username and password and they gain full access to the account without notifying the owner. The response I was given was not professional at all and definitely not sympathetic and fails to look at the consumers' point of view, you cannot expect people to not get hacked and if they get permabanned like me than bad luck, unlucky I guess? Thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars in the game wasted because my account was compromised ONCE. They state that “the suspension has been correctly applied” but in what context? That my account was caught using third-party software used by the hacker to gain an advantage then yes obviously the suspension was correctly applied, however in the context of my account being compromised, abused for boosting and wrongfully permabanned, then NO it was not correctly applied.\n\nFinally, I have been supporting this game for 7 years, put time into, spent money on it and have had zero offenses regarding bans or even chat restrictions.\nWhy would I want to throw all that time and effort away for some cheap wins in PRESEASON? I am deeply saddened for the lack of respect for my loyalty to the game or time my case has had and the response I received.\n\nThis is not to attack the individual's support team at all and I’m sure they are following protocol. This is purely from my perspective as a consumer and someone who loves this game, I have presented evidence to highlight my own support for the game with dedication and perseverance, and I will not stop until this account is returned to me as it is my main and only account I have put time into.\n\nApologies for the length of the post but I need proper attention to this as its extremely unfair to have all my time, effort and money go down to drain to some people who decide to abuse accounts for boosting. If I could get some help and someone to understand my perspective that would be much appreciated\n\nEDIT: Update, after all this evidence all these points they are still not even giving me A CHANCE to get my account back.  I'm sorry but this response is not satisfying AT ALL, you are basically blaming your CUSTOMER for getting hacked.\nResponse from the same rioter\n\n\"Hello there,\n\nI can understand that losing your account can be painful.\n\nAt the same time please know this is not a personal decision and sadly I cannot give out any specific details about how we run our investigations. What I can tell you is that you are ultimately responsible for any actions that go on your account, regardless if it may have been you or someone else using it.\n\nI get this may seem unfair to you, but the decision is final.\"\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-05T10:23:50.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**tl;dr - Submit an *Account Recovery* ticket specifically. You'll have to be logged out of support to do this.**\n\nCases like yours can be a bit tricky. Us as boards-goers can really only give you 'general rule' type information, not what applies specifically to your circumstances.\n\nAccounts being banned in this manner after a compromise is fairly common. Generally, the process for the original owners of those accounts is fairly simple:\n\n1. Change the password of the account (if still possible), attached email address, and any accounts that share those same passwords\n2. Run a virus scan and otherwise determine how the compromise occurred (if possible) so it can be prevented in future\n3. Submit an account recovery (AR) ticket through player support to go through the verification process\n\nIt sounds like you just submitted a regular ticket. Unless there's something more going on behind the scenes (I'll get to that in a sec) generally they would direct you to submit an AR ticket specifically since anyone with access to the account can submit and access a regular ticket.\n\nThere are a few things that could be going on here.\n\n1. The signs of compromise were deeper/subtler and were missed, and support believed it to be a cut and dry case of \"I didn't *know* they were bad/I'm trying to cover my butt\" in which case submitting an AR ticket should take you through the more in-depth investigation.\n.\n2. Support has reason to believe you aren't the original owner of the account, in which case an AR ticket is still the way to go since it is essentially the process to prove ownership. Do note that if you *aren't* the original owner (even if you were gifted the account or some other non-malicious transferral occurred) you likely won't be able to recover the account.\n.\n3. The compromise was 'close to home' and therefore can't be proven. For example, initiated by a sibling or roommate with access to the physical location you normally play at. There is no way to prove that such actions were taken by someone else and not simply you trying to disguise the behaviour. The *physical* security of your account is entirely in your hands, Riot can only protect you in the digital space.\n\nThere are also a few things that can make recovering the account essentially impossible. Most notably that would be things like currently or having previously shared the account, or having been compromised repeatedly in the past.","replies":[{"poster":"Meguméme","date":"2019-12-05T11:17:03.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Seras Dragon,\n\nYeah, I realized my mistake and I sent in an account recovery ticket this time. I submitted a regular ticket originally as I did not know that my account was compromised yet and thought it was a mistake. I do believe I have sufficient evidence that the individual isn't me and I answered very intricate details about the account such as what I have been gifted and what I have gifted, my first 6300BE/IP champion, my first RP purchase and around when the account was made. I instantly changed the password the minute I found out I was banned, but the person could not get into my email as my password for league and the email differ and I was able to hold on to it. I appreciate your in-depth response and hope all goes well.\n","replies":[]}]}]}
