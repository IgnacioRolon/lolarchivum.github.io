(Preferably mid,top or support.)\r\nLeave a comment with your opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-26T11:22:27.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:25}} Morgana is a similar support style to Lux. Their Q-W-E of the kits are effectively pretty similar. Her Ultimate offers both great initiation and peel and she is a good mid and support. I'd recommend giving her a go!\n\n{{champion:161}} is a really fun champ to learn as well. (Especially if you like Lasers)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-26T12:36:18.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooo I do love me some lazerz.\n\nBut defs as a support main myself, Morgana supp has a very similar playstyle to Lux. I'd also recommend Zyra in that sort of category of supports. (and they all have the flexibility into mid). \n\nI would be aware however that both Zyra and Vel'Koz are going to be seeing some changes in the mid year Mage Update. Not huge ones for Vel mind you, mostly his W. Zyra will be seeing some bigger changes focused around her Pass, Q and functionality/reliability of her plants.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-03-25T11:09:41.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For mid, Cho Gath, Annie, Kayle, lulu.\nFor top, Malphite, pantheon, sion, nautilus.\nFor support,  blitz, Janna,  nautilus and soraka.\nThese champs are all very strong and relatively easy to play. They have decent utility and more than adequate damage/tankiness for fights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-25T09:07:54.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, support Lux has been buffed in 6.6. The shield now reapplies which means it's better for your teammates but the increased travel time makes it worse for yourself.

Lux is still a viable support if you still enjoy playing her. However some top tier Champs are:\nTop lane: Nautilus and Quinn\nMid lane: Ahri and Zed\nSupport:  Janna and Blitzcrank \nThese are kind of just personal preferance  and I highly suggest picking champions you are good at. For example, I am having big success on Kayle at the moment, even though she doesn't have the highest pick rate. Hope this helps you out though, and good luck in your ranked voyages!\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]}]}
