Navigate to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\" and find the latest version folder (either sort by date modified or just select the biggest number).\n2. Create a new, blank file and name it \"S_OK\" with no extension. This can be done by creating a Text Document from the context menu and removing the \".txt\" at the end of it.\n3. Start the patcher with administrator privileges.\n\nIt will scan for a while, and then continue downloading. If that doesn't work, reply to this message.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
