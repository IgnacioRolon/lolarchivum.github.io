I was playing Talon, got baron buff and was about to end the game. However, the game started saying Attempting to reconnect. I ALT+Tab and the client was not saying game in progress, or reconnect. The game was like it never existed... I received no LP nor did the Ezreal I was duoing with. The game was supposed to be on top of the Taric 2/5/15 one.\r\n\r\n(http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=EzSmurf)\r\n\r\nPlease fix the Riot, I want my LP :(. I can confirm that that game was a sure win as there were 3 left on the enemy team against all us 5 with baron buff and two inhibitors were taken...\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nEzsmurf","replies":[{"poster":"Hide on Skaarl","date":"2018-06-16T05:01:57.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just experienced it in 3 games in a row, one game didnt exist when we were losing, the other happened in game and i kept dcing with 21 ping and the third i dced in champ select and could ban because i couldnt reconnect even though im not lagging as im the only one in my household using my internet\nSomething is up with the serveres. jesus christ riot","replies":[]}]}
