But I was thinking, what if it was like the ranked solo/duo and flex queues? I obviously don&#039;t have Riot&#039;s data and I&#039;m not sure if this is feasible, but I think it would be good if normal draft could rotate with normal blind pick. That way we&#039;d have the best of both worlds without splitting the queue.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-16T11:19:09.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.riftherald.com/lol-patch-notes/2016/11/9/13574822/lol-normal-draft-queue-removed-why","replies":[]}]}
