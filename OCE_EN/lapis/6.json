They can and will ban you if you give a real reason eg cheating.\n\nand for proof of this just look at all the people complaining about being banned on the forums everday, despite having spent money on the game ( In one case I think I saw someone say they spent $550 nz on the game)\n\n\n\ncontinuing on the original post, I report at least 5 people a day( if I play for about 6 hours on that day)  and i've never seen a single popup saying that the player has been punished, it would be nice that not just the last person to report heard that the person was punished for their behavior","replies":[{"poster":"TankerInc","date":"2016-03-16T06:01:50.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Narwhal,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dcWlims8,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-03-16T05:50:32.448+0000)\n>\n> This is so incredibly untrue its not funny, you don't own a single thing on the account(including the account), using money to purchase skins is like buying a license to use them, they have the right to ban you for absolutely no reason if they want to(obviously they don't because then nobody would play so they have to have a reason for business reasons obviously) point being the things you were talking about are irrelevant for the above reasons.

NEGOTIATIONS, BINDING ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW_, is about 90% different on both sites. There is really a lot different, but mainly the laws around the ACL from the ACCC DO in fact affect how the T+C's are on the OCE site, why?

What Riot is offering is a SERVICE, not a good to the public, therefore, technically, no one owns the account since no one is paying for it or has paid for it.\n\nThe account is free to make and free to use, making it technically, no ones asset.
