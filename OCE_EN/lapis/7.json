Mordekaiser is already breaking this standard of \"adc\", being a melee magic damage carry. The main reasons a bot lane marksman (or \"ranged adc\") with a support has been the typical set up for years is:\n\n- ranged adc typically need a support to maximize their safety and ability to farm/get kills AND\n- dragon is bottom lane, so having the two champion lane be bottom makes the most sense in order to secure it when possible (hence TP meta OP as it brings even more champions bot lane)\n\nBot lane in this champ select is defined as Bot and Support, made up of typically a carry style champion and a support style champion. The thing is, with the addition of the Rift Herald to rival Dragon in the early game, this duo lane could now go anywhere. Maybe carry + support Mid is the new optimal strategy to secure presence over both Dragon AND Rift Herald!\n\nAlso, Marksmen such as Graves, Kindred, Quinn, Vayne, and perhaps now Caitlyn, have proven their ability to handle solo positions and scale well into mid-game. So perhaps the \"duo lane\" no longer needs to be a marksman with a support, as the marksman takes up a solo position somewhere else on the map!\n\nI see this preseason as a time for us to completely re-write what has become the dominant meta for the last 5 years, and not defining bot position as \"ranged adc\" is a means to shake us out of our now **assumed** \"right way to play\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-15T19:29:33.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was the impression I got with this patch, to really mix things up and diversify. With the masteries especially it's no longer \"this is the most optimal way to play x champ in x position\" but rather we are now free (relatively speaking) to build our items/masteries/runes around OUR playstyle, rather than simply what is the most effective and frankly I'm loving it. It's a lot to get used to, but so was last preseason, and the preseason before that, and after a couple months it was like the changes had always been there.\n\nPersonally now you've mentioned it and I'm thinking about it, I would like to try both swapping ADC with Mid and trying with a support mid lane. Of course I'll need a team of four/five for that but I'm sure I'll find some peeps to play :) \n\nIt just seems to me that like you say, some of the marksmen are more than capable of tackling solo lanes, and from my perspective mid laners lacking mobility like Anivia have just slowly fallen out of play (albeit a while ago) because of the shift in the meta. I would think that putting Anivia in a duo lane with a support would resolve most of the reasons she isn't played, and I love Anivia! and would love to see her coming back :D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-10T22:21:02.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe late in the patch","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-15T23:39:40.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"next patch*","replies":[]}]}]}
