I was supporting an unskilled Jinx, verse an experienced Jinx and Blitz. She kept blaming me for not helping, even as I threw the lantern at her feet. MFW Thresh counters Blitz, but only if my ADC clicks the lantern. XD\n\nMany flames back and forth later, I got banned. Deserved and won't do it again, especially not for any punk ADC, but seriously, Thresh is so widely used not, and Riot has pretty much labelled the lantern with all but glowing red arrows to tell you to click it, that people should know by now what to do. Yet I'm still having to explain it every game I play with him.
