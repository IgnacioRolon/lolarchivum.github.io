Quality memes. \n\nSummoners society - discord is still a bit quiet, although people are almost always up for games. They also have a very large [facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/)page where people often look for pals.\n\nThere a quite a few more, but off the top of my head these are usually the go-to places.
