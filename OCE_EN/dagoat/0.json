I&#039;m left wondering how this is even possible? how can a summoner be healed for more damage than they take? not to mention that 86K of healing seems a bit ridiculous... Surely something is broken or buggy for this to happen.

I don't think \"damage taken\" takes into account his own abilities.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-31T01:56:21.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe it does no. The damage taken is rather 'damage taken from enemies' (I believe it includes things like minion.monster damage but not certain on that one). So for champs like Zac and Mundo something like that would be very possible.","replies":[]}]}]}
