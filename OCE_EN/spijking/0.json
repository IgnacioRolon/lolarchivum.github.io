She swiftly took cover behind a large boulder, trying to make out her would be aggressor; however all she could catch a glimpse of was a black cloak, loose threads hanging off its torn edges. Clearly this foe was somewhat adept at fighting in the dead of night, so finding him would be her biggest task in this fight. Then a thought dawned on her, if she couldn&rsquo;t find his exact location she could just attack everywhere, so with a flick of her wrist she shattered the boulder to pieces, sending shards out in every which-way. Soon jagged stones were jutting out of every surface currently around her and Taliyah looked pretty pleased with herself, until she saw the hooded figure step out from behind one of the fractured oaks. She tried as hard as she could to make out his face to no avail, until she noticed something moving on his arm, what looked like characters from an ancient language, a language that looked familiar to her.\n\nThe two stood there, facing off with neither showing any sign of backing down, until Taliyah finally spoke up &ldquo;What are you doing here, this battle ground is for those of the institute of war and no one else&rdquo; a tinge of nervousness shook through her voice that would go unnoticed by anyone else, but this man seemed to be different, was he even a man? Finally he lifted his cowl to reveal his face, the sight of which took the young stone sorceress aback and that`s when it hit her, the markings that were covering his body were an ancient Shuriman language, a language used back when Azir was still a mortal king. She was so enthralled by what a language so ancient was doing on a man still alive and young that she failed to notice the smug grin on his face &ldquo;tell me stone seamstress, you haven`t fully grasped your powers yet, have you?&rdquo; he taunted, and it seemed his taunt had the intended effect as he tilted his head to avoid the incoming barrage of pebbles.\n\n&ldquo;Look child, I don`t want any quarrel so step aside and let me carry on my business.&rdquo; His voice leaked strength and resolve, making Taliyah heat up even more &ldquo;You trespass on summoner&rsquo;s rift, and then you insult my abilities, you have no business here&rdquo; she loudly proclaimed and recklessly she charged at him and began her assault, flinging stones left and right, ripping and tearing at the ground around her, forcing her adversary to dodge as she delivered blow after furious blow, however all her efforts seemed to be in vain as he effortlessly stepped through the volley of earth. Throughout the fight nothing seemed to be changing, Taliyah would launch her threaded volley but the stranger would simply step to one side to avoid them, until he gestured at the ground under her, a signal which she ignored as she raised a hand to fire off another barrage, but quickly realized something was wrong. She looked down beneath her feet to see that the earth was nearly drained of all stone.\n\nSeizing his chance, he forced his hand onto the young girls throat and pinned her to ground, scattering the dirt as the back of her head smashed the ground. &ldquo;sweet dreams, stoneflower&rdquo; he muttered to her and suddenly the marks from his skin began flowing down his arm towards her as she struggled, and just like that&hellip;everything went black. \n\nTaliyah awoke surrounded by happy villagers in what seemed to be the middle of a small town, hazily rubbing her eyes she tried to remember what she was dreaming about, but if she couldn`t remember it probably wasn&rsquo;t that important. Shakily she got up, feeling a strange sensation on her throat she rubbed it, but nothing was there, &ldquo;must be my imagination playing tricks&rdquo; she guessed as she began walking away. As she was leaving she noticed a young boy walking up to her with a ball, gesturing her to have a turn, a gesture which she happily accepted, however as she began to hold out her hand to take the ball the earth underneath him began to crumble and swallow him whole. Taliyah shrieked in horror and desperately tried to pull him up, but the more she struggled to rescue him, the faster the earth devoured him, eventually engulfing the child completely. The stone mage lay there crying, wishing she could have done something to stop the horror she had just witnessed, however her sorrow was cut short by the sudden screaming of terrified towns folk. Right away Taliyah`s head shot up, and Immediately she wished it hadn&rsquo;t, because her sight was met with her deepest horrors, all around her giant stone monoliths were raising themselves around her and then toppling back down, crushing as many innocent townsfolk as they could.\n&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;NOOOOOOOOOOOOO&rdquo; she screamed as she clutched her ears, trying to drown out the cries of the towns people as they were crushed by her uncontrollable stone pillars, slowly she crept back until something caught her leg. Reluctantly she looked down to find a bloodied girl grabbing at her ankle &ldquo;Why are you doing this, please make it stop&rdquo; the bloodied girl pleaded, which only plunged Taliyah into deeper grief, &ldquo;please&hellip;make it stop&rdquo; Taliyah sobbed.\n\nAs she lied unconscious on the floor, writhing in agony, the looming figure simply stood and watched although the look on his face suggested he would rather not, but before long he couldn&rsquo;t bear watching it any longer and slowly he began walking closer and closer while unsheathing a silver short-sword from his belt to prepare the final blow. Readying the sword above her neck he took a deep breath and wound up his strike, then like a guillotine it came plummeting towards her&hellip;only to be suddenly stopped by the interruption of another blade. The shocking sound of the clashing metals made him jump back, looking up at the interloper, it was a man long steel blade and who radiated resolve. &ldquo;So you must be the one causing so much trouble lately&rdquo; The man said &ldquo;Griffon was it, or was it Grithor?&rdquo; a snarky tone riddled his voice, &ldquo;My name is Griffith, and I`ll assume that you are Yasuo&rdquo; he spat back, not appreciating the jabs at his name.\n\n&ldquo;Whatever your name is does not matter, you must leave this place now, you`ve already done enough damage&rdquo; Yasuo ordered as he picked up Taliyah and fed her some strange herbs, ones that seemed to calm her sleep and fade the marks covering her throat &ldquo;If you refuse I will not hesitate to strike you down&rdquo; he said slowly laying the unconscious girl on a nearby stump. &ldquo;I don`t recall needing your permission&rdquo; Griffith spat back, readying his hand with a glow of dark energy &ldquo;Good, I was hoping you`d choose the fun way&rdquo; Yasuo smirked and began unsheathing his blade. The two men began eyeing each other off as they circled one another &ldquo;I hope you`re ready old man&rdquo; Griffith remarked &ldquo;You better make this fun little boy&rdquo; Yasuo countered and before long, they both charged&hellip;","replies":[]}
