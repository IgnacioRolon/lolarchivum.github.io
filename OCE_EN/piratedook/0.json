Would it really be necessary for Riot to implement player bans when part of your point is that \"players who continually act in a manner that would reasonably result in a ban would inevitably get banned again\"? Personally, I don't see a significant enough distinction there to warrant such a change.\n\nThe fundamental principle of Riot's punishment systems is reform, and simply applying player bans all the time would be counter-intuitive to that (they're only applied in the most extreme of cases), but at the same time failing to apply perma-bans swiftly has historically caused more significant problems long-term. The current punishment tiers are essentially a balance between the two, and personally I think it works well.\n\n> the solution is incredibly simple. you mute them. permanently if that's how far they've gone. really toxic people can't be toxic if they can't chat\n\nSo far as \"permanent chat restrictions\" I believe Riot did try that at one point, however discovered that players would simply find other ways to be toxic (in gameplay rather than chat, for example). A permanent chat restriction doesn't stop a player from being toxic, it just stops them from being toxic in chat. Ultimately, it just means it takes longer, and more resources, to achieve the same outcome, at which point why bother to delay the inevitable?\n\nI'm sure there might be a *few* players who would genuinely benefit from receiving a permanent chat restriction, but that would ultimately be a crutch anyway. The important thing about all of this behaviour stuff is that it generally comes down to a lack of sufficient self-control, and if that is the issue then simply removing the \"outlet\" wont help the person in question (and, ultimately, not anyone they encounter, in-game or elsewhere).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-01-25T06:28:59.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=MyBhTI4K,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-25T02:46:33.892+0000)\n>\n> In order to get a ban removed, the ban would need to be identified as a &quot;false positive&quot;, which basically means that either a punishment shouldn&#x27;t have been given, or (in some cases) a less severe punishment should have been given (rather than the punishment that *was* given).

I was in the process of doing the test that they had going. I created a new account, got it to level 30 without a ban or warning. I was super positive and helpful, too. When I made a new ticket, letting them know that I completed the task, I was rejected because 1) the Rioter that assigned me the task realised what a garbage company Riot is and left and 2) they were no longer doing it.\n\nLike a clichÃ© villain, that is when I realised it was all pointless and became more toxic than ever. If Riot literally gave me my main back, any of them, I would easily reform and I would put that on my mother. I have more of an attachment to those accounts than to being negative in-game.\n\nWill not ever happen, though.

I got ban once for 14 days and told anymore bans after this the account will be perma. All because I quoted someone saying \"KYS loser I mean really KYS\" then took a break for 4 hours and got the same player again and I was neg in that match.\n\nIf we break it down to what is really being said \" This account has almost every champion. You have more then enough to unlock everything. You get S's and so on so you don't buy skins / rune pages or anything. You unlock everything for free. So we see a point we can now try and ban this account so you will buy champions / skins \"\n\nSo when you are perma... Small percent will stop playing the game for good. BUT!! The greater percent will make a new account and buy things all over again.\nSo perma ban = money to Riot. No matter what others claim. ","replies":[]}]}
