There's a good chance this is why you're having problems. \n\nTo uninstall League properly, you need to do it through the Control Panel. [Here](https://youtu.be/ZKnDjFYfoJI?t=2m) is a Riot Support video to help you do that.\n\n__*\n\nThe Wrenchmen will be around later today to give you further help, but I recommend you try my solution first.","replies":[{"poster":"Pandaleet","date":"2016-12-03T01:35:07.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I have now been able to get to the launcher page, new update, this now comes up when I press launch: https://gyazo.com/cd5bba037749bc83a597c93562200e47 if there's anyway you can help with this and give me advice on how to that'd be great {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-03T04:01:49.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try this:\n\n1.
