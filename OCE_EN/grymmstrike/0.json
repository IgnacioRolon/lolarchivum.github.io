I can&#039;t carry a goddamn game as Soraka when my Ryze &quot;ADC&quot; is two levels behind half the game because he can&#039;t CS for shit and keeps getting blasted by their Lucian/Sona.  The only time he actually starts doing well is when the enemy team groups up and he is split pushing against nobody.\r\n\r\nEither let me chose ONE ROLE to play, or make it worth my time to even play the game if I don&#039;t get my primary role.  Next time I get stuck with support I am queue dodging.  If it keeps happening I am playing Overwatch instead.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-25T11:20:55.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the option of choosing two specific roles or one specific and fill.\n\nIf you don't get your first choice of role, play whatever role you choose next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-06-25T05:22:28.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"que for your primary and another position that isnt support/fill... if you cant do that you should probably go play overhyped","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-06-25T03:46:28.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to choose fill.
