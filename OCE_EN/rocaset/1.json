I don't see how my opinion is so difficult to understand, in my experience, as well as all my friends, there is a troll every match, which indicates that riot either requires too much to ban them, or simply won't ban them.

People shouldn't be punished for trying to play the game outside of the predefined 1::1:2 setup. It's not 'cancerous' to take creeps, they don't come with labels of ownership. If they leave you with a pushed lane and then leave change to a defensive playstyle and take safe gold you can get. If they complain that you have no damage/tankiness/gold then point out it was their strategy that instigated it. Players should never feel forced to play a certain way, yourself included.\n\nIf they intentionally feed or verbally abuse the team then ban them but playing differently or poorly should never be a reason to ban someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocaset","date":"2015-08-16T02:19:00.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying if you play jungle you own each minion in the jungle, but it's fairly implied as soon as you get into bot lane that the adc is entitled to the majority of the minions. that's not personal playstyle, it's practically a rule of League of Legends. Now the troll supports I'm talking about can take all the farm they want, as long as they don't deliberately push the lane to the tower when the adc is buying something. There's a difference between last hitting and pushing the lane. That just restricts the adc and ruins it late game.\n\nI feel as though players definitely should feel forced to consider the consequences of taking something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-08-14T12:09:14.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, right now there's bans for certain categories of players.\nIt used to be more of a generic response, but it turned out it made low-level games basically unplayable and most players abandoned.","replies":[]}]}
