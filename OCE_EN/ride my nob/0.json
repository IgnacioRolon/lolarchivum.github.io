I finished a game and all of a sudden it said someone has logged in on my account from somewhere else and I know for a fact i dont give or have ever given my password out ever. It has to have been hacked and I know that, some random from a game added me just to tell me how bad I was at the game and Ive never seen someone rage at something so little before and  he said he was a smurf and he wants to keep me on his list for no apparent reason at all. I truly believe it would have been him/her, there name was DuckHeWhoKites\r\nPlease solve this asap, I&#039;ve put alot of blood, sweat and tears to this account even abit of money. I don&#039;t want all of this to be for nothing....\r\nP.s I also went on this account to see if I was still online and there is no name Lil Titties and I assume everyone on that account has been delted.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Renzcer","date":"2016-09-28T15:20:01.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm also a victim of hacking, my account was suspended recently.\nChange your passwords on everything related to your LoL account. Those hackers are mostly likely using your account as a guinea pig to test out scripts, only a matter of time before your account gets banned/suspended. And Riot Support won't do anything about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bishop996","date":"2016-09-28T11:24:23.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have the same problem and my email has been changed i cant put in a request because it requires so much detail that most people wouldn't bother remembering","replies":[]}]}
