Is there a _simple_ app available for pressing multiple keys at once? All I could find was AutoHotkey which looked way to complicated, and seemed more geared toward creating hotkeys such as shutting down your computer. I am just looking for an app that can bind multiple keys to one key, such as binding the 1 and 2 key to F12, so that when I press F12, both the 1 and 2 key are pressed simultaneously. \r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-22T12:54:38.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Outside of branded software like iCUE (for Corsair products), Synapse (for Razer) and LGS (Logitech), AutoHotkey is really the only one that comes to mind.\n\nWhat you are suggesting does come dangerously close to cheating territory so do be aware of that.\n\nFor example, using software to press a combo faster than you are able to would be classed as an unfair advantage. I'm not sure what Riot's exact policy on such macros is, but for the sake of your account and fairness in general, I'd advise staying away.","replies":[]}]}
