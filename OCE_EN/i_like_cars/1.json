Forget the stomps and move on. Some general advice: ward more.\n\nAs the jungler, you should have the 2nd most amount of wards placed.\nNot saying warding would have won you the game, but it could have helped decision making and stopped a couple deaths.\n\nEven when you played support you only placed 14 wards in a 37 minute game. Granted your opponents don't ward much either, but thats a big problem.\n\nsolely looking at the farming of people in your games and wards placed, I'd guess Bronze 4.","replies":[{"poster":"i like cars","date":"2015-02-23T13:00:03.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will remember that.

Some games are STRAIGHT OUT unwinnable, no matter how well you do. You shouldn't be asking \"how do I win this unwinnable game\" since sometimes not even a Diamond player could win that game. The question you should be asking is \"how do I win more of the games that are close but I still happen to lose?\"\n\nYou accomplish that with better farming (being 50 behind Yi isn't good, especially when Yi spent so much time dead, although as I said that game was unwinnable), better warding, better objective taking and better positioning (map-wise and teamfight-wise).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-02-23T16:55:33.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i see 0 defense","replies":[]}]}
