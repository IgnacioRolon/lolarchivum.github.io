Then i have a neck and neck battle with even kills and deaths on both sides, almost everyone full build, nearing on 50 mins and win and only get 13 LP, wtf is with that system??\n\n1st problem, \"people would afk at the end so they wouldn't lose LP\"\n\nSolution, if you are afk when the game ends or for over 6 min you lose the usual amount of LP for that match, AND half of all of your teammates lost LP and your teammates then only lose half of the LP they usually would, (they still lost so they should lose some) \n\n2nd problem, \"people would bully others into AFKing so they didn't lose any LP\"\n\nSolution, the AFKer loses far too much LP for someone to just talk them into it, plus we have no tribunal, so any \"thresh AFK or we will all report you\" threats wouldnt work, as there is no punishment for reports, and apart from reports what else can a bully do? add you to friends and sent you nasty messages? no.\n\n3rd problem, \"my system failed and i was AFK for over 6 min but i came back!\" \n\nSolution, while i sympathise with this, if you are afk in ranked, leaver buster is so brutally harsh right now that losing extra LP is the LEAST of your worries, you should be worrying instead about your 3 week ban. \n\nso yea i see no problems in at least trialling a system similar to this.","replies":[{"poster":"I am Qwerty","date":"2015-03-10T19:03:33.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reguarding to the people bullying part, I think that the people should not provoke the person to afk, but at the same time, the person afk shouldn't take enough offense to actually go afk.
