Every time i Q up the teams i get are just straight up bad and it is seriously annoying, could basically win every game if these people weren&#039;t just complete retards. check my match history if you want. 99% of the losses and some of the wins are just filled with teammates who are just retards. I know i&#039;m not that good of a player and i still have heaps  of room to improve but these people are just downies.\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"a√Ædan","date":"2015-06-12T09:53:09.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I know the feeling. But honestly if you are as good as you are making out (and I've seen your match history and it's fairly good) then you should be able to carry your team. You should focus more on objectives over kills. If you manage to get a kill or two ahead of your opponent, roam and help your other laners. Support them if they're playing bad, don't rage at them. Encourage them to do better. It's not always your teams fault. Look at every game like its YOUR fault you lost, look at the mistakes YOU made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-06-12T08:38:15.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo with someone who you believe isn't retarded?
