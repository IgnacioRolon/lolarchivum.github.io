Her ability to 100-0 people whitout being fed and only having one item and this one shotting also including being stunned for the entire time and also the fact that she has 0 skillshots and a complete lack of anything resembling counterplay apart from camping her lane from lvl1 till lvl18. It baffles me why riot has refused to rework gher even though she is the perfect example of an unhealthy champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-23T09:10:24.798+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:79}} is the definition of an unhealthy champion\n\nfucken drinks too much alcohol, needs to go into rehab","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-23T13:12:08.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lack of counter play?\n\nAnnie, meet xerath.","replies":[{"poster":"i like cars","date":"2015-08-23T14:30:14.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, or you saying xerath has no counterplay?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-25T02:52:37.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell no!

In fact, it's boring when too many champions have skillshots.\n\nAn example of a reasonably healthy champion (that may need slight tweaks but overall doesn't need a rework) is Master Yi. Master Yi has 0 skillshots, but he still requires a good level of skill to play, especially against players that aren't bad. His Q dodge requires an excellent sense of timing, choosing the time to fight is also critical (his short range makes him easy to blow up) and he has a lot of hidden depth that lower Elo players fail to see.\n\nThe reason Annie needs a rework is simple - the instant stuns on her W and ult. Flash ult has barely any counterplay (besides prediction/staying clear of her flash+ult range).\n\nIf I were Riot, I'd make the bear's autoattacks stun people and remove her passive stun. Obviously it'd be OP if every AA stunned so it could have some small delay like Udyr E.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-23T04:43:58.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strat,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=4A9Jwz27,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-23T03:14:09.887+0000)\n>\n> If I were Riot, I'd make the bear's autoattacks stun people and remove her passive stun.

She is only strong due to high scaling and the ability to zone you with her stun up, which shut down a lot of lethal combo's to her immobile kit","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-24T03:55:56.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps, to be honest I was just throwing something out there without thinking too hard about it. They could maybe get away with a shorter stun (e.g. 0.5 seconds). Or maybe they could keep the current stun length and add delay to her ult by making her \"throw\" the bear, giving the enemy time to react. The W stun could still be instant since it's ~250 shorter range.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"just2jiG","date":"2015-08-23T10:16:29.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think all she needs are longer cooldowns, maybe lower base damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-08-23T09:03:50.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is literally an assassin that was supposed to be a mage they need to do an over haul like they did to ahri and change her from an assassin mage to a mage or a kite mage (which is what her stun was meant to be for)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-08-23T06:50:20.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been saying this for about 9 decades, Annie is the most broken champion in this game.
