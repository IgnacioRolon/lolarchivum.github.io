They even shared that they were getting a lot of questions about it when they introduced the new client about 3 months ago, and yet here we are; new client and no way to create or change item sets. \r\n\r\nRiot, it&#039;s great that you&#039;ve made a new client. I like it very much. it gives us some great information but you are not ready for the new client yet. You are missing features, and you should make sure EVERYTHING is ready before decommissioning legacy client.\r\n\r\nI know things take time, but I don&#039;t think a lot of us users care how long it takes, but please do not move to a new platform when you are not ready. I am surprised you did this against user feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-14T16:49:28.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the question has been answered and addressed, I'm going to close this thread.

The point is they have not finished working on the new client before removing the old one, hence we can no longer use features that are important to the user.\n\nIf you're going to make a reply, at least make one that does not make you look like a goose.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-12T08:55:04.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright smartass here's your answer by Riot Gehirn himself:\n\n_We know you want item sets. I want item sets. Thing is that you and I are the extreme outliers.\nItem sets was initially not prioritized as a feature because almost nobody used it. We've certainly changed that to at least being a feature we will ship in the new client eventually, but getting the client working for all players is still a higher priority as it affects more players. Unfortunately this does involve moving more players over to the new client so that we can continue to work out the kinks._","replies":[{"poster":"The Dark Lörd","date":"2017-04-12T09:10:12.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You've completely and utterly missed the whole point.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-12T09:15:44.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You asked about item sets?

You're so blind you can't even see what's going on here. I'll tell you the situation: I provided feedback on the new client for Riot's eyes. I didn't ask a question so therefore, I do not require an answer of any form, but Talon came in and started being a prick so I responded, then you came in, being a tough guy without even knowing what's going on. What's wrong with you? Who says you're the pinnacle of morals in society? Like Talon; you have no manners. You've completely missed the point this entire time. I've already provided my feedback to Riot Support. If you're all so-knowing like you're suggesting, you would know that they referred me to post it here. If you know how to read, and be all so-knowing, you would already know that I've complemented the new client and gave some feedback in my original post. Now, learn how to comprehend shit or find another game yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-12T12:40:27.989+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you were providing feedback to Riot specifically then you shouldn't have posted on here in the first place, the boards exist for the community to discuss with each other. Also I never suggested shit about being so-knowing or whatever you're going on about. I also don't appreciate you calling someone a \"peasant\" or \"nutcase\" it's rude, unnecessary and not the way you should be addressing someone. Now I suggest we end this pointless argument and stop wasting each others time.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dark Lörd","date":"2017-04-12T13:18:25.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really have no idea how the feedback system works for Riot do you? If you go to their customer support and follow the prompts to provide feedback, they will not let you send a ticket, they stop you and refer you to post it on the forums (this place). So, don't tell me how to post on a forum, because frankly, you haven't a clue. You have no manners to begin with. Trying to act all tough for a guy that calls someone a retard (Talon12), stepping in and calling me a \"smartass\", telling me to \"suck it up stop crying\" and \"deal with the new client or find another game\". All that is rude and unnecessary. Perhaps you should change the way you address people. Seriously, it's a joke. You're like it all over the forum. And I'm not going to have someone try to be a tough guy and defend his little brother being an arsehole in my thread, especially when he has no idea what his talking about even without all the stuck up remarks. Your replies might just cut being half decent if you just stop being so stuck up and pathetic about your \"opinion.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-12T06:12:52.831+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"read their post, they said they are making it, but its low on their list because they need to remove bugs and put in more important features.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2017-04-12T16:32:36.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When people think the old client is gone... haha its not im using the old one since the 11th","replies":[{"poster":"The Dark Lörd","date":"2017-04-12T21:53:51.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh really?
