Oceania region, if that makes any difference. :-)\nI often have games where at least one of the players is named something like \"**aask99ga5Diane**\", uses Ghost+Heal as their summoner spells, never uses chat, and is clearly botting rather than sitting at their computer actually playing the game. (_No regular player solo-dives towers anywhere near as much as these players do._)\n\nAnd so, rather than subjecting myself to 15-20mins of being told to \"go away\" / \"leave\" / \"quit\" by mid-lane (_which I've gladly done earlier this week_) when I'm sick of my non-human teammate feeding bottom lane and want to support a competent player, I've had to make a judgement call when I see them and decide whether or not to select a hero during the start of a match.\n\nToday has been my first instance where I've had a 5-minute wait before I can queue for another match.\nNot a disaster - I wasted like 3mins of others time (2 players x 90 seconds or whatever), so I can handle having to wait 5mins myself. Plus it means I won't be matched with those specific bots like 'Diane' and 'Kennedy' in my next game.\n\nI've tried reporting bots, but I still see them a couple days later so I'm not sure that it actually does anything.\n\nI do have a couple of queries though:\n1) Am I right to queue-dodge in this circumstance? Is it a dick move on my part to avoid being put with non-human players?\n2) Are there tiers to this penalty? Am I going to find I have to wait 10,20,30,_permaban_ minutes if I continue refusing to play with bots as teammates? What should I be expecting? (_I'd rather know in advance, so I can make an informed decision, y'know?_)\n3) What are your thoughts on the situation? It would be good to get some other perspectives here, rather than me just charging blindly forward (_and getting permabanned_ :-p ) because I didn't have the common sense to ask around first.\n\nThanks in advance. :-D\n\nEDIT: 4) Is there a way to be like \"I don't want to ever be matched with this specific player\", so that I can add the bots to that list, and make my games have 5/5 humans more consistently? :-) ","replies":[{"poster":"Kittenp0x","date":"2019-08-28T00:22:05.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The pep-talk is appreciated, but this was my most recent game: https://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/253490951/201050290?tab=stats\n\nIt took 26mins to get kill #1, because getting Teemo down was impossible. I got kill #2 about two->three seconds before the match ended.\nIn any case that match went about 33mins too long, and it was only because of the Master Yi player that we actually managed to win.\n\nAgain, thankyou for the positive words; but looking through my forum history it seems I was having this complaint (bot-infested games) about 5 years ago.

Thankyou for the info! ^-^ \nIf the most I'd ever have to worry about is a 15-minute delay, then it's no worse than ending up in a game where we're stuck struggling for 15-20mins; and if I had wanted that, I wouldn't have queued for Co-op Vs AI in the first place. :-)\n\nNormally I can handle there being one bot on my team (it sucks, but *eh..*), but when there's 2+ bots at a time then the match is hardly worth attempting. I just really didn't want to face horrible consequences from leaving an already bad situation, y'know?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-26T16:15:55.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">I play Co-Op Vs AI almost exclusively\n\nUnfortunately yes, you will pretty much always see them in those games. On the other hand, once you get some skill behind you, it's not too hard to carry bots through those games either, so you can still learn a lot basics-wise, especially if you are trying a new champion.\n\nIf co-op VS AI is where you want to be, then I'd recommend asking the real players in your games if they want to team up. Not many people play them regularly, but quite a few use them as cooldown type games. Queueing with real people obviously reduces the chance of you getting bots, so it will only help.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
