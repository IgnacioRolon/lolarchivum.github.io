It&#039;s alright for you to say someone is noob, IF you do advise him/her how to improve. I just can&#039;t understand whats the point of saying noob, it&#039;s not helping at all.\r\nAlso, for those people from non-English background country, you need to know in OCE server the official language is ENGLISH, so use ENGLISH in chat. \r\nIn this match, there were 3 people used Chinese to say others stupid for the WHOLE match, even I asked them to stop, they just won&#039;t, which was annoying.  I think it&#039;s alright for you to play in other country server, I come from China as well, it&#039;s fine. But please respect other country culture, and use English please.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-06-02T00:16:31.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately we have alot of what is called \"little man syndrome\" on OCE\n\nall you can do is mute and move on mate","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-01T13:11:29.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's ARAM though.\n\nIf they just spammed that for the whole game, report them for spamming, pretty simple.\n\nI really wouldn't mind the language barrier as long as they are using pings correctly (otherwise it would be refuse to communicate really), most of us have survived NA when there was no more than 2 types of pings after all.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-01T16:57:38.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know I still find it weird that people played on NA.\nMe and my friends played on EU.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-01T17:03:36.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WyuTL53n,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-06-01T16:57:38.798+0000)\n>\n> You know I still find it weird that people played on NA.\n> Me and my friends played on EU.\n\nOCE has always been defaulted to NA as their home server for MMOs, hence when LoL came out, most people just went to NA automatically.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-01T16:58:37.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All you can do is report them post match.\n\nThe majority of players don't look at the forums and even refuse to.
