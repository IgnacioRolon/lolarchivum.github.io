If you think about it, with riot releasing new champions every now and then, eventually the champion pool will become big enough that 3 bans each still leaves potentially a lot of valuable champions open. \r\n\r\nJust an interesting thought","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-11T07:20:33.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol *cancer* get the fuck out xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-11T07:14:34.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we need 5 bans, 1 for each person.\ncan't ban all that cancer with only 6 bans, and 3 of them i can't decide anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bravo Bird","date":"2015-05-11T05:09:42.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can pick 5 champions each team anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-11T05:43:23.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FromLanXiang,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=c7t4rjLm,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-11T05:09:42.805+0000)\n>\n> You can pick 5 champions each team anyway.\n\nBut more champs also means more pesky individuals or combos people might not want to deal with, hence I don't think adding an extra ban slot or 2 for both teams now is being unreasonable.\n\nNowadays there are just not enough bans.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-11T07:11:42.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much what Sekai said, fact is in professional games (LCS etc.) you'll find that they have a lot of trouble doing bans that in any way actually affect the other team.\n\nHowever the opposite is true, lets say you give 5 bans, now there is 10 champions banned away, that can really screw people not only on a professional level, but in lower ranked as well (it also means you require 20 champions)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-11T05:46:51.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The topic comes up every few champion releases.
