Riot's already had to limit Twisted Treeline and Flex queues so that times remain reasonable. Can you imagine how long queue times could get with yet another queue? What's more is, if the extra queue was to go in and Riot wanted to maintain normal queue times, then they would have to alter the matchmaking algorithms, which make games less balanced on a skill basis. They've stated multiple times lately that they're trying to reduce the time it takes between pressing play and actually getting into a game, and adding a new queue would not help this in any way, shape, or form.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-26T07:39:46.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This isn't the case of having an extra queue but rather replacing blind pick with draft.
