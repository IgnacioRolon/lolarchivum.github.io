I think the problem is, the teammates COULD be dragging you down, but not because they are BAD (sure some cases in may purely be that but it shouldn&#039;t be all that common for the league you go put into) but because of mindsets. Everyone knows bronze isn&#039;t a good place to be in, so they think to themselves &quot;i need to carry.&quot;\r\nIt may not be a hyper carry 30/0 with teammates going 0/16 or something but at least get the objective done and dusted. I myself am not a carry person as you&#039;ll see from my match history.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, the mindset you need to carry because others may not be &quot;good&quot; enough, is what could be dragging us down. Because of this, there&#039;s no proper team composition, and your mind is already tilted. As a friend in silver (almost got to gold) told me, he does best when hes having fun. I think this is because you are keeping an open mind and can plan ahead instead of just going in the moment, and actually learning from mistakes instead of just pointing it out (something i need to learn.) \r\n\r\nI imagine better players can keep this open-mindedness but still keeping a level of concentration without getting tilted. I think until we learn to trust others to a degree, were not going to get much done. But what if the reason we don&#039;t trust is because we did, and then somebody broke it? Maybe you played support trying to help the adc (obviously) and that adc failed to a degree. I guess that&#039;s the part where you just keep going.\r\n\r\nSo learning to play with an unlocked camera, or getting better reflexes and map awareness or strategies will help yes, but doing a 1v5 neglecting your teammates and communication will cancel out that carry. Ive gone into a couple of solo ranked games and i&#039;d ask something like &quot;Is it okay if i go Braum?&quot;\r\nNothing. Nobody said anything, even the adc.\r\nAnd in matches, if you see someone make a mistake, call it out. But don&#039;t FLAME them for it, constructive feedback along with some &quot;gj&quot;s and &quot;nice one&quot;s will help that player a lot and in turn you ad your team. As we know getting bashed for a mistake only makes things worse. Try not to make yourself seem superior to anyone while your in bronze too, otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be in it. You might have an excellent 1v1 potential, but what about team fighting, objectives, and communication. Just small things to work on to add it all up. I try to treat my teammates as friends in games, and sometimes it works, others, they just ignore it.\r\n\r\nthis one game, we had a thresh adc (it was normal&#039;s, but i still don&#039;t know why he did it, he did well though surprisingly) and a jax jungle. The jax hadn&#039;t gotten one kill ( maybe one or 2, i cant remember) but had died 8 times to the enemy JG. BUT, he had slayed the dragon like 6 times by himself, and this wasn&#039;t while a team fight was going on yet, or he knew we would lose. Anyway, the thresh keep going on at him about how hes basically doing bad, stop feeding, the usual, but sort of in a calm manner, but not so much as if he was trying to help. In turn, the jax would just in caps go &quot;F*** UP!&quot; He wasn&#039;t really flaming anyone at anytime (he got angry at me once for a mistake we both made, mainly me and i was fine) so i knew he wasn&#039;t trying to troll. So, every time he did something good, id give the occasional gj. \r\n\r\ni told the thresh he may be making mistakes, but live and learn. At the end we won, Im going to say no thanks to me though, my team for how odd they were being, were actually pretty good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould anyone preferably in Gold or above enlighten me on this? I am of course in Bronze 4 myself ( i cant even get the LP to get to bronze 5 XD) so this whole thing could just be obsolete, but id like to slowly make my way up to bronze 2, then set a new goal. I haven&#039;t done much ranked, so this is mainly theory. Now, this isn&#039;t me going &quot;I&#039;m in bronze, but i secretly know i should be in silver this or gold that&quot; (I&#039;m sure we&#039;ve all wish that&#039;s what was happening though) i genuinely know that i belong in bronze for multiple reasons and would like to improve and understand, (i might know my mistake, but i might not know how to act on it) and possibly get any ridicule for this help anyone else that read it.\r\n\r\nCheers :3","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-30T01:59:18.382+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"True. The real thing that keeps bronze people bronze is the inability (or willingness) to learn.\n\nLearning HOW to win and what win conditions are. Each game and each team comp has a different win condition but most people don't think about that.\n\nThere are 3 things you should know before hitting ranked imo:\n\n1. The best runes/masteries for your champions\n2. Your champions powerspikes/win conditions. Are you a teamfighter? Splitpusher? Poke comp? Pick comp? etc etc\n3. EVERY champions abilities and how they work\n\nThe amount of times i've played with people who have said \"oh right, i don't know how Braum passive works\" or \"why can't I dash when Cassiopeia is poisoning me\" etc. Its ridiculous.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nLooking over your account: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=MCNT052\n\nYour masteries are ok. There are a few i'd change personally, but they aren't \"wrong\".\n\nYour runes are god awful. They are tier 2 and not even the correct runes you'd want.\n\nFor Braum and other tanky supports I would run Armour Marks, HP seals, MR glyphs and Armour Quints.\nFor Soraka you can run the same page but swap the Armour Quints for AP. I don't play her so i don't know the best set up, but that would be an ok page.\n\nAs a LoL Players you should have 3-4 rune pages as a minimum:\n\nAD Page: AD Marks, Armour Seals, MR Glyphs, AD Quints\nAP Page: Magic Pen Marks, Armour Seals, MR Glyphs, AP Quints\nAS Page: AD Marks, Armour Seals, MR Glyphs, AS Quints\nTank Page: Armour Marks, HP Seals, MR Glyphs, Armour Quints\n\nYour builds are ok... You never swap your trinket. You never buy boots.

Should i ave gone someone else such as alistar? trynd wasnt going tank so we didnt have anyone to soak up damage, so malph was free to ult when he pleased.

If you don't have tier 3 runes you are automatically putting yourself at a disadvantage.\n\nYou can't have more than 3 sight wards on the map at any 1 time, so having a regular trinket with a sightstone is pretty pointless. its better to have a sweeper to kill enemy wards and deny vision.\n\nMy advice. stop playing ranked until you have tier 3 runes and learn a bit more. Otherwise you will just ruin your MMR and make it really hard to climb ranks.\n\nIf you want to get better at support, you should watch support players.\n\nPainlessDeath, Masters NA player.

If u want i can mentor you :3","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-30T23:20:39.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also on runes you probably want to start with buying these, since these are generally the most optimised and used runes:\n\nMarks-  9 Magic Pen, 9 Flat AD\nSeals - 9 Flat Armour, 9 Scaling Hp (not the % kind)\nGlyphs - 9 Flat MR, 6 Scaling Cdr\nQuints - 3 Flat Atkspeed, 3 Flat Armour, 3 Flat AP\n\nThese should help you build 3-4 basic pages that should work on the majority of champions and most rune setups for champions consist of these runes. Most other runes aren't worth the ip, but some others I feel I should mention are:\n\nMarks- 9 Armour Pen (for ad assassins like zed), 9 Flat Atkspeed (for pure atkspeed champions)\nGlyphs - 9 Flat AP (for very offensive ap mids when going against ad mids since mr won't be too useful), 9 Scaling AP (for ap damage supports like karma/annie/zyra/morg/ect...)\nQuints - 3 Movespeed (for things that need to roam or have no reliable gapclose, though I'd generally not get these until you hit high elo), 3 Flat AD (for ad assassins like zed).\n\nAnyways the first set is pretty standard rune fair, and the second bunch are optional extras that you might buy if you really want to optimise runes. The first set is basically necessary for reaching silver-gold, the second set is more important once you try going higher. ALL OF THESE MUST BE TIER 3.\n\nHope this helps with runes. Also on the champions thing, generally unless a champion is getting reworked, a few nerfs here and there is not really going to matter all that much if you plan on mastering and main-ing that champion. So try out some various champions and see who's playstyle and kit you enjoy, though I suggest you stick with meta picks and not try to master urgot for instance (no offence to urgot mains, he's just not in a great spot atm).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-10-30T02:14:43.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm working on basic bronze guides atm.\n\nThe first guy pretty much summed everything up.\n\nOther summoners have been in your position, learn from there mistakes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n--\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8P4ufbUbgA&t=85s\n\nThese league based creators are good teachers.\n\nGbay99\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIxFJ5UicWOUdoUYyJTD1Q\n\nFoxdrop\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9U_UPJLasfZYZ0icNI0vBg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-30T04:25:05.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another thing. The mindset that you \"need to carry\" in bronze may not apply if you are being wrecked in lane and are 0-3, for example. The main thing is to do the best that you can to help your team win the game. Which in some situations means don't feed anymore. Build defensively maybe. Ward more. Dont overextend. Maybe you need to group. Maybe you need to play safer. Call your jungler if you think you can win a 2 v 1, but don't get upset if they don't come. Plenty of players in bronze give up and try to surrender or just hard core feed when they are losing lane, sometimes even when the rest of the team is absolutely pub stomping.\n\n[You might like to read this for some more ideas](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ATq68GiY-im-pretty-sure-ive-lost-my-edge-in-this-game?comment=000000000000) (note: written for an adc guy).","replies":[]}]}
