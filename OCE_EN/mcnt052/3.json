I was wondering, what if you edited blind pick so you don&#039;t have to role call? \r\n\r\nSo, it&#039;s basically draft, but you don&#039;t see who the enemy is picking, no bans and everyone has a higher likelihood of getting the role they want.\r\nOr is this also a bad idea in general? I realise it then is different from every other blind pick mode, therefore kind of making it a new game mode anyway, introducing the same problems as if it were normal draft\r\n- People don&#039;t like it so stop playing as much\r\n- Longer queue times anyway to appropriately match people to their preferred roles\r\n- Anything else I can&#039;t think of.\r\n\r\nSince the boards may very well be the vocal minority in OCE, could a poll be created perhaps for this change in OCE?\r\n\r\nOr is OCE just not significant enough to make any changes like this? (Or is, but the risk of losing the OCE playerbase just for this change isn&#039;t worth taking?)\r\n\r\nYours sincerely\r\nDepressed Old Urgot Main {{champion:6}}","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Kurama","date":"2017-12-28T18:12:51.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be a good idea and thats why it won't happen, i mean.... they all sat around and agreed that \"Blind pick\" where ppl fight and argue over roles was the best choice rather than a more logical and cancer free choice of what you just said, even if they don't implement what you said in \"Blind pick\" make draft a 24hr thing instead of this stupid 10-3am or worse forcing us to do \"Cancer (blind) Pick\".... it's unheard of and completely stupid.","replies":[]}]}
