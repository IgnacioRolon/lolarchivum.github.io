But if everyone pings MIA and you ward, this can potentially be a top lane with more necessity to win it (or at least not lose it.)\r\n\r\n4 ADC: Most the time you will either have a squishy person or a melee champ on the enemy side that you ca poke down and eventually with the help of your support, kill. But a lot of people don&#039;t like/play support so you may have a mediocre support you&#039;ll have to carry while you try snowball.\r\n\r\n5 Jungler: Just running around killing monsters is specific places can be a walk in the...jungle. get to a point where you&#039;re comfortable with what you have, and help out some lanes.\r\n\r\nHardest roles to master from top to bottom:\r\n1 Jungler: I wasn&#039;t sure whether to put adc here or not but anyway. Timing spawns, dealing with enemy junglers, warding what to buy and when and things you NEED to practice before you can say you main jungler. Knowing what lane to gank (aside from the guy that spams assist me when its almost impossible) can help turn the tide. But ganking one lane means you&#039;re not ganking another. If you&#039;re ganking top per-say, because their top-laner pushed, cool, you basically got him with his pants down. But that means your leaving the enemy mid laner vulnerable and the other mid laner to potentially roam you or bot (with possible help from the jg.) \r\n\r\n2 ADC: Because a lot of people don&#039;t main support they don&#039;t know what to do and not to do. They may know, but they may not execute it.\r\ndealing with a bad support while the enemy is fine, can lose your lane. They last hit minions without relic shield, they don&#039;t buy any items to help you or help him that in order helps you. And waiting for them to either initiate for once or stop initiating every time they can, will dent your snowball into a square. Sure a gank can pick up some kills but both the jg and adc can be quite squishy, if the support is unaware of the gank or even going to use any form of cc the gank could turn into a feed.\r\n\r\n3 Support: The role that (apparently, i haven&#039;t really seen this too much but then again I&#039;m in OCE :) that tanks the blames the flames and the hits. If it weren&#039;t for the importance that the ADC gets fed support would 1 not be support and 2 just be another &quot;guy&quot; on the map to fight. This is the babysitter, the person that has to know when to initiate, when/where to ward, when to buy ward items, when to stop following the adc if they are kind of...&quot;crap&quot; (or dead) and must follow them otherwise like a puppy. They need to know whether to push freeze or let the enemy push using poke and scare tactics. (running into a bush and standing there makes them run back with caution sometimes) And this role may be one 2nd most crucial person to team fights (with 1st being the adc) and they HAVE to be able to focus the right people or cc or allies for shielding. \r\n\r\n4 Mid: Knowing if its safe to push is crucial, so its normally a good idea to sit back...but if the mid turret doesn&#039;t go down you don&#039;t get more control...but if you let yours go down they get the control...\r\nKnowing when/if to push is a big thing in mid lane. Sitting back letting them come to you sets up ganks, but pushing also sets up ganks, from you to top or bot. If I&#039;m Anivia i could literally smack a wall into the enemy adc&#039;s face while the support, adc and possibly jungler take that opportunity to shoot them dead. But that is exposing my tower. This would be much more safe if their first tower was dead, then that would put pressure on their lane and they would quite possibly stay to protect or push it them self.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, 5 Top: Same point as last time, not as much of an important pushing lane. You could very well turn it into one before its &quot;necessary&quot; and gain more control. But at the same time, you could roam mid lane, then together you two could roam bot lane. Starting a team fight early, then going back to lane or staying as a group to pick people off. You could certainly push whatever lane you ganked (bot for example after the mid roam from top) But none of that will matter too much if you didn&#039;t pick your champion revolving around the team. Top is like a second support that is also an adc/apc.\r\n\r\nWell, that&#039;s my first post i&#039;ve done and this is of course all my opinion backed up with what little experience ive had. Agree? disagree? troll? Your choice.\r\n\r\nAnd by no means any roles below Jungler for mastering is no means easy to do, its just eas_ier_. from what ive heard and seen.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-30T10:52:26.583+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no agreement for any of this.\n\nThere are easy to master champions, and hard to master champions, but roles are nothing like that, you can go into any role with basic knowledge of how league works if you know the champion you are on (and they have some ability to play in that role)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MCNT052","date":"2016-10-30T00:36:26.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually, now that i think about it, i was probably basing this off how regularly i was seeing easy/hard to play champs with the roles they were in.

If you play a champ well  and its shows % wise you should do well no matter what, you should be used to counter picks,your lane you play in, how to farm your champs damage output and how to farm with them. \n\nBut i ask What are we talking about? Competitive or soloqueue? Competitive its top / jg for sure. So much diversity for top(1v1 ,1v1 against adc, 1v2 laneswap, 2v2 with support). And the amount of decision making a jg has to make is crazy.   Soloqueue I think it depends on the meta at the time.\n\nI only ask as Competitive or soloqueue are worlds apart","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-30T02:39:09.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and you have to consider that carrying can be harder in certain roles in soloq, especially depending on what you pick and main. Carrying in bronze as a tank support is possibly the hardest thing to do in this game if your adc is a 0-6 potato with 14cs at 20min, however you can't just take the cs they're missing (outside of relic shield procs and even then some low elo adcs don't understand what the relic shield does and will still report you and go afk and this triggers me so much because I now have to work with an even smaller gold budget and still have to buy support items like sightstone and locket of iron solari and pink wards) and build bruiser because they'll go afk or report you for building damage on a tank.\n\nAlso don't tell me that age old story of if you had faker mechanics you'd climb out because sure you might, but it's going to take forever because most of the time your great engage or peel will be met with no damage backup from your team, even if you ping what you're going to do and probably eventually you'll just be consumed by the low elo decision making.\n\nI pity every single bronze tank support main because good or not, it's going to take them a while to get out and it's probably the most challenging role in this entire game.\n\nThat said, once you get to high bronze/low silver or higher, then these issues disappear because at this benchmark people follow pings and teamwork is more than just a noun.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-30T03:43:39.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly its a matter of your midset, i myself play every role but do very well in the jg/mid/support roles, adc being my worst.\n\nWhen i play sup, no matter what champ i play i play how the adc plays( tend to ask them what they want in champ select as well and pick to what my team needs) to create the synergy needed if they are playing def and a little scared then sit back and just watch for the engage, take a look at the builds/timers/enemy positions and take it all into account while you sit back, this way you can make sure you know whats going on, with out babysitting your adc. If the enemy lane is being aggressive just make sure you & your adc dont die and communicate, say sit back play def and ward and help your adc farm as best as possible, your better off missing a bit of farm then to die. If you want to have lane pressure make sure your playing a support that can follow this up,( bard,zyra,karma,leona ect something with a stun,snare,slow or AOE poke)  keep up the wards and map awareness and if they arnt making the calls make it for them, but again communicate. if they dont listen then just play to them , might not be your thing but your less likely to make the mistakes of going in with no follow up.\n\n\"\"Also don't tell me that age old story of if you had faker mechanics you'd climb out because sure you might, but it's going to take forever\"\"\nThis is not ture if you had half that kind of skill you would work your way out and skip div's no problems, but i do understand in low elo's no matter how good you are playing sometimes you just cant do much more than u have. So its a 50/50 at best.\n\nyour also playing a sup, your role is to help your adc farm,lane control, river control, ward sweep, and peel/engage. your not there to kill, lets say you play malphite, you build tank engage ( only after 6 unless getting a gank)/disengage with your Q slow on enemy ADC, apart from this your main goal is to ULT there back line or there mid/adc or peel for your adc and keep wards up, and to build to enemy teams make up, do you need MR armour hp ect.  I myself play,  playmaker sup's like bard,thresh,zyra that have the ability to create something if an opportunity presents itself so its a completely different play style.   If you want to make a greater inpact, id suggest learning jg or mid. ( another story all together haha )\n\nNow I know its hard to get out of bronze when you are tanked and people are on tilt being toxic and so on but all you can do it keep moving forward there is no magic button to win, so my only advise is play your best and always self criticize and dont beat yourself up about a loss other toxic players or mistakes , acknowledge them and keep your chin up.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-30T05:10:35.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha yeah I know alot of those things and I do think I should be bronze. Also I just feel that tank support mains get the rough end of the stick. I'm a low elo ap utility support main for the most part so I don't really have too many issues and if my adc is flaming me I can at least just buy more damage instead of tank and just do my own thing, like a midlaner but with warding. \n\nI just feel that tank support must be the hardest role in low elo. Also I will mention that being in bronze as a tank support encourages you to play very very defensively which is not really always the best option and can lose teamfights. My higher elo friends have pointed out that I'm too slow to react to good engages or I'm not going in when I should be and I feel that the experience gained from what is an engage at bronze level can sometimes be very detrimental and make it harder to climb and adapt once you pass the high bronze threshold.\n\nI wasn't speaking at all about myself, I main zilean, I'm part of the cancer that is high base damage mage supports. I'm just saying that people who play tank supports in low elo have it rough.","replies":[{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-09-30T05:39:39.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh yer most of my comments are well i think/should be common knowledge just put in more simple explained terms.\nBut a tank support will not have a place till mid game as they need items for there hard engage ( after 6 ) and if they fail early as in fall behind lvs or die alot , there isnt alot they can do untill they get that good engage to catch up or you all team up and just push as best as you can, while not forgetting other lanes.\n\nI did take a look and saw that you played zilian..... he is a bad support compaird to every other champ that would even be conciderd in the role, as ive mentioned in a previous thread he has nothing to offer his adc bar a speed boost and after 6 a revive ( maybe a stun if you can land a double bomb)  apart from that....yer no heal no slows no real gap closer no snare ect , mage supports are fine, look at morg,karma,annie,zyra, they can at least offer a better all round kit than he can, dont get me wrong his revive is awesome but yer.\nI would suggest trying out karma or zyra or morg , you can even carry with them with little ap, its all about the utility they offer.  ATM im playing karma alot and she is op!  heal ( once you get atheans {{item:3174}}  )  snare , slow on Q full team speed buff and her dmg is stupid with very little ap and her cds are low,just a great all rounder, add me IG :shdwzone  ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
